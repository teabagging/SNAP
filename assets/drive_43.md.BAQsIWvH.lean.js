I thought this movie was a great depiction of what it's like growing up, especially for guys. Not to mention, the tremendous comedy they bring in by pushing the limits of traditional movies by making your imagination fill in the blanks to keep it appropriate.

In this movie it could not have been handled in a more funny way! The situations these guys get in to are not unlike situations average teens find themselves.

I laughed so hard at every scene. I brought it on DVD and video and I still liked it. But now that I have seen it a million times it has gotten stupid. Becareful when you buy it on video because it's a hard decision on which American Pie version you want to get. The unrated version is okay but I like the original better because it's the way it meant to be. If you hadn't seen this movie yet you would probably like it for your first time but if you watch it a million times you might think it's a stupid movie.

They then start to plan how to do it, starting off with many dirty nauseatingly raunchy sex jokes (masturbation, sexual orientation) that aren't even funny and it goes downhill from there.\\"American Pie\\" is stupid, raunchy, and crude, to say the least.

Maybe the writers should check their statistics. And as for \\"American Pie\\" representing the youth of the late 90s. I don't think so. This was a lame attempt by a bunch of clueless 40+.

But there were parts of this film that were just too funny to ignore or not laugh at. I particularly enjoyed all the parts with Eugene Levy (Jason Biggs's dad in the movie), who is always hilarious. I don't think there is a lot I can say about this film because everyone has already seen it. I can say though that I would not watch this with... my parents (even though I am an adult). The humour, while funny, can be embarrassing. But you will nevertheless laugh unless you are a serious prude and easily offended. Which obviously I am not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just so over-rated","review":"This may be one of the most over-rated movies of the last 20 years.

NOT!","review":"I'm 18 years old and I'm sorry for sounding like my parents, but this movie is just stupid. It's also pointless and sick. I mean two high school guys want to loose their virginity before prom night? Give me a freakin' break! Who wants to see that? Not me.I think teen movies these days are about nothing but sex. And Movies like this just messes up the minds of teens. Their lives are screwed by either catching STD's or becoming a parent at an early age after becoming obsessed with sex. It's sad, but true. Don't even bother with this movie or the sequel.Peace out y'all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash","review":"Only someone under the age of reason would enjoy something like else.

Add two stars if you are 15 years old, but then you shouldn't be watching it. So, I don't know for whom this movie was intended. It's an R-rated teen flick with a few sophomoric toilet gags. On the plus side, the movie did not try to preach moral values or the evils of sex; the situations were more true to life and the acting was pretty good. On the bad side, it lacked creativity and original humor except for a few chuckles here and there. It would have been funnier if they edited it down to half an hour."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elliott Smith = Cool","review":"i first saw elliott smith on last year's oscars, but i had no money to buy a cd with, so i just filed it away in my head, elliott smith = cool. a few monthes later, i caught him on SNL, and it became elliott smith = very cool. so i went out and bought XO. within 2 weeks i also had either/or and the good will hunting soundtrack.it's not my fault. it's elliott smith's fault for making music that once you've heard it, nothing else compares. it's his fault for just being one of those musicians who is so distinctly human."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elliot Smith is the next Bob Dylan!!!!!!!","review":"\\"XO\\" is a beautiful CD of guitar-driven melodies that takes the listener to a heightened sense of awe and wonder. \\"Baby Britain\\", \\"Sweet Adeline\\", \\"Tomorrow Tomorrow\\" and \\"A Question Mark\\" are all musical delights and Smith's voice croons with controlled rage and dripping honey. \\"Waltz #2 (XO)\\" is the song of the year an inspiring delight of acoustic guitar, piano and other instruments. Elliot Smith used to be an underground secret, with \\"Miss Misery\\" and \\"XO\\" he has made a true name for himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the better albums of 1998","review":"This is the first album I've ever heard from Elliot Smith. I only got to know about him when he performed at the Grammys with the song Miss Misery. After that, I was hooked. The songs are all very close to heart and the lyrics are abolutely wonderful. Mixed with Elliot's music style, they make a perfect blend that is very hard to beat. If you buy this album, you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Arguably the best Elliott Smith Album","review":"This has always been my favorite album by Elliott Smith. The more I listen to Either/Or the more I find it hard to decide between the two, but I still think that in the \\"desert island\\" situation I'd go with XO. I thought about reviewing each song but I just don't think it's necessary, everyone should own this album. I have bought it as gifts for several of my family members that don't know who Elliott Smith was. Give the gift of music, give XO! Somehow he makes the f word sound pretty. That's gotta count for something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet Elliot... how I miss you....","review":"I first heard Elliot's music from the movie Good Will Hunting in 1996 or 1997 I want to say, and I went out the next day and bought every album he made. This one, by far, is my favorite next to Either/Or. Elliot had a way of perceiving the world in a different perspective. How prophetic his melanchology infinite sadness came... [He took his own life October 2003] The harmonies are haunting but ring true, there is a little slice of Beatles in the mix of that 2nd hand guitar that just plays near to my heart. Buy it... how you will not be disapointed, only when the last song fades out..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Too Good","review":"I will keep it short and simple: This is as good as it gets.It is Valentine's Day (night). I am alone - and playing this masterpiece of loneliness, misery and redemption. Waltz # 1 alone would keep anyone from doing something desperate. I went to my local record store to find some of Mr. Smith's work and was astonished to find none. I feel sorry for anyone who will never hear, feel, or experience this. It is almost too good. To separate it from the rest - give it 6 out of 5; especially Waltz # 1 (but I repeat myself)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent,these tunes get better with each listen","review":"Oh well,okay is so way off,this album is top notch the songs flow so naturally whilst retaining their own beautiful originality.\\"Independence Day\\" is a midway highlight whilst the wonderful\\"bottle up and explode\\" and \\"amity\\" use the requisite amount of power and melody. the closing \\" I didnt understand \\" is breathtaking and straight off those unreleased harmonies from Pet Sounds.All in all top stuff,and Baby Britain is alcoholic and very bitter,in England we should make Elliot headline every festival!My tent would never go away then! Oh Yes indeedee."},{"rating":"2","title":"Songs of longing","review":"Great music from a incredibly talented guy who does way too many drugs. His lyrics are poetry; his music is powerfully simple. On XO, Smith's music is still guitar based, yet masterfully produced to a more studio sound. Buy it. Don't listen too it to much when you're drunk, though; you'll cry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prepare to become Obsessed with this Album!!!","review":"I wandered around my local record store one day waiting for something to jump up and grab me, when I heard Waltz #2 playing. I headed straight for the \\"S\\" aisle, picked up XO, and have never turned back. Elliott Smith is amazing. I force him on all of my friends, and they have all thanked me for it. This is one of those albums that digs right into you, and refuses to let you free of it. Nearly every song is a gem, and Smith's guitar playing is entrancing. If you like nuance, you'll love Elliott Smith! Also, if you can see him live, do not miss the opportunity. He's the sort of artist I hope never becomes a huge star (so we can enjoy small performances), but continues to write, record, and perform for years. XO is a genius album."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best album I've heard in a long time.","review":"I guess everyone has his or her favorite Elliott Smith album, and this is mine.

The saxaphone in \\"A Question Mark\\" is simply annoying and I've never been to hot on \\"Independence Day.\\" However, interestingly, I rather like \\"Amity,\\"....P>This is not the best Elliott Smith, I would leave that for \\"Either/Or\\" or \\"Elliott Smith\\" itself, but you can never go wrong with an album by our dear friend E.S."},{"rating":"2","title":"xo","review":"Elliott Smith was a traditional songwriter up to this wonderful album XO, whereeverything becomes richer, arrangements, vocals, songwriting and sublime. It's 'pop of course, the best kind.The very label change that does go to Dreamworks Records means something, more ways to express themselves.There are only a few acoustic songs, the rest seems to be part of a sarabande ..

War, longing, friendship, healing and sexuality are touched upon with grace and humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"gorgeous","review":"Carr's book isn't one of those page-turning adventure stories which get you staying up all night. It's a gorgeously written meditation on the ideas of love and identity enfolded by time and memory, a small treasure which gets you staying up all night.As the years of dirt and grime get removed from the artwork he has been commissioned to restore, Tom Birkin, the young WWI vet commissioned to restore the original painting, comes also to see his own reality, his own light and life shine again, as well as the hearts and pasts of the local community members. At the same time another veteran is employed to look for an old grave beyond the churchyard walls.

For a new Cub fan, Betti-Cola is perhaps the best place to start - a smattering of 24 energized pop songs, sung by the forever-cute Lisa Marr. It's nearly impossible not to love such sunny gems as \\"My Chinchilla\\", \\"Little Star\\" and the perky cover of the Beach Boys' classic \\"Surfer Girl.\\" If you love it as much as you should, be sure to check out their other albums - Box of Hair, Come Out Come Out and Mauler. You won't be disappointed.But be forewarned: bad moods must be checked at the door. It's hard to have this much fun with a frown on your face."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent first effort, but not their best album","review":"This collection of Cub songs, while great, doesn't quite stand up to their later releases. The production isn't very good, with the vocals buried in the mix and everything lacking high-end definition. The songs tend to be on the short side, which reminds of early They Might Be Giants. Still, the songs are well written and the simple guitar-drums-bass setup works well for them. The guitar is more often done without any effects at all, and the singing is a bit off-key at times, but this doesn't detract from the songs.If you're a Cub fan, you should get this album, but if you haven't heard them before, you should get their later releases."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best cd ever!!!!!!!","review":"I have been looking for this cd forever and i can't seem to find anyone who has and actually wants to sell it.. but anywho.. i have heard this cd once and i have wanted ever since! i think the beat and the way they all harmonize is splendid! well, if anyone knows where i can pick this up send me a email at: XGeMiNiStAr10X@aol.com please!!! i don't care what shape it is in as long as it plays...thank you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Seekers of truth and meaning often turn to liberal religion","review":"Unitarian Universalism offers seekers a map to find truth and meaning in their lives. This book helps identify the markers one looks for on this journey.

He is very ill-suited for the role. So too is Ophelia: supposed to be a frail girl, she is instead graying in hair and a bit too strong-willed for the role. Overall, a very bad portrayal of Hamlet. Kenneth Branagh's or Laurence Olivier's versions are considerably better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mel Gibson was not right for the role.","review":"Mel Gibson is not a good enough actor to play the extremely complicated Hamlet. He tries his best, but his performance looks over-the-top and forced. This movie also suffers from cutting the play almost in half and not developing the character right. I couldn't understand Ophelia's problem because she was so badly developed. Plus the castle the movie is set in is VERY ugly.The movie is difficult to watch because the castle is so ugly. Although it has many faults, the ghost scene is good and done in the correct way."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Bard would be turning in his grave!","review":"Mel Gibson's unworthy portrayal of the Prince of Denmark can only be worsened by noting the fact that he broke the iambic pentameter of \\"Yea, from the table of my memory, I'll wipe away all trivial fond records....\\" Something is indeed rotten in Denmark! The rest is silence."},{"rating":"1","title":"No, this movie is too boring","review":"I started watching it and then heard words I never heard before in Old English, I had no idea what they were saying got bored and turned it off.

Although a little older than what I picture Hamlet to be from Shakespeare's play, Mel Gibson plays Hamlet with enough passion, ferocity, and intelligence that you do question whether Hamlet is really mad or just plain brilliant. A cast of British actors including Helena Bonham Carter round out this ambitious production."},{"rating":"2","title":"I saw it at least 30 times!","review":"This movie is the greatest Hamlet version on screen, even thou it is really a short-cut from it's original Shakespare version. Zeffirelli is just a genious beyond... Ophelia's character is presented unlike any other Hamlet screen version- It's amazing. I'm shure I can view it 30 more times!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!!","review":"If I had a zero star choice, that's what I'd choose. This does not mean I don't love Shakespeare, I saw a way-off-broadway student production and they were absolutely great. \\"Suit the action to the word, the word to the action\\" is Hamlet's own words to the player, and he should have been there to coach Mel Gibson and Co. Every show of aggression in the film came as a shock- not a surprise. Very unsettling when you feel whatever emotion there is should not amount to this. The whole effect was very artificial, and that includes the acting, the filming, and the cast. The only saving feature was the set and costume, and they don't do nearly enough saving."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mel did a very good job as the wishy washy prince","review":"Poor Hamlet, couldn't make up his mind to save his life. I really ejoyed this version, Mel and the rest of the experienced cast did a great job. You just have to forget Mel was Mad Max and accept him as the Mad Prince of Denmark and you'll enjoy this as much as I did. Also, if a teenager has to do a book report on Hamlet this is a good version for that age group. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I enjoyed watching the movie,I can't wait to see it again.","review":"The differences b/t the movie and the play was that, the movie was easier to understand, even though it left alot out. I would even consider watching it again. The only thing I still don't understand it why they used that type stuff for posion, and why Ophelia died without telling Hamlet her true feelings toward him so he would stay there with her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gibson's a great Dane !","review":"This is a Hamlet that's easy on the eyes and the mind...if you don't have the time and stamina for Branagh's 4 hour version, and can't get hold of Olivier's exquisite 1948 film, this is the one for you ! Mel Gibson is excellent as Hamlet. He gives him humor and a masculine vigor, and the top-notch supporting cast is superb. I especially like Alan Bates..his lusty, murderous king is fabulous...and mention should be made of Nathaniel Parker's wonderful Laertes. David Watkin's cinematography is stunning, Ennio Morricone's score subtle and beautiful, and the production one of Zeffirelli's best. This is very enjoyable Shakespeare, even for those who normally don't like him, and I highly recommend this to parents who would like to introduce their teenagers to the Bard. Don't miss this glorious movie !"},{"rating":"2","title":".","review":"It's odd. As I read through some of the negative reviews of this version of Hamlet, I can almost agree with some of the points that are made. But it doesn't change the fact that this is far superior to Branagh's version. I know how much it bothers Branagh fans and many Shakespeare purists to hear that, but that just makes it that much more fun to say. The basic reason for this is that Zefferelli, although he is a bit too carefree with his cuts and shuffling, has far better aesthetic sensibilities than Branagh. The emotions of the characters in this version are far more compelling, engaging, and distinct than the lukewarm indifference that comprised the tonality of Branagh's adaptation. And though I'm no Mel Gibson fanatic, he does an *exceptional* job in his role, and keeps the film compelling through all of its hacks and alterations. Though far from a perfect adaptation, this is an engaging and rewarding movie. I've always thought it was far better than most people seem to give it credit for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mel Miscast as Hamlet; Mediocre Production","review":"Mel Gibson has built a successful film career as an action hero, so, what an odd, awkward choice he was to play tortured Hamlet. Dying his hair blonde another silly miscue. And having Glenn Close (who is about 5 yrs older than Mel) playing his Mom, sheer goofiness. Production values and overall feel is rather crude, totally unlike Kenneth Branagh's magnificent 1996 version of Hamlet. Selectively chopping away at the play's script did not help this awkward version either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Mel Gibson is always good to look upon; however, this version of Hamlet was not handled well by the director and so the whole production was disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mel has captured Hamlet's soul","review":"What a masterpiece. As much as I love Braveheart, I truly think this is Mel Gibson's finest work. It throws all over attempts into shadow, including the great Lawrence Olivier and certainly Kenneth Branaugh or Ethan Hawke. So often the female characters are reduced to cardboard mock-ups of feminine ideals of the Shakespearean age. Not here! Ofelia and Gertrude have souls and minds to probe, filled with as many dark secrets as Hamlet himself. I could never say enough about the caliber of this film. Suffice it to say that it is THE Hamlet of the ages and worth a look as well as a few dollars to own it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A teacher's must","review":"I have taught this play by simply watching the movie.

It wasn't too boring either, and Gibson does a good job of capturing Hamlet's madness!"},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful rendering","review":"One cannot stop comparing this Hamlet against Olivier's. This one is more beautiful, Zefirelli's color, texture, garments and decorations, epoch recreation, are superb. However, I take issue with the excessive dramatism. Subdued shadows of danish mist are replaced here by italian exhuberance. Olivier's hesitant progress towards doom is replaced here by well intended overacting - nicely done, of course, we have great actors in this movie, but overacting nevertheless. Zefirelli did a nice job on The taming of the shrew and Romeo and Juliet, but Hamlet requires, I believe, a more nordic introspection. Too bad Bergman never did attempt to film it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gibson Great... Zeffirelli Not so Much","review":"Gibson brings a wonderful dynamic to the role... but the rest of the film's direction by Zeffirelli is a travesty. The Freudian Oedipus complex? ... oh, please... done to death. The complete removal of the opening scene of the play (the ghost appears to the guards)? Well, that just about stops any forward momentum the play is meant to have at its start. And the almost complete removal of the Fortinbras subplot? Uh, that pretty much guts the parallel structure of the play.Stick to the Branagh version instead!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"high school students will love this movie for its vivid scenes. Very true to the text. Brings Shakespeare to the teen's grasp."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not this time Mel!","review":"Well...if you want a chop job Hamlet this is the version to go for. Kenneth Branagh's version does a wonderful disgrace to this movie! I don't care wether Mel Gibson is good looking or not; he is not fit for the Shakesperean Stage/Screen. The only thing this movie is good for is high school students who didn't read the play and want to get the basic story. My friend and I laughed the whole way through and the only reason we survived is because it was happy hour at the campus bar. The script is wanting in every way possible and Glenn Close as Gertrude? Pass me another beer and you, well you should move on and see Branagh or Olivier's Hamlet!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful","review":"This film has many problems, bad cuts, miscasting, etc. - but I'll limit myself to Mel Gibson here. This is the most ridiculous Hamlet I've ever seen. Mel plays him with swaggering machismo (the only thing he is capable of) and it is wrong, wrong, wrong. Hamlet is a passive-aggressive type; he is indirect in everything he does. Laurence Olivier's is a good example as to how he should be played. Gibson's doesn't even make any sense.And as far as the cuts, they're particularly bad here, but everyone does it. Olivier cuts quite a bit out of it himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laughable","review":"Mad Max as the most classically tragic figure of all-time - what a joke! Glenn Close is abominable and hardly old enough to be his mother - plus Gibson's too old to play the young prince, anyway.I love Shakespeare, but this was atrocious. Laurence Olivier would be turning over in his grave if he saw this despicable display of an acting attempt by Gibson. Watch Olivier or Branagh's versions if you desire true Shakespeare- not the faux watered-down version. He was great in Braveheart - but ladies and gents, Braveheart this is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shakespeare Would Have Died","review":"Casting Mel Gibson as the complicated Hamlet was a huge mistake. I felt as if he didn't even understand the words coming out of his mouth. Also, the long play was cut in half, leaving a lot missing. Glenn Close was way too young to be cast as Mel's mother; she's not even 10 years older than him, and Zefferelli didn't even bother to put ageing makeup on her. I think Glenn Close is a fine actress, but she only did a mediocre job in this mediocre movie. The messy and grainy cinematography never let me forget that I was watching a movie, instead of sucking me into the story. The Kenneth Branagh version is infinitely better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be worse, but I don't recommend it","review":"Mel Gibson is a terrible choice for Hamlet. I think if I could have ignored him and his acting the movie might have been bearable, but he was the star character. The choice of actress for Ophelia was perfect, though, and I wish someone else had played Hamlet, so I could rewatch the movie without being annoyed."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was wasteful of words.","review":"This movie could have gotten to the point faster if it had been more concise. It was also hard to follow because of the language. It also would have been nearly impossible to understand if the play had not been read first. The acting was good because each actor accurately portrayed the characters as Shakespeare had described them."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was a great film the acting was good and very pleasing","review":"I liked the movie and I thought it was very understandable unlike the play which was a bit harder to understand. The acting in the play was good and so was the action. But I found that some parts in the film were left out like the scene in the play were the clowns had a scene. Over all this is a great film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highlights of Hamlet","review":"When I first saw this version, not long after its release I was immediately lost and confused. Having a clear ability to understand Shakespeare (as I had read several of his plays, but not yet Hamlet) I was bewildered. A film based on Shakespeare needs to interpret the work VISUALLY as well as with the dialogue.This is not a film for those who know not the play and it is too short, too cut and too uninspired for those who do. What a pointless mess, really. Typical dreary castle, typical silly costumes, typical, typical, typical. It's everything people expect from films based on Shakespeare, boring, dull, familiar.See Kenneth Branaughs 4hr masterpiece, and Anthony Hopkins \\"Titus\\" or Ian McKellen's \\"Richard III\\" to see what Shakespeare can really be on screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, this was a great purchase!! <3","review":"I bought this for my girlfriend.

Useless for us in Sweden. Didn't get any any information about this when I bought it- disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Scofield","review":"There are arguments against this movie as a perversion of Shakespeare's Hamlet, in that it is not true to the play. While Franco Zeffirelli did indeed cut and re-assemble the sequence rather recklessly, the actors play the story superbly. All doubts of Mel Gibson's ability to do classical work was immediately erased in my mind. Where most actors struggle to find any humor in Hamlet (including, sadly, Olivier), Gibson uses humor magnificently to balance Hamlet's equally spontaneous wildness. And he can make the switch on a dime. But the real reason to watch this movie, the real reason that this movie should be seen by everyone everywhere, is Paul Scofield's portrayal of the Ghost of Hamlet's father. Witness a consummate actor breathe life into one of the most heart-wrenching texts ever set down. Beautiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have potential if they just leave the bathroom","review":"The most disappointing thing about this CD is the sound quality.

Watch this one on cable if you get the chance but don't waste a dollar of your money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hyperventilate","review":"This movie is a very poor production but also a curious one because the only good thing about it is the monster itself. Hypnogogic and psychopompic hallucinations (the correct terms) are an ancient problem of mankind. This film pretends to be fact based yet it does not mention the only known cure for sleep paralysis: hyperventilation which floods the body with oxygen to wake up the brain, since sleep paralysis is caused by one part of the brain being awake while another is asleep. That said, this topic has great potential and some producer should make a film of gripping horror (I suggest this film's producer find a new line of work).

Granted the first four fiances were not right for Julia's character, but to think anyone would marry that creep after he harassed her (don't they have stalking laws in Hale?) is a bit much. I wanted to shoot him and her family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Bland","review":"All The Chemistry in the World Doesn't make a Great,Good,or even Average Film.those words plus Fair don't even Describe this Awful Film.Roberts,Gere&Marshall are just Cashing in the Check on this Forgettable Mess.Nothing Fresh or Original here."},{"rating":"1","title":"It should be illegal to release a movie this bad.","review":"OK, where do I start. This is a terrible movie. There is no good part and I'm sick of seeing that annoying woman run from the altar. I would give this movie 0 stars, but I can't. DON'T BUY THIS! DON'T RENT THIS. Extremely hazardous to your health. May all copies of this movie be burned at that stake."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 hours of my life...wasted!","review":"I was dragged kicking and screaming to this one by a lady friend. I have actually found a few chick-flicks watchable and mildly entertaining, but found this one especially cheeky, corny, and predictable. An excrutiating looong 2 hours!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hugely disappointed!","review":"2 stars because these ARE two of my favorite stars on film. I did enjoy Pretty Woman and was looking forward to seeing them together again. Maybe because my expectations were so high that the disappointment is so incredible. Pleaseeee, this movie felt like it was made up as they went along. Okay now we'll put in a couple of guys singing, now we'll show the horses again, now we'll have them playing cards, now... It was like instead of having a story to be told they started with just wanting to get these two actors together once again on the screen. A 2 hour long sitcom. And because I couldn't believe what I was seeing I guess I plumb missed all the jokes everyone else is talking about. Maybe they can try again in a couple of years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definetly Good!","review":"Me and my sister went to see this and we loved it! Notting Hill was absolutely disgusting and this one was almost completely clean! Defintely rent it. Buy it. Sure, maybe there wasn't very much \\"chemistry\\", But in Notting Hill, Hugh Grant was such a drip (underline please). Spilling orange juice all over someone is not what build a relationship on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen! It's advertised as being a \\"follow-up\\" to Pretty Woman? I don't think so! This movie is nowhere near as good as Pretty Woman! The script is weak, it's completley miscast...I could go on! Don't waste your time or money on this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbearably Stupid!","review":"Richard Gere plays a newspaper reporter who ahs been sacked because he can't write, er, good articles. When Richy hears about a Runaway Bride named Maggie Carpenter who likes to dump grooms ride at the altar, he decides it is the perfect story to win back his job. So, he immediately goes down to Maggie's home town. She is currently engaged, and he is not leaving until she runs from that chapel again! However, when our Richy falls for Maggie, things get more and more complicated. Is he still in love with his job? Or is going to go for Maggie instead?Runaway Bride has a perfectly good idea, but the script is poor and weak. The direction from Mr. Marshall is not near as good as the effort he put into Pretty Woman. The leading actors have good names, but unfortunately their performances aren't good enough to give this film an extra star.Do not waste your time on this unbearably stupid trash!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No magic this time around.","review":"Runaway Bride starring Richard Gere and Julia Roberts is their second time teaming up and Garry Marshall directed them in Pretty Woman. I didn't like this film at all, it's considered a romantic comedy but it feels more like a drama, Roberts' character has major commitment issues and it takes 2 hours to figure out why she won't get married, that could have been resolved much quicker! The chemistry between the two actors is not as strong or connvincing like Pretty Woman. Joan Cusack also stars and of course she steals every scene. Runaway Bride had me running from ever watching this fluff again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"For those who don't feel like thinking.","review":"This is quite easily one of the worst and most predictable movies ever! I nearly ripped the disc out of my DVD during the scene at her walk-thru rehearsal at the church where she is waiting at the altar for her fiance and Gere steps in instead...ugh! Come on! This is for those who have absolutely nothing better to do. Rent it, if you must, but don't buy it. Seeing once was torture enough!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"It was my stepdaughter's choice. She needs a real perspecitve on life. This kind of movie gives her the wrong ideas about life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really stilted","review":"I usually enjoy both Julia Roberts and Richard Gere, but this movie just did not do it for me...perhaps because it was somewhat dated (which I knew going into it), or perhaps because this earlier work just featured actors not quite yet at their prime. The pacing was just slow and it lost my interest about half-way through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ear to Ear Smiles from Intro to Ending.","review":"Utterly Enjoyable in every department, anyone who critisises this film is taking it and themselves far too seriously, Richard Gere and Julia Roberts have Chemistry to Burn in this film, at some points it's like there just having a great time and have forgotten that the Cameras rolling. Julia is as Loveable as ever and Richard plays his most likeable character in decades. (though, how hard is it to act like your in love with Julia, i act like that every day)The Supporting Cast are Hillarious, (Joan Cusack and Hector Elizondo are standouts) the pacing, screenplay and Direction are spot-on, a sure-fire crowd pleaser."},{"rating":"2","title":"Runaway Smash Hit!","review":"Brilliant work from Julia Roberts and Richard Gear. It's about time you guys got together again to film this movie. The movie flows very well from one scene to the next. The scenes are hilarious. It's not very often you get a movie with good clean fun anymore. I highly recommend you watch this movie to the very end!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Julia Roberts and Richard Gere perfect match in Runaway Bride","review":"I have probably watched this every year since it came out. It is funny, touching, and makes you care about the characters. The on camera chemistry between the stars is a perfect match. It is a must own movie for you collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Julia, Get Another Personality....","review":"Enough already of the sarcastic pretty woman of a decade ago, can't she grow up and display just a bit of class & diversity now & then! This has to be the emptiest plot around & all just to reunite the 3 stars & director from her first big role. Who would believe any of these characters or the situation of a multi-weddinged babe & the small-town feeling is just as contrived. And a society columnist in the main-news section of USA Today? It might be fun for a few light laughs but I feel basically we should just forget this one!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"pretty empty","review":"that's the best thing you can say; very cute, and just fine if you liked Pretty Woman; Richard Gere is very charming and sometimes funny, and Julia is Julia; there's cameoes by Larry Miller and Hector Elizando (!); check out the soundtrack, featuring Shawn Colvin and the Dixie Chicks - it's not bad"},{"rating":"1","title":"More Trashy Roberts","review":"Paramount should have been shut down for making a film that glorifies a woman with total disrespect for her fiance(s), men in general, and everyone else in her life. Roberts is her usual strange self and should be sent the bill for all the resources wasted finding Jennifer Wilbanks after she decided it would be cool to imitate this braindead movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"JULIA, TRY TO STAY SINGLE.","review":"Runaway bride is not like Pretty woman.Richard Gere is OLD, and Julia is more beautiful every time.But the movie, is boring and a not funny or romantic at all.The only good thing here is Julia, she is great and she'll always gonna be great."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money-not gere and roberts best work","review":"I particually love watching romantic comedy's, this was a BIG disappointment, I read that joan cusack stole moments from this movie and it was true!

No real \\"chemistry\\" until about 75% of the movie is over.Skip it and see Notting Hill, which was much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"As a huge fan of the Roberts and Gere team, I have to say I was highly disappointed in the outcome of this movie. Original? Yes. Interesting and funny? No. Just because a movie is original, doesn't mean it's good. Although we all knew the happy ending was forthcoming, the storyline to getting there was pure boredom. Then again, it's hard to make an engaging (pardon the pun) movie with such a ridiculous story line. Pretty Woman was a far far better flick, you can't even compare the two. Then again, this is just my own personal opinion, after all, everyone is entitled to their own. Go ahead and see it if you're curious. I hope you enjoy it more than I did. Thanks for reading my review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contrived, boring garbage","review":"Richard Gere seemed bored during this movie. And well he might be. Alright, so most romantic comedies are predictable: girl-hates-boy, and in the end they fall in love. But the better ones cover this over with comedic twists and good acting. This film contains neither, though Julia Roberts tries. So contrived and badly written, you'll be embarrassed to be caught watching this. Bland cinematography, unfunny, and with little charm. Spend your money on Twinkies; they contain more substance than this sorry film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont fall for this bride","review":"While thinking a movie starting Julia Roberts, and Richard Gere what can be wrong, but to my surprise I found out that \\"everything\\" can be wrong, the bride was very un charming, and un-sexy, the acting was not to a satisfactory level, Richard was a little better in his part, but still the story didn't make much sense from the beginning, it was to long and boring..... DO NOT FALL FOR THIS ONE..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Now a reality show in a town near you","review":"Not so funny when it happens to you, is it? Now that the public has turned on the real runaway bride, attempting to press criminal charges for her flighty behavior, we can appreciate just how unreal this movie was, and that \\"Julia\\" would have left lots of wreckage behind her as she bolted from each wedding. Instead, the whole tragedy is played for laughs and, ironically, press coverage. Both Gere and Julia have seen better days, and have been playing themselves in lackluster films as long as anyone can remember. Watch \\"Goodbar\\" instead to see the real Gere."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is no \\"Pretty Woman\\"","review":"Ok, so I didn't expect this to be as good as pretty woman, but I did expect it to be pretty good since Julia Roberts and Ricard Gere were in it. I didn't enjoy it much. It moved kind of slow, and the whole movie all I kept waiting for was the reason she kept running away at the altar, and without giving away the ending, I thought it was a really flaky and unsubstantial reason. I didn't really enjoy it. I didn't find it very funny, I never laughed out loud once through the whole movie. If you like romantic comedies, try the wedding singer."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Chick-Flick","review":"One of my favorite movies that I love to watch over and over again. The chemistry between Gere and Roberts is great and I love the small town atmosphere in the movie.

It is THE chick movie! It is the story of a girl who has had three weddings but has never said \\"I do\\". A newspaper column writer finds this story funny and publishes it. He ends up meeting the \\"runaway bride\\" and I won't tell you anything else! Excellent acting by Julia Roberts and Richard Gere. I recommend this to women. When it comes to guys, I don't think they would enjoy this movie too much."},{"rating":"2","title":"runaway bride","review":"yes 5 stars for this mega title is absolutely the norm with the stars like Julia Roberts and Richar Geer."},{"rating":"1","title":"duMB MOVIE","review":"THis movie is dumb with lame jokes and you know what the ending is from the dumb commercials. Anyone who thinks this is a good movie is out of their bird-brain. Pretty woman was so much better. Buy pretty woman instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your Money","review":"Ok, this was a horrible movie. It's another Hollywood attempt to make an easy buck and cash in on the success of an earlier and much better movie (Pretty Woman). I saw this in the theatre and could not believe that I paid money to sit through it. The movie has no direction what so ever and yet is also extremely pridictable not to mention very slow moving. The stars walk through their performances as if they even realize how bad of a script this was. If you like Julia Roberts and/or Richard Gere, buy another movie because this one is way done on the list in their canons."},{"rating":"1","title":"IMMERGED IN SUGAR","review":"Roberts and Gere resisted bravely while they could to the pressure the movie executives put upon them to try to make another PRETTY WOMAN. The result was this thing, a formulatic and boring product that will be buried forever in film-making history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I watched this movie with my wife unfortunately. Unfortunate that I watched this movie, not that I viewed it with my wife. The movie was so bad that we left 3/4 into it. It was so bad that even my wife agreed it was horrible and she left with me. Julia Roberts while having a good smile is not the best of actresses. Case in point is Ocean's Eleven."},{"rating":"1","title":"More On-Screen \\"Magic\\" from Roberts/Gere","review":"Its a shame we're only treated to ONE movie per decade of the dynamic duo of Julia \\"world's largest mouth\\" Roberts and Richard \\"Hampster\\" Gere. I found myself laughing out loud - not once - during this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, has it finished now ?","review":"OK, so Richard Gere is still cute and the virginal appeal of Julie Roberts is undiminished since Pretty Woman (how did she manage virginal appeal AND be a hooker? in that). This was one of the slowest moving movies I have seen for ages and dragged inexorably towards it's supremely predictable anti climax in a manner that dished up only rare surprises in a manner that treated them with a respect they never deserved. Two great actors, one pants film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Runaway, far away....","review":"I have to say I am quite shocked at the number of five star reviews this movie has recieved. This is easily one of the worst that Hollywood has to offer. Don't get me wrong, I am always up for the no-brainer romantic comedy, however, this took the cake in full-on garbage. As a fan of Roberts and Gere, I am embarrassed they have chosen these roles which are now forever emblazoned on DVD. I found nothing interesting or remotely funny about a bride who skips the altar four or five times, and to make a movie of it! YUCK! I was tossing my cookies by the time Roberts moved to New York to sell her art, what was that all about? Well, buy it if you must, but don't say I didn't tell you so....."},{"rating":"1","title":"In a word; YUCK","review":"This isn't just a reflex action to that romantic comdey genre, although admitddly it isn't among my favourites. But this film is badly paced, to be quite honest I was staring at the furniture in Gere's apartment during the second half of the film. Sure a romantic comedy being predictable is a given but tedious, sachyrinne, badly directed, acted and just about everything else. This thing looked like a sitcom. For those of you who claim \\"Gere's best performance\\", have you seen Primal Fear? Internal Afairs(Where he was better then the film) or even An Officer and A Gentleman. You rent of these popcorn films for a good lazy afternoon, and this will bore you to death. For what a romantic comedy is supposed to be, see Four Weddings and A Funeral."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably bad.","review":"If you are allergic to movies that have an overkill of \\"cuteness,\\" be sure to have a barfbag handy, when you watch this one. Luckily, I recorded it from TV, skimmed to the end just to make sure it did have the required happy ending, and then erased it. If I had actually owned it, I would have burned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Runaway from this\\"","review":"This is probably the worst movie I have ever seen.The small town America this piful is set in has to be the most sickingly false contrived piece of garbage Hollywood has come up with to date.Richard Gere is particurally wooden and miscast,Julia Roberts on the other hand has been playing the same character since Pretty Woman, so no surprises from her.By the way,the Dixie Chicks video on the DVD is worse thn the film.I gave the one star for the lack of special features on this DVD as there is less of this garbage to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Runaway bride","review":"Julia please retire and let some of the more talented( and a lot prettyer) young actresses take parts like this... you so full of yourself"},{"rating":"2","title":"Some Of The Best New Surf Out There!","review":"One of the best bands of the mid-90s instro-surf movement. One of the things that bugged me about many of these bands was the yawnworthy retro-sweetness (and slowness) of their music. These guys have got power and energy in spades and I'd put them up there with the Nebulas, Man Or Astroman? and all of the other great neo surf acts. I've got this on vinyl and almost every song is fantastic. Also,I'm REAL impressed that Amazon has this, as itunes doesn't.

I was really looking forward to hearing her latest album. To my surprise, it wasn't what I expected. It was too contemporary. It was just a lot of beats, with her trying to sing over them. I tried to listen to it. I found myself skipping from track to track. With \\"I Owe You\\", she use different styles of music, which made the album great. With this album she headed in a different direction, and stayed with one style of music. It just didn't sound right. The only two songs I like are \\" Hear This\\", and \\" Why Me\\". I think I'll stick with \\"I Owe You\\", and pray that her next album is more like her first album.

Sheffield seems to produce his very best material when he writes solo and (frankly) when he writing 20 years ago.\\"Sight of Proteus\\" fits both those parameters, and in my opinion is among the two or three best that Sheffield ever produced. The story is based in a world where changes to the human form can be ordered from a public catalog - and of course the darker underworld where prohibited changes can be obtained.In an over-populated world where underground scientists are willing to push the envelope of human form and evolution, this novel broke new ground pushing the \\"what if?\\" question related to human potential.

It's an insult to the many, many fine cooks/authors who have spent years testing and revising recipes until they come up with a book worth publishing. Why not just take the recipes off the back of a soup can, rather than spending money on what is being passed off as a cookbook. I think the author's forte is likely making reservations rather than dinner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Pleased and Full!","review":"I wasn't sure about this book at first, because I didn't really think that what the authors claimed could be true. But, I am happy to say, that for the most part their claim of 20 minutes a recipe is true. Now, you have to really MOVE that entire 20 minutes. As the mother of an 8 month old, that sometimes means that 20 minutes takes 30 because I have to stop and pay attention to my daughter.

Initally I was very impressed with it's specs. How ever, I have had nothing but problems with it. I returned the first one because it wouldn't play half of the mp3's that I tried... it would just freeze. The second one I got seems better, but I still have alot of problems with it. I have numerous audio cd's that it either refused to play, or plays with lots of clicks, pops, and stuttering. In addition, I have been creating mp3's from my cd collection to archive, and I still have alot of mp3's that stutter and stall, or won't play at all. I have tried 2 ripping/encoding programs and 2 codecs with similar results both times. I also tried 2 brands of cdr and a cdrw.I for one, am very dissapointed over all and I will be returning it and trying another brand (Rio??)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the Rio instead","review":"I got this mp3 player because CNET.COM gave it a 9 rating.

I will get a Rio as soon as I get a refund for this player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does NOT read all MP3 CDRW types!","review":"Hold it! What the misleading ads, glowing reviews, etc DON'T tell you is that the Mojo can't read CDRWs formatted for packet writing. Well, my computer's CD burner uses -- guess -- PACKET WRITING!! I only find this out after I've bought the thing, got it out of the package, plug it in, and stare in awe as the LCD just displays \\"can't read\\" and shuts itself off every time I put in an MP3 CD... what a RIP OFF. Then I notice that the user manual informs you of this glaring flaw way in the back in fine print (which you will never see until you've bought this kludge, opened the package, etc, because the reviews tell you nothing about this.) So forget listening to any MP3 music on your CDRWs if your computer has the Adaptec Direct CD software like mine does. Oh, but it plays regular audio CDs just fine (except for the skipping)... whoopee."},{"rating":"2","title":"Contrary to a previous review, CDR does work fine","review":"One reviewer stated that CDR's made using Adaptec Easy CD Creator 4 don't work in this (presumably due to \\"packet writing\\"). I use that software (using DAO \\"Disk At Once\\") to write my DATA CD's that have MP3's on them and they work great. Just make sure you are writing DATA and using DAO. All other features of the MOJO are great as already reviewed by others. One additional feature not mentioned much is the \\"line out\\" jack. Using an adapter cord (not supplied with the unit), you can plug this into any stereo's RCA (left and right) input jacks to get MP3's into your stereo!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only plays MP3 CDs well","review":"For playing MP3 CDs, the MOJO does almost everything I need and more; it's really a great CD player for the price... It has so many good features. Missing, however, is the capability to fast forward and rewind while playing MP3s. The fast foward and rewind work while playing normal audio CDs, but you can't hear where you're at until you stop fast forwarding or rewinding and play the CD, unlike almost all other CD players that I have used.When playing my normal audio CDs, my MOJO skipped a lot and every now and then would just stop in the middle of a track. My Memorex basic CD player plays these CDs perfectly fine. Because I have so much trouble listening to normal audio CDs, I am going to return this CD player and buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Often fails to play audio CD's","review":"While the Mojo performs well with MP3 discs, it will certainly disapoint you when you play a regular audio CD.

Yes, I tried cleaning the lens!"},{"rating":"1","title":"... out after ten months","review":"During it's working time, The Mojo was great. It was terrifc to have 150 songs without needing to shell out $$$ for the iPod. However, recently it stoped playing certain tracks. After investigation the problem, I found that I could only put 450MB of mp3's on a disc. Past that, the thing just doesn't play the tracks. I also found that I wasn't the only person with this problem. TDK support is a joke, so I'm stuck with a half working player.Besides this major defect, the player really wasn't put together well. They could have done dozens of things to extend battery life. Playing standard CDs drained the batterys in one hour. You can't scan forward inside tracks and the equilizer was less than satisfactory.Save your money and buy a player from people who know electrons, not just CD media. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Ugly Tank!","review":"Sturdy as a tank and just as ugly. ..:-) Great little durable player that should last you many years.

Plenty of volume and it will not skip on you!!!I love the headphones and it's menu... I also own the Riovolt, it is rather flemsy, but can do more in a stantinary position. In other words, if you are on the move, get this player!!! hide it if you can, it's sooo ugly...:-)As for those complaners who say it eats battries, simply buy recharble Nickel Metal Hydride. each charge will last about 4-5 hours or more per charge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"This has a lot of features, mostly already enumerated.

This is one for teenagers who think it is an intelligent movie to watch, instead of the lame production that it is. An episode of 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' can be more intellectual than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this movie at all costs!","review":"This is THE least enjoyable movie ever.

Based on a true account during the Vietnam era."},{"rating":"2","title":"American Masterpiece","review":"This film is as close to a masterpiece that American cinema has produced. Unfortunately it requires an explanatory companion piece to inform the viewer what is happening. Briefly stated: Tim Robbin's character has been mortally wounded in Viet Nam in the opening scenes and the entire film is about his dreams and visions preceding death on an operating room table. Every person who feels his life is the subject of intense and realistic self examination will recognize pieces and fragments of his own dreams and visions in the film. Not necessarily in the same order or with the same story line, but with the same resistances and the same symmetries. This film is definitely NOT for everybody and it is amazing that it was ever done, especially in Hollywood but there it is,the amazing exception to the overwhelming rule."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO ENGLISH SUBTITLES","review":"There are NO English Subtitles as it says there are in the DVD Features.

Pretty bouncy and melodic, as a matter of fact. The songs are all pretty short and to the point - and the point usually has something to do with casual sex with someone who needs to be ditched ASAP... This fits into a long line of brash, punkier-than-thou chick rockers, from the Pleasure Seekers on down to L7, the Raunchettes, Bratmobile and the like. The band wears its sneery distain on its sleeves, and even though the songs are catchy, after a while the subject matter seems a bit same-y. Neko's country leanings are clear fron the word go, what with a gnarly cover of Wanda Jackson's \\"Mean Mean Man\\", and various other twang-ish numbers. Cool record... it's the kind of thing you might outgrow pretty quickly, but if you're in the mood, this totally rocks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was expecting this to lean more toward rockabilly than punk. Even for punk it's pretty amateurish musically. Neko has the best voice of the 3 Maow-ers but her singing has vastly improved since this came out. Skip this and get her more recent stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"Reading this book was a delight.

The one negative review picked nits and technique, entirely missing the tenuousness of the mother/child relationship when stressed, and of the mother's and the child's fierce desire to cement a better relationship, while also saying \\"Goodbye\\" to the pain of the Father's loss. The concept of mind-to-mind communication between parent and child is so old and so basic, and yet is refreshingly displayed here without bells and whistles and trappings that might render it unbelievable.

A child showing all the symptoms of being autistic is miraculously cured by the actions of her mother, as she heroically stands up to: a) child welfare workers; b) physicians and/or psychotherapists with many years of experience dealing with autistic children; and c) common sense.Here is Kathleen Turner snatching her autistic child away from these screaming meanies, and finding her own cure for her daughters autism, although she refuses to learn anything about the disease she most unrealistically cures.This movie slaps parents of autistic children in the face with its simplistic Hollywood style cures for a most difficult medical problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"house of cards","review":"I remember when my mom had brought this movie home from the, video rental store it wasn't the typical run of the mill Tommy Lee Jones and Kathleen Turner movie.I wasn't sure if was going to like it or not but i popped it into the old proverbial video cassette player and it started to play and get going. The two things i did like about it right away was that Kathleen Turner wasn't playing her typical crabby women roles she played a dramatic part of a mother who is frantically trying to understand and help her daughter physically with her autistic and savant type of behavior.Tommy Lee Jones was perfect for this role how was able to divorce himself from the tough guy roles is beyond me but one thing I will tell you for sure is how made the role look so credible as a doctor who along with the girls mother try to make heads or tails out of her special situation, him and Kathleen turners on screen chemistry was something i would call pure cinema."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tom Green:Better in Canada","review":"This is the best Tom Green video released out of his four videos.I have never laughed so much in my life,I had to change my pants serveral times while watching it.Something Smells Funny is better than the Tom Green:Uncensored,Tonsil Hockey,and Tom Gren:The Best of.Yes,there is some material in this video that was aired on MTV but this is better because they don't bleep ANYTHING.On the Slut Mobile you can see there women's--well you figure it out.Better material than the MTV version.I have never seen Tom Green use such language.Canadian TV is better than American.GET THIS VIDEO."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tom Green Show: Something Smells Funny","review":"Tom Green is an insane genuis and his antics are uproarious.

Can't get enough of him. But this video was more than enough. True, it does have some very funny clips on it, but on this video they're pretty rare. There's only two segments that have been on the MTV version and most of this is either stupid or disgusting or both. I think Tom had to tone down his act for MTV and his old act wasn't very funny at all. There's about 8 or 9 funny skits on this, but that's out of about 30. I like the MTV Tom Green a lot better than the Canadian Tom Green. From this video I can tell he improved greatly and Tom and MTV are perfect for each other, but in Canada, it was a mismatch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tom Greens Best Canadian Cuts","review":"Even though it's no where as good as his Americanized show, Tom Green's \\"Something Smells Funny\\" is a Tom Green collectors item with some too hot for TV stuff from Canada.

I literally took my shoes off and walked the rest of the way home, barefoot! I came home and put my Spenco cross-trainer insoles back into my shoes and it felt like a dream once again!

I love them so much that I want two more pairs, one for my show boots and one as a back-up! Once you put your shoe on, you can't even feel them, but you know they're working.

The feel is similar to my Earth shoes which make me stand strait and I do get a feel that I am getting some kind of workout while just walking.If you don't have high arches I think these will be great for you. They are well worth the money to try them.For those of you suffering from plantar fasciitis I recommend Brooks tennis shoes, originally made for runners.

If you're into yourself more than pleasing the customer then I just don't know what to tell you about this video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Easy Towel Changes","review":"This paper towel holder is excellent. Our previous holder had a heavy, screw off top. It was easy to drop and just a general pain when it came to changing the roll of towels. This Simplehuman Quick Load Paper Towel Holder is simply fantastic. In one quick motion, I am able to pinch and remove the top. The roll goes on, and then I can quickly place the top right back. It also stays in place quite firmly when I lift without pinching the buttons. Overall, I am very happy with this product, and I would definitely recommend it to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Works","review":"I put off buying this paper towel holder for months even though it's received rave reviews. Finally I grew tired of repeatedly yanking my entire roll of paper towels off the kitchen windowsill and into a sink full of water when I needed a single paper towel. I decided it might be worth the cost. I've only used this holder with standard size paper towels so far (not the jumbo size) but it works great. The heavy base really does stay put when you pull off a single paper towel. The base is large and the filled holder looks a bit bulky on the windowsill but it works really well. It's super easy to refill --- just a squeeze at top to lift out the empty roll and put a new one in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"I love this paper towel holder. It is so easy to refill and it looks great! I would highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Solution!","review":"I bought this paper towel holder to replace a wall-mounted one that refused to stay screwed into the wall, leaving us with multiple unattractive holes that I now have to figure out how to hide. I've always preferred wall-mounted paper towel holders in order to save counter space, but decided to go with this counter top model because it matches other items in my kitchen and I knew it could sit within easy reach of my kitchen sink. I am so glad that I did! It is sturdy and attractive, and really doesn't take up much space at all. I can easily tear off a towel using the one-handed method. I have other simplehuman items around my kitchen and have always been impressed - I can now add this product to the list. It's a keeper!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the best","review":"This device looks great and boy does it work. No more tipping over the paper towel holder when you pull off a towel, the holder stays put and the towels tear off cleanly. I can't believe I suffered all those years with holders that were nothing but a hassle. Loading it is so easy, just press and remove the cap on top and slip the paper towel roll on and then replace the cap, the cap automatically locks in place. Spend the extra bucks you'll be glad you did, this is the best paper towel holder out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Paper Towel Holder Ever","review":"I bought this item about two months ago and could not be happier with it. It comes fully assembled and is beautifully designed and made. The base is heavy and the shaft is solid. There is no flimsyness here and no problem with the holder turning over. It is easy to tear off one or more paper towels using one hand. The price was also very good. I definitely recommend it to anyone needing a new paper towel holder."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"This is very convenient and looks great in the kitchen. Seems well-made as well, so I think it'll last a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product","review":"I wanted to get something to match my modern kitchen, and I was tired of the screw tops when I change paper towels. I love how this one loads, it's so quick and easy. Only complaint is the stainless steel bottom. Due to humidity in the south & the splattering of water, it leaves water stains around the ring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Simple Item","review":"It's a simple product but built well. It has a sturdy frame and heavy base so it doesn't move when you pull the paper towel. However, the stem is a little tall for Australian sized paper towels so a substantial amount of stem is showing.Nonetheless, it is still better to have more than less and I would not have hesitation recommending this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"A quality paper towel holder.","review":"I have been very happy with this paper towel holder. It sits nicely and does not move when you pull on the towels. I really like the attractive contemporary look and design. I would recommend this for anyone looking for a nice upright towel holder. It is the best paper towel holder I have ever owned. I have been pleased with all my purchases from Simplehuman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something that really works","review":"I have bought all the cheap ones over the years but finally I found one that really works and looks cool on my countertop."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best paper towel holder you'll ever need","review":"I love this paper towel holder! It's heavy enough to survive \\"attacks\\" for paper towels, holds all sizes of rolls, and is a snap to reload! Just push a button and the top pops off and then snaps back on in a second.

I'm sure you're asking yourself how could you spend $20 for a paper towel holder. Trust me, just do it. For how long this thing is going to be standing around your place, you will not regret it. This baby doesn't budge. It is so nice being able to properly pull a nice thick paper towel off a standing holder and it tear properly. Not flip the towel holder over, or pull 8 more sheets out, or it flips into your hand getting your needed to be toweled hands all over the whole roll. This towel holder stands there like a champ and does the job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another happy customer","review":"Bought this after viewing the video clip one of the early reviewer posted (a lady, I believe, thank you!).

With this holder, the patent is gone - discharged. I could not be more happier with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks good, works well","review":"It gets the job done. It loads quickly like it says.

It is a Progressive Chopper with an extra blade. They do pack it in a Vidalia Box but the Chopper itself has Progressive imprinted on it. I wonder if the box chops better than the chopper? You are paying $8.00 extra for a blade. Read the comments on the Progressive chopper quite a few people unhappy. When you read the comments on the Vidalia Chopper Wizard at national Express it appears the Vidalia is a lot better product than the Progressive. I contacted \\"As Seen on TV\\", and they said they have permission to do this. I should have ordered from National Express and gotten the REAL DEAL !!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!!","review":"I buy this for birthday presents all the time now--it's my new favorite kitchen gadget.

I found it incredibly handy, however, after only using it a few times the plastic piece on the side of the contianed that the lid attaches to broke off and now I cant use it. I can't find a customer service or help option for letting the inventor know and I am dissapointed it did not last long at all. I even was very careful to soend the time cutting onions and things into a little bit smaller pieces, not chopping them whole. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke in 2 weeks","review":"As many others have stated, the hinges are a weakness with this item.

That being said, I have replaced it twice, because it is truly a time saver. It chops just as advertised. Yes, you do have to slice the onion in half before putting it in the chopper, but that takes no time at all. I use this at least three times a week. A breeze to clean in the dishwasher. This is one of the few \\"as seen on T.V.\\" products that actually work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best chopper I have ever used","review":"I was wary of this \\"as seen on tv\\" item. Usually, these types of things are just not worth the money. However, this is the exception to the rule. We've had our Vidalia Chopper for quite a while and have used it to chop many things and even for a few chili cookoffs.When we first got it, I thought that it wouldn't hold up as it was mostly plastic, but we've chopped many, many gallons of vegetables and other items with it. We traditionally make several gallons of fresh salsa for our July 4th get together. Usually, it takes hours to get all of the peppers, onions, garlic and tomatoes chopped. This year, I used the vidalia chopper to do ALL of the chopping. I had 4 people \\"feeding\\" me the ingrediants and I was able to keep up with them. We finished in less than an hour with 4.5 gallons of salsa.I've used the spinner style choppers and the bang bang style, but the vidalia chopper is absolutely the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"No more tears","review":"This gadget is such a time-saver and is nice and compact. I can chop a green pepper and onion in seconds for Spanish rice (I quarter them first) or chili, fresh salsa is a breeze too. The little comb-like gadget makes it super easy to clean the top part and everything is easily contained in the base for measuring and easy cleanup. I am thinking about getting the slicer too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true time saver","review":"I received this kitchen gadget as a gift. After only a month it has gotten more use than many of my other small kitchen utensils. Great for kids that want to help but too young to handle knives. I found that it dices about everything I've needed to chop(vegtables, cheeses, meat, eggs) Also, having such uniformed cubes has made some of my meals look more attractive. Potatoe salad takes half the time. It is tricky to clean and comes with a special cleaning tool that I know in a matter of time will get lost. All things considered well worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't chop much but onions...","review":"Hmm, for the time it takes to get this out of the cupboard and considering the cleanup, it's kind of a waste. I mean, it will chop an onion, IF you quarter it first, but otherwise I have not found much else it will work on, without getting teeny little pieces stuck in the squares. I tried it for celery: no go. Green pepper is fine, but carrots don't fare too well either. Like I said, you need to quarter the vegetables first, but then since you already have the knife and are CUTTING, you might as well continue cutting/chopping with the knife. What are you saving, time? Not much. Effort? Not really.Totally unnecessary tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Letters of James and Peter: The New Daily Study Bible","review":"I am still studying the book, but so far it has been a valuble addition to my books."},{"rating":"2","title":"rainbow popsicles and diamond-paved streets","review":"Music to go on a picnic to, or drive around to on a sunny day with someone you like a lot.

It had good bass, nothing could make it skip, and everything worked wonderfully. However, in the second year, things started to happen. First, the anti-skip disappeared. Then, the buttons reversed. Finally, two weeks ago, I dropped it from a height of FOUR INCHES. Now, the tone is often completely off if it is held in certain positions, and there is annoying background noise somtimes.

The radio edit leaves you hanging as the 12\\" version is the one you really want. As for the remix on this single, its a great track to listen to if you are a club and feel like dancing.

Seriously. Special features are the commentary, a lameo interactive piece that plays a long with the film, 2 short documentaries, and a trailer for the better, ULTIMATE EDITION. Oh yeah...and if you like to watch movies on the computer, you can watch the theatrical version on WINDOWS MEDIA PLAYER.Seriously...where do people get off packaging a DVD like this?

This film is a rarity: A sequel that far surpasses the originial, though the first \\"Terminator\\" is one of my favorite films I still think that this movie is better. This is also the best film of the 1990's. The reason this movie is so good has nothing to do with the jaw-dropping visual effects.

Best Arnie Film!","review":"Terminator 2, is even more fun and action-packed than the first one. I was eight-years-old when this came out, and was extremely excited! Ofcourse the plot concerns two Terminators sent back to kill John Connor, son of Sarah. One is the T-800, played by Arnold, the other is the T-1000, played by Robert Patric, one of my favorite movie villains. The excitement and horrifying tale never let up. For big T-Buffs, get the Ultimate Edition DVD, and watch the Special Edition which features tons of awesome scenes, which include Kyle Reese and some T-1000 special effects that are incredible!The special effects are top-notch with Stan Winston returning aswell as ILM doing CGI work, that would later help make Jurassic Park the great film it is.

Schwarzenegger is really annoying as the cyborg with a heart and so is linda hamilton, as the freedom fighter who is a \\"couple of cans short of a sixpack\\". It lacks the grit and suspense of the original. The scene where arnold fires thousands of bullets at the police without killing any of them is painfully reminiscent of The A-Team!

She created a character every bit as iconic as Sigourney Weaver's 'Ripley' in ALIEN, or Harrison Ford's 'Deckard' in BLADE RUNNER.The special effects are superb, and Robert Patrick is great as the new, and improved killing machine. The extra 16 minutes, that included the 'dream sequence' in the asylum was much appreciated, as it makes it easier to understand how a sane woman manages to stay that way, given what she has already had to endure in her quest to save not only her son, but an unbelieving world as well.The story is even better than that of the first Terminator, the direction by Cameron is excellent, the sets are great, and the action is non-stop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie!","review":"Terminator 2 is very suspenseful with a lot of action.

The big-budget, grandiose feel of the movie lacks the raw terror of the first film. The original film was much scarier.2. None of the characters were particularly interesting this time around...even Sarah Connor lacked any interesting qualities.3. The actor portraying the T1000 looked about as threatening as a puppy dog. They should have switched Robert Patrick (T1000) with Arnold. Arnie would have been FAR better as the evil, liquid-metal droid.Some good points: 1. Incredible special effects. 2. Good acting on the part of Hamilton. 3.

Some dvds include German, Spanish, French, Italian and Japanese. :("},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all time favorites","review":"I just watched T2 again for the umpteenth time and I still love it. There was very little wrong with this ground breaking movie. The only reason I gave it a four instead of a five is due to John Connor. As in 1991 when the movie came out, I just couldn't stand his character. When he wasn't crying he was being a petulant puerile teenager. Now, I know that that was the intent, but boy he made me sick. Honestly, that says a lot. For as much as he irked me I still absolutely loved this movie. Even watching it yesterday through the sophisticated eyes of over 20 years of CGI advancement, T2 still holds its own. I remember when this movie was cutting edge and ahead of its time. T2 took movies into a new direction much like Star Wars did 14 years before it. CGI is now an integral and necessary part of movie making and T2 really kicked that off. This is a must see and a must addition to any collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good film.","review":"I don't quite like this one as much as the original, but it's a good flick and I'm looking forward to 3."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY IS THIS CALLED EXTREME","review":"personally this dvd sucks it as almost no special features all the real special stuff is on dvd rom I dont have that. the commentary is ok but that doesnt change the subject really this dvd was made just to make a point that they could make the picture look better then ultimate and it only does look better if you have a home theather syestem and a widescreen tv. I DONT HAVE EIGTHER has a matter of fact I DONT HAVE A DVD PLAYER I have a playstation 2. I mean I was so mad when I bouth this I took it right back. now IM trying to get ultimate which is what you shold be trying to get if you looking for extreme to have the same goodness has ultimate forget it. unless you have a home theather syestem dont buy this. and the really bad thing there are no trailer's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't play","review":"As others have pointed out this won't play on even a newer Blu Ray player.

The disc is going back to Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blu-ray doesn't work because of internet requirement","review":"Not listed on the product page is the requirement for the blu-ray player to have internet connection. I have my router upstairs and my blu-ray player only allows wired connection, so when I tried to play this disc the first thing it does before going to any menus is it tells me it cannot access internet. When I hit cancel, it fades to black and stays there- it even hijacks my player so I can't do anything at all with the remote. I didn't buy this for the junk games and crappy special features and I'm angry to forces me to look at them first. Total junk edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"T2 deserves 7 stars","review":"In similar fashion to the Godfather series, the second movie is better than the original. Arnold gives a brilliant performance and shows why he is the best action star in hollywood. There is a good supporting cast, but Arnold is what makes the movie. Arnold travels back in time and has now been \\"reprogrammed\\" to be a good terminator. He is the protector of John Connors against a more advanced terminator. Sarah Connors (Linda Hamilton) plays a much tougher role than in the first movie, but she gives a good performance. The special effects are great and so are the action sequences. I recommend that you go to Universal Studios and check out the Terminator 3d show. It is the bomb. It got me very pumped up about T3. Lets hope Linda Hamilton will come back to T3, but if she doesn't, its okay because Ah-nuld is back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware - May or may not work with your player","review":"Even with the latest firmware update to my 3 month old Pioneer Elite BDP-05FD Blu-ray player, the disc will not play the movie's video - only the audio. This is my second Pioneer Elite blu-ray player, the first one purchased two years ago, so I'm familiar with blu-ray's iphone-like need for constant software upgrades. All my other blu-ray discs play perfectly, and it's all playing on a Runco VX-22d 3-chip 1080p projector, so that's not the problem. I think it's inexcusable that a disc is distributed that won't work on a modern higher-end system, much less a more mainstream system. Sometimes a company can get a little too cute with pushing the envelope on specification reqirements, and I think that's what we have here. A complete waste of time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"It kicks a** man!!","review":"It has a good story line whick is expressed when the main characters are driving as far from the city as possible. The special effects were trully awesome and both of the actors that played terminators did the job really well. The script was pretty good, but could have been better. I could still see the movie again and again, never getting bored of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"DTS is incredible!","review":"Anyone that thinks it's hard to distinguish between Dolby Digital and DTS is in need of a hearing check and this DVD proves it! I've owned and enjoyed the previous DD release but it never came close in terms of accuracy and punch that the DTS edition provides. If you have the right equipment, compare the beginning battle scene when a terminator is walking into the picture from the right, blasting away at everything in sight and suddenly turns to fire at the audience. It's good with DD but you'll want to duck and avoid serious head trauma with the DTS version! And that's just one example of countless kidney-jarring scenes. I personally can't wait until more Sci-fi films are released in DTS! Incredible!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a instant classic","review":"Terminator 2 is a movie packed with action and I bought one from Amazon,the sound was really great with thx 5.1 sound and the picture was just so sharp you will want to discard your LD and vhs version of this film.but one thing I do not understand is why didn't the studio add in extra cut scence into the dvd?

This is bar far the best DVD package put together to date. Not only is T2 a classic movie, which includes great action, amazing effects, a well written script and Schwarzenegger at his best; but also a great menu system, outstanding extras and 3, YES 3 versions of the great film on offer (the third is a Easter egg, so you'll have to choose title 3 while the film has been started and you'll get the extra, extra extended version).I won't go into the story as everybody knows the score, but this is probably James Cameron's best work to date, a truly great film, which has not been effected by time. What are you waiting for, go and buy it now."},{"rating":"1","title":"An \\"Apology\\" Release? Really??","review":"These guys have a lot of nerve releasing yet another version of T2 in Blu-Ray. The first had no business being in Blu-Ray format with a picture quality squarely on par with any old vanilla DVD you could find in the bargain bin at your local convenience store. Bye-bye $30...Now they've come back to us with another Blu-Ray release that's ostensibly the \\"clearest T2's ever been,\\" demanding another $20 from each of us for the privilege. Hello? You seriously expect me to pay a total of $50 for what I *should* have gotten for my original $30? Seriously? Where do you people get the stones?Tell you what... I'll wait until this version ends up in the bargain bin before I bend over and squeal like a pig for you again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really good...","review":"The original Terminator was quite good.

Potential problems.","review":"I have gotten two copies of this DVD, and both have had the same problems. On certain scenes, the DVD will go back and repeat the previous scene and get stuck in an endless loop unless you skip the scene entirely. Meaning there are some scenes you don't even get to see! I recommmend getting the regular version of the DVD and not the \\"Ultimate\\" edition. The extra material really isn't all that good anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terminator 2-- the most over-rated sequel ever.","review":"I still fail to comprehend why people say that this is the best Terminator movie, especially now that there are two other Terminator movies that are better. Putting Linda Hamilton's exceptionally poor performance (and I won't even get started on Eddie Furlong), this movie offers nothing but show-off special effects sequences that, by today's date, are no longer impressive. The liquid metal man looks like a windows 95 screen saver. I understand that this film was revolutionary for its time, but it certainly doesn't hold up to the second sequel as far as special effects or story go. Which leads me this: why is the story in T-2 so elementary? And why does the Terminator \\"feel?\\" I swear, there was once a day when James Cameron wasn't so damned Hollywood. What a terrible move."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware!!","review":"Do not buy this Blu Ray if you own a Samsung BD-P1400! Even with the most recent firmware update, the disc will not load!

If you care about a proper presentation of this modern classic, avoid this (at least) fourth DVD release due primarily to the lackluster transfer. This thing heads up all the BD sales here on Amazon, there's a good reason it's so heavily discounted. You will get what you pay for. A great movie, yes, but certainly not a showpiece for your home entertainment setup. And the bare bones aspect of the release isn't a saving grace.Lions Gate, step up and release a version worthy of the source, for this and T1. Amazon, jumbling up these product reviews is just dirty. Two stars for this release, I'm guaranteeing five for the eventual proper release... which will be a my quadruple-dip on this title. They won.

But T2 certainly accomplishes that. Its just as powerful and entertaining as the first, and the effects are incredible for that time. I'm in awe of it today.

I understand wanting the best disc format for this film, but that is no good if it won't play."},{"rating":"1","title":"T2 polished image lacks grit, humanity of original","review":"Terminator 2: Judgement Day abandoned what made the original Terminator a landmark sci-fi movie. T2 is bereft of the original's gritty, breakneck terror. Instead, James Cameron decided to go for style over substance. The result: an empty-headed special effects juggernaut with a plot of clay feet. Instead of Arnold coming back from the future as the villian, this time he is the beefed-up robotic protector of humanity's future rebel leader. The T9000 prototype cyborg is an incredible special effect (with its eye-popping shape-shifting abilities) and steals the show. So who cares about Linda Hamilton or Edward Furlong and the human side of the story. Everyone's so hyped for machine vs. machine that we forget about any semblance of a story. Maybe T2's a metaphor for society itself: we've abandoned our humanity (it's good and bad)for the flawless, cold precision of machines."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality but it takes a while to load","review":"Good quality for a remastered movie and very good audio but it takes a while to load the disc as it always try to connect to the Internet to \\"activate\\" some content (not worthy).

It is one of the few movies where the sequel is better than the original. This is definitely James Cameron's best work ever (Yes, better than the almighty Titanic), and is improved even more from the VHS version to DVD. The plot is great, and it keeps you at the edge of your seat the entire time. My only gripe is that the entire movie is set at night.

The FX are true eye candy. the storyline is great, and the actors bring it all to life! All they needed was to give the T-1000 more scenes (since he is one of the best reasons to see this movie) and it would have earned a perfect score!

This is probably due to the sound processesing that you are able to hear when you use the PSP earbuds.

The bluray movie is excellent, the menus are quite interesting, it has certain touches that makes it better than the DVD versions.

It looks VERY \\"toyish\\" with some very poor black paint wash applications. Light up eyes feature is a tad bit cool...sound effects are annoying and too loud at best.#2 All the extra bonus special feature discs and extra \\"director's cut\\" discs (aside from the actual blu-ray film disc) are just DVDs...that's right...JUST DVDs. The studio just decided this is a strategic way of getting rid of their overstock of what they've previously released in the past. They couldn't even transfer all of this to blu-ray?

Even though the movie was a low budget one, we see Cameron in his prime, directing at his best wih whatever material he possesses. Very well written and very good effects for the time. But when T2 came out, everybody expected Arnold to reprise his role as the assassin and when things seem to reverse themselves with the first famous \\"Get Down!\\" of the movie, we know that we are in for amazing ride. The ILM effects team went overboard and it was worth it. Not only did they create a visual smorgasboard of the most amazing special effects of 1991, they also helped to raise the standards of special effects to what they are at present. The movie itself is very satisfying, great action leading to a fantastic showdown in the steel mill. I recommend it to anybody who hasn't already seen it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where's the Long Cut?","review":"Excellent film....truly a sci fi classic. But where is the director's cut? Like 'The Abyss' and 'Aliens,' some of Cameron's best work shows through in the extended versions of the film. In T2, there is a scene in which young Connor tries to teach the Terminator how to smile....one of the best scenes ever, that deserves to be put back in! Save your dough and wait for the long cut!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!!","review":"This movie was very good. Though the story was a bit lame...the usual \\"human kind is gonna die, someone needs to save it\\", the action was fast paced and very fullfilling. The main character, the terminator, needed no special acting skills other than one expresion (good thing for Arnold). Just one thing...its one of those paradox things...If they prevented the future from happening the way they did, then how did the terminator come back in time if they never exsisting? The DVD format did the movie justice. It brought out the color and effects the VHS version could not. The sounds and explotions were mush more well defined also. END"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terminator 2","review":"Unlike many sequels this one lived up to the original with some added super special effects. The characters in this film were very much more developed and the special effects did not overwhelm the story. You see that Sara Conner has become in many ways Kyle from the first film and no longer the naive waitress from the first film. The orginal terminator has also developed more fully as is the character of the new liquid metal terminator. There is a little of everything to satisfy audiences: action, special effects and characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"T2 on blu-ray is AWESOME!","review":"Admittedly this is one of my favorite movies.

It arrived in only 2 weeks and I was excited as soon as I recieved the postal slip to pick it up. Wow! It is just simply the ultimate in both picture and sound. The DTS soundtrack sounds loud and clear and gives the listener an extreme feeling of presence. There is the theatrical show and the special edition which I had never seen before, another great bonus. The menus are huge with alot of added extras to be explored. It has not been taken out of the DVD tray, nor will it be, and acts as a demo for sound enthusiasts. DTS is awesome.

It has great action, good effects, and is funny at times. 3 movies on 1 disc is great, it allows you to have more control over the time of the movie, and what scenes you like or not. It's great, but the only thing that I don't like about this one, is that it's not all just about running from the terminator like the first one was, and in this one Arnold isn't a killer..... :'("},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great movie!","review":"I have received this DVD today.

I have a 1.1 player by design, as I have no intention of ever hooking anything in my HT up to the internet (it is completely closed circuit, and will remain that way). BDLive is reserved for stuff like current trailer downloads, and community screening nonsense. The stuff already on the disc, like commentaries and featurettes should play regardless of any internet connection. This is merely Liongate's way of mining marketing information by tracking what features are viewed so they can sell me more crap. It is also their way of insuring that they maintain control over when and where I watch it (if their server goes down, I'm out of luck). This is the absolute last Lionsagte product I will ever buy until they wake up and realize that they do not maintain ownership of this disc after the purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Make sure that your Blu-Ray player can handle the Skynet Edition","review":"I recently bought the Terminator 2: Skynet Edition (from another retailer) and even though my player was made after this Blu-Ray was released and has all the current updates this is the only Blu-Ray that won't load up.All I get is a black screen even after sitting in the player for over six minutes.So while the movie is terrific, the Blu-Ray disc itself gets a 1 since it won't even load. I'll hold onto it just in case sometime in the future I get another brand of Blu-Ray player that can play this disc.So I would say rent this first to see if your player can handle it or not.

It's a shame that she hasn't released new music in the last years. If you like a nice sample of pop and latin balad, Amanda is a choice. She has better discs, but there are some very nice tracks like \\"Esto se llama amor\\" \\"Amame una vez mas\\" and \\"Duende\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great romantic album","review":"Amanda Miguel's sweet voice has the ability to stir emotions. Amame una Vez Mas (La Ultima Luna) is my favorite song on this c.d. It is hopeful and heart-lifting. Media Hora is another great song. Amanda comes across as more of a young, flirtatious girl in this song, but it's a cute one. This album is definitely enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST-BUY!!! TIENES QUE COMPRARLO!!!","review":"For the lovers out there, you don't have to speak Spanish to feel Amanda's emotions in every one of her songs. She's been blessed with great vocals and a good team of writers, composers, producers (including her husband, Diego Verdaguer), etc. Buy this DC and try to learn song #6 - Media Hora - believe me, if you want to be romantic with your significant other, this song will do it for you.

Perhaps the software had a malfunction, but there was no help key, and no means by which to go from window to another. After 2 hours, we gave up.

My kids much prefer Lego chess to this."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 year old gets it just fine.","review":"My 5 year old son loves this program. The series seems quite effective at teaching chess.

They are also both very computer savy. I bought this program to buff up their chess playing skills and stategy, but they say they find it boring and don't think it has anything to do with playing chess because the game pieces and boards look nothing like the traditional game pieces. The characters are very difficult to identify and confusing, they are cartoon renditions dressed up in costumes. I'd save your money and look for a better chess program or get your child involved in an actual chess club."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product for kids","review":"This is an excellent product for kids. My kid loves to learn with this software. I had issues installing this product. Other than installation issues, it has been excellent. We are having fun now!I will recommend this title for kids starting on chess!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun way to learn basic chess tactics and strategies","review":"Learn to Play Chess with Fritz and Chesster 2, continues where the first CD left off. Like the first CD, this program may take some guessing regarding what exactly is one supposed to do, and clicking on the crown in the upper right corner helps to navigate through the game.This program is really good for grasping the basic tactics and strategies because your progress is measured and you have to develop certain skill proficiency before moving to higher level and learning more tactics and strategies.The CD covers some popular opening moves, middle game tactics like pins, forks, skewers and deflection, and mating strategies in end game. With practice on this CD, you can begin to win some games, and then move on to Learn to Play Chess with Fritz and Chesster 3, which is out in German, and is supposed to be out soon in English."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real Chess Learning - and fun too!","review":"LOL jokes and cute graphics for parent's and kids to enjoy together! This game builds on the first one. It also has much of what the first one has - it really incorporates a wonderful storyline, humor and lots of little games to teach kids sophisticated chess techniques. Grade A+ - Tons of replayability."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be titled \\"How to Stay Broke on Minimum Wage\\"","review":"Mr.Steamer's suggestions imply that in order to become a millionare, one must be essentially perfect and alone- that is, having no health problems, minimal bills, no family, and find the cheapest place to live. I think it can be assumed that if one were to live alone and have perfect health in the cheapest city in the world and not spend their money on frivelous things, they too could be a millionare. Personally, I would rather sacrifice the millions of dollars that James Steamer claims I can make, and rather have a family, accept my imperfect health (and treat it with the backing of health insurance), and spend money on fast food or an occassional movie once in awhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great garage album","review":"This is a garage band on Estrus Records (one of the greatest garage labels). Long defunct, I believe. This particular album (one of three they put out)is so good I've been listening to it regularly for about a fifteen years. \\"Disintegration\\" has been covered by a lot of bands, but the original is here and it's far better than the other versions. They do a fantastic cover of The Osmond Brothers' famous (and career-ending) psychedelic tune, \\"Crazy Horses\\". 16 songs, all of them iPod-worthy. Highly recommended. I rate this four stars because I think something has to be Abbey Road-level great to warrant 5, but if I was just using the garage genre as the grading curve it'd be five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good range of complexity covered","review":"This seems suitable for all levels of undergraduate calculus. The explanations of high school or 1st semester calculus are reasonably succint and clear. I will be commencing multivariate calculus shortly and coverage seems adequate for that as well. There are truly a vast number of problems so I find it helpful for reviewing earlier subjects in preparation for my next course.I strongly recommend the Kindle version (which only works on the iPad or computer please note) as it is a fascimile of the written book but without the weight. I have an ancient hard copy by my bed as well...No big textbook for maths is perfect but I rarely get frustrated with this one, it would be my recommendation after I have been trying a few."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for home study","review":"I found \\"Calculus with Analytic Geometry\\" 5th edition by Howard Anton to be useless for home study. I spend a great deal of time referring to other text. \\"Advanced Mathematics A Precalculus Course\\" by Richard G. Brown and David P.Robbins has been very helpful. I found there is not enough examples or explanations. I found explainations before the examples, not hints with them, more useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"It teaches you what other college calculus books don't.","review":"In taking the whole calculus sequence, teachers have pretty much forced me to buy a calculus book with every new class I took. I bought Anton's Calculus With Analytic Geometry for my first calculus class ever and throughout the following courses, I have always relied on it to explain to me what isn't explained in other calculus textbooks. It is not only a classic, but in my opinion, it's the best there is on the subject.By the way, the companion's books written by James E. Ward, are also great books. They take the reader into greater depth in understanding Anton's examples and explanations. These books are money well invested if you are serious about learning calculus, over time they will always have a special place in your library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anton is superb!","review":"I have used Anton's Calculus texts off and on from the first edition. He is far and away the best writer I've ever used. Particularly helpful is the way topics in a chapter flow one into another.It is always difficult for 3-semester or 4-quarter courses to decide on a sequence of topics. Anton's choices in the fifth edition are different from what I would prefer, but they are acceptable to many programs. Regardless, he is again strong on the many ways he encourages and develops his readers' intuitive understanding of fundamental calculus ideas. My own students have actually come to believe that they can READ a calculus text because of Howard Anton."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very well book, good explainations","review":"I am currently using this book for AP Calculus AB and I found out that this book has very detailed explanation of examples and all concepts. Well sometimes it is a bit too wordy, lol. Very well for self learners. I bought this book personally and also using the school textbook Calculus graphically, numerically and algebractly by Finney. Personally, I feel this book is better than the school one since it actually have detailed explanations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well written","review":"Definitely a good calculus book.

Firstly, the soundtrack is horrendous - a piercing, ferociously screeching mess...if the composer was trying to relay Van Gogh's angst and madness, he suceeded more so in annoyance, when at times the music overshadowed and drowned out the dialogue. The story, although delivering passionate exchanges between the two brothers, flatlines in character development - it is mostly devoid of warmth, failing to draw the viewer in to the soul of the brothers Van Gogh...one is left feeling pity for the pathetic dysfunction, rather than empathy for Van Gogh's passionate longing, joy and despair.... i have said for years that no one has yet portrayed Van Gogh's life properly in film, and i will continue to have this opinion until some talented filmmaker (with brilliant composer in tow) does justice to this enigmatic and misunderstood artist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother.","review":"If you have an interest in painting or painters don't waste your time or money on this beautifully photographed but dull & trivial video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Going to the Top!","review":"This group has awesome potential.

Secondly, the travels were easy to follow because many of the communities mentioned still exist to this day!! One could use it as a travel guide, if you're adventurous enough.Anyway, no matter how romantic John Ford may have made cavalry life seem, I think it was a grinding existance, and I'm glad I' a 20th or 21st century traveler! Sometimes tedious, but always interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"dodgy PH claims + could biased reviews be due to MLM system!?","review":"I saw this amateur video of testing Nikken's water and PH of water from different sources.What puzzled me was how does adding some water from the nikken bottle to an already acidic water to change its PH is supposed to gives us a more pure water??! It's obvious that a chemical reaction is taking place (otherwise the water PH in the glass wouldn't change). So in fact we're changing the water PH by adding more chemicals to the existing chemicals of a tap water.Also be mindful of the fact that since it's an MLM company there's probably a lot of incentive for its members to give it rave unscientific reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"If it seems too good to be true it probly is","review":"I wish I had known that the products from this seller are greatly reduced because they are similar to but not exactly as seen in the photograph.

But the company was extremely gracious in offering a refund and explaining the discrepances to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird?! Not worth it!","review":"Overall the system is easy to use once you get it all assembled. I had a hard time believing a lot of the Nikken claims to this. My kids all thought it tasted weird.

When looking for Customer Service help on their website, there's no trouble shooting or company email available and no one answered the phone when I called.To top it off all of the parts are plastic and Nikken couldn't be bothered to put a recycle symbol on any of them.

Definatly a great soundtrack, and is reccommended to EVERYBODY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck.","review":"I listened to this soundtrack with high hopes, after hearing \\"The Last Crusade\\", but, to be honest, this one is awful. The \\"Temple of Doom\\" music is dreadful and just sounds, well, evil. I don't like to listen to it. The mine cart music was so bland, I kept waiting for it to start, but it never did. \\"Anything Goes\\"-This one may be a classic and all, but I was never a fan of sung music and I find it impossible to listen to. Oh well. At least the listening to the soundtrack is better than watching the movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An instant Pick-Me-Up","review":"When ever I need a boost,be it going to work or to force me to go out,I listen to this album.

I rented it and I think I am going to demand my rental fee back because of the bugs.Not only buggy but WHY ON EARTH do you get Hot Topic bands to do horrible covers of classic songs !!!! With the cash this series has made over the years they should have kept the tracks as original artists only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really not very good and this is why...","review":"The first complaint about this game is that skating seems to have taken a back seat to BMXing and er... walking around a bit. It seems like you spend more time off the board doing idiotic things like spraypainting a wall than you do on the board doing combos.Secondly, where are the female skaters? The 'hero' is an uncharismatic, generic guy. No choice to be female in story mode.Thirdly, the schoolboy laughs are just wearing very thin. Here's a tip, Tony, 'impressing hot chicks with your movez' does not a story make.This really isn't a very good game. The THUG games were better and the THPS games better still. In fact, I'd say forget it all, go out and buy Aggressive Inline.

No more customization of characters in story mode? Glaringly worse, no more ability to be a girl in story mode? (yes, there are female fans out there..I know I'm not the norm, but throw me a bone...I don't get the point of removing it from a game) First 20+ missions forcing a character to \\"learn skills?\\" Poorly animated gray screen is subistitution for much hyped \\"no load screen\\"?Come on, Neversoft...moves like this insult and alienate your fan base."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Like the Undergrounds","review":"Based on the name and when you see this game in commercials, it looks like an awesome, revolutionary, perfect 10 type of game. But, it turns out it's just another pathetic version of the THUG games. Everything is the same, except the levels (which are small and stupid) and the dumb bmx bike (which has very bad handling). Not to mention the missions that you do are very easy, short and boring. The only thing you do is skate around, look for somebody and they tell you to do a 1500 point combo over something. I'm not exaggerating, that's really all you do! Look for people, do a trick or two, and that's it. I beat the game in 2 1/2 hours. So if your expecting some outrageously fun, spectacular skateboading game, don't look here. I don't recommend this game to anybody, honestly. I was seriously disappointed, and I guarantee that you will be too if you buy this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad examples and images for teens","review":"I was shocked by this game.

I won't name the other brand, but I had probably less than a 1% failure rate with them. My store was out of them, so I bought a spindle of these so-called Digital Versatile Discs. I needed to burn 2 copies of 2 different DVDs I'd authored. I now have the 4 burned DVDs and 6 other DVDs that failed to burn. That's 10 tries to get 4 to burn properly! That's a 60% failure rate.Why did I keep burning discs when they kept failing? Because I have a client on his way over to pick them up. When failure is not an option you keep burning the discs until you get four to work. Luckily I am a long standing customer with my supplier, and I should get a full refund.I SHALL NOT purchase any Maxell products again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Maxell I remember","review":"I've used Maxell cassettes and VHS tapes over the years with no problems.

These were on sale so I picked up two 50pk. spindles. I only had one bad burn (my fault...pressed eject by accident)...so, a 99% success rate. I used three different burners Matsui, Lite-On and Plextor, all at slow speeds, 1x, 2x & 4x - no problems. BTW, burning discs at fast speeds doesn't always come out right. The copies play fine on my Pioneer DVJ-X1 decks, computer and home DVD player. The gold/mustard color isn't bad either as it stands out: Bling-bling!I don't know if they'll last as long as my Verbatim discs, but only time can tell.If you're on a budget, these seem like a good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"You might as well flush your money down the toilet","review":"You might as well flush your money down the toilet than waste it on this pack of DVD-R discs from Maxell; at least there is a possibility of enjoying the aesthetics of money ride down the plumbing.

It consists of Schweitzer's medical case histories, travels, hospital administrative chores, reflections on African and European culture, and general overview of his first decade and a half in Gabon on the west coast of Africa. Schweitzer's candid comments about the Africans and the harsh conditions under which he worked help make this book better than the average account of third world philanthropic endeavors.

A compelling read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too technical","review":"After just finishing Herbert's Santaroga Barrier and jumping straight into this one, I had high expectations, especially after reading others' reviews. Throughout the book I found there was FAR too much time given to detail - latches, levers, knobs, control panels, etc... Unless you're someone who's served aboard a nuclear sub, it's impossible to paint a mental picture of what was going on half the time in this book. And the ending was.. well, not much of a bang. I was expecting a big 'twist' - something I'd never expect, which never happened. On the plus side, it did have some interesting philosophical views which Herbert is good at. The characters were somewhat enjoyable, and there was some good suspense at times. But overall I found that too much emphasis was given to the workings of the submarine, and the climax was a bit bland.I would suggest watching the movie \\"Das Boot\\" over reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ups and Downs","review":"I love Manowar, but Amazon was really not on the ball at all with this order.

But they have some good songs and can play it an inimitable sloppy, fast, over the edge sort of way. The lyrics are worthy of Ed Wood but ya know, there's something appealing about them. There's an honesty. And when they're on, they rock pretty damn hard. The problem with MOW is that they have no definitive album. There's a few songs on this album and some good moments on that album but it never all came together for them. I think that's what they were trying to do here. What a disaster. Again, some good moments, but not nearly enough to sustain interest. Every other song is bogged down with some lame pitch deepend narration. The \\"orchestration\\" is really just samples. My guess is that even the choirs are sampled this time out. MOW fell in love with technology and lost their way.

Lot's of intros and talking ... and the worst is that the intros sound like a cheap electric organ, no intros with plain guittar and with eric entering the song in a magestic way ... only choruses of repeated voices... this album is terrible, worst of manowar by far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Personal favorite of Manowar's","review":"Time is short so I'm not saying much.Manowar's other albums have left me somewhat flat, it's decent metal yes, but it's not really what I love from metal bands.Gods of War, however, does.

He lives in a world of delusion - and constantly ignores social cues and even being removed by security from the property - only to return again. A pathetic character actually. In this story - he has spent much of his adult life creating a comedy set - yet never goes out to even one club to work on it, Very unrealistic - I am a stand-up comic - and I know it can take years to develop a set and refine it. Sandra what's her name is in this too - and there is NO follow up as to what happened to her character. I won't spoil it for you - I will say this film starts off twisted - and only twists some more.

That sense of painful embarrassment pervades throughout the entirety of \\"The King of Comedy.\\"It's a difficult film to applaud, but it's even more difficult to damn. \\"The King of Comedy\\" is one of those films that weeds out the less vigilant viewers among us. It's the story of an obsessive going after his desire--a career in comedy? Or just a moment of recognition?--in the most manic and unsympathetic ways possible. And it does so in meticulous (or you might say: slow) fashion. I felt that watching through to the end paid off--for me, the ending made the whole thing worth it.

I only wish that Jerry had played more such roles!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Scorsese's best","review":"This is one of the most underrated films of the 80s and easily one of the best, also. In a decade in which Scorsese made more ostentatious films (Raging Bull and The Last Temptation of Christ), as well as more commercially viable projects (The Color of Money), it is easy to see how his most low-key and perhaps most challenging picture went ignored upon release. It's now finally getting its due. I know many people who prefer The King of Comedy to Taxi Driver, and while I don't think it's quite that brilliant, it is a perfect compliment to that masterpiece. Worth seeing solely for the performances of DeNiro (who deserved another Oscar for his work here as Rupert Pupkin), Lewis, and Bernhard. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like \\"Curb your enthusiasm\\" - the king of comedy is for you","review":"so awkward and unpleasant, it will rivet you.

Rather unusal casting of DeNiro as an eccentric loser, but he makes it work. Jerry Lewis is perfectly uptight and unlikable as the comedy king. But it is Sandra Bernhard who really steals the show from both of them! Whether she's shouting her outrage and disgust at Rupert (\\"You're a constant embarrassment to me!\\") or performing a striptease down to her underwear before a bound and gagged Lewis, she is way over-the top! The whole film has a wicked black humor that really bites!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of DeNiro's best!","review":"I had seen almost all of the DeNiro/Scorcese films before renting this, and to be honest, I hadn't heard much about this film other than Jerry Lewis' performance. My reaction can be summed up with one word: Wow. DeNiro is stunning. After all the tough guy roles he's had, all the various oddball types, his portrayal of Rupert Pupkin is totally unique and brilliantly done. I was surprised to find Sandra Bernhard here, and by the end was mesmerized by her performance. Then there was Jerry Lewis, filling a role very similar to Johnny Carson's tonight show persona. This film is so good, it made me like JErry Lewis enough that I might watch the Labor Day telethon. Before this, I was either apathetic or turned off by his work. Here, he was nothing short of amazing. Rent this movie today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun","review":"King of Comedy is a howlingly funny movie. Robert De Niro is perfect; who knew he could do comedy, though this move is far more a character study than slapstick or standup routine. Jerry Lewis is also wonderful as the slightly tired, seen-it-all, autumn-of-his-career late-night chat show host, beset by his fans, and fanatics.

There are richly developed characters, including the peasant boy, Miguel, who she's grown up with, but who is now an equal, rather than a servant.I found the story educational- this is a part of American history that most everyday Americans know little about.

The book is beautifully written, and actually gives us a peek into a life in Mexico that is not known or common. Before I read this book I had no idea (in the 1924 time period)that there were princesses like Esperanza whos dads own huge ranches and make tons of money. Esperanza shows her love for family, her love for the earth, and most of all, HOPE. Esperanza lives up to her name in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest Book I Have Ever Read!","review":"Esperanza Rising by Pam Munoz Ryan is a wonderful book. It tells about a girl who goes through tragedies. I liked how it told all the things that she was facing. It made me feel sad for her. I also liked how it told about how she tries her hardest to care for her mother.It's sad in the rest of the story because she has a loss, and in the middle she also has a loss. Even though, I still would read it over and over again.The theme is probably how to deal with tragedies in life because it tells about her sad life.It's intense, cute, and a classic. I would recommend it for girls. I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love!","review":"I read this as part of my graduate studies in children's literature--loved it!

So Esperenza, her mother, and her kind servants have to run away to California to get a job because their friends live there.They have to go because Esperenza's uncle is very cruel and will kill them if Esperenza's mother does not marry him.In California, they live in a camp for Mexican migrant workers.On the farm,their work is to peel potatoes, pick cotton,and many other tasks.I would give this a five star rating because Esperenza is the kind of girl who never gives up. This 253 page book has long chapters, but every one of them is action-packed.Even though the main character of this book is a girl, I can see a boy reading it and not thinking it is girlish because there are boys in the story too.

I loved how it showed the young girl's feelings and emotions completely. The story itself was interesting, and it gave the reader an opportunity to experience life during the 1930's for a specific group of people in very hard times. I loved getting to learn more about the Depression era from the point of view of an immigrant. The fact that they came from wealth and were taken to poverty just adds so much more to the story line. It happened to many people. You can really feel the ups and downs of the characters as they go through their trials, because the author's writing abilities are fantastic.

Girl realizes all she ever needed to be happy was her family, not material wealth. The End. That sums up the book. Esperanza is an entirely unlikable and unrealistic character.

The actor who played Nico did a good job. Nora was a little over the top. The death scenes were not believable. I did not believe that the victims were fighting for their lives. I would actually give this movie 2.5 stars.

It teams up Eddie Murphy & Steve Martin for the first time, and I'm sure not for the last. Martin plays his typical likeable part, this time as a B-film maker, and Murphy as Hollywood's hottest action heroes, and also his not so successful brother. Murphy is brilliant in both of his roles and steals the show, playing his best part since The Nutty Professor. The film is worth watching for the simple insane looks Murphy gives as his core character of Kit Ramsy, who believe that aliens are actually following him. To add to the film, Martins character decides to make a film (which Kit Ramsy does not know about), where aliens are in fact following Murphy.

He convinces them that he has gotten action star (Kit Ramsey) Eddie Murphy to star in his small time film Chubby Rain. Satires of the movie industry are done so well via the pompus movie exexutive (Jerry Kenfro) Robert Downey Jr. Bowfinger exploits Ramsey's phobia of conspiracy by meeting him at chance locations with his film crew to film him hysterically. The concept is that Martins crew is told this is the only way Kit Ramsey will work. Murphy also plays Ramseys goofy nerdy brother who is hired as Ramseys double. Good work by Murphy and Steve Martin is in great form with his usual clever lines. The movie Chubby Rain is so horrible you can't beleive it's actually being filmed this way.

He works with a devoted group of equally down-on-their-luck actors, headlined by the brilliant Christine Baranski. Desperate to make a film, he devises a scheme to use the hot action star Kit Ramsey (Eddie Murphy) without Ramsey actually being in the film. To say much more would give the laughs away, but a dog in high heels, spoofs on Scientology, Heather Graham's innocent (or is she?) actress just of the bus from Ohio, and Martin's terrific spoofing of Hollywood, all combine for one funny ride.

The nerdy brother of the film star is quite annoying and the film star just rants and runs. Steve Martin is constantly telling stupid lies throughout the movie which for the most part are unfunny. The movie promotions staff were smart to not waste money selling this movie in the theatre's.

Though Harrison Ford finds out that his wife was having an affair with Kristin Scott Thomas' husband he keeps looking for something. Scenes in this movie come out of no where. This movie is incredibly boring and is not worth watching at all. When I finished this movie I thought I had been sitting there for 4 hrs. The only good thing about this movie is that it ends. Using Leonard Maltin's scale I would give this movie BOMB meaning this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I would not give this movie any stars except I can't do that with the field. So I have to type BOMB."},{"rating":"1","title":"LOSER","review":"I'm not disppointed because Ford did this movie and I only'like him as an action charcter. No way.

I was planning on finding out about the secret life of their partners and why the affair started. When it took nearly 45 minutes just for the two widows to find out their partners were dead, I knew I was in trouble.This movie was not worth sitting through, and more than once I reached for the stop button. However,I figured I'd already invested enough time that it was worth finishing it, but just barely.If you want to see this movie, do not plan on seeing something exciting (as the preview suggests), make sure you are in the mood for a love story-which is way too long for its own good."},{"rating":"1","title":"so dull it's painful","review":"I was not expecting much when i went to see this movie but it turned out to be so dull and lifeless I found my self wanting to walk out of the theater.

Ford and the main actress exhibit the same colorless expresions and acting throughout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn!","review":"This movie looked good; good soundtrack, the actors appeared mismatched... both were dry and boring...I could understand why their partners had affairs...i wish we could have spent time getting to know the passion between the deceased partners first, before they were killed off... they seemed more interesting. I like Harrison in action movies, because he is more believable. Hollywood is always searching for that \\"Grace Kelly\\" cool in leading women.Ms. Scott-Thomas was a bit too cool to the point of ice....And men like that?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Performance By Kristen Scott Thomas","review":"This movie is very dark and unrelentlessly depressing, but it is worth watching one time because of Kristen Scott Thomas's performance. She is great at playing the part of an emotionally repressed widow who has found out her husband was having an affair. I think it is good that a movie has been made that is trying to be different from all the other movies currently being made, but this movie is just not very good. The whole storyline about the dirty cop that Harrison Ford is trying to track down just doesn't blend with the movie, and it made absolutely no sense in the movie. I hope a better movie dealing with an unusual romance will be made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Random Hearts","review":"This movie is the reason there should be ZERO STAR rating at Amazon. I am quite sure Random Hearts is the worst movie I've ever seen. Certainly the worst movie ever made with a mega-star like Harrison Ford.Uninspired script, frenetic story line, pathetic performances all combine to make the audience wish that ALL of the characters had gone down in the plane crash together and spared us all the next two hours of agony. I really feel like I wasted part of my life watching this one.

There's alot of dialoge and very little action. The subplot about a corrupt cop is distracting and the only thing in this movie thats random.

No matter how talented an actor is...they can not save a movie with a bad story. The whole story behind Random Hearts is totally unbelievable.

Unless you are a diehard Harrision Ford fan and you want this to add to your collection.....Rent this first!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Two Thumbs Down - Gene Siskel, The Daily Pearly Gate","review":"A movie so bad that even Gene Siskel had to reach out from beyond the grave to give a two thumbs down. I first saw it on HBO and quickly wrote them a note saying it was the first time I'd wish they had commercials. My favorite part is a line that Kristen Scott Thomas says about an hour and a half into the movie. She says \\"I've found it\\" - I was praying it was the plot but no such luck. The best part of this movie is clearly the end - but that I mean the credits - you finally know this regrettable show is finally over. If you are unfortunate enough to see this movie, in the last two hours and fifteen minutes of your life whisper \\"Random Hearts\\" to those around you - you'll beg for this time back. I'd suggest if you interested in seeing something more exciting try watching paint dry.Amazon is too kind allowing a 1 star minimum - If this movie is anything celestial it would have to be \\"space junk\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dull and Boring Movie","review":"I rented this video after I saw a trailor of this movie which seemed interesting. But, the movie is very boring. It doesn't have a plot to begin with. The direction and screen play was bad. I was just waiting for the flashback of the other couple (the central charactors for the rest of the story) which never happened. Instead the script steers away to love between the main artist(its really random). It is sick. Stay away from this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give Her a Star","review":"Ford has often been given interesting and exciting roles, but he has never been an interesting or exciting actor. He always looks surprised at his success, and I'll bet he really is. The 'why me?' syndrome is written all over his face - when there's any believable expression there at all. But he's actually worse here than in anything else I've seen him in. (Admittedly, his part is that of a hopeless jerk, which doesn't help.)Scott-Thomas is always wonderful, even in this, but rarely can she lift a mediocre film up all by herself. As Mr. Winslow says in \\"The Winslow Boy\\", it's a \\"forlorn quest.\\" The second star is for her. If Amazon offered a zero star option, this would rate one star.There's one long scene of a conversation between Ford and Scott-Thomas in her Washington home that was obviously shot by each actor on a different day. Ford's body-double must be a more animated actor than Ford because Scott-Thomas plays the scene beautifully."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent movie","review":"This is an excellent movie starring Harrison Ford, Kristin Scott Thomas and Sydney Pollack. It's a little slow only because of what is transpring...but the story line is excellent. I had been looking for this DVD and found it on Amazon. Good movie...good price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie was insulting...","review":"This is the classic case of a big budget movie, with no script. The acting, cinematography, production and initial premise were all superb; but the script was as empty as one could possibly imagine. I was insulted by the sub-plot (\\"Dutch A Cop on the Edge\\"), it was like they were trying to distact men from noticing how bad the rest of the plot was. Also, there was NO romantic chemistry between the two leads (it was like watching two robots kiss)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't waste your money","review":"I like Harrison Ford like most people but, I'm sorry, this movie is bad. It was very slow and there is no point. The whole way through the movie, I was waiting for that thing to happen that would make the whole thing turn out to really be a good movie after all. But it never happened. It was a total waste of money. Harrison could have done much better than choosing that role."},{"rating":"1","title":"ALL I KEPT THINKING WAS WHAT A BIG PEST HARRISON FORD SEEMED","review":"LIKE...AND I'M A FAN OF HIS. The premise was interesting and had potential...two strangers are thrown together after their cheating spouses are killed in a plane crash. But it never went anywhere. Harrison Ford plays a police officer and there is a sub-plot that adds not a thing to the movie. Kristin Scott Thomas is good in her role...much better than Harrison Ford who basicly plays a nudge. Thomas just wants to be left alone...Ford just wants...well...something...closure I suppose. Although why he chooses to look for it in Ms Thomas' Levi's is beyond me. I like both of these actors just look for them in other moveies. This one was a dud."},{"rating":"1","title":"???","review":"I thought something, some kind of big secret, a \\"shock\\" would be discovered, of course more than the affair, or \\"the affair\\" is just for cover something...until \\"the end\\", so I felt lost and empty after seeing this movie. One is a cop, another is a congressman, their wife and husband died together in this horrible way, and they are always so serious...and this film is so serious and cold...it is a thrill style, isn't it? I understand \\"the affair\\" is a serious object to the two alive people, but by this way??? It is not a bad movie, but I couldn't feel satisfied after the director did his job like this. He's given us some wrong implication. I think we should add something into this movie, let the alive people find out some truth we normal people really call \\"truth\\", then the movie will be perfect. 2.5 stars actually."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am not particularly critical, but...","review":"This movie is really terrible. At its heart, Random Hearts lacks a coherent story. Sydney Pollack has tried (with miserble results, I might add) to overlap Ford and Thomas's sordid love affair with her campaign and (even more un-interestingly) an Internal Affairs investigation that Ford is embroiled in. The peripherals are negligible and the core is rotten. On the whole, a blemish on Ford's fine career. Definitely, two thumbs down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Random Hearts","review":"Reading the video box of Random Hearts, I was unwitingly lured into believing it was a mildly interesting intrigue thriller. I could not have been more wrong - in fact, it was possibly one of the worst films I have ever seen. Harrison Ford looked like a tired and dirty old man, Kristin Scott-Thomas was, well, Kristin-Scott Thomas, and there were times when the dialogue was so nauseatingly I struggled to sit through it. It was a tedious, useless and deeply disappointing film, and I strongly warn anyone who is a about to make the same mistake I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is Ford in a Coma during this one?","review":"Man, for the most part, i've always enjoyed Fords movies. And I do still enjoy his stuff. But this one, my god, I couldn't take in enough coffee to stay awake for it. I was very bored during the whole movie. Harrison reminded me of a monotone Priest give a 90 minute sermon. I'd suggest watching Raiders of the lost ark, backwards before watching this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Random Hearts","review":"The DVD came on a timely basis. I just had a chance to watch it yesterday, 12/6/08. The DVD had a bad place about half way through the movie. I guess that's to be expected with a used copy. I will think twice about ordering used in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hands down, the worst film I've seen this year","review":"I couldn't not believe how they portrayed this movie as a mystery. The following is an example of the dialogue you will hear in this 'mystery':Dutch (Harrison Ford's character): \\"I wonder where they did their laundry\\"I couldn't not believe I was actually watching the movie at that point. And I am even more surprised that I had the patience/determination to watch it to its end. Horrible movie. Unfortunately, I have lost a good bit of respect for Harrison Ford for chosing to do this pathetic film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"Whoever talked Harrison Ford into doing this movie did him a great disservice. He actually has only one scene and one look in the entire movie; haunted. He just has to keep doing the same scene over and over. We kept waiting for a plot to unfold but it never did and the wait was interminable. This was a real stinker."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointment!!","review":"I thought this movie was a big disappointment. Harrison Ford plays a widow who finds out his wife was on a plane with her lover when they both die in the crash. He wants to know why his wife had an affair and how could she have lied to him and how long and how serious...blah, blah. All he did was whine the entire movie. Also, he plays a police officer and not a very good one. This movie lacked substance and character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"My husband and I love Harrison Ford movies. So we thought this one would be great too, because we also enjoy Kristen Scott Thomas. This movie lasted about 2 hours and 15 minutes. I think you could have watched the first half hour of the movie and would have gotten as much out of it as watching the whole thing. I think the \\"plot\\" of this movie was \\"drug into the ground\\" way too long. I mean, I would be upset too if my spouse was having an affair, but what can he do, she's gone. You can't get revenge on someone who is no longer there. We were very dissappointed with this movie, after waiting so long for it to come out at the video stores."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rent It First","review":"This movie is the kind that only a few people would actually like. I hired it to see it but it wasn't what I expected for a movie rated in New Zealand as (M + Contains Violence & Offensive Language). I HIGHLY reccomend you hire this first and if you like it, buy it ,otherwise don't. This movie is fairly boring and not even good actors could save it! If you want to see a good movie with Harrison Ford, buy Air Force One! See Ya"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad movie night","review":"This is a movie that you can invite your friends over and make fun. I am a HUGE Harrison Ford fan, but he looked ridiculous in this movie. He definitely was not ready for his close up - There is a close up of him that will make you cringe (earring, dyed hair and all), for he looks every bit his 60-something age. - playing a top cop no less. Kristen Scott Thomas seemed to be in another movie, slipping in and out of an English accent. The music was shockingly dopey. There was NO chemistry between them. The plot and subplot tedious. Need I go on! View for the giggles. Gave two stars for this reason alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock ain't dead; it's in Toronto, Canada....","review":"This record was produced by Greg Oblivian, and the Oblivians influence is quite strong. The Snakes have some seriously good stuff to add to rock music. Lots of the material sounds like Chuck Berry in the garage with a lot of beer and a full backing band. If you like garage blues/rock/punk, buy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stax Soul + Punk Rock + Beer","review":"What a relief to hear a young band playing good straight ahead rock and roll for the fun of it. If you like The Animals, Real Kids, early Stones, Them, Rocket from the Crypt, Detroit Cobras, etc. then you'll like this. Soulful vocals, farfisa organ & horns show off the R&B influence, but they never descend into the corny retro schtick that plagues so many garage type bands. This is good time rock & roll at it's best & the record's almost as much fun as their live show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Question Before Buying","review":"Hi, I would like to know about the speed for reading and writing of the disk drive.Also, tell me about its dimension please."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cutting Edge for Women's Ministry Leaders!","review":"This book is a must for the library of all Women's Ministry Leaders, especially those struggling to express to others why it is so very important to have an active, relevent ministry for women.

The beats are incredible (!) but more importantly, all of the songs take you through the journey of a genuine Christian life. From witnessing (Yes, It is What it Is), to repentance (This Is Me, Hear This), to walking by faith (Faith, Have What You Want)... Kierra and team found a way cater to everyone. I've found that in many \\"young adult\\" gospel albums, there's much high-energy praise and sad songs of repentance for besetting sins, but not a great deal of material that identifies with the lives of young preachers, teachers, evangelists or people who are just decidedly Christian. I appreciate Kierra's ability to keep it real but also \\"let no man despise [her] youth\\" when it comes to being a soldier for the kingdom. Good job."},{"rating":"2","title":"it's like brand new","review":"this cd that i recieved was like new, even though it was supposed to be used. i love the music, and i just couldnt believe the price i paid for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Many Producers, Not enough quality","review":"Kierra first cd was stellar. It was a great sound for a person with such a strong voice in a youthful body. But the new album is a total disappointment. The problem may be that Ms. Sheard has not found her signature sound yet and she has too many producers who have put their sound on her voice. Ms. Sheard's talent is lost in too hype beats and over induced lyrics.I know Kiki is a great talent, I am not downplaying her. But this album does not showcase the skills I know that she has. You may not be happy with this purchase, but it's worth a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"could have been better","review":"I enjoyed Kiki's first album which sounded more like her. I would have to agree with one of the reviews on how this album did not sound like her. It almost sounds as if she is younger than 18. There's a lot of head bobbin' music on this album which I do not particularly like. I wish this album was more of a mixture of sounds like her first album. I heard snippets of all of the songs on my computer through Windows Media Player, and from what I heard, I do not think I want to go out and buy this. I only enjoyed one song which was \\"Why Me.\\" I heard this song on my way to church on the radio and it really touched me because inspite of what I am dealing with in my life right now, God sees all my mess and junk and still loves me. I wish she had that song out on a single, I would definitely go and get it. I hope in the future, that she will work with producers who will bring her sky-cracking voice back.

Please Cartoon Network, Frederator Studios & Warner Bros hear our cry of dislike.I love Adventure time, Why won't you sell me full seasons???EDIT (April 2012):User Mushi has notified me that Season 1 is on the way: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007Q0JJHC"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nope, not falling for it.","review":"I'm not buying ANY of the Adventure Time DVDs unless I know I'm getting entire seasons.KNOW YOUR DEMOGRAPHIC. This show is primarily enjoyed by high school and college students who would rather have the entire season(s) of a program than a few episodes. Also, repeats? Not okay.Not buying this or any of the Adventure Time DVDs until some sort of proper season collection is out. I don't wanna waste my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"at this point you need full seasons...","review":"It is ridiculous that again there is another random selection of episodes from this fantastic show. its not even that the collections arent full seasons...you just are not listening to fans of the show. if you go on the message board on cartoonnetwork.com fans of the show list their favorite episodes and guess which ones are not on the dvd...foolish. if you wont listen to your fans who are you listening to? this collection is missing among others: \\"what was missing\\", \\"fiona and cake\\", and many many other fan favorites. please cartoon network stop showing us your favorites and give us full seasons!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why would you do this?","review":"Is it really that hard to wrap your mind around the concept of releasing an entire season of a show on dvd? Whoever thought that random collections of episodes would sell better than the full seasons is a dingus and needs to be fired from every job ever forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not buying it Cartoon Network","review":"Like many others, I am entirely frustrated that you keep releasing these random collections of episodes. We LOVE the show. Finn and Jake rule! But your DVD compilations SUCK!!! No use saying much else, it's been said already. Release the episodes by season and you'll get my money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Show","review":"This is a great show. The wit is incredible. Would I have preferred a complete season? Of course, but seeing as I have no cable, I will take Adventure Time as I can get it. The show has a minimal timeline, so watching the episodes in the order they are released does not seem so important. My kids and I enjoy the show. The episodes are nice and short, which, in my opinion, helps keep the show entertaining. The 15 minute episode format that cartoon network/adult swim uses allows for some really witty, strange and creative work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take a Stand or this random release series will continue","review":"I love this series....BUT I refuse to buy these DVD collections of random episodes. I would hope that they are reading these comments and will bow to our requests for Complete Season sets. I have been burned in the past by buying the cheapo small collections and then being forced to buy the same episodes over again when an organized set is released. I know that many of these DVDs are being sold to parents for their kids.....but I think they would sell many more if organized collections were being offered. Could it be a money grab or is it just ignorance on the part of the releasing company? In either case, someone should wake up.....How do the real fans of this classic series get noticed and respected?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly","review":"As mentioned in several of the other reviews, Cartoon Network has yet to release a season collection of Adventure Time, despite the fact that the show is now on it's fourth season. I am not a huge fan of the digital-only purchase, I would prefer to hold an actual product in my hand at the end of the day, but Apple's iTunes store has each of the previous seasons available for $19.99, as well as a Season Pass for the current season that updates bi-weekly with new episodes (at the same price.) I am also not a fan of the iTunes proprietary file type (it can basically only be played in iTunes or on Apple devices,) but this is the only season collection of the series that exists to date, to the best of my knowledge. Sadly, Amazon video does not yet offer this series within their instant video collection. If ever they do, I would recommend that over iTunes, just for the accessibility of the file format."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why continue doing this?","review":"Not a review of the show, a review of this lame release.Just release the Season Sets, please. As stated before, this show is enjoyed more by young adults and college students, not 5 year olds. This isn't Dora. We want season sets and are willing to BUY them.But guess what? That demographic is savvy enough to just torrent these episodes and burn their own discs if you don't give them what they want. So please, just let us BUY the season sets for this show.All of what I said applies to Regular Show, too. Catch a clue, Cartoon Network."},{"rating":"1","title":"greed","review":"This DVD gets zero stars (but it will show 1 (one) because it would not let me leave zero. I'm so sick of studios putting out random episodes of cartoons...adult and child alike. It's quite sad when things like this and Yo Gabba Gabba for example, come out with random episodes on scattered DVDs rather than season box sets. Ridiculous.The body of work equals an A-Plus. The DVD delivers a whopping F-Minus (worse than failing)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Release seasons 1&2","review":"With the money they are bilking from parents/customers, they should have released the complete first season by now. All this is doing is fooling people to pick it up or when their kid is screaming at the store for it. I mean, they have enough money. Perhaps they rather that I ignore their DVDs from now on..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a complete season","review":"Stop jerking everyone around CN and release complete season packages instead of double dipping. Until then people will just continue to torrent these episodes."},{"rating":"1","title":"No full seasons? No good review.","review":"This show is great, but these products blow. Every other tv series ever releases full seasons, but this one doesn't because they must hate their fans. Don't buy this crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"in the words of LSP...","review":"What the LUMP is going on around here(insert valley girl accent)?? Can we please stop messing around and just come out with the entire seasons already?? For people that are just curious of all the low ratings it has zero to do with the show its self which is a 5 out of 5 all day its the \\"random episode\\" thing that cartoon network is doing here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aw, what would Finn do?","review":"While this certainly is a disappointment as this product does not satisfy the hardcore fan in terms of it not being a collection of full seasons, I will still get it because I like having the DVD to share with friends. This is my favorite show on TV right now and since everyone can't afford cable, it's nice to be able to share what you find with other animation fans.What makes this, and \\"My Two Favorite People,\\" worth owning is the fact that AT is such a wonderful creation, and the simple lessons it teaches: empathy, friendship, forgiveness, and courage are great to have around for kids and adults alike. I truly wish the Christmas special was on this, as that was a truly amazingly weird episode!Call it Dungeons and Dragons meet Calvin and Hobbes or Rocky and Bullwinkle on acid, buy this DVD and enjoywhat is here!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does anyone have a list of episodes on this DVD?","review":"Just wondering what is on this one.This is a GREAT show.I wish they had all of the seasons together.Low rating due to mix of episodes.5 Stars for the show itself.*************EDIT************I found out what is going to be on this one:The DVD will feature the following episodes:It Came From the NightosphereRainy Day DaydreamWizardPower AnimalEnchiridionSlumber Party PanicThe Real YouMemory of a MemoryPrisoners of LoveCrystals Have PowerBusiness TimeMystery TrainGuardians of SunshineThe MonsterHit ManThe Creeps"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT A FULL SEASON!","review":"This is an awesome show but the dvd is just a mix of episodes from all three seasons. A full season dvd would be much appreciated."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Season 1 or 2, don't buy this","review":"Don't buy it, plain and simple. Don't give them your money until they come out with season box sets. In conclusion, wait"},{"rating":"1","title":"RANDOM EPISODES AGAIN??????","review":"Let me say this right off the bat...I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS SHOW...i haven't seen such a creative show in a loong time and whats best about it is that it does not rely on dirty toilet humor and fart jokes to be funny...it seems a lot of cartoons (Family Guy)use this as a crutch for a lack of ideas. That being said...CAN A GUY GET A COMPLETE SEASON FOR GOB's SAKE!!!!!!!! this random smattering of episodes not only makes NO sense but its annoying as well because the fans have no way of knowing when to expect their favorite episode to be released (if ever). I don't know whose idea this was but it wasn't Pen Wards...i met him at New York Comic Con and asked him exactly that and he said that kind of thing was a total corporate decision..cop out? maybe...but he didn't seem that type to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Episode duplication","review":"Amazing. Even though between this and the other episode compilation, \\"My Two Favorite People\\", Cartoon Network has only released 32 episodes out of 78 existing Adventure Time episodes, they have managed to put 4 different episodes on both compilations.Geez. Cartoon Network, if you're going to release random episode compilations, rather than full season DVDs, how about making each compilation unique?For those who haven't seen the show itself, it's excellent, certainly as evidenced by all the miffed fans reviewing this compilation."},{"rating":"1","title":"We want full seasons. Hear our voice.","review":"I'm not buying this or any of the other compilation DVDs.I've bought the Season 1 DVDs but I refuse to support this random sampling nonsense.The show is up to season 5 now and season 2 isn't even expected to be released until June 4 2013.Get some marketing sense, Cartoon Network. You've got some catching up to do.I've pre-ordered the Season 1 and Season 2 Blu-Rays. They're available for pre-order here on Amazon.We don't want your random assortment of episodes.We want full, unadulterated seasons.If you're going to keep releasing these random episode collections, expect terrible product ratings to keep pouring in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not falling for this either.","review":"I rate this 1 star because it's an insult to my intelligence to try and get me to shell out cash for something that I'll pay for AGAIN once the full seasons are released. Nope. **** you, CN. Have the balls to produce the full season straight up, or else don't. Otherwise, you ain't getting a single dollar from me."},{"rating":"1","title":"0 stars DVD for 5 star show","review":"I know corporations are greed manifested but as consumers we really should show them their limits. I support this channel through loyal viewership and DVD purchases but I got my limits. Picture the cretins in their office deciding to ruin the DVD release of this awesome show so they can squeeze us some more. Jake and Finn wouldn't hangout with them and they've even hung out with the Ice King."},{"rating":"1","title":"This start is for Cartoon Network","review":"I don't know what the math is going on at Cartoon Network but seeing this release and not the Season releases makes me think it isn't good.I love the show but like others have posted, not going to buy this when all I want are the season episodes in one DVD set. Seems like it is tough for them to perceive what people want to actually buy, so you have to resort to hurting one of the things you love the most with a turd review so when somebody at CN reads to try and figure out why sales and overall acceptance of a product they release isn't so great, this is what they see.So poot on this DVD release, stop messing around with whatever marketing formula made you come up with it and just release the season box sets from now on. Everybody wins."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too \\"easy\\"!","review":"Most everyone in my class felt that this book, while having an interesting format, was irritating to use. There is no basic glossary of word parts and combining forms, only an index that lists the exercise number where the item can be found. Normally, I might say that this facilitates learning through practice rather than rote, but many of the index references are incorrect! Apparently, they have not been updated since the previous edition. This also makes the book useless as a reference. Also, the way the book categorized body systems made little sense. For instance, why is the pulmonary system included in the section on the special senses? I give this book a C-."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rudimentary, riddled with errors","review":"I went through this book page by page as part of a medical transcription course. Having somewhat of a medical background, I found this book to be very rudimentary. I was hoping to get a more thorough and detailed knowledge of medical terminology. In the chapter relating to my particular field, there were words that I suppose you could use, based on the root words and prefixes/suffixes, but were just ridiculous...never actually used in the field. This book is also riddled with errors, particularly in the review exercises. It looks to me as though no one edited this book. I am disappointed that I spent so much money for such shoddy work. I gave it two stars instead of one because the \\"programmed learning\\" format seems to work well."},{"rating":"1","title":"errors","review":"I agree with other reviewers who commented that there are errors in this book. The accompanying disc is helpful, however, there are errors on it, as well. The disk also falsely corrects your practice quizzes. It says you were incorrect when you have the answer correct."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I am taking a medical terminology class at the vo-tech school in my area. The entire class and the instructor are very disappointed in this book because it is full of errors. For people who are new to medical terminology and have no medical backgrounds this book is very confusing at times and I wonder if I am really learning the correct terms. The instructor has already said that she is going to buy new books for her next class."},{"rating":"2","title":"Medical Terminology","review":"This book is concise and to the point. It came well packaged and it came on time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tribute to the pioneers of Archaeology and their work.","review":"This book was first published in 1949 and then enlarged in 1967. Altogether it has been translated into 26 languages and read by many millions of people. It is easy to see why.This book traces the origins of Archaeology and those who were involved in the great discoveries. Commencing with the great statues of Pompeii, Troy, Mycenae and Crete, we then move on to the Pyramids - with sections about all those who became involved from Napoleon to Carter. Next we find the great Towers of Assyria, Babylon and Sumeria before concluding with the great Temples of the Aztecs, Mayas and Toltecs.This is a fascinating book which is able to give the layman an expert's insight into the greatest archaeological finds of history.NM"},{"rating":"2","title":"Conservation at it's youth","review":"Roosevelt gives us a day by day accounting of wehat it meant to try and share a turn of the century safari in a country that was truly primitive. His comments on the native people show how some attitudes on race have barely changed in roughly a century. It gives you an insight as to where our museums obtained their exibits in days gone by. Overall a very good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but too much drudgery.","review":"Great descriptions of some fine hunts against dangerous game and great commentary on the local human wildlife so to speak. It's unfortunate that liberal revisionists have tried to paint a vision of Africa that simply is not so nor ever was. Unfortunately the book is filled with too much 'Today I shot this, that and the other thing' which becomes really damned dull after awhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to stay with the President.","review":"Mr. President is long winded and goes off on tangents. It is hard to stay with him. The reading experience is further hindered by the format of the Capstick Library books-the pages are made to look tattered and do not have clean edges. The photography in the book is \\"state of the art early 1900's\\" and is lacking."},{"rating":"1","title":"African Game Trails (Capstick Library)","review":"I purchased a copy of this book and am extremely disapointed with the quality of the photographs. They are so fuzzy and out-of-focus as to be useless--in some cases unrecognizable. I'm suprised that you offer such a poor quality volume for sale. I coresponded with the publisher and the nice young lady offered to send me another copy but added \\"I looked at the pictures and they're terrible.\\" I replied that I already had one lousy copy and did not need another. You should check the quality of this volume carefully....it's terrible!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Title","review":"Soooo glad to have finished this one. Written in 1909, 1910, immediately after Roosevelt left the Presidency and went to Africa in March, 1909, for the Smithsonian, to shoot a zillion animals and bring back their hides and heads for the collections. He went with his son Kermit, who shot most of the very fuzzy black and white pictures in the book, and more animals even than his father. He was about 20 then. It is a picture of colonial East Africa at that time, and of Western man's thinking about the black natives, who were \\"children\\". Thankfully, that sort of mind-set has disappeared. But you can see here that Roosevelt had it in spades. Too bad some of his bearers did not write their own accounts."},{"rating":"1","title":"infidelity in a regency...","review":"From the blurb on the book, I suspected this regency was about an affair, and I was right.The hero-Adam, is a war hero and Amanda-are thrown together when Adam is secretly trying to find a French Spy.I won't go further into the book in case you choose to read it.I personally quit this book because I don't read romances, definately regencies, to read about infidelity.I was pretty sure the author was going to set the husband up as a villian to \\"justify\\" the affair-but she made a mistake when she had the hero living at their home as a guest. And this is no school room miss-she's been married some years and has children-so the husband would have to have been truly evil for me to accept the adultery-and it was not the case.The book also gives way too much info about the war-the first 40 or so pages are predominately just that-boring.In my opinion this is not one of Miss Wolf's better regencies. If you like traditional regencies I say skip this one.2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book is a compromise","review":"There are better books on dining car recipes, including \\"Dining by Rail\\" and \\"Dinner in the Diner,\\" and both available through Amazon. And, there are more complete books on Fred Harvey, such as Stephen Fried's wonderful \\"Appetite for America.\\" The cookbook portion of \\"The Harvey House Cookbook\\" is better than the space devoted to Harvey the man. Still, you'll be left hungering for more regardless of what you're looking for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Collection Prestige","review":"Here we have the 4th album by France's Carnival In Coal. The band consists of 2 members. Axel performs all instruments and Arno takes care of all the vocals. This band has been described as Morbid Angel meets Mr Bungle. I think that is a pretty good description and it's what tempted me to pick up their albums about 4 years ago. There are a lot of layers and instrumentation here which requires several listens to absorb. Plenty of catchy and varied songwriting. You'll find everything from death metal to disco here. I also recommend hunting down their 3 other releases (Fear Not, Vivalavida and French Cancan which is composed mostly of cover songs done in Carnival In Coal fashion)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for ipod","review":"Best in car holder for your ipod.

Also disappointed that the marketing/packaging for the actual unit doesn't make the cost of the subscription to the service obvious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible customer service","review":"After unit broke, ceiva refused to honor 'life-time warranty' and made us go through dozens of customer-support interactions repeating the same steps over and over at every call.Insisted we order parts, sent the parts, had no record of sending parts at next call and insisted we order parts again, then found record of part order and expressed being very angry with us that they had sent the wrong parts and required us to repeat the process.

Was told several times that the frames were backordered and would not ship out until the week before Christmas, but that they would be expeditied.Come the last shipping day before Christmas and they are still backordered. Customer service is of no help.How is it that a company can make one (and only one) product and still not be able to come close to making Christmas needs? I mean, they could have locked me (3 frames) in for life as a customer with their wildly overpriced $12 a month service.

It says \\"free\\" but no mention of the additional 99.95 to 159.95 needed to use their product. Such deception should not be allowed by companies who use Amazon to sell their products.

Hope you enjoy it as much as i did!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another top-level Francis","review":"Francis offers his usual fare: The same protagonist with a new name; a plot of investigation, discovery, physical pain and mental exercises; a supporting cast of believable characters who act in supportable, self-interested, and logical ways. All of which is not to say anything bad; i love to read Francis, and do so when looking for a vicarious thrill and a light read. The protagonist in this one is Edward \\"Link\\" Lincoln, an action picture actor ~ the sort who might star in movies made of Francis' books ~ who goes to South Africa for a little off-set investigation. At least, he thinks that's why he's gone there; he's actually gone to be killed. In a post-Apartheid world the picture of South Africa is rather sweet; i would guess Francis had some coöperation from the government in return for his portrayal of the country."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 Stars worth of Dick Francis' Plot Twists!","review":"This is one of my favorite all time Dick Francis novels.

This is the first book I've ever read by this renowned historian, and it is outstanding in both detail and clarity. Admiral Morison (as he is referred to in Stephen Ambrose's history of D-Day) tells this story clearly and with dramatic narration, as much as any history which strives to be complete can be. I intend to read his RISING SUN IN THE PACIFIC next, and I may try to read the entire series on U.S. naval operations in WWII, given time. This book is essential to an understanding of D-Day and, along with Mr. Ambrose's books, gives any reader a great deal of insight into the most dramatic day of the 20th century, and maybe in the modern history of the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest travel books of all time","review":"Powerful observations written about the Spanish people, culture, government, it the time of the 1840s, Richard Ford has uncanny ability to observe, understand, analyze, and then put down his observations with wonderful prose, sharp wit, great philosophy, and an obvious love of Spain and things Spanish.As an interesting aside, written at a time when England is very powerful, America young, France despised (Napoleon having been beaten by the British at Waterloo), the writing gives an insight into British culture as they saw themselves at that time.If you love Spain, if you love truly superb travel writing, it is worth working through the obscure references in some passages to be amazed at the truly brilliant writing of Richard Ford. Insights into the Spanish that still hold true today, and universal insights into travel as an art that will always be true, page after page of great reading. I liked it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is Oil... it is very Oily","review":"Purchased this to go along with my new Poulan chainsaw from Amazon. From what I can tell this is just standard chain oil (which is probably just... standard motor oil?)At $5/qt it is hard to say this is a steal, but given that the chainsaw seems happy I can't really complain. I'd recommend just heading into Ace/Home Depot and buying whatever their generic chain oil is instead, but if you want to keep everything brand-matched, I suppose this is just fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sluggish and a boring play...","review":"This play is and seems to be boring. DON'T BE FOOLED BY THE NAME, IT IS! This all takes place in a court house and there is not another set or anything else. The judge speaks most of the time with some alternating characters. The ending is also very predictable. This play (on the plus side) shows how it can be in a court room and how being prosecuted can feel. As an audience member, i would feel sorry for the men/women that go up there on the stand. But no matter, the play is a boring sluggish one about a predicament that doesn't seem that well established."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The Beatles they aint!\\", (and that's a good thing).","review":"Because The Beatles didn't stick to just one \\"sound\\", or one \\"style\\", it becomes necessry for a parody band such as The Rutles to work in the various styles in order to be a completly successful parody band. Why? After the screaming hysteria of the teenage-girls has passed, the music itself is what is remembered. Some people prefer one sound over the other instead of just loving it because it's The Beatles---SCREEEEAM. Therefore a parody band that limited its work, or even a particular album, to one sound would loose some part of the target audience. This CD effectivly touches many aspects of The Beatles sound. No matter what you like about The Beatles, or The Rutles, there are at least a couple of songs here you will LOVE (Track programming/repeat must be divinly inspired) and several more you will like alot. A definate must-have!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Dirk in the lonely heart","review":"Eric Idle's pre-fab creation, The RUTLES, were an hilarious dead-on knock-off of the Beatles. But that was 1978, and all four Fabs were alive then-- so laughter came easy. This 1990s rip of the ANTHOLOGY specials and CDs is Idle-less, ill-considered and quite unnecessary.The new \\"old\\" songs here are dismissively mediocre, the three-man-left joke in poor taste, and even the mixes seem wrong: music obscures many vocals to the point where this not only doesn't sound like the Beatles, it ain't the RUTLES, either.

Reccomended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Authoritative translation of Sankara","review":"The hymns of Sankara included are (1) Hymn to Daksinamurti (2) Hymn to Guru (3) Bhajagovindam and (4) Hymn to Siva. The Appendices are (1) Totakastaka and (2) Manasollasa. The original script is followed by commentary and explanation. The Hymn to Daksinamurti is famous because it gives the quintessence of Advaita philosophy. Bhajagovindam is a popular devotional composition.T, M. P.

He wrote fiction stories that had religious themes and plots to them, often cloaking subtle aspects in high mysticism. In THE CONQUEST OF FEAR, King reveals slowly his unfolding religious experience through the years and lays a unique foundation of principles for anyone to refute fear of any kind, anywhere. King writes in a deeply personal way, sharing his experiences and insights, as if with you alone. There is a convincing factor to this book that will help you to rid yourself of fright and dread. It is a highly practical book of spiritual guidance for anyone who is seeking to live life to the fullest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Reading","review":"The Naked Sun was definately worth reading as it contained some very intriguing and relevant ideas.

No action. No emotion. Blah. The Solarians were too extreme to swallow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Asimov Strikes Back","review":"This is the second book in the Baley-Daneel duo. And it's better than the first one, The Caves of Steel. The Science Fiction aspect is more creative--the Solarians are unlike any race I'm seen or read. The mystery is even tougher. Looking at the two books, The Naked Sun is almost the opposite of The Caves of Steel. The latter takes place in a confined Earth, with few robots. The former is on Solaria, a world with many robots and open spaces. Baley's reaction to the expierence rings true to his character--especially when dealing with the open spaces. To sum up, this is sequel will hook you and make you crave more. How fortunate there is a book called The Robots of Dawn!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Realistic Sci-Fi","review":"I gave this a four star because it continues Caves of Steel perfectly with an all new problem for the main characters. All the main aspects of the first book are kept the same but this introduces more psychological effects to people and reveals some things left unknown in the first book. I recommend this to anyone who likes sci-fi that isn't unrealistic past the new technologies developed which one must accept to enjoy any sci-fi book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Asimov","review":"It's always fun to hear a great mystery, and in the future with a great off-world scenario made it even better."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it","review":"I thought this book was wonderful.

Daneel Olivaw is one of the most important characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Future tense.","review":"It may be a flight of fancy, but it seems that you can see Asimov as a scientist when you read his novels. Unlike other speculative writers, there is a clear sense of details that ring true to the present day. For instance, the trouble with getting robots to respond to a question reminds me of some of the more comical experiments with intelligent agents.Although the allegorical nature of the Solarians gives the book a somewhat dated feel, it still has that Asimov magic-- combining study of human nature with speculative fiction. A first class author, as always."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Quick Read","review":"A couple of admissions first - This is my first review. This was the first Asimov book I've read. I enjoy older (50's/60's) science fiction - no profanity, good character development, fairly predictable, but with interesting ideas and ways of looking at human life.That said, I picked up The Naked Sun at a used bookstore not knowing that it was part of a series. I read a couple reviews that complained that the first 50 pages were used to get the new reader up to speed and decided I'd take the risk and read it anyway. I am so glad that I did. I couldn't put it down and finished it in less than a day and a half of intermittent reading. It's basically a classic 1950s style crime novel. Yes, it was a little predictable, but so what. I really enjoyed the interplay of the characters and way Asimov made the idiosyncrasies of the Solarians equal those of the earthmen.Not groundbreaking, but a fantastic quick read. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoyed it.","review":"\\"The Naked Sun\\" takes detective Elijah Baley to the outer settlements of the spacers to solve a mystery.Once again, robot R. Daneel Olivaw joins the investigation.The biggest difference between this and the normal life of Elijah Baley on Earth is that most of the investigation is under wide-open sky. Baley is not comfortable, he would rather be back in his city's steel caves. Meanwhile, we learn much more of the problems of the spacers.But, Baley produces an interesting solution to the mystery.I enjoyed reading this book. However, it is a little bit too light a vehicle and does not get far enough into the spacer's problems or how Baley fits into that arena of the overall plot.Try it. It is entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Victorian tradition","review":"I have read many of the thousands of words on this book. Most people seem to have read and enjoyed it, as they should. So I won't add too many more - that ain't necessary. All I will say is that, overlooking the relative thinness of the characterizations, after reading the book (and its predecessor) you might very well go back to the J. Watson / R. Sherlock Holmes stories with an enhanced perception."},{"rating":"2","title":"Asimov makes characters out of entire worlds!","review":"The Naked Sun, continuing the exploits of Elijah Bailey and R. Daneel Olivaw, sees the two investigating a murder on the Spacer world of Solaria, where it is obscene to be in the physical presence of other human beings, and robots are everywhere, attending to every need. The contrast between Earth and Solaria is stark and made purposely so. Only Asimov and a few others have such a talent for making worlds into characters. He conveys the feeling and the emotions as if you were actually there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad quality","review":"This was my first pen tablet.So I didn't know if this product was good or bad.It's cheap comparing with other kinds of pen tablet, so I didn't really wonder.But my mom gave me an another kind of pen tablet(which is Bamboo's pen tablet), and that quality was so high.With this pen tablet, I couldn't draw where I wanted.It was still easier than with a mouse, but as a pen tablet, it sucked.If you are buying your first pen tablet, I don't recommend this one.Otherwise you'll think you can't draw well on the computer and give up.With a good kind of pen tablet, you can draw better than you think.I promise, this product isn't good at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work well with Mac","review":"I had to buy this for a class and can't install it properly on my macbook.

Writing them works in Windows 7 Ultimate, after a fashion. So does optical character recognition, after download and installation of the Simplified Chinese Language Pack from the Windows Update Website.However, the handling of the stylus is skittish: it's difficult to draw a straight line or a smooth curve. Yes, I *am* holding the stylus as if it were a Chinese ink brush, but holding it as if it were a pen does not help. After trying for some hours, I've come to the conclusion that I'll do better to use my optical mouse for writing Chinese characters.Actually I'd rather use this tablet under Apple Mac OS X, but the manufacturer KYE (aka Genius) has not written any drivers for OS X since version 10.4. So the tablet is useless under current versions of OS X."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money","review":"I would not reccomend buying this product.

The movie did not have any Oscar-caliber aspects to it, but it was entertaining, however.The DVD itself has a good image quality, but there were no features other than scene selection, and a trailer to 3 other movies.

The games are excellent, but I wished that he had gone into more detail about the decision for some moves. Overall, it's a worth the purchase.

The first two I owned died because of the casing splitting open. I've actually learned to reinforce the plug that goes into the laptop with ducktape and toothpicks to keep it stiff. You also have to worry about it randomly burning out or overloading. In which case it'll emit an insanely high beeping noise.11/2/08Update: The cord is shorter then the others I have owned... Either the plug on my laptop is going bad or the adapter is already screwed out of the box. It constantly disconnects putting the laptop on battery.

Unfortunately, the intricacies of the plot and the imaginations of the filmmakers was too much for the film's budget, but still the heart and raw dedication to movie making is just one of the things that makes this movie so good. It's obvious that the people who worked on this bought into what they were creating and the end product, if a little flawed, is perhaps one of the best looking, bet lit, best photographed, best scores, best special effects, best edited, best overall shot on video indie film and continues to stand the test of time against all others.

It is also a book for other Ph.D.'s who have been brainwashed clear of any senses.This book is like a cross between a pseudo-science with prose writing written by hippies.

What I got instead was a book containing a little science and a lot of breathless commentary on how amazing babies, science, and scientists are.If you're a thinking religious person that believes science is a useful tool that does not have all the answers you probably will not enjoy this book. The authors have already come to all the conclusions for you and God has been deliberately scrubbed out (literally--they quote part of the famous Wordsworth poem \\"Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of Early Childhood\\" at the heading of the last chapter, but leave off the final and most significant line, \\"From God who is our Home.\\").On the other hand, if you belong to the \\"science is man's best hope\\" school of thought then you may enjoy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hooray!

I wish you all could have seen Robert Plant screaming the word \\"Gun\\" from \\"I got you in the sights of my guuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuun.\\" He started softly and did a limbo layback from face down to lying totally with back to floor as he did a crescendo of the word 'gun'. The final moments he was facing the ceiling just screaming it out. He MAX'ed it out. It shook the whole house apart. Then the music exploded. It was pure inspired bedlam.

Seriously, how many albums back then were this loud? Maybe Tommy from the Who. I can't think of many others. Black Sabbath's debut was released a year later, so that doesn't count.Anyway, I really like what Zeppelin was doing here.

Bonham's drumming, more than anyone else's, has been imitated (but never replicated) since this album came out.Duran Duran? Who remembers them? When was the last time somebody bought a Backstreet Boys cd? Modern bands, with rare exceptions (like Green Day) are 3 year wonders. Zeppelin lives nearly 25 years since their demise.

The reason that these Zeppelin remasters are being sold so relativly cheap on Amazon is because the seller, MusicStore2000, is selling lesser quality imports from Argentina. First off, 2 of the 3 cases I ordered from this seller arrived broken and cracked (a real pet peeve of mine). As for the disc itself, the printing on the actual disc is kinda sloppy. The disc appears to be of lower quality than the other Zep remasters I already own. The sound quality is acceptable...I do think the disc does contain the '94 remaster. Overall, I would say this disc is on par with the ones you get from those 12-for-a-penny record clubs...slightly inferior to the store bought versions. What bothers me the most, though, is that nowhere on the Amazon sales page does it say you are getting Argentinian imports. I would not have bought them had I known ahead of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Classic Classic","review":"When I was 16 my hippie neighbor started sharing his Zepelin and Floyd collections with me and this is the first CD he gave me. Every evening I would turn off the lights in my room and listen to the latest offering. What I loved and still love about this album is how rough and dirty the compositions sound. This is, in my opinion, the purest form of rock and roll. The vocals are great, the guitars are sensational and the drums are powerful and confident.

The only thing I disagree with the previous reviewer is about what is a real band. Duran Duran -- Hah! They ain't nothing either. If you want to hear REAL music, check out Britny Spears and Ricky Martin and Cristina Aguilera. If you want to hear REAL bands, look for N'Sync and the Backstreet Boyz. Now that's stuff that will stand the test of time!

I really hate the boring covers of \\"Shook Me\\" and \\"I Can't Quit You Baby\\". Also \\"How Many More Times\\" is repetitive and meaningless. The lyrics are very stupid in this one. The only track that I enjoy is \\"Your Time Is Gonna Come\\" and (a little) \\"Babe I'm Gonna Leave You\\". I don't understand why the most enjoy very much Led Zeppelin. Awful blues guitar rock. Only \\"Stairway To Heaven\\" (found in L.Z. IV) is an excellent song. Go listen to Pink Floyd or Alan Parsons."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Shook Me","review":"Grabbed me from the get go. That first LZ album was meant to be an attention getter. Songs of heavy blues and rock. Early metal. Jimmy Page's masterful guitar work along with Robert Plant's piercing vocals set the groundwork for the bands future editions that went through constant metamorphosis. This is a must have album for anyone who appreciates near perfection in one of classic rock's greatest bands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest debut in rock history","review":"This is the greatest debut ever made. 'Dazed and confused' is still sonically thrilling and plumbs new depths for the blues. 'Babe, I'm gonna leave you' takes folk rock to the stratosphere. 'How many more times' makes you want to headbang. 'Black mountain side' introduces the brilliant acoustic side of Zeppelin. 'Good times bad times' and 'Communication breakdown' are basically great filler that would be the highlights of most bands' repertoires and 'Your time is gonna come' somehow combines church organ with folksy guitar in a blues song. Only 'You shook me' and 'I can't quit you baby' seem obviously dated and lacklustre by comparison. Most of this album may be derivative from other sources but overall it was brilliantly original and eclipsed all the other British blues-rock bands of the era. There's an urgency and obvious desire to impress in this album that was never quite repeated."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Great transformation from The New Yardbirds into Led Zeppelin","review":"Led Zeppelin (self-titled debut): Led Zeppelin's debut arrived as the freshest sound in Rock and Roll for that era and it remains a Great rock album. I don't have to defend or exaggerate the significance of this band as their work is well known. Most of Zeppelin's work is essential listening for anyone who loves rock music. If you don't have it, you need to get it. This is the first of several Masterpiece albums from Led Zeppelin. {The Zeppelin fan might be interested in seeking out the Yardbirds DVD that has them doing \`Dazed and Confused' with Keith Relf on vocals - that DVD is not part of this album.}"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, the best","review":"I have to agree with many here that this is the best Led Zep and a true classic (although I love them all!).I also think that this may in large part be due to the fact that I'm old enough to have been in my teens when this was released.Hearing this before any of the later Led Zep material was like hearing Cream or The Doors or Jefferson Airplane for the very first time.It was so innovative, so distinct, so fresh...So, kinda like your first true love :-)I feel the same way about Fresh Cream and the first Doors album and Surrealistic Pillow.If you weren't there, it really can't be described.I was 15 in 1968."},{"rating":"2","title":"YEAH!","review":"This is not 5 stars because it could have been better produced, But it's pure Zep.

Everything zepp were about is demonstrated in this album. How many more times is so underrated, bonham is superb on the drums and page's timin is perfect. Babe I'm gonna leave ya is a classic zeppelin song accoustic mixed with the heaviness that defined them durin the seventies. communication break down is just pure basic rock and anyone who listens to this album will be impressed by it. definetly up to the standards of the albums that came after LZ 2, IV, houses of the holy, physical graffiti. ur time is gonna come, john paul jones provides a very good organ intro, vocals by plant works really well.For anyone considering gettin into zeppelin I really urge you to listen to this, a superb first album providin the foundation for all the sucess they endured."},{"rating":"2","title":"In the beggining","review":"Led Zeppelin starts their amazing career with this influencial album. It begins with Good times, bad times. It sets the stage for their whole catalog. All the rest flows from the vibe. If I were to recommend a Zeppelin album to anyone, it would be this one. How many more times is a perfect ending also.This classic album also showcases Jimmy Page's signature violin bow on his guitar. If you are a beginning Zep head or want to be one this album is crucial to your collection"},{"rating":"2","title":"All the Power of Zeppelin","review":"Zeppelin's first album captures the raw power of the group as well as any other. It's probably the rawest and bluesiest Zepp album, great roots for the rest of their music. Its hard to describe how well this album flows. From the opening knock-you-over power of Good Times Bad Times to my personal favorite, How Many More Times, with its huge rolling riff and its almost imporvisational pieces from other blues songs. Even in their debut, each band member shows how ridiculously talented they are. Obviously a must-own, but isn't every Zeppelin album?"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREATEST RECORDINGS OF ALL TIME","review":"I'VE HEARD THIS ALBUM FOR THE FIRST TIME WHEN I WAS 13-YEAR OLD (NOW I'M 23).

LP, Cassette and now one of the CD's that is always in the machine. When I first heard this in 1969 it changed my whole musical world. It represented the pinnacle of white english boys trying to play the blues. \\"Your Time Is Gonna Come\\" is one of my favorite Zeppelin songs. That almost religious sounding organ at the start that leads into the heavy drumming of Bonham. Page's acoustic guitar is like a water fall of sound in this song and Plant convinces you of a broken heart. Jimmy is an incredible guitar player on this recording - playing the blues better that any of his contemporaries. There is not a bad song on the whole album. This album is why I had to learn guitar. I defied my parents and snuck off to see these guys for my first concert ever. It was well worth the beatin!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE GREAT ZEPPELIN MACHINNE LUANCHED!","review":"Of all the music that spawned from the sixties, this one truely incentric and organic.

The well-known singles are great, but so is the rest of the album. In 2000, Wide Mouth Mason - a Canadian band opening for AC/DC - played \\"How Many More Times,\\" the last track on this album. Needless to say it was great. \\"Babe I'm Gonna Leave You\\" is one of my top 5 fave Zep songs. Buy this album now."},{"rating":"2","title":"the beginning of greatness","review":"this is the first offering from the greatest band of all time. this album, much like most seems to have a basic musical style. in this case it's a bluesy feel. aside from communication breakdown, not much on here is crazy rock. that being said, the other songs are great, slow paced, bluesy jams with plant really showing of his talent and page playing great blues guitar. dazed and confused is the opus of this album. great tune. this is a great zeppelin cd, however, for newbies i would recommend zoso or II, a little more traditional rock you hear on the radio. this is an essential recording and a must have for any zep head."},{"rating":"2","title":"The beginning of a rock phenomenon","review":"Released in 1968, Led Zeppelin's debut album kick-started Led Zeppelin's short but spectacular career and went on to become a hard rock classic.

Just amazing, but what came after it is not what I am here to review, it is this album. Communication Breakdown bombs in and takes you for a pretty raw and fun ride! I won't go into detail but every song is a work of art when it comes to Rock and Roll. If you don't have this album you should, it is one of the best overall albums in Rock history next to the likes of Dark Side of the Moon and so on and so forth.Jimmy Page is on guitar and with Plant at the mic, this thing was just the beginning...but even then it is such a superb album filled with soul, rock and roll, and metal.

Initially you might listen to Dazed, babe and a few others a bit, but the whole thing wears out quite soon. It's popular today because of hype and nostalgia. Case in point: Even Green Day are considered classic and legendary today despite being the amateur pop garage band they still are and were when they came out with Dookie in 1994. Anything can be popular and the more accessible or journo-defined cool it is the more it 'endures.'Incidentally, the best debut of all time is Iron Maiden's self-titled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tolerable","review":"Along with Physical Graffiti, this is the only tolerable one of Led Zeppelin's albums. I have nothing against the fact that quite a few of the songs on this album are covers of blues standards; they are performed fairly competently.

But the raw power of this album makes up for so much. While the songs of \\"II\\" were a lot closer to the sound of \\"IV\\", Zeppelin's crowning album acheivement, \\"I\\" showcases their earlier sound, doing blues covers popular at the time (and throwing a lot of their own inprov into them), while beginning the chemistry that produced originals and throw all four of them into stardom.However, don't think this is just an album for the Zeppelin fan or collector.

The next three songs, babe i'm gonna leave you, you shook me, dazed and confused, I must say is some my favorite zeppelin, the latter being particularly noteworthy. I love the organ solo in your time is gonna come, as well as another fabulous jimmy page riff, black mountain side. Communication breakdown gets to me every time for its manic quality. I'm Can't Quit you babe, i would say the weakest song of the album...it sounds as if the band is tired, though the subject matter is pure robert plant, who by the way, hasn't developed that annoying feminine screaming quality yet.

Rucker is always good for a couple of tracks, but overall her albums have been left wanting.

Not to mention that her style launched hundreds of mimics, and some of them so well Rucker risked being outshined by her clones.\\"Ma'at Mama\\" goes a LONG way toward rectifying all of these imbalances.The tracks here are not only strong, but much better wedded to her vocal arrangments. The music and the poems both are allowed to breathe and stand on their own merits. Of particular note are the tracks \\"Rant\\", \\"Uh Uh\\" and \\"Poon Tang Clan\\" which, while tardemark preachy, exposes a too-rare sense of humor.Sure, there are some too-familair devices here for a modern poetry record (cue the African drumming, cue the roll call poem), but the hits, for once, far outweigh the misses.

However, as similar reviews have indicated, the quality of this unit is fair at best. We have taken full advantage of their lifetime warranty repair service. We have replaced the faucet handle three times, and now the base of the faucet has locked in place (it will not swivel from left to right any longer.)

And we have had trouble in several places. The latest is this faucet. After three different people pulled the faucet apart (me, a friend and a plumber) and put it back together, it's still leaking. Changed the O-ring, the cartridge, cleaned the contact gaskets. Called the company and they're sending out a \\"spacer kit\\" which will supposedly solve the problem. Except it's out of stock--at Kohler. I might get it in two weeks. After another service call, I'll be out of 140 bucks, and no guarantees it'll work. Of course, I can try to fix it myself. At least I would not have dented up the metal pull-out hose by trying to pull out the faucet while the hose was still threaded through it, like the plumber did and put two nice dents in the hose. Honestly. Why can't things be made to last like they used to? Kohler is all about the look, but I've been disappointed in the quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you love Lauper you need this CD !!!","review":"Have you ever wished to get Good Enough from the Goonies soundtrack on CD?

Will it go down in history with other books about war? Maybe. Will you be glad you read the book? Yup.I thought the most entertaining parts of War Reporting for Cowards are those sections dealing with the Marines he was attached and the war itself. There is a lot of personal history that Ayres includes that may be important, but I found to be distracting. I especially liked Ayres story of his first few minutes at Camp Grizzly. Approached by a young Marine who wants to banter a few lines from Full Metal Jacket, Ayres finally catches on. Truly irreverent but so truly typical of Marines.An easy read, War Reporting for Cowards will give you a view of the war in Iraq not available anywhere else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Appalling, dull, irrelevant","review":"Chris Ayres has turned an amusing magazine article into a full length account of a very unexceptional few days in Iraq. The problem with this book is that this experiences simply do not warrant a book - as a result 80% of the writing is preparatory musings and dull bio material of this young man's life so far.

The author describes psychoanalyis as a deeply human(e) practice, a practice allied with democratic freedoms and care of the self. This small but thoroughly provocative book, raises questions about the chemical and genetic reducibility of the individual that medication as remediation readily assumes.

Olivia's secretary comments on the fact that Olive has an entire file on Kayla and who her friends are, etc., and yet Olivia tells Kayla that her father never let her find her. So--where did the file come from? Where did Rick get his information on Olivia and Kayla to give to the tabloids?

Highly recommend all of his books."},{"rating":"1","title":"A self-serving forum for Mandino's ego.","review":"Five of us in a book club read this book as our selection for the month. We all agreed that this book is nothing but a forum used by Og Mandino for his self-aggrandizement and we would not have read it to the end if it weren't for our planned discussion of the book. This book reveals how materialistic Mandino is and how egotistic he is to use a figure like the ragpicker through whom he could brag to his readers about his awards and wealth. Unfortunately, there was no redeeming value in the book even when one stuck it out to the end. This is the only book I have ever tossed in the trash. It is a waste of time and money. There was no option to rate this book lower than 1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book made me wonder why books by Og sell at all!","review":"I selected this book for my Book Study group to read. It was hard for me to face them when we met because after reading it, I realized that the book is the ramblings of a very egotistical person and certainly did not provide any (not one) uplifting concept.

We all promised to throw the book in the trash as we left."},{"rating":"1","title":"Og, what happened?","review":"I loved the original 'ragpicker' book by Og Mandino -- The Greatest Miracle in the World.' This sequel was written about 10 or 15 years later and something happened to Mr. Mandino in that time! He seemed more interested in telling you about all of his accomplishments, all of his material possessions, etc. than the inspirational message in the original book. Further, he replaced much of the God-based inspiration with politically correct platforms.Just bizarre to me how an author could change that much. I read a couple other reviews from disappointed readers and ignored them. Now I wish I would have believed them.I still love the older Og Mandino books, however, especially the Trilogy, but this one isn't worth the waste of time or money, or worth the disappointment in this author that I've looked up to....read at your own risk."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book full of Og Mandino being full of himself.","review":"I have had a hard time not throwing this book away. It is a shameful way to plug your own accomplishments ... using the \\"notion\\" that you are having a special relationship with a messenger from God. Simon Potter was merely an avenue for Og Mandino to let the world know he shared company (in the palace)with Imelda Marcos. Of course, Simon Potter witnessed Mr. Og's kind gestures when paying for the \\"armed guard's\\" meals as they were protecting such an important man as Og Mandidno. This book is a conversation Og Mandino has with his own self. A book full of Og Mandino being full of himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book was extremely hard to read and appeared to be a bragging platform for the author. The majority of the book is full of the author proclaiming his success through his own words and the words of this mentor.

I smiled thinking to myself that he already knew so much about me it was a good probability that he also had a good idea of my net worth.\\" Use your time more wisely and find something more worthwhile to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Return of the Ragpicker","review":"Mr. Mandino dilutes his message by using most of his book to tell the reader that he overcame failure to become a great success. He goes on in exquisite detail to enumerate all his great accomplishments and acclaim. Unfortunately most people are not turned on to a message that says, \\"Look at all my awards and how great I am. Read my affirmations for six minutes a day and you too can be wonderful.\\" While he is at this, he lets you know how he stands on gun control, the environment, TV and other political things.I am surprised his affirmations use negative words like \\"not\\". Many consider this an ineffectual way to write affirmations. A positive statement works better on the subconscious.He does come up with some good life concepts at the end of the book. Most of these can be found in the New Testament. I love Mr. Mandino and his earlier books. I have to wonder why he wrote this one in this manner."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star only because no stars is not a choice","review":"Perhaps it's me, but I had to put this down and walk away on page 101. The greatest miracle is that I made it that far. The only thing I learned is that Mandino claims to sell a lot of books. I say \\"claims\\" because this beauty has barely cracked the top 100,000 in sales at Amazon. Whatever. I'm obviously not the brightest bulb as it took me 100 pages to figure out that Simon Potter's only role is to pump the author's ego. No wonder Mandino likes him so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do you expect me to believe that this is the same ragpicker?","review":"Who are you trying to kid, Og? I guess you made a lot of bucks with this one...I know you dug into my pocket. It seems like the bucks are your major interest in all your later books.

Anything Leslie Nielson did is always hilarious, but Mel Brooks was smart for reuniting Amy Yesbeck & Marie Cavanaugh(both from \\"Robinhood Men in tights\\"). And it wouldn't be the same if Harvey Korman wasn't in it. Just having Mel Brooks and Harvey Korman together in the same movie will always result in totall comedy!Just like the way Mel used Igor as comical in Young Frankentstein, he made Renfield comical as well. I noticed that the more you watch this movie the more you crack up at Mels puns and inuendose, but that is always the case with his movies and you end up appreciating him even more as a director. This is one to add to you list of the \\"Mel Brooks\\" collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alive...And Liking It","review":"Nobody matches Mel Brooks as a master film parodist. He pretty much owns the genre with films like \\"Young Frankenstein\\" and \\"High Anxiety\\". \\"Dracula...Dead and Loving It\\" is a terrific return to form for Brooks. He doesn't reach the heights that he did with his earlier horror spoof but it'll do. What separates Brooks from his imitators is that he has an affinity for the films he's sending up and not making fun of them. You want to revisit these films after viewing Brooks' parodies. Brooks assembles a terrific cast here led by Leslie Nielsen. Nielsen was probably a septugenarian at the time but he exudes a sexy comic presence. The film isn't up to the comic mastery of the earlier Brooks work but this would be considered an acceptable film from a lesser talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Funny","review":"I thought this movie was absolutely hilarious, and it doesn't need to refernece almost everything to sex, like most of today's comedies do.

Maybe this DVD will give me the chance I need."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"This is my most favorite Leslie Nielsen movie!

I believe that Mel Brooks is a true genius. However, reading the reviews for this movie, I hardly think that they do it justice. Everyone should watch this movie. And to those reviewers who listed great Mel Brooks movies, I DO agree with you, but HELLO! You are all forgetting his funniest movie ever-ROBIN HOOD MEN IN TIGHTS!There is no movie that can compare with this one in terms of comedy.So, in conclusion, Dracula Dead and Loving It is excellent, you should buy it, Mel Brooks is a genius and you should all buy Robin Hood Men In Tights and watch it many, many times until you have learnt it all off by heart as I (and many of my good friends) have done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Babbling Brooks","review":"A few interesting ideas here -- including a sequence in which Dracula enjoys a bit of sunshine -- but on the whole, Mel Brooks's shticky spoof of Francis Ford Coppola's BRAM STOKER'S DRACULA (with visual homages to Universal and Hammer horror) keeps taking the easy way out. The result feels rather like a middling \\"Your Show of Shows\\" sketch stretched to about eighty minutes. Leslie Nielsen is miscast in the title role (which really cries out for a Sid Caesar), and only Harvey Korman and Brooks himself seem to understand how this material should be played. Production design looks nice, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead on Arrival","review":"How can the other 94 reviews on this site give this movie an average of 4 stars?!! At best, it is a two star movie experience and that is being very generous. Dead and Loving It only rates the second star because it is a rather good looking movie and it has a good cast. What it doesn't have is many funny jokes. That Mel Brooks wrote and directed this is hard to believe and it is far down on the list of his best work. Someone here compared this favorably to his (and Gene Wilder's) \\"Young Frankenstein.\\" They must have been insane. \\"Young Frankenstein\\" is possibly the best of all the Mel Brooks comedies, while this is close to the worst. Please note this is from someone who is a fan of both Mr. Brooks and Mr. Nielsen and also a lover of vampire movies. It simply is not very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"one of mel brook's worse","review":"some people compare this to Young Frankenstein. Other than both being horror spoofs there is no comparison. The movie is a parody of the then recently releaded horror Bram Stokers Dracula. Leslie Nielson now has found his niche as a comedic actor. He is good as the infamous count. But, unfortunatley this movie is very heavy handed on the horror and more vulgar than most of Mel Brook's Movies. Young Frankenstein was far superior."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dracula - Dead and Loving It","review":"Dracula - Dead and Loving It is a 1995 movie starring Leslie Nielsen as Dracula and Mel Brooks as Van Helsing. One would think that such a comedic duo would create an amazing comedic satire but the end result is quite mediocre. Some of the jokes are quite funny but on the whole it feels very much so so. Nielsen plays on autopilot and Brooks has seen better days. The costumes look on the cheap and even though it is only about 90 minutes it feels like an overly long movie. Not a terrible film but a very average one. I would like to give a 2+ but since I can not I give it a 2 out of 5. Not recommended. 2/5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laughing and loving it","review":"Oh for me this is the best movie from Leslie N.

I have seen them all and watch my favorites (Young Frankenstein, Blazing Saddles, High Anxiety, Producers) several times a year. I went to Dracula the day it opened and walked out before it finished - demanding and getting my money back. A complete waste of the talents of some truly funny comedians. I expectd a \\"High Anxiety\\" tour de force from Harvey Korman and the perfect timing and deadpan delivery of Naked Gun from Nielson. Instead I saw two great professionals struggeling desperately with third rate material. I'm sorry that there is no way to give zero stars. Certainly the worst movie Mel's ever made and among the worst made in recent memory. If anyone but Brooks made this film, it would have gone directly to video. In vamipre terms, this film sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laughing Gas???","review":"I think the other reviewers definatly were under the influence of laughing gas because I don't think I laughed once throughout the entire movie.

I was expecting the same non stop antics and spoofs of the other Brooks films. It was almost like this film was rushed into production. Out of all of his films I've seen this one is the worst. I actually forced myself to finish it. There were a couple of funny scenes but few and far between for a Brooks film.

My girls love to hear the animal sounds as I read about the zoo animals & they love looking at Eric Carle's brilliant illustrations.

I have a feeling that this will be a treasured book for years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reading to your kids","review":"This book is a great one to read to your kids.I like this one more than his Panda Bear and Brown Bear because I can get the kids more excited about sounds. I've read it to groups of young kids and encourage them to make the sounds with me. I'll \\"roar\\" like a lion and \\"snort\\" like a hippo and the kids will parrot me. They have a lot of fun with this and you get them to start talking about sounds other animals make. They will remember the sounds after just the first reading and get excited any time they see me pick up the book.It's really cute to watch one kid \\"read\\" this to another after we've read it in groups a few times.

Then this is the book for you. Polar Bear, Polar Bear, What do you hear? is a book about the sounds that the animals at the zoo hear. Each animal hears a different animal and mentions the sound that they make. The illustrations are simple, but brightly colored for effect.

This helps learn more animals and to hear the noises they make. That is one of the most exciting things about this book, people trying to impersonate the noises that a wild animal makes. This also teaches kids what noise each animal makes This book was newer when I was in about forth grade and I liked it then even."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely adorable.","review":"The art is wonderful. After reading this book a few times we finger painted and cut out the paper when it was dry. We cut out circles and squares and then glued them on paper and told our own story.

The repetitive nature of this book makes it great for pre readers. With a little bit of practice your child can memorize the book to 'read' it to others.

It is my daughter's favorite just like the Brown Bear, Brown Bear what do you see? book by the same author. The kids like to peep at the next page and see which animal it next and then read it. They learn a lot of new words from this book such as hissing, braying, bellowing, etc. And the most impressive thing is my daughter has learnt how to pronounce certain hard words from this author's books and she does just fine. At her age, she can actually say \\"boa constrictor\\" (one of the animals in the book) very clearly and with such innocence she reads the third last page as follows: \\"zoo peeker, zoo peeker, what do you hear? instead of zookeeper zookeeper!

Wrong! Even though the whole focus of the book is animals making sounds, a large proportion are basically impossible for a human being to imitate: e.g., Hippopotamus, Flamingo, Peacock, Elephant or Walrus. It's a lot easier to just add sound effects to the animals in Brown Bear, almost all of which can be easily imitated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant - even better than Brown Bear!","review":"The twin of Brown Bear, Brown Bear, this book is similar to the other one, but scores an extra point because it adds sounds to its offerings. This might be one of my son's top 3 books since the age of 6 months simply because he has so much fun listening to me (or any of us) making the sounds of the animals. Actually, I think he saw us more than he saw the book in his first year, because he was just fascinated by all the sounds!

Their sound consists mostly of Casio keyboards - with or without lyrics. The 20 songs last a total of roughly 45 minutes, so if you don't like one song, it'll be over soon! Some of the songs sound like early Beastie hard core, especially SICK FOR A REASON, and will likely appeal to people who like their CD AGLIO E OLIO. SCRAPPY sounds quite a bit like the Beasties' more recent work. But I'd say that BS 2000's music is more danceable than much of what the Beasties do. Overall, this CD is fun and different - all that you can expect from a side project. If you don't like it, then you can ask yourself, \\"Who died and left you Mr. Critic?\\" Sadly, this is one of the last CD's issued by the now-defunct Beastie label - Grand Royal.

The price was low and I'm sure that I got a good deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice idea","review":"This makes nice little triangular sandwiches, perfect for snacking! Great product! I would highly recommend this unique little sandwich cutter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was very excited to get this since I cut the crust off sandwiches and then cut into 4 pieces at least twice a day for my kids. Was not impressed though - you need to really press down hard to get it to cut an untoasted sandwich and then you need to help pull the crust off. Was not the time saver I expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!!!","review":"I would state unequivocally that every parent, educator, medical personnel, social worker and therapist should have this book -- it is the first concise, straightforward view of the system. While most parents of special needs kids become quite savvy at the system over time, this book would have saved me hours of headaches, heartaches and trauma if it had been available when I was first entering the system with my son fifteen years ago -- even so, it still has great information (summaries of over 30 private schools, lists of OT, PT and ST, lists of evaluators, and best of all, definitions that have been a mystery, i.e. I FINALLY know the difference between a psychoed and a neuropsychoed eval!). As you can tell, I highly recommend it. The only negative - it really deals with only the first 16 years in the system - I really wish the authors would consider doing a part 2 - middle school and beyond!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate + misleading","review":"As a professional in the field of early childhood special education in NYC I can vouch for the need for what this book promises. Unfortunately for those of us that know the field and NYC it does not deliver. It is full of inaccurate and misleading information from beginning to end. The fact that some parents are raving about it says more to me about the confusing red tape parents have to go through rather than the helpfulness and clarity of this book.To parents who want some help- Resources for Children with Special Needs and each boroughs Early Childhood Direction Center offer *excellent* free guidance.

They work fine for about a year, then something seems to happen either with the software or the transmission of power between the battery and the device. I was so tired of sending them back that I went and bought another brand of MP3 player.On the plus side, and the reason I give it a two instead of one stars is that it really had good sound quality. Also, it was the perfect size and had the right features for me at that time. And, it was water resistant and reasonably shatterproof."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage!!! Don't waste your money!","review":"Purchased this MP3 player through TigerDirect.com.I had to reformat it after only 1 day because it has a glitch that puts it in permanent wait mode until it's reformatted. Even then it took me almost an hour to do it, because it put the computer on wait mode, too! Ridiculous!!!If that wasn't bad enough, the increase volume button stopped working after 3 days. We were able to turn the volume down to 00 (mute) but had no way of increasing the volume, because the button doesn't work!This MP3 player is complete junk - I'm in the process of trying to get TigerDirect to replace it ...

Frankly I wished I had saved my money. I was lucky enough to see them in Sapporo a couple days ago and while the show was good, the songs, mostly taken from \`Withering to death.\`, were uninspiring at best.\`Gauze\` worked because of the X Japan influnce and strong, varied songwriting and \`Kisou\` worked because of the absolute rage conveyed in the music and those albums I recommend a million times over \`Withering to death.\`"},{"rating":"1","title":"","review":"This Japanese band produces noisy, psychotic Rock with Metal influences and a touch of industrial music. Sounding very funky at times, mostly due to the improvised bass playing, the band go from extremely quiet moments to furious bursts of adrenaline, resulting in intense passages accompanied by screaming vocals. You can't deny the influence of punk rock on many of the songs. Cleanly sung catchy choruses are present throughout the whole album. While these guys seem to be having fun while experimenting with different musical genres, in the end this all sounds like a mixed bag of incoherent compositions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent glass cover, functional pan, but...","review":"The product arrived safe and sound, and definitely was a good value for what it was. Like the other reviewer, however, I am skeptical about whether this is actually T-Fal. (It is not prominently marked, nor as sturdily made, as is the case with my large collection of authentic, out-of-the box, T-Fal cookware.)The glass cover was my only reason for purchasing this, and was worth the price alone, though I really didn't need the steam hole (which my T-Fal cookware covers do not have). The way the pan itself is riveted together, and lack of T-Fal's exclusive even-heating surface, make me question if it is actually T-Fal, but from my p.o.v. the cost was worth it for a new, replacement, glass cover (which I was unable to find by itself). In sum, the seller was ok, but this product does not appear genuine (or top-shelf, if it is). I guess... \\"you get what you pay for\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"fry pan","review":"After receiving the wrong item twice, 12\\" Mirro covered frypans, the third replacement was a 10\\" frypan but not a T-fal pan as the description indicated.

I have bookmarked this dealer as a no-go for future orders."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not such a good item","review":"I really spected more from this pan. All the food that I cook in it gets either burn or sticks. I had to buy another one in a store."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"Received this book a few weeks ago and have been doggedly working on \\"William Powell\\", one of my Kottke favorites but a really challenging piece for an intermediate guitarist. It's made wonderfully accessible by Mark Hanson's notes and the accompanying CD - I find that hearing a song at half speed is an incredible learning tool. I can now play a recognizable, if decidedly watered down, version of the song. With Hanson's help I'm picking up more of the nuances that make the song a masterpiece and improving my playing A LOT. This is an excellent book."},{"rating":"2","title":"fair and balanced","review":"ok, get past the fact that this is a book written by a sports writer, and understand there will be one or two malaprops and one or two missed typos. it's actually fairly well written. more importantly, it gives us something rather unusual: an even-handed look at joe paterno, and an even-handed retrospective of the program he has created. it's hard to find- so often we see bland - and blind- praise; other times, we see negative press from those with the opposite agenda. this book gets it right, and it's a must-read for anyone who considers himself a fan of penn state football."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read for Penn State Football Fans","review":"The book \\"The Lion in Autumn:A Season with Joe Paterno and Penn State Football\\" is a good book to be read by a Penn State football fan. The book takes you through the Nittany Lions 2004 season where they finished the disapointing season at 4-7. The book travels through the rough season with an inside look at Penn State football. Week by week the book takes you in depth into what happened during the 2004 season. The book goes in chronological order game after game with recollections of Nittany Lion football pasts along the way. At the end of the book there is an afterword about the Lions next season whre they went 11-1 and finished 3rd in the country. I recommend \\"The Lion In Autumn\\" to any Penn State football fan who is looking for something to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking in nutrition information","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. There was very little written in the book about the actual diet part of the plan. I have the original book and workbook and it had alot more information about the different food groups and what goes into each group. I bought this book because I wanted an updated version of the nutrition information but was surprised to find no nutrition information, only Carol's story and the 12 weeks of devotions. There is some good information mixed in with the devotions, but I wanted something that was easy to find and all together. I don't know if the information I wanted was in the journal or not, I guess this was just a way to make more money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dilbert-isms","review":"What made Dilbert so funny is that all the situations in it reminds people of things that go on in their normal lives. How many people groan at the decisions of the Pointy-Haired Boss, knowing that your own boss has done something just as boneheaded?That is the beauty of Dilbert as a whole. Every working stiff in the world can relate to him. Sometimes it's your \\"cow-orkers\\" that always seem to be lacking in intelligence, or sometimes it's your Pointy-Haired Boss that comes up with some kind of half-baked idea. Sometimes, it's even both!The cast was incredible with such stars as Chris Elliot, Larry David (the creator of Seinfeld), Kathy Griffin (late of the Brooke Shields' show, Suddenly Susan, and whose character, Alice allows Griffin to steal the show), and the overlooked Jason Alexander (Seinfeld's George) as evil Director of Human Resources, Catbert.Overall, an excellent way to unwind when coming home from the office. Even better when enjoyed with some \\"adult beverages\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a MUST for anyone that likes Dilbert or Office Space","review":"The Dilbert TV series is truly a riot. It has both the fun of office space, along with the incredibly looney deaths that only a cartoon can provide (black holes created by Dilbert's invention that's field tested by rednecks and ends up sucking up everything, poor ventilation polution that turns workers into slimes, fish people, etc, and other poorly designed contraptions that generally cause death and mass destruction). Like office space, this series pokes fun at all aspects of office life, including outsourcing, marketing folks, motivation schemes, board of directors, etc. The character voices seem dead on for what you would expect in the Dilbert comics. If anything, Dogbert is even better than he is in the comic version.I don't understand why this show didn't make it on TV (maybe being stuck on UPN?). The sense of humour is terrifically twisted. This series is well worth getting if you missed a number of the episodes when it was on TV."},{"rating":"2","title":"As Good As Promised","review":"This was a gift item, it arrived quickly, the content is good, and the recipient loved it. It was a surprise because he didn't know there was a DVD series of this show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Adaptation of Wonderful Comic","review":"I bought this hoping it would live up to the wonderful comic, however I was completely disappointed. Each episode tried to stretch the typically hilarious one liners of the comic strip into a 30min. comedy and it was a horrible disaster. I just kept waiting for jokes that never came and I finally gave up after 6 episodes. There was a reason the series was canceled after only one season. If you buy this thinking it will be at all like the comic strip you are going to be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not really the Dilbert I know","review":"This has two seasons of Dilbert cartoons, which is two seasons more than I previously knew existed. I read Dilbert comics fairly regularly and while the characters look the same, they just don't seem to have the same personality I would imagine them having. I didn't really expect them to be the same as the comics, but something was missing. Maybe the irony wasn't quite as strong.Which isn't to say they weren't good. My daughter loved the cartoons, but when I handed her some of my Dilbert comics, she didn't enjoy them as much. So the humor is obviously different."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun series that ended before its time","review":"The Dilbert animated series was entertaining. Some of the plot lines were a little ridiculous, but I've watched the series multiple times and it doesn't get old. I enjoy animated TV series and this one is better than some of the shows currently being aired."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"Dilbert is absolutely fantastic and its obscurity is criminal. It's full of hilarious quotes and storylines. It's so dense with jokes, you always find something you missed when you rewatch the series. And you'll do plenty of rewatching if you're anything like me. For anyone unfamiliar with the series, do yourself a favor and watch \\"The Knack\\" on Hulu. Depending on when you read this review, that particular episode may or may not be available at the moment, but I would argue that it's the best to watch if you get a chance.If you've done that, you've most likely clicked the 'add to cart' button by now.There are two full seasons in the collection, with few special features. Honestly, it doesn't matter. Maybe it would be a tough sell if this show were still on the air and this collection were full price, but as it is, you can't pass it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Funny","review":"I really regretted buying the DVD set. The comedy wasn't there.I have always enjoyed the strip but the hip cynism in the strips comes across as very unfunny and not fresh or orginal in the show. The last two episdoes were awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Comic Strip Comes to Life.","review":"I've been a fan of Dilbert ever since learning to read. The comic strip was always the first one I turned to once I got the morning paper.I accidently came up on this TV show. I was amazed that it was made into a animated show and I was also amazed how I could've missed something like this.All I can say is, this show is a must watch for anyone who's EVER had a job or worked a day in their life. The comedy, rather its social or satirical, is great. The show may not be up to par with The Family Guy but it sets up there with the best.If you enjoy: The Family Guy, The Critic, and Futurarama then you'll enjoy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some Good Episodes, Some So-So Episodes","review":"Regardless, the DVD is a must have for Dilbert fans. The episodes that are good are really good. The episodes that are so-so are kinda boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dilbert the Complete Series!","review":"Dilbert has got to be one of my top 3 favorite TV series ever. After Comedy Central took this show off air in 2006 I have been devastated for I was left with nothing to watch on Saturday mornings. Thankfully I could order the complete series right here on amazon for a low price.I recommend Dilbert the Complete series for anyone who likes to share a chuckle or a laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holding up well","review":"I am impressed with the price to quality with these bits.

Of the hundreds of books I have read on flying in the military, this is the best! My book is worn out from the many readings. Each and every time I read it, I become Drury as he experiences the sights, sounds and sensations of flying the Skyraider in Vietnam. I can almost smell the aviation fuel, feel the humidity, enjoy the completion of another mission along with him. After all, isn't this what we want from a good book? You won't be disappointed with \\"My Secret War!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story of the men and airplanes who risked it all","review":"Richard Drury has done a great job of giving us an insight into a war that didn't officially exist at the time.

The book argues that God's revelation is \\"confessional history.\\" The source and setting of basic Christian convictions lie within a historical framework. By his focus on revelation as personal experience, Niebuhr served as the igniting force for views of future theological movements that are still prevalent more than forty years after his death.

On the way there, the pilot suffers a major heart attack and the plane crashes, but Brian makes it out alive. He has to survive alone by making fire, cooking fish, and hunting meat until a rescue plane finds him. Will Brian be rescued? What I like about this book is how Brian never gives up and always tries his hardest. Brian works hard no matterwhat happens and I like that attitude. This book is well suited for kids who like survival novels. The best age for the reader is ages 9 or older because not all the words are easy to read.

Then he was stranded in the wilderness with only a small hatchet on his belt. A good plot. The writing style of this book was pretty good.

The story is about a boy named Brian Robeson who flies to Canada to see his dad. The plane crashed so now Brian has to survive in the wilderness for 52 days. Brian runs into alot of surprises that whole time he is living there. My favorite part was when he gets rescued and they have a nice meal by the rescue fire. I liked the ending very much because it was my favorite part."},{"rating":"2","title":"jordans review","review":"It is a very interesting book.

He tries to survive in the Canadian wilderness. Along the way he looks back on his past to help him survive. He has to find food, shelter, and make fire. Let me say he runs into some trouble. It is really Mother Nature against man in this book. Also in this book, there is a terrible secret and Brian is terrified.I would rate this book 4 stars because I think the beginning is slow, but it gets to normal pace near the middle. Then, the book is awesome."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Very Bad and Boring book","review":"Although I never got past chapter 8 in this book, the part that I did read was very bad and unrealistic. There is a very slim chance that the pilot would have a heart attack on a plane, and then Brian Robeson, the main character, would actually be able to fly the plane at all. Then there would be an even slimmer chance that anyone would survive a crash of such greatness where a wing broke off and the plane crashing into the lake, and then swimming out. Furthermore, I don't like this book because of the odd survival skills that Brian uses during the part that I read. I would not suggest this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hatchet","review":"I was just wondering what this book was not text to speech.

The flight was going great until the pilot started to feel bad, worse, and finally he had a heart attack. That is when things started going down hill.Brian encounters many challenging obstacles such as making his own shelter, catching his own food with his own tools, and being attacked by wild animals like skunks, bears, a timber wolf, and a moose. In order to survive, Brian must work past these obstacles.Overall, I think this is an incredibly great action book that is very detailed. I recommend this book to anyone who loves adventure and this book is for both boys and girls."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazingling Adventorous","review":"Wow! Hatchet is one excellent book. It is a story of a thirteen year-old boy named Brian. He is heading for his dad's house in the oil fields of Canada. But is tragically cut short when the plane he is in crashes...only after the pilot dies. From a heart attack anyways. Brian luckily survives the crash and moves on. As the story progresses, Brian deals with many tragic events. Finally, he is rescued and can, well, move on with his life. And can fortunatly put his life back on track.

I strongly suggest this book to all readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Battle of the Books selection","review":"My son's school selected this book for the Battle of the Books competition, where children compete in teams of three on plot and character questions by correctly naming title and author.

Gary Paulson writes Hatchet. Brian is on his way to visit his father in Canada. His mother gave him a hatchet as a gift. He put it on to please her. Brian never took off the hatchet. It was a private flight and they did not ask him to take it off. He did not know that this hatchet would save his life. Over the next couple of months he would learn how to get food, build shelter, and survive all together. He must keep a secret from his parents divorce from tearing him apart. The very water he drinks is from the lake that contains the plane, and the body of the dead pilot. Brian will have to face many natural problems such as tornadoes, storms, moose, wolves, bears, mosquitoes and many more.

I cannot believe this book is a Newbery Honor book. I cannot believe this book is actually encouraged to be read. (My son said the teacher played an audio introduction to the book, and if they wanted to continue reading it on their own they could.) Not even halfway through the book, the boy named Brian has vomited three times and almost a fourth (is this really necessary?). Also, about halfway through, 13-year-old Brian begins to despair that he will ever be saved so he takes his hatchet and begins cutting his arm to try and end it all. Nothing like teaching our children how to despair and attempt suicide! This book is in no way a positive moral example of great literature. If you would like to read something that is, I highly suggest \\"Island of the Blue Dolphins\\" by Scott O'Dell rather than this trash. Beautifully written and much more worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Book","review":"Hi everybody!We (Marissa and Emma, both 14 y/o) read that book in school but the German version. We had to read it! We don't like it very much we both think that the book is boring. Because you can't write too much about \\"Being alone in a space without anyone\\". The topic is kind of interesting, but the author took the story too long. He always writes \\"I am Brian, I am 13, I rescued a plane crash\\" and so on.We wouldn't say that book is exciting.Marissa R. and Emma D."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd rather read a dictionary","review":"Brian's story of survival seemed interesting...at first. The story dragged out at an indescribably slow pace and was rather like reading a telephone book, or dictionary. The author repeated words to give them more meaning, and to help you feel Brians pain and yearning for his old life, which was nice, the first few times. It became extremely repetitive and made the reading unenjoyable. I would certainly not recommend this read to anyone at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sooooo boring!!","review":"In English class earlier this semester, the book the Hatchet was the topic of all of our novel studies, and english discussions! We were told to read the book in two weeks and prepare a good solid essay on our points of view! This book was soo boring.

As the plane goes into the Canadian woods, Brian must think of a away to survive the crash, and to my astonishment, he does. The rest of the book is about how this city-slicker boy survives in the wild with nothing but the clothes on his back and a hatchet. This book gives people who live in cities a good look into what it would be like to live by themselves in the wild and have no one with whom to talk. It also gave me a flash into the Stone Age.

There was no distinguishable climax, and plot structure was no where to be seen. There was sometihng unrealistic about Brian's survival attempts. It was as if the book droned on for ever, and the end was no where in sight. Things that should have been summarized and made shorter took up pages; things that should have been packed with detail, description, and emphasis took a matter of sentences.

But this summer he found the Brian series by Gary Paulsen and has read all of them - twice! Hatchet is a thrilling story of a boy's survival alone in the wilderness. Brian's Winter, The River, Brian's Return, and Brian's Hunt continue the story. My son actually took Hatchet and The River on a 2 week backpacking trip with the Boy Scouts as 'essential gear'. I've read them all and they are excellent books - well written, exciting and dealing with the topics of survival, growing up, and figuring out who you are and what is important to you. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hatchet","review":"Mr. Pualsal the book made me feel exicted about the story. Because the story had exictment, drama, and scary scenes like the tornado was good and bad for Brian.

I liked everything except the d word close to the end of the book but other wise good.From 18"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sick and Sad","review":"In my class we read this book and some of the parts are very sad and some of them were very nasty and gross. As Brian Robeson is going through this terrible accident you feel as though you are growing with him. I know as I read along in this book I felt sorry for everyone who loved and or cared about Brian. After I finished my reading for that night I would go to sleep hoping and praying that Brian would survive.

Every chapter I was waiting for something to happen. Nothing ever did. The story is very predictable. Man gets on island, man makes fire, man gets saved. This story is just like the movie \\"Cast Away\\", except instead of the man talking to a volleyball, Bryan talks to himself. What's the chance of your pilot having a heart attack, then you somehow land on a island, make fire, and survive 45 days in the wilderness? 1/1000. This book got 2 stars from me because the end played in well with all the dullness. This is like Maury, he always plays the same show more that once. But this time, Paulsen's show never got on TV. I suggest this book to old people who like action movies but not the books. I beg your pardon Gary Paulson. You are a great author. What went wrong?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Survival and nature","review":"This is a riveting novel. The character is alive, breathing and hanging on for life the whole bumpy ride.

Paulsen's style and diction merit a children's book. There is no depth, meaning, complexity, et cetera. The main thing which people who actually like this abomination cling to is Paulsen's ability to make it seem real; Of all the things one could claim, that is one of the most outrageous. This book does not convey any sense of reality at all, it merely explains the main character's illogical or simplistic actions, shallow thoughts, unrealistic emotions, and naive reactions - and moreover it does this sans any insight or purpose. Perhaps this book would be alright for kindergarteners or first-graders; beyond that, I would highly discourage anyone from even giving this book a second glance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just What I Have To Say","review":"This book wouldn't be so bad if it didn't take so long to get into the action.(Other than the plane crash.)If you don't mind waiting you might like it.

None of the pages matched up with the newer edition. In a panic the other night I ended up buying the book on my Ipad because I needed to find vocabulary words on specific pages.

Gary Paulsen's vivid language allows readers to feel as though they are with Brian on his adventure in the wilderness. Brian is a very realistic character that struggles in nature in the same way that any teenager would when abandoned in the woods alone. His resourcefulness and intelligent ideas help him to survive the very grimmest of circumstances. This story is told in the third person. This allows Paulsen to explain what Brian is doing, and yet he still shares what Brian is thinking as he lives through this experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GOOD BOOK","review":"I think hatchet was a very good book and one of few books I actualy got in to.

The book is about a boy, Brian, who crashes in a plane. The pilot is dead, so Brian is stranded in the wilderness with his only possession, a hatchet. The genre of the book is survival. A person who would like this book is someone who would like a good adventure or survival story. In the course of my author's life, he has written several fabulous novels. One is The Winter Room, another is Hatchet, or Brian's Winter. Those are only a few. When he wrote these books, he lived in New Mexico. One reason why readers would like this book is it is a book action, adventure story. A really good scene in this book is when the plane is crashing. Another reason why readers would like this book is because it has good description of things. Like when the plane crashes, or where the book describes the forest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hatchet - the story of a young boy alone in the wilderness","review":"I'm 14, and we were studying survival in English, this book along with a couple more were made compulsory to read, and this was the only one i enjoyed.

Growing up in rural Kentucky, I spent many a wonderous hour in the Appalachian Foothills and learned to love and respect nature at it's best and worst. I tell my boys that nature rewards knowledge and seldom forgives foolishness or ignorance. Nature is neither cruel or kind; it is what is.&quot;Hatchet&quot; illustrates this superbly.

I liked it and am waiting for someone to check in \\"The River\\" at school. The reason why I gave it 4 out of 5 stars was because it was really gorry. It was a good book and kept me on the edge of my seat.

Good job Gary Paulson and keep writing those great books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hatchet","review":"When I read Hatchet I thought it was quite boring. The ending wasn't really good because Bryan kept looking and drooling at food. During this book, Bryan kept on saying he knew \\"THE SECRET.\\" He was always scared of things, so I thought he was a wimp. The book was way too short but it was easy to read. One good thing about the book is that it told you how to survive if you were stranded in the middle of nowhere. The author was Gary Paulsen and some of his books are good, but not this one. I wouldn't read this book if I were you. You will start the book, you'll hear \\"THE SECRET,\\" and after that you will put the the book down.

Another reason I found the book to be so wonderful is because It's by my favorite author, Gary Palson. Most of his books are a true story about himself.

A young boy with a frustrating home life. But as Brian boards a small airplane taking him to see his father in Canada he realizes he is the only passenger. Quickly frustration becomes fear. However the flight seems to be going fine and the fear seems to wane. That is until the pilot dies of a heart attack and sends the tiny plane plummeting into the ground. Miraculously Brian survives the plane which landed in a small lake. But can he survive the hunger, the animals, the elements, and the loneliness he will find in the Canadian forest when he has nothing but a small hatchet to help him?This is a great story if you like adventure and nature tales. Though it starts out a little slow it picks up quickly and draws you in to it. The under story about Brian's parents and home life gets a little confusing at times but mostly it helps enrich the story. I recommend this book for ages 10 and up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Human endurance and survival against extreme conditions","review":"If you like this book, and survival by your own wits stories in general, check out two amazing books which are TRUE stories. \\"The Long Walk\\" and \\"Adrift\\".

My 8-year old and I read this book together and compared it to \\"My Side of the Mountain,\\" also a boy's survival story: Hatchet was preferred by both of us for its drama and the depth of emotion the author provides for the boy, Brian Robeson. Life lessons in this story include determination (building a fire) and the ability to change yourself by recalling things you have learned in your past and pulling from your inner strength. Brian's toughening to both the environment and his family's split makes the reader realize that we should appreciate what we have and accept the things we cannot control."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Out Look of Out Doors!","review":"If you like adventuresome books, you should read this one.

It's an exciting adventure story about Brian, a 13 year old boy who must fend for himself in the Canadian wilderness. The author wrote it in such a way that I found myself wondering what I would do in Brian's situation. It was tense and realistic, but still had moments of humor (such as when he names his raft \\"Brushpile One\\", or when he gets a sudden windfall of food and decides to first \\"eat until he drops\\" and then be careful and ration the food.)There are some gory and upsetting parts, but I didn't find it depressing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hatchet","review":"HatchetA boy, trapped on an island wondering what to do. He is stranded out where no one can find him. What should he do? Gary Paulson's book, Hatchet, is a great book for people who like adventure and survival books. Personally, I like the book for many reasons. First, the book has a lot of action, and second, I can relate to the book a little bit. One of the best reasons I read the book is because my friends said that it was a great book to read. When I started reading the book I could see how the boy who got stranded felt. The best section throughout the book was probably when the boy figured out how he really missed his parents and how he wishes he could have a second chance.

This book has too many gross descriptions. For example, when Brian shoots the animals and when the dead pilot is mentioned, the author gives overly gory details. But, perhaps this is what living in the wilderness is like. Because of this, boys might like this book better than girls might. I did feel bad for Brian, since his parents are divorced and he was all alone. Besides being gory, The Hatchet is also a little depressing and a bit boring.

The difference being is that Irving decided to write short stories where the reader does not have nearly as much time to dive into the book as other authors allow.

Instead we're sentenced to two hours of the dreadful Kate Capshaw. It's not necessarily that she's a bad actress; she just seems like an awful person. Ellen DeGeneres isn't much more fun to watch. And the solution to the mystery of the love letter is not merely ridiculous; it's insultingly stupid.Tom Selleck, as always, lights up the screen (too bad he's only on it for about 15 minutes), and the other supporting players are fine as well.

I admit that some of the satisfaction I got from viewing this movie came from the sight of the young male actor's attractive physique. At least it helped me understand the main character's temptation. I could imagine myself in her place. If only life was fair, I would be.

The main problem is the way characters are managed through the movie, what give us a movie which centers mainly in only one character (Kate Capshaw's), and leaves the rest of the cast unatended and undeveloped, which is a shame, most of all to Ellen DeGeneres and Julianne Nicholson's characters, because these two give the best acting in the movie. The other problem is that a movie with really one character is not necesarilly bad, had it not been that Kate Capshaw acting is so flat and boring, that one ends up not caring for the character.In a brief: Bad script, lousy direction, dreadful lead actress, good supporting cast; but poorly managed with very little on-screen time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could give it less than 1 star","review":"Boring, Boring, Boring.

I finally watched it last night and could not believe how slow and boring it turned out to be. I generally like movies that are slow and have very little action, but this was just too much. I guess my greatest disappointment came from the fact that it was such a good storyline and it was hard to believe that someone could do so little with it. I'd like to see another director take the same plot and develop it into a more interesting story. It just seemed that there was so much more that could have been done here."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the most boring movies ever made","review":"Don't even go there. If ever a movie needed a car chase to liven things up this is it. Badly written and dull in the extreme. If you need a romance theme watch While You Were Sleeping again."},{"rating":"1","title":"I won't be sharing this book with the kiddos....","review":"What a horrible lesson in sharing. This book only teaches that it is okay to be selfish. I was shocked when I read this to the end, thankfully not to my little ones, and was sad to see it did not redeem itself. Definitely not a story about sharing...but rather a lesson in being self centered."},{"rating":"1","title":"SHOCK HORROR!!!","review":"Oh MY lord! I was expecting a whole load of bad reviews on this cd, as it was DEFINATELY a bad cd! I mean ..apart from Liberty Bell, what the hell was nice? This slow crap, which is not heavy enough, and this long boring beat, while she goes on and on about noting in particular, I was VERY dissapointed with this album, I should NOT have got it. I mean it was way too light, and look at the cover, what on earth is this yellow stuff? I don't know, I'm not going completely put it down, her voice is still as enchanting as ever, and some of the \\"ballads\\" I guess you could call them pretty nice if you're snoozing and have nothing better to listen to, but I found this too peaceful and psychadelic for my liking, and many people said it was too commercial. I agree, please go back to what you were like during Mandylion The Gathering. Sorry to dampen the good reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"definitely one for the ages","review":"I am a relative newcomer to the genius that is The Gathering. I bought this and 'Souvenirs' at the same time, and although 'Souvenirs' is amazing in it's own right, this is way more bang for your buck, with such memorable tracks as 'Frail', 'Travel', and 'Probably Built In The Fifties' just to name a few. Over and over again I find myself yearning to hear this cd no matter what I'm doing. I can't recommend this cd enough, Anneke's vocals are as good as you get pretty much. I like every track on this cd but 'Red Is A Slow Colour' tends to get repetitive to me, and the lyrics are the kind that are so strange that they become tattooed inside your brain. With that minor complaint aside, I recommend this cd to everyone for one track, 'Travel'. This track is so astounding that I have heard it about 15 times now, and everytime I find something new I like about it. Anneke's vocals seem to be at their peak on this track. All I can say is this cd is worth every penny I payed."},{"rating":"1","title":"How To Measure A Planet?","review":"Extremely disappointing, to say the least! This album has it's moments, but they are few and far between, and not enough to balance out the extreme bordom this album creates. I love slow, quiet, melodic music, but with the condition that it's catchy and entertaining. This album is neither. I love Mandylion and Nighttime Birds, and listen to them both frequently, but I'm afraid How To Measure A Planet? will not be played nearly as often. This is a two star album; one star for Anneke's beautiful (but on this album, rather boring) voice and another star for the great talent of the others' (which they decided not to put to a lot of use on this album). I'm hoping If_Then_Else will proove that we all make mistakes, but they can be amended."},{"rating":"1","title":"a big step backwards","review":"I own the first two major releases by this group, and they are wonderful. This album, though, sounds like a collection of b-sides, with none of the hard rocking or symphonic chord changes of the other two albums. This album is one CD too long, and even then it's half sound effects and static. Almost every song is in a dreary slow-jam beat, reminiscent of a group called Renaissance from the late '70's. This album, I hate to say, is virtually unlistenable. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"just plain terrible","review":"The best album of 1997 was easily \\"The Gathering.\\" This new album, however, sounds like the group is trying to do too much and forgot the most important stuff that made them great--the metal, the rock and those delicious chord moves that sent chills up and down your spine. I was thoroughly bored by this trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"a sellout/concept album","review":"i was amazed at what i heard. this was the only gathering cd at the store. first of all this isnt metal. its kinda electronic rock sometimes. the vocals by annek are wonderful. but there are hardly any guitars at all. and the lyrics arent doom anymore. if you want metal with great female vocals buy either nighttime birds or mandylion. this isnt recommended for metal fans. BY ALL MEANS DO NOT GET THIS CD IF YOUR A METAL FAN! even though its good stuff its definitely NOT METAL"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's been a long time...","review":"It's been 12 years since I wrote my first bad review of this album.

Gathering, your 15 minutes was up LOOOOONNNNGGGGGG ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"leave it or love it","review":"The Gathering seems to be one of those bands that you either love or hate. I hate it. I think it is not musical and certainly not subtle. Above that I have a problem with the voice of Anneke van Giersbergen. And besides that this is their worst cd. Sorry, that's what I think"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the heavy guitar sound?","review":"I was very excited when I heard there was a new album of The Gathering and I immediately bought it. But hey, where is that typical heavy guitar sound that was on the two other albums? There are only a few songs that have that special The Gathering sound. Okay, the album sure sounds great and is well produced, but next time put more songs like 'Liberty Bell' on the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful...","review":"I gather this is quite a departure for the band, but not having heard their previous stuff (aside from seeing the video for \\"Leaves,\\" from Mandylion), I didn't have much in the way of preconceptions.I've seen reviews and websites that refer to the Gathering as a doom or progressive metal band, but what this CD reminds me of is All About Eve and some of Sarah McLachlan's older stuff. Beautiful female vocals, lush and powerful arrangements... what's not to like?This music would work just fine on a mix tape with, say, Garmarna, Kate Bush, Siouxsie and the Banshees, and the aforementioned All About Eve and Sarah McLachlan. And that's pretty good company to be in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different than before!!","review":"This album is totally different than Mandylion and Nighttime Birds, but the lyrics are good and Anneke's voice hasn't changed. Which makes this album one of my favourites of this year, it's relaxing music but the lyrics will waken you!! Buy and enjoy is all I got to say!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Review From a Music Fan in Detroit Michigan Area.","review":"This is deffinitly a great album. One of the best in my current CD collection to date. The Gathering uses a great combination of female harmony vocals and great music laong with it. This is the kind of music that can deffinitly get stuck in your head and you could go on sing ign it forever. I suggest it to anyone who enjoys music from the metal and rock genre aspeacially interested in female vocals. This lead singer can sing great."},{"rating":"2","title":"White Gold Bracelet","review":"I love this bracelet for its \\"wear-ability\\".

At 21, the impetuous Miss Sophia has lived her with her grandmother, Lady Alicia, in London for several years now. She moved in with her since her mother's passing and can't stand to live with her step mother. At a ball, Miss Sophia hugs the Earl of Wynwood believing it is her cousin whom she hasn't seen in almost 11 years. He is rude to her and she ends up creating other mishaps in his presence increasing his dislike of her. She is invited to the earl's country estate since Lady Alicia is close friend's with his mother and Miss Sophia begins to make havoc there. I wont go into much detail into the cast and various incidents since I dont want to spoil the book.Story flowed nicely, entertaining cast and at times funny dialogue.I really hope they begin selling her books through kindle. I really enjoyed this clean regency romance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are the songs?","review":"How can I review this album if I don't know what songs are on this album. There is no track list on the album's page. Please put the track titles on the Ramon Ayala pages. Many of them don't have the track lists. Without the list, it is very hard to choose wich album we would like to purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really learned a lot!","review":"I am a pretty new private pilot and the title grabbed my attention. I read and enjoyed the vast majority of the content and gained valuable insight from a definite pro.

But season 3 you still had the pros making the final tables, very fun to watch!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boycotting World Poker Tour","review":"I stopped watching the World Poker Tour entirely. I only watched them in the first place because they put them on DVD, and since they screwed up season 3 by eliminating episodes, and then failed to release any subsequent seasons, I just don't watch anymore. It's a shame, because I'd like to continue watching every episode they've made so far. So now I watch poker videos or WSOP dvds to get my poker fix. I've practically forgotten about WPT.Saying the same thing about this screw-up as with the UFC, if you don't release everything, from the beginning, I refuse to watch. (UFC is still missing #1 and #2, both of which Hoyce Gracie won) So if WPT wants me as a paying watcher again, they will release ALL of season 3, and then begin releasing subsequent seasons.No wonder the stock is in the dumps, they have no idea what we want."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Small","review":"I was really expecting something big enough for my baby green cheek conure.

I slapped on the knee pads and had to nearly cut off the circulation in my leg to attach the straps. Then I went nuts and knelt down. The straps fought me every inch of the way to the ground until they finally gave up when I made contact. I am hoping with a few rounds of paintball the straps will stretch out enough to get them even close to comfortable. Same goes for the elbow pads. I would say they are built for your average teenage player...not your average giant. Bigger Buyer Beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good enough","review":"The knee pads were slightly asymmetrical, as though the cup had been riveted to the pad upside down on one of them.

They did the job and they look really great with a layer of chrome silver spray paint."},{"rating":"2","title":"They work.","review":"I have no prior experience with tactical pads but decided to order what turned out to be a great deal for only $15.The knee pads fit just fine and the elbow pads are barely big enough for my larger-than-average arms. Their construction seems durable, including cross-stitched bands. So far they have withstood a whole day of rough woodland airsofting. As for comfort and performance: When I wear them, it's practical to crouch, but I've found that they're a bit too rigid for duck-walking and they slip a little too much for extended low-crawling.All in all, I'm sold; they allow me to quickly and comfortably get into and stay into the most typical airsoft-related positions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the $15 I payed for them","review":"These pads fell apart the minute I put them on.

I suggest, if you aren't going into church work to purchase the less expensive abridged version of this book, however called \\"called to believe\\", it should suit your needs. For all those who want to read a extensive introduction to Lutheran theology, you will find this to be golden.

Since we have driven over the river numerous times, I was curious to learn more about it. The author was a journalist for the Philadelphia Enquirer. I was quite impressed with all of the work and research which went into writing this book. It is organized into chapters on various aspects of the history, such as settling the towns, floods, and shad restoration. It is so well-written and easy to understand that one can pick it up and read where one left off, remembering previous information in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very deep and soulful book of poems.","review":"This is a must have book for all readers. After I started reading poem after poem, I could not put this book down. Some of them were very touching, mystical and funny. I read the whole book at one shot.

Also the price is very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very very very cool and unusual book!","review":"For the language, skill and craft I would certainly get this... a true artists book. The cover is awesome... okay I know thats a bad reason to buy a book... but I did. The poems were unreal...The variety of experiences that are covered inthis collection is truly amazing. So much time and space is covered that at first I wondered if he was for real or not(did he really travel to all those places?)...but the details are so specific that it was real... sort of like a time machine. granted, some of the poems were not as strong as the others... but on the whole I would say its a good investment...

Ben Ali is truly talented and I am not only saying this because he is a cousin of mine. This collection is filled with such reality that it seems so sureal, but the reality is that this book is filled with emotions, experiences, and thoughts that only a true artist and writer can convey. There are just no words to describe what a wonderful collection of poetry this book contains. From beginning to end you will be so captivated that you will definitely not want to put this book down. Ben reminds us that life is filled with so much meaning, that we as humans look past it everyday, yet he sees it and brings it to life for us.I can only hope there is a sequel:) Ben I am so Proud of YOU!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Work","review":"I loved the texture and rich imagery in the poems.

They have unique situations, characters and plots. There is humor and human interest and \\"Dead on the Dance Floor\\" is no exception. It was very interesting to enter the world of professional ballroom dancing and to meet various personalities as you might expect in the real world. Ms. Graham did a great job on research and making the story come to life.

A fun read and wonderful surprises!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't even get through it.","review":"I have enjoyed some --but not all --of Heather Graham's works. Dead on the Dance Floor had a promising premise, especially since I'm a dancer myself. However, I couldn't even get through this one. I finally gave up. Graham often has too many minor characters in her books which muddle the story. This one had a lot of those with all of the teachers and dancers at the school. It was difficult keeping track of who was who."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow Dance","review":"Was very drawn out.....come on already and get to the point!

After reading this book though, I realized, more than ever, that my fears were not so unusual or wrong. Beverly Sinke's words took my most sought-out questions and gave them new hope and light. She is truly inspirational -- she has been through so much pain, and yet, looks to life and God with outstretched arms. And not only do we read her inspirational words, but many other great thinkers interwoven into the novel. We all have something to learn from Beverly's autobiography; foremost, that our relationship to God is too precious to be cast aside because of tragedy. If you have any doubts about your faith, make yourself acquainted with this story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really works!","review":"I was skeptical when I bought this, and was surprised to learn that it really does work most of the time.

This CD doesn't put me to sleep at all--in fact, it keeps me awake. I find myself listening to the music instead of going to sleep.One of the pieces has irritating and dissonant passages mingled with relaxing, soothing passages. Also the music changes tempo and volume quite often, which would wake me up if I did start to drift off.Since I expected something that would put me to sleep, listening to this is upsetting, because I wasted my money.However, since it works well for most reviewers, I figure I must hear things differently, or have a harder time falling asleep than most. Maybe if I listened to it enough to get used to it, it might work better.I would like to find something totally soothing and relaxing--maybe I need actual recordings of water or rain, but I prefer music.

Not only that but when I woke 5 hours later and turned it on again hoping to just enjoy the music - right----didn't make it through Track 1 again and got another 2 hours of sound sleep.

Some of the music made my heart race and then I could not fall sleep. I tried this CD 4 times before calling it quits. I would not recommend this CD. I have resulted to using my very loud air purifier as white noise so that as I sleep the street sounds do not wake me up, but recently someone recommended to me trying a Homedics SoundSpa machine, which has all kinds of natural sounds for background noise when sleeping. I may try it. I hope this review helps."},{"rating":"1","title":"misleading advertising","review":"Somehow, from the description of this album, I expected jazz to sleep by.

Not only is it less damaging to your hair (and wallet) than other dyes, but they have the best selection of reds! I receive a lot of compliments on how natural and pretty the color is whenever I use the Bright Auburn or Light Auburn shades, and find that even the faded color is quite pretty. Like all red hair dye, it tends to fade quickly, but I've found that with proper care the color can stay pretty vibrant up to about two weeks, holding the redish tones for three or four. I'd recommend this brand for anyone considering going a ginger tone or anyone who doesn't want to fry the hell out of their hair with other boxed dyes. Overall, perfect hair dye at the perfect price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Recommended - damages hair and fades rapidly!","review":"I strongly discourage anyone from using this terrible product. I purchased this product for my naturally medium brown hair that is perhaps 5% gray, and deeply regret using it. The product was very drying and damaging, even after a week of daily deep conditioning with my own conditioner (the included conditioner is a single use pouch.) More importantly, the color fades rapidly. I purchased this because I was tired of how quickly the semi-permanent 28-day dyes fade, but this is worse! Although the initial result was a beautiful rich brown just as pictured, the gray faded back to gray in one week and the brown faded to an ugly brassy color in 2 weeks. Unfortunately, the brassy color has not faded back to my original. The Clairol semi-permanent dye lasts longer without damaging hair and fades back to the original color not this brassy color."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing like color swatch at ALL.","review":"My hair was pretty light, and I put this on wanting the wonderful color on the box and swatch.

There was zero, and I mean ZERO hint of any color in this other than brown."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work well on black hair.","review":"I even left this product in for 35 minutes and it only slightly lightened my dark hair. I was hesitant to use it because of the health hazards and the dryness I felt in the sample lock of hair I dyed; had it not been a gift, I would not have used it (did it for courtesy).

The exception was 4th Avenue Jones' rendition of \\"Jesus Freak\\", that one sounded pretty good. In my opinion, Gotee Records missed the mark with this one, though I love most of their artists.

It is very very easy to replace; no hand tools are required! You won't even get your hands dirty. The filter has a small arrow on one side which indicates the direction of air flow. In this case, the air flows down, so the arrow should point down when you install the filter.The filter installs in a small door in the left rear of the vehicle. Installation takes about 1 minute (if that). My local dealer quoted $75 to replace this filter! I usually write the date and mileage on the filter when I install it so I can easily track how long it's been since it was replaced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy online and save","review":"These filters cost around $50.00 from the dealer. Saved big bucks by buying it here on Amazon. It is identical in every way to the original factory filter that I took out of our 2008 Escape Hybrid. I like having my vehicles serviced at my Ford dealership, but am not about to over pay for parts. If they are only a few dollars higher than aftermarket prices, I will not make the extra effort to find parts elsewhere.

This CD will bring back memories if you ever host an 80's party in the future. It will keep the old schoolers dancing in the Soul Train Line when they hear \\"Ain't Gonna Hurt Nobody\\" by Brick, \\"Back in Stride\\" by Maze featuring Frankie Beverly.

These jeans are thinner material, have a different label, and shrank in size right after I washed them. They don't have the rivet on the pockets and are generally cheaper in feel. Since these are the jeans that came up when I typed in 31MWZWK, I believed that that was what I was getting. I actually think that they might be a \\"knock-off\\" rather than the real thing.

Woven amongst the daily events are facts about this famous artist and explanations as to why he used his unique technique and signature bright colors.The style of writing makes this suitable for reading aloud to children aged 3 and up. The story is easy to read but is not patronizing in tone. It is perfect for a first biography about Van Gogh for young children.

Very useful and applicable stuff!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No scripture","review":"I read this book twice: once after going to a seminar conducted by the author, and the second time in preparation for leading my own men's study many years later. My recollection was that it was a powerful and helpful book, but I was greatly disappointed the second time around. On the second reading I realized that while the author trumpets God vision for men throughout the book, he doesn't back it up with Scripture. He just simply asserts Biblical truths (maybe?) without grounding you in God's word as a way to get there. By all means read it, if you are trying to understand Biblical manhood, but ask questions to yourself as you read, and supplement this book with your own studies of Scripture. You might want to go to somebody like Wayne Grudem to get fully grounded Scriptural answers on these topics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read for every man and Pastor","review":"I have been using this book from the beginning ofpublication. Had given away my last copy and purchased to use some materials out of the book ona series of sermons on Fathers. I have given this book away on Fathers Day and used it as a must read as a Pastor for Dads who were looking for help. In the message to fathers, I also recommended that those who did not have the book to purchase a copy. I used this book in the message as a reference along with a book on children and teens by Dr. Ross Campbell, MD. Highly recommend both of these books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book for Christian Men","review":"Steve Farrar does a fine job of laying out how Christian men should live their lives in Point Man. I first read this book back in the 1990s when Promise Keepers was getting started. I recently reread it, and found it full of reminders about what I should be doing as a Christian husband and father. I like the fact that Farrar does not pull any punches, but uses a direct style that does not leave much room for interpretation.Overall it is a great read, but I would not label it a classic. It has some really strong chapters about marriage, spiritual disciplines, raising godly children. But, it has a few segways that are distracting. I definitely recommend Point Man for any young man who is wondering what to do as a man of God. It is also useful for older men who may be struggling, or remain clueless about what masculine Christianity is all about. This book will help point you in the right direction."},{"rating":"1","title":"This can really hurt a family, REALLY!","review":"This is scary bad. Our small group-study at church is going through this, and it's making me sick. The men's-group is rallying around this like it's a miracle answer to all of their family issues, but it's just smoke. The author is NOT teaching relationship skills, but just rules for a plutocratic relationship. There's so much more to being a family leader then just having testicles and a bible."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK advice wrapped in offensive glossy & stupid theory","review":"Some helpful practical tips on things like prayer, but you have to get past some awful drivel to get there. In the attempt to convince the fathers he's aiming at that they should invest more time and love on their kids (not a bad thing itself), he makes ridiculous and offensive dismissals, such as: mothers as irrelevant to parenting; any family structure other than nuclear as having only existed in the last generation - dismissing entire continents and ages; and any generation apart from the present one as unimportant.Like I say, you get past this and the macho allusions they're dressed in, and there's some OK advice. However there is also the pernicious subtext that, 'Don't worry if your son is greedy, materialistic and unGodly, just so long as he's straight, gets and stays married, holds down a decent job, and doesn't touch drugs, phew, you've won the war.'"},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye opening","review":"My kids are grown and on their own but I wish I would have had this book when I first became a father.

Dana Matherson is the average big, mean bully who tortures Roy. Officer Delinko and Curly are the men who keep watch on Mother Paula's All American Pancake house, where the story is set.

I think I've read every book of his with the exception of Hoot and his other kids book. They're the best.With Hoot, I was expecting some of the language to be toned down. And it was. But it was still typical of what I'd expect to read in a Hiaasen novel, just for kids. He did a great job with the kids and painting a picture of Florida.If I had to fault the book, I'd say that the overall message of anti-corporation / conservation is a little bit strong in this book. It's been present in every one of his other books. Maybe because it was for kids I noticed it more?

Beatrice Leep is an athlete and ends up not likening Roy but then they become friends.Roy's problem is that he wants to know why this boy is running, but Beatrice wants him to mind his own business.When Roy gets home he goes back to the golf course and falls into a mysterious hole in the ground and then he faces a life-threatening encounter.My favorite part of Hoot was when the groundbreaking ceremony was held and Roy, Beatrice, and the mysterious boy speak their minds about the pancake house.I have never read a book with an ending like this.

There are some people that want to build a pancake house on a piece of property that is inhabited a group of owls that are almost extinct. When the people try to build the resturant, funny things keep happening that delay the construction. All I can tell you is that what happens from there is down right funny. I think the book is appealing for students between ages of ten and fourteen. I thnik that older students might think it was dumb. I think the book is awesome. It is one of the most enterining books that I have read.

My eyes were glued to this book, it was exciting and fun, but you never know what was going to happen next. This book also captivates a young audience; I would recommend it to anyone ages 11-14. It also had so many surprises in it. You could read it casually and then all of the sudden your eyes would widen with thrill. I also loved Carl Hiaasen's style of writing. It really draws you in, because he uses realistic language that thirteen year old actually use today. Not to mention the plot was also realistic, and could happen in everyday life. I would also unquestionably recommend his next book, Flush, to anyone out there.

While it's not the most horrible thing in the world, I guess, teachers and parents should be aware it's in there. I'm puzzled as to why a children's book, and one that's apparently won awards, has swear words in it. Also, the synopsis on the book jacket described the story of a boy who moves to a new school and finds an unusual person to be friends with. However, my son told me the main points of the story were environmentalist in nature, coming out against a company developing land in Florida.

I frankly think those readers just want more of the same, and that Hiaasen was carefully writing to a different audience and had different effects intended. It's something to get a Newberry Honor for your first effort that would qualify for the award."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor role models!","review":"This book is terrible. The first time the owls are mentioned you know where the whole story is going. There are no characters with good qualitites. Main character lies to everyone and frames a kid who gets arrested. But that's okay. The boy who gets arrested already has a record so he would probably end up in juvie anyway. We learn that from a school counselor who tells her son, who promises not to tell but does. The story involves verbally and physically abusive parents as if this is common and less of a concern than owls. There is an instance of swearing. Also one kid moons another. I wish the author had just written a sign saying \\"Save the Owls\\" and saved me a lot of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read Aloud","review":"I really enjoyed the characters in Hoot.

Would you maybe trespass and potentially go to jail to save them? Or would you rather eat pancakes? Carl Hiaasen answers these questions in his novel Hoot.Mullet Fingers is trying to save those owls. The owls are in danger because a pancake house is trying to open a restaurant right over the owl burrows. Roy, the main character, gets hooked into helping the owls with Mullet Fingers. They need to get proof that the pancake house can't build their restaurant over the owls. The only way to get proof is to trespass in the fenced area, which is, were the owls are.To find out if the baby owls are saved and Roy and Mullet Fingers go to jail or not read the book Hoot, it's a hoot!

The Florida adventure starts when on his way to school, Roy Eberhardt sees a shoeless boy running down the street. Curious why the boy is not going to school, Roy decides to find out who he is. The new kid Roy and the shoeless truant joins together on a secret mission-saving a family of endangered burrowing owls from being destroyed by the construction of a pancake restaurant on the lot where their home is located. Transplanted Montanian Roy is thrust into a world of capitalistic adults, limelight-loving politicians, school bullies,child abuse, and civil disobedience. Filled with humor, it also touches on the realities of child abuse and destruction of wildlife habitats. The manipulation of the bully was masterful, but you can't help feeling sorry for him in the end. Watch out for those alligators in the porta-potties!

And so begins a fun, suspensful adventure with new friends, some of them with feathers.I loved this book! My cousin recommended it to me but it was only recently that I actually gave it a chance. The cover is unique, and I think it's cute now, but it was also kind of misleading in the way that I thought it was about some silly talking owl. The story really surprised me, and I found myself not being able to put it down. There was some mild swearing, but nothing really bad. Some parts were kind of unbelievable, but it was a neat book.

As it turned out, Hiaasen just didn't carry his vehicle particularly deftly. The characters are paper-thin: frankly, we just don't give a HOOT about them. Roy is dull and predictable; the police are run-of-the-mill buffoons; and, as for the mysterious, barefooted Mullet Fingers, I couldn't care whether he lacerated both plantae on one of those new onion slicer gadgets. I wish I had taken a \\"pass\\" rather than invested three hundred pages in this trivium."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hoot Flew too far to the left for me","review":"This book was funny at first, but it got too politically correct for me. There is a definite left-wing, socialist message in this book--that government--and government regulations--are good and are there to save us from the big bad corporations. (All the people who work the restaurant chain are stereotypical, cardboard villains; in contrast, the main character's likeable father works for the federal government.) Some may say that you shouldn't take this book too seriously--that it's just a \\"comedy.\\" But it gets pretty serious as it goes along, and I think we should be teaching our kids to like businesses, because they create jobs, and to hate government regulations because they choke small business and risk taking and stifle job growth.

Roy is often getting picked on because he moved from Montana; he is always being called Tex or Cowgirl. One day on the way to school Roy was looking out the window and saw a mysterious boy running full speed and barefoot! Roy gets so interested in the boy that he jumps off the bus and runs after him. Roy and the boy meet and become friends, the Running Boy tells Roy about these owls living on a construction site and how they are going to be killed if they don't stop the bulldozers. So Roy and the running boy go through many obstacles trying to save the owls. To find out if Roy and the Running Boy save the owls read Hoot.P.S. read the book before you see the movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hoot","review":"The book Hoot is a very exciting children's adventure book written by Carl Hiaasen. This book will keep you on the edge of your seat, wondering what will happen next. The book, Hoot takes place in a town call Coconut Cove after Roy Eberheart is forced to move there with his family from Montana. In this book Roy has to battle many obstacles, such as a bully, Dana Matheson and attempt to rescue burrowing owls from getting bulldozed over for the new Mother Paula's Pancake House. He assists a mysterious running boy who has been erased from society and his step sister, Beatrice in his attempt to save the owls before they get buried alive. The become the best of friends in the process. Will they be able to stop the buldozers in time?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and funny","review":"Even though this is tailored for young adults I found it very enjoyable and the author made me think again about how just a few people can make a difference in the world around them. I have enjoyed several books on CD from this author and I always look forward to the quirky characters he writes about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hoot Hoot Book","review":"I rated this book 5 star besaus,its a great book. Hoot as lots of misteries. One boy, A new house, a new school, a new friend,a new bullies,and even more problems. You should read this book!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This book was recommended to me by Amazon.com after buying other books for my 11 year old son. We both read it and I have to say it was a great story for kids as well as adults.. Carl Hiaasen deserved the Newberry award that he recently won for this!! I would love to find more books like it. Thank you for the recommendation!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Use of 'poor' language in a book for ten year olds!","review":"I gave this book to my 10 year old and within the first five pages, she came accross the 'd' word in the text. I quote from page 4, \\"They yanked em' out of the ground, every d#@* one of them.\\" It is used by a construction worker who is talking to a police man but regardless, it is unnecessary. Although I am well award my child has heard it as well as other words,I don't believe it should be used by a children's author who is writing for 10 year olds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"As a fan of Hiaasen's adult fiction and an environmentalist, I couldn't wait to read this book with my kids. What a disappointment. Sure, there's a story there, about a boy who stands up against the illegal destruction of a protected species - but the author seems to have replaced the outrageous humor of his other stories with tons of explanation and repetition, as if he's making sure kids might understand. Try reading \\"Notes from a Liar and Her Dog\\", or \\"The House of the Scorpion\\", or \\"Holes\\", instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful! Awful! Awful!","review":"This book proves that awards are given to authors, not books. I cannot imagine one of the middle school students that I have ever taught in my eight years enjoying this book. It is long, dull, and preachy. The characters and conflicts are unrealistic. If I had not been forced to read it for our adolescent book club, I would have abandoned it after page 3.Don't fall prey to the flashy colors on the cute cover. Just don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just awful","review":"My son read this book as a summer book report project, and for fun I read it as well. The best I can say is that it at least gave me an opportunity to discuss politics with him. The pro-environmental / anti-corporate slant is a bit heavy handed and quite trite. The expository repitition is mind-numbing, and the characters act most unrealistically (but very conveniently for the message). Apart from the environmentalism, which I usually don't mind, the author plays with gender roles a bit too enthusiastically for my taste. Even my son wondered why the protagonist was so infatuated with this mysterious \\"running boy\\". Bizarre at best, bad propaganda at worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mom's review","review":"Hoot has language problems for an elementary-age book. And the subject matter is filled with EPA rhetoric. Stay clear.I'm just glad I read this before I let my 5th grader read this junk. As I write this, I'm only 1/2 way through but will finish...even if it bores me to death. Don't waste your money. And save some trees by not buying this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carl needs to stick to the grown-ups","review":"I love Hiaasen's fiction. I was excited to know he was coming out with a book aimed at a younger audience so I could share him with my 12 year old, Sam not being quite ready for the likes of \\"Tourist Season\\". He and I read it together. Half way through he was begging me to put it down and start another book. I kept telling him we needed to keep going since I knew there would be a hilarious ending. Well, there wasn't. The book was boring, and the attempts at the Hiaasen humor didn't translate to this level of readership. The characters were not nearly as colorful as in his adult books. Bottom line-it just wasn't funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hoot - a study in ecological terrorism and vandalism","review":"What an offensive book depicting ecological terrorism and crime masquerading as righteous activities by children! ELF (listed by the FBI as an American terrorist organization accused of vandalizing millions of dollars worth of private property) would be proud. In the book, parents are clueless but well-meaning, school officials are inept, corporations are greedy and employees stupid, politicans are corrupt, and vandalism to property is condoned, all depicted through the eyes, of course, of an innocent child. This book does not belong on anybody's reading list - unless, of course, you belong to that part of the population who thinks capitalism, private property and profits are dirty words."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boo","review":"I hated the book Hoot.

As all the books of CH is easy and fast to read, it will keep you interested in the story of the owls and the new restaurant that other people want to build in that space."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a Hoot!","review":"Loved the book as i do all Carl Hiiasen creations. Easy read, would be fun for kids as well; I believe that was the intended audience, butokay for adults as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jasons best book","review":"Hoot is a very exciting book. Hoot is a story about a couple of kids that are trying to stop a construction site from building a restaurant. The reason that they are trying to stop the construction of the restaurant, is that their are burowing owl's that live on the construction site and they want to save them before they build over the owls burrows. Again this story is very exciting and a joy to read and if you like adventure books you will have lots of fun reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Honestly?","review":"Hoot is an exceptional book with a respectable message. While I was reading it I was thinking it's okay, that's interesting, hmmm, aha, oh, ect. But what I never thought was wow!, cool, haha, weird, oh no! and so on. I felt like the author lacked passion, the comedy was juvenile, and the drama unrealistic. When I was done reading I was actually a little relieved it was over! That has never happened to me before. So read the book if you are a great Hiaasen fan, or 8 and under, but otherwise set the book down; walk away with your hands raised; and forget about the whole crazy idea of reading it. Cause honestly, it just ain't too special."},{"rating":"2","title":"Starts Slowly, Ends Well","review":"Hiaasen takes a while to get into the kid lit groove. The first third of the book seems a bit confused, as Hiaasen fights his urge to steer his characters into his usual adults-only mayhem. He fashions a protagonist who is unreasonably precocious and spends too much time setting up adult characters.And then, when Roy's mother has a bed-time heart-to-heart with her son, Hiaasen finds his groove. The rest of the book flies (pardon the pun) as Hiaasen finds the right balance of madcap action for the \\"tween\\" reader.Adults who are put off by profanity will find this an appropriate introduction to Hiaasen's sly humor and progressive outlook. And kids who can make it through the first third of the book will find their reward in a heart-warming and hilarious epilogue.If you read \\"The Lorax\\" to your children as toddlers, give them \\"Hoot\\" when they start reading novels. They'll love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Hoot of a read!","review":"I loved Hoot! I am the mom of a sixth grader, who was required to read this book for school. I read most of her books, because I love good material. I found this to be a great book because it takes place in current times, it is ecologically sound and you just have to love the characters! Kids and adults will love this book and looking out for the underdog (oops underowl!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Summer Reading","review":"I just read \\"Hoot\\" because my little brother had it lying around as part of his summer reading list. I actually read three of his summer books just because they all sucked me in within the first few pages. I am always disturbed when I hear people, adults and children alike, state that they hate to read. I wonder how anybody can hate to read when there are books like \\"Hoot\\". I immediately fell in love with Roy, the small, bullied kid who has such a great outlook on life. Maybe if more children read about a kid who was being pushed around but saw that he could endure and still be a productive individual, more people would come out in this world and feel as though they can contribute and are worth something to society. I thank Carl Hiaasen for a very entertaining and thought provoking read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who is the good guy here?","review":"I read Flush and found it to be a fun read. Hoot is not a fun read and has little redeeming value: Mushy, ineffective parents who are in denial, a \\"protagonist\\" who lies whenever he can to manipulate the 'bad' guys, lies to bumbling police, lies to all parents and teachers and lies to the hospital -anywhere that the end justifies the means. All the adults are inept and the 'juvie' bad guy 'deserves' to be framed. Roy, the main character, is a snot - his parents are 'proud' of him- oh please!! enough already of people not being responsible for who they are! This book is a dud. There is nothing 'cute' or 'redeeming' about the deceit."},{"rating":"1","title":"A kid's book?","review":"I already don't like language that is not appropriate for adults to speak and so much more when a child speaks obsenities.

The errors are in virtually every paragraph and become a distraction. Read a different book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The end of footnotes","review":"I am giving this book a large raspberry not because of its content but because of its editors. The Economic Consequences of the Peace is a classic and should be read by everyone. Unfortunately at least the print edition of this book with the introduction by Volker has a very nasty habit. Rather than carrying over the foot notes to the next page if it lacks the room, it simply truncates them. In one notable case it truncated a foot note in the middle of a hyphenated word. There is no reason in the world why editors should be so sloppy on such a matter. The footnotes are part of Keynes's work, they are important. Find a different edition to read if you really want to read one. This one rots."},{"rating":"2","title":"DO NOT BUY the \\"General Books\\" LLC edition","review":"Do not buy the cheaper \\"General Books\\" LLC edition (featured above). It has so many typos and spacing problems that it is impossible to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not this edition!","review":"Maynard Keynes' Economic Consequences of the Peace has long been recognized as a classic, and it takes on new significance in light of the recent meltdown on Wall Street. But if you want to buy a copy, you should forget this edition. It appears to have been scanned from an earlier copy, but no effort was made to clean up the text after scanning it. As a result, there are whole sections of gibberish, a mix of characters and symbols that makes no sense whatsoever. Much of the book is literally unreadable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable edition","review":"This \\"General Books\\" edition was apparently made by using optical character recognition to typeset from an existing copy of the original book. The result is unreadable because the technique produced gibberish where there were smudges, underlining, etc. in the original copy. I have re-ordered (but not yet received) a more expensive copy of the book which appears to have been digitized and reset--and free of errors. Google also has a downloadable (pdf) version made by digitizing a copy of the book from a university library. Despite the errors, I've slogged through about three chapters and am blown away by the sense of being in the presence of genius--that's why I re-ordered the book in a more expensive edition. Because this is an important work, I think Amazon should delete the shoddy \\"General Books\\" edition from its offerings."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic on its subject. And well written too.","review":"One of the most influential books of the early 20th century. Keynes' insightful criticism of the Paris Peace settlement are a must read for anyone interested in the Versailles settlement or interwar Europe. While the opinions and conclusions Keynes has are open to debate, it was this work which has set the standard for agreement or disagreement about the effects of the conference. As much as to its arguments about trade, Keynes book owes its success to its suburb writing and lively style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything a Big Bad Wolf could want!","review":"This is a compilation CD featuring monster or horror themed songs, with old radio commercials for horror movies in between the songs. What's cool about this CD is that it doesn't feature all the same \\"monster\\" songs that are on every other CD like this. True, it does have Bobby Pickett's \\"Monster Mash\\" and Sheb Wooley's \\"Purple People Eater\\", but most of the other songs are pretty obscure. \\"Haunted House\\" is here, but it isn't the familiar hit version by Jumpin' Gene Simmons, it's the original version by Johnny Fuller (which is admittedly inferior to the hit version, but it's nice to hear it). There are a lot of really cool songs here that you probably never heard before; like \\"Midnight Stroll\\", \\"Werewolf\\" and \\"The Green Slime\\". It's a kick hearing the old horror movie commercials, too! This would be a good CD to get for your Halloween party."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun gift for football fan","review":"I bought this DVD set as a Christmas gift for my son who plays college football and has been a Notre Dame fan his whole life.

They really tried to make a quality product and it shows. Great if you're a Notre Dame fan or want to see some classic games in general. Picture quality is generally good but varies from game to game as expected, but it's great just for the nostalgia factor. Plus, it's fun seeing who was in the top 25 back then as the sports ticker update will show up from time to time during the games. And at under $60, it is a good bargain. I bought the USC vs Texas, Notre Dame vs W.V.(which this box set includes), and LSU vs OU nat'l championship games for an average cost of $19 each as an example. Overall, highly recommended to Irish fans and college football fans with a sense of history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for that Noter Dame fan","review":"Hi, my husband is a huge Notre Dame fan. He grew up watching the games and then went to school there. The sun shines and sets on the golden dome for him. So, I got this for him for Christmas and he loves it. However, I also think anyone who is interested in the history of football or football in general would like this. I've enjoyed watching the classic games with him. It's weird to watch football in 1966 - it looked almost like a different game. Then by 1978 they are passing the ball more, and they looked more like football players instead of rugby players with big rear ends. This is just down right good tv."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Collection","review":"This DVD set takes the viewer through 40 years of Notre Dame football. With games ranging from the 1979 Cotton Bowl to the Penn State game in 1992, the set will wake up the echoes of Fighting Irish football - especially for those who haven't experienced it before or are looking to revisit the thrilling days of yesteryear.

This is probably the most poorly conceived bike computer ever designed. Rather than being held in place with screw tightened brackets everything is mounted with zip ties which seems like a good idea except that you cannot get them tight enough to hold everything in place, the readout unit slips down due to the normal vibration and the pickup unit needs constant adjustment in order to work.

It attaches to your bike's handlebars with a little clip it can be slid out of, like many bike lights. Unfortunately, the clip doesn't hold the spedometer securely, and it fell off several times (when riding, and not) and was eventually lost.

Took 15 minutes to install taking care to get spacing and wire routing just right.

It has more features than I was hoping for when I bought it. Installation is easy. Learning to use it is a little bit challenge due to the poor manual, but you'll quickly figure it out.I will certainly recommend it, but be prepared for it to die prematurely. In my case it died just before I was to venture on a training ride - not a good timing. You see, I depend heavily on this and my turn lists to figure out the training ride route.

After all, there are only 3 different interior colors for my year. Boy, was I wrong. The color was waaaay off. So bad that it just looked ridiculous. I sent it back, and not only did I have to pay shipping to me and shipping back, they had the nerve to charge me a 15% restocking fee for finding out that their product is stupidly off color.

Stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shun Abduction!","review":"This book is on my list of the dumbest books I've read. The plot is silly. (Think of the silliest episode of Star Trek and then double it) Surface dwellers enter and then ruin a Utopian society. It's been done and done, again and again...and done better than this. Shun this clunker of a book at all costs. It's not even recommendable as a light summer read. I won't touch another Robin Cook novel after reading this bomb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cook's \\"Abduction\\" should have been--abducted, that is.","review":"I didn't read Amazon's reader reviews on this book until afterward, but they all seemed to mirror my own assessment of \\"Abduction\\". My first thought was 'Did he write this in high school or what?'. This novel was definitely not up to Robin Cook standards in comparison to his many wonderful medical thrillers. His characters were nothing short of juvenile in behavior, and his overuse of the word \\"surreal\\" in one chapter had me about ready to scratch my own eyes out! I think Dr. Cook had better give up science fiction and go back to doctors and hospitals, where he excels as a novelist."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Famous Medical Author Simulates A Self-Frontal-Labotomy","review":"This novel tells the story of five people who are sucked into an undersea civilization very much older than our own. The plot hinges on two of the \\"suckees\\" - deepsea divers - acting like oversexed Neanderthals who become rapacious killers in a Utopia that knows no violence. The characters in this book are so unreal, their actions so inexplicable and \\"far out,\\" that the novel becomes laughable. The premise, the plot, and the characters are so cartoon-like that the reader weeps for Robin Cook; to think that a well-known author's gift is revealed as so thin and fragile. This book is a literary suicide. Avoid it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe the author should be abducted...","review":"After reading that Robin Cook is supposed to be one of the good medical thriller authors, I decided to give him a chance. He definitely didn't pass my test! The main thing that really irked me about this book was his portrayal of blue collar workers. Just because he is a doctor with a degree on his wall doesn't mean that he is better than everyone else. His portrayal of blue collar workers shows them to be idiotic, homophobic and purely hostile when it comes to conversations with the more \\"civilized.\\" One word to describe this book: disgraceful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast Read, Entertaining","review":"In spite of all the negative reviews i really liked it.

Teaching at a rural school on Zanzibar, I was happy to read any book I could get my hands on. Somehow this book made its way into the school; it was so terrible I couldn't put it down! Predictable plot, flat characters, sophomoric style; indeed, there is little to redeem it.If you want to have a good laugh over a bad book, look no further."},{"rating":"1","title":"An amateurish offering from an old pro.","review":"I consider myself to be a Robin Cook fan. In fact, I put Abduction on reserve at the library before it had even arrived from the publisher. I was very disappointed. The story is silly, the characters are one dimensional(if that) and the writing is amateurish. I doubt that if this has been another author's first novel that it would even have been published."},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone else wrote this.","review":"The story is totally unbelieveable. The characters have absolutely no depth and the story line is non-existent. I did not even finish listening to this unabridged audio of this book. I have enjoyed Cook's books in the past but I don't think he wrote this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Robin Cook? Are you absolutely sure?","review":"I guess I'll add another \\"I was very disappointed\\" to the group. I am a huge fan of Robin Cook and can hardly wait until his books come out. This book had me giggling in some places, though I don't think that was his intent. It seemed to be something a \\"budding sci-fi writer\\" might do as a first book, not a seasoned writer of medical thrillers. I did donate it to my High School library, as the kids might enjoy it if they don't know who Robin Cook is. When they check it out, I will tell them not to judge his writing on that book alone and recommend another to them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really credible...","review":"Disappointing. The whole plot is unconvincing and the characters are weak...I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I am a big fan of Robin Cook, have read all his books. I feel his strongest books are those that portray possible real life scenarios, such as Toxin. Abduction reads as if it were thrown together during long plane trips or something. The characters are overly stylized and the story unbelievable and shallow. If you like Robin Cook's usual fare, you may well be disappointed with Abduction; and if you haven't read his books before, don't start with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the heck was he thinking?!","review":"I tried to have a totally open mind while reading this book. In fact, it managed to grab and hold my attention for the first \\"section\\" of it.

And if you do, recycle it immediately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!","review":"If there were an option to rate it as -5, that's what I would have given it. The book is ludicrous and I'm embarrassed to have purchased it."},{"rating":"1","title":"B movie quality","review":"Reading this book was like reading a script for a B movie written in the early 1960's. Even the main characters were unbelievable. It is hard to think that Cook actually wrote this book because his other books have been very good. If you want to read a good thrilling book about under the earth read 'The Descent' by Jeff Long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly Awful","review":"I believe that this is the worst book I've ever read; I'm ashamed to say I actually looked at every page. The plotting, characterization, and style is at the fifth grade level. Everything is astonishingly shallow, trite, and predictable, and the writer (I can't believe it was Cook) even screwed up the ending twist. For heaven's sake, don't encourage them and pay money for this trash. Read Verne. Zero stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts out good, goes downhill","review":"I like good Sci-Fi, but this book doesn't qualify. The book's beginning is good, the middle boring and trite, with an ending that is very weak. In some respects, this book is a take off on H.G. Wells \\"Time Machine\\" with obvious influence by Jules Verne. The story line had lots of potential that was just not met. Pass on this one, but if you have not read other works by Robin Cook do so. This book is not typical of his usual fine writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the usual Cook","review":"Having read all of Robin Cook's novels, I anticipated another exciting story. I was disappointed. Although well written, I found the subject a little too far-fetched, and not the usual Robin Cook excitement. Having also read \\"Invasion\\", I feel that Robin Cook should keep to the medical themes that he obviously knows so well. His medical stories are always \\"can't put down\\" believable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed!!","review":"I agree with almost everything the other reviewers have said. The only thing that pleased me was that I didn't pay the full price for the book! Hopefully RC will read a few of these reviews and see the error of his ways. I am a great fan of him but this one was really bad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, boring.","review":"Can this book really have been written by the Robin Cook, whose previous books I have thoroughly enjoyed? The beginning of the story caught my attention, but soon dropped to readying quickly to get it over with. I sincerely hope that Mr. Cook will return to what he does best: writting medical fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoy!","review":"I had read this years ago, and didn't remember for sure till the ending....A bit different for Robin Cook. Still a FAN!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Excessive exposition, two-dimensional characters and illogical plot points. Surprising from Robin Cook - possibly a ghost writer? Premise was promising but poorly executed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remain OPenMinded.","review":"Thsi has to get 4 stars because it is plausable.I found it wonderful fodder for a sci-fi movie[I love scifi movies]and it impresses me that Robin Cook is galactically creative as to write sci-fi as well as medical thrillers,[and do a great job on both] what a combination! The ending was totally unexpected and definitely possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Adventure","review":"If you are thinking \\"typical Robin Cook\\" you won't be able to appreciate this book. But if you just read without those expectations I think you will enjoy this new type of story with Robin Cook. I couldn't put the book down! It was so unlike anything I have ever read......very creative. I was sorry to reach the end of the book. What an adventure! More please, Mr. Cook."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"The only abduction here is that of the reader's time and money. The idea of a secret city under the sea (in the earth's crust) seemed a little out there, but then do so the stories of Jules Verne, H.G. Wells and M. Crichton, so I kept reading hoping something interesting would turn up. Alas, it just got more boring and trite as it went on. I skipped a big chunk and went towards the end, again hoping for some twist or something to justify my having bought it. No such luck. I can only believe that this book was published because of the author's very well-known name. Please, Dr.C., stick to medical thrillers or you'll lose a ton of readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"a real disappointment for this Cook fan","review":"I have read almost every one of Cook's books, and I found Abduction to be such a disappointment. It is sort of a combination of Man from Atlantis and Lost in Space, and not done as well as either of those B-grade t.v. shows. The premise of the book was far-fetched, and the characters were fairly steroetypical. I got lost in the technical jargon during Arak's explanations to Suzanne (the glossary in the back of the book helped, but not all of the terms were there), and I don't like to read a fiction book with the aid of a dictionary. The ending was very trite, not all that surprising, and disappointing in that the reader never really knows what happens to Suzanne. I get the feeling that Cook was writing this one to sell as a made for t.v. movie and lost sight of the higher quality writing that he is capable of. If you are a Cook fan like I am, read it so that you can say you've read it; otherwise, don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was glad to see Dr. Cook going beyond the medical thriller, but \\"Abduction\\" was a disappointing Michael Critian(?) clone. The premise was good, but the writing was not up to Dr. Cook's usual talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time.","review":"I have read many of Robin Cook's medical thrillers, and find most to be interesting, though a bit formulatic. I find it hard to believe this book is by the same author. I had to keep pushing myself to keep reading in the hope that the book had to get better. No luck, it just kept spiraling downward. The ending was enough to cause me to literally doze off.The characters were not developed, the writing style was elementary school level, and the plot did nothing to draw me in. It's as if Mr. Cook had a contract to fulfill, waited untill there were 18 hours left, and gave birth to this weak effort. Laid an egg is more like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Back cover needed to prepare the reader for a sci-fi flick...","review":"First of all, I LOVE Cook's books. I love the science and facts he usually uses. Even when he does take literary/artistic license, he backs up his imaginative scenarios with some facts. I was totally unprepared for the science fiction utopian storyline of Abduction- there isn't even a hint on the back cover to tell you what's coming. I figured \\"Oh, maybe the oceanographers bring some oddball bacteria back with them,\\" but noooo, the oceanographers are sucked into a bizarre utopia of lazy, beautiful humans. As another review said, there are no likable characters, so I found myself not caring about what happened. The twist at the end was a bit silly and felt very forced, as did many of the scenes. I'd recommend it to someone else as a for-fun, kicks-and-giggles read, but I would make sure they know Abduction is not a medical thriller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the real Dr. Cook?","review":"What happened to DOCTOR Cook? Science fiction?? I was expecting another great medical thriller as usual. Although I found the book interesting, it's not the real Robin Cook."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVED THIS BOOK","review":"I coulldnt set it down it was a nice change from Robin's usual books I can't belive it's got such bad reviews I WOULD DEFINATLY read this book! He discribes this other world so well that I really felt as if I was right there with the charecters. READ THIS BOOK ignore the other bad reviews"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cook should stick to what he knows best","review":"Having read and loved many of Robin Cook's previous novels, I expected to be pleased with this long awaited book. The fact that it came out in paperback instead of hardback was a surprise at the time. Having read the book, I'm wondering why they wasted the paper? I was very disappointed in the storyline. It dragged on and on, and all I could think was that Robin was into his second childhood. Having reached the end of the book (I was given permission to stop reading it by more than one person), I feel like I've just completed a marathon. Robin needs to get back to what he knows best, and stay away from the \\"abduction/ alien/X-files\\" type novels. Hopefully, Shock will be better than this one, otherwise I'm giving up on his books. (Amazon requires a star rating. I'd rather not put even one star on this book.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good start but where is the end.","review":"I have read most of Robin Cook's previous novels and was prepared to enjoy this one. The beginning grabed my interest but when he got his characters in to the center of the Earth it all goes to pieces. Lots of loose ends. If all they wanted a professional oceanographer why did they abduct the two divers? It they were as advanced as infered, they should have been able to solve the problem on their own. The two divers were totally over the top. Their actions were not consistent with their situation. If I were a Navy Diver I would be offended by these two characters. Then there is the end? The book doesn't end. I kept looking for another chapter or at least a few more pages. So many unanswered questions. Robin Cook has done better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sci-Fi Bomb","review":"A poorly excecuted foray into the science-fiction genre for an accomplished thriller author. The premise of a highly-advanced undderworld civilization is something that exists only on the lunatic fringe of UFO believers, and the adolescent writing style only serves to discredit the author. Dr. Cook's editor should find a new career after allowing this in print."},{"rating":"1","title":"unbelievable","review":"My absolute awe at how poorly this book was written kept me with it through the bitter end. Having read all of Robin Cook's other books I expected some kind of plot to evolve as the book continued. Cook has always had an easy flow to his dialogue, but in this book it is stilted and thick with ridiculous stereotypes. While I don't discourage a foray into different genre', perhaps he could at least write with the same level of conviction he has in the past. I can't believe a good editor and/or publisher who supports the author would let this book go to press."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Robin Cook","review":"I have read all Robin Cooks novels, and I was very dissappointed in his latest ABDUCTION. It was wise for it to come out in paperback. I am upset because I wasted the money on it, but glad I did not have to buy it in hardback (as I usually do). I love Dr. Cooks medical knowledge and the novels he derives from this knowledge. Being in the medical profession I can readily relate to his books. Not so with this one. Just very dissappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ghastly space opera","review":"This is a book that might even have had trouble being published in the 40's, the heyday of space opera. The script would probably not have been accepted for a very bad episode of \\"Star Trek.\\" That is has been published at all, in any decade, is a mind-boggling tribute only to the venality of publishers who will count on a well-known name to sell any old drek. That any respectable writer would allow this donkey to go to print is inexplicable, save that he suspects he will never write another book so doesn't care. The 'human' characters are trite, shallow and stupid, the 'alien' characters are idiotic, the plot - such as it is - is mind-numbingly predictable, the suspense and tension are zero. I give it one star for grammar and spelling. It deserves far less."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are we sure Robin Cook wrote this?","review":"So not what I expected from Robin Cook. The premise was good, but it got boring in the middle and fizzled out completely by the end. It was a real disappointment from an author that I have come to rely on for good books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful read","review":"I started to read this book because I like Robin Cook's novels; but I gave up after 100 pages of unrelenting geological and diving jargon. Cook should stick to medical themes. This book is a huge disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to medical thrillers Mr Cook!","review":"As I read this book I kept wondering if it could possibly be by the same Robin Cook whose thrillers had given me so much enjoyment in the past.If it was possible to give it less than one star I would have done. In a word simply dreadful.Word of advice to Mr Cook - stick to medical thrillers."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was pleasantly surprised!","review":"As a fan of Robin Cook's medical thrillers, I wasn't sure I would be able to get into his first sci-fi effort. I was hooked from the very beginning! All the gripping terror and chilling suspense he brings to his hospital horrors are present in this whirlwind encounter with a lost civilization.The characters are believable, the descriptions fascinating, and the premise Cook has concocted is absolutely extraordinary. I especially enjoyed the explanations of \\"birth\\" and \\"death\\" in the lost world, finding similarities to Walden Two and at least a few R.A. Heinlein novels.While entirely unlike anything else Robin Cook has written, The Abduction is definitely worth your time, and I happily recommend it. It's a bit disappointing that other reviews trash this book, but then again, it is a *total* departure from Cook's usual genre and writing style. I still thought it was quite good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abduction","review":"Pehaps it is unfair of me to review this book, as I did not finish it. I expected another medical or science fiction thriller from the usually reliable Mr. Cook, and the initial chapters seemed to bear this out. But the deterioration into a silly and boring lost society/world is almost instantaneous. The other reviewers are right on the money, and I will not repeat their brief plot (if it can be dignified by that word) descriptions. If this is any reader's introduction to Robin Cook, don't be put off. Any of his other works are infinitely better. As for his old fans (and I am one), don't allow yourself to be deceived by the author's name and reputation into purchasing this turkey. What can he have been thinking?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment for Cook fans","review":"I thought that this book is the most disappointing of Cook's collection. It was so bad I couldn't finish it. The plot basically has a couple of people get captured by people who live in the Earth. They have the choice to go back to above ground or stay there. The values of these people are so messed up I couldn't stand it. I promptly returned the book to the library after reading only about two hundred pages. Cook could have done better!For people who have only read this book by Robin Cook,don't give up. His other books are much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb","review":"I have picked up and read quite a few very bad books over the years. This one by Cook definitly cracks the top 40 worst books that I have worked my way through. The plot here surrounds the idea that their is this underworld civilization unknown to us. The story is kind of like Jules Verne redux. Only where it is interesting to read Verne and see how someone saw the future a hundred and twenty years ago, this is just bad thinking when it comes from someone today.I could go on. But why bother? this book sucks so bad that its not worth the effort of thinking about it for another second."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous tale","review":"Let me summarize the story for you so you don't waste time on this book. Five divers/scientists go deep into the Atlantic Ocean, and become abducted by another species of humans who live in a large air-filled cavity under the seas. The \\"aliens\\" are a happy people who abhor violence, and who transfer their souls from body to body to live forever. The \\"aliens\\" also have advanced technology which is difficult to explain (for example, why do they use lights to set up artificial days and nights?). Our ordinary human heroes want to escape. The ending is particularly ridiculous, and comes across as Dr Cook ran out of time to think of how to wrap up this crazy story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Readers who have enjoyed Robin Cook's medical thrillers will be disappointed by this book. The setting updates a tired science fiction idea -- an inhabited world miles under the surface of the Earth -- without adding much of interest. The characters are not very sympathetic, and the ending is essentially a joke. One hopes that Cook will go back to biomedical themes, and that publishers will not print everything a famous writer puts out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is Freedom Worth Leaving Paradise?","review":"This novel is a pleasant change from the medical psychological thrillers that we are all used to from Mr. Cook. It involves a group of people being \\"abducted\\" by a race of ancient beings that pre-date all known living creatures on Earth. As the plot unfolds we the humans are in a virtual paradise where everyone lives for pleasure and death and violence are virtually unknown.The humans must decide if living forever in Paradise is more important than their personal freedom and being with their families in a world of death and violence.This is the second science fiction type novel I have read by Mr. Cooke and I must say he does the genre well. This book does a good job of explaining many of the mysteries about our planet that have plagued scientists and historians for more that a century."},{"rating":"1","title":"Idiotic...","review":"This is the first Robin Cook book I've ever read (listened to, really). I know he's better known for his medical stories and based on this \\"science fiction\\" story, he should get back to his forte. This book is poor on every count. All the characters are idiots. If they weren't, the story couldn't have been written at all. Somehow the 5 main characters have made it through their lives with reading a single science fiction book, watching a single science fiction movie or TV show, or even knowing anyone who has. Otherwise they would have seen every trite plot point coming 50 pages away. There isn't a single original thought in the entire book. Really, I mean it. And then, in the middle of this amazingly juvenile book, he drops random polysyllabic words as though to say, \\"see, I haven't lost my perspicacity!\\"Based on his reputation, I'm sure some of his books are great. Too bad this isn't one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Was He Thinking?","review":"This is one of the worst books I have ever read. The characters are annoying and so very stupid.

Abduction, however, is a departure from his medical thrillers and a very poor one at that. If you have never read a book by Robin Cook, do not start with this one! Any of his other books is much better. If you have read some of his books, be prepared for a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pulp Fiction","review":"Having never read a Robin Cook novel before, I got sucked in by all the blurbs touting him as a \\"master of medical fictions\\". Wow, talk about false advertising! This is 3rd rate science fiction, as written by the Boy in the Bubble. The characters, and I use the term loosely, act and speak like no human beings I've ever met. To use the description \\"cartoonish\\" would be an insult to cartoon dialogue writers everywhere. If this were a movie, it would be perfect MST3K grist. But, sadly, it's just a bad book that killed two evenings (and a few brain cells) for me. Thank God I borrowed this from someone, and didn't actually pay for it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable","review":"I've read science fiction before so I know about needing to suspend disbelief while reading a story, but this one is absurd. The crew of a submersible and the 2 divers enter the secret world of Interra which exists between the upper & lower oceans of the earth. The Interreans seem advanced, but display some disturbing traits. There is a separate race of creatures which are half human-half machine who do all their work, while the Interreans mostly play. The crew & divers want to return to the surface, but the Interreans don't want people on the surface learning about Interra.This story is clearly a rewriting of The Hollow Earth by Raymond Bernard from 1976, which was also unbelievable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abduction is DOA, here's the post-mortem.","review":"As a long time science fiction fan, I found the book poorly written and dreadfully predictable. Cook uses a condescending, didactic style that is clearly oblivious to several generations of development of the genre. (It openly acknowledges the influence of Jules Verne, and is reminiscent of Edgar Rice Burroughs and Lin Carter in places...which would be fine if it were 1936.) Further, I was completely appalled with the occasional gaffes in basic physics. (\\"Supersonic\\" trains in a vacuum tunnel?!? OK, that's probably not how he meant it, but it's what he WROTE.)Run, don't walk away from this one. Back to the medical thrillers, doc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book ever!","review":"After forcing myself to finish this torturously ridiculous book(being the last of my beach reading supplies), I wanted to call up Dr Cook and demand a refund of the hours of my life.

(Atlantis Lives) It could be told very well in about 75 pages or a hour long TV show* The characters are fairly flat and one dimensional.* The plot, while not bad, is reminiscent of a 1950s twightlight zone, or 60s Star Trek episode. Its very straightforward and you can see where its going.* The ending twist was one I didn't find that amusing -- again, a decent short story conclusion, but not enough for a full novel.Saying that, the book isn't *that* bad. I think some reviewers might have been expecting something more in the lines of Cook's other works. I would give it a little more than 2 stars, but given the lenght it's closer to 2 than 3."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you love Robin Cook, and I do, pick a different book.","review":"Occasionally young authors find that even though their first few novels are rejected by publishers, after they become famous the publishers are willing to publish almost anything. However, sometimes the early efforts are not publishable regardless of the author's name. This book was published after Robin Cook was quite famous, but went straight to paperback.This is definitely not a \\"Robin Cook\\" medical thriller, but rather a poorly written science fiction story with an utopian society with open marriages reminiscent of sci fi from the 1950s and explanations of the Alantis Myth, the Gulf Stream, and myriad others topics \\"unknown to scientists.\\"If you love Robin Cook, and I do, pick a different book."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst audio -cd i have ever listened to","review":"for the past 15 (at least years) i have listened to any number of audio cds and tapes (from Nancy Drew quality to higher) while i have been engaged in renovating an old house--- this is the first CD that i have put back in it's packaging to send off to the goodwill, unlistening to in it's entirity----- it is poorly written, as if it has been composed by a half-drunk in the 1950s who is stuck in some sexist/unimmaginative time-warp-=----"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dr Cook is no Jules Verne...","review":"Perry Bergman, founder, president and largest shareholder of Benthic Marine is on its way on board the Benthic Explorer near the volcanically and seismically active Mid-Atlantic Ridge.

It's Saturday-morning cartoon-ish. Mr. Cook's other books are believable. This one is childish. Mr. Cook -- please bring back more books like Chromosome 6. That one had everything -- plot, a touch of believability, good characters, and suspense. It was pure enjoyment."},{"rating":"1","title":"my review","review":"This book is a work of science fiction, about people who find a world under the sea inhabited by an advanced species of humans.This is certainly not the best work by this author. I have read many of his works and they are mostly related to the medical-investigative field and much more realistic. This book deals too much in the fiction world and it is hard to accept the story. However, I did find the ending to be orginal and totally unprepared!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An Unpleasant Surprise","review":"I usually pick up subsequent books by familiar authors, because I'm in the mood for a particular type of story. When I started this book, I thought this must be some other \\"Robin Cook.\\" That's why I came to amazon.com to read a review. After 100 pages, I think I'll abandon it (which I rarely do to a book) & give it away. I have plenty more \\"real\\" Robin Cook books on my shelf to read. If I want GOOD sci-fi I have those, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please tell me the other Robin Cook books are better!","review":"This was the first and probably last Robin Cook novel for me. I was disappointed after hearing so many positive comments on his medical thrillers. The \\"fantasy world under the sea\\" science fiction in this book lacked several components, including plausibility and interesting dialogue. Many comic book heros have more dimensions than the stock, predictable characters in this novel. A plot twist in the last pages is the only original idea in the otherwise stale material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are they SURE that Robin Cook wrote this?","review":"Ok...I'm still shocked that Robin Cook wrote this. Are they SURE that this wasn't written by some wannabe Micheal Crichton? The only elements of a traditional Robin Cook novel (Sphinx and The Year of the Intern nonwithstanding) are the brief references to microbes (although I think that Robin Cook made the mistaken assumption that decontaminating someone externally decontaminates them completely). The rest of the book reads like a poorly written Micheal Crichton novel(including an ending almost identical to Timeline), and nothing like I expected. So why did I give it 2 stars instead of 1? If nothing else, its a good read if you have nothing else handy. As far as Robin Cook novels go, this one goes squarely at the bottom (w/Vector at the top) and I do not recommend it, but you could do worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Robin Cook Really Missed on This One!","review":"Having read almost all of Robin Cook's books to date, I sat down Saturday afternoon ready to be involved in a medical thriller. What I found instead was a novel with poorly developed characters and a totally predictable story line. I even went back and checked the title page to be sure this wasn't a reprint of a very early book by this author. Unfortunately that is not the case. The main actors in the story are superficial and one dimensional. Unlike older Robin Cook novels, none of these characters seems to have existed before the story began and the reader is really not sorry to see them go. The premise of a civilization existing under the earth could surely be presented in a more believeable way given today's technology. This book is a disappointment from start to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass this one up!","review":"Well, I really wish I could say something pleasant about this novel but I'm as lost for words as Cook apparently was when he wrote the book. I can't recall the last time I've read an entire novel where I did not encounter a single new word -- new to my vocabulary, that is. Not that I buy novels to increase my vocabulary, but as I read this novel, that \\"peculiarity\\" stuck in my mind. The character development was atrocious, and the plot was so old and tired that even Cook seemed to give up toward the end and just shut his effort down with one of the most truncated endings I recall ever reading. I read the whole thing but would encourage other readers to avoid my mistake. Ouch!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ABDUCTION","review":"THIS BOOK IS REALLY TERRIBLE.

I have read all of his and I kept waiting for something Cook-ish to come. It never came. Not one doctor (at least not any medical doctors) not one nurse not one hospital. It was his worst yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another fantastic work by Robin Cook!","review":"First off, let me say, the abduction in the title is not by aliens from outer space. In fact, just the opposite, but that's all I'll say so as not to spoil the imaginative and suspenseful plot of this sci-fi thriller. Robin Cook is one of the few writers whose books I will read automatically, without even glancing at the cover synopsis, he's that good. He's never failed to entertain, and this latest book is no exception. Once again, he varies from his usual medical thriller format (see Invasion) and pulls it off nicely. The story moves right along, always prompting you to read further to see what happens next or to explore the fascinating details of the advanced alternate culture within. The characters are varied and interesting, and his writing style is, as usual, excellent. I'm not sure what those who gave it a low rating were looking for, but if you're looking for an enjoyable, fascinating book to read, especially if you're a sci-fi fan, don't miss this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"I enjoyed this book, No it is not typical Robin Cook but that is why it is interesting. He was trying to push the envelope to make his readers see other writing genre's. The characters act that way for the plot to continue in the direction he wanted it to follow. A good book that I recommend if you want to try something different."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I thought that this book is the most disappointing of Cook's collection. It was so bad I couldn't finish it. The plot basically has a couple of people get captured by people who live in the Earth. They have the choice to go back to above ground or stay there. The values of these people are so messed up I couldn't stand it. I promptly returned the book to the library after reading only about two hundred pages. Cook could have done better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Abduction","review":"I thought this book was wonderful, it made me stop and think. Sure it wasn't as thrilling as his other books, but I loved the idea of a whole different race of humans living below us in secret. The idea that maybe Atlantis could be real, inspired some deep thoughts."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good, not good at all.","review":"I have read every single book Robin Cook has written, so I was eagerly anticipating this new novel. Unfortunately, as soon as I read the first chapter I realized that this book was not like the others. It involved no medical knowledge whatsoever and was entirely science-fiction. I have to say that I am very dissapointed with this book, but his new book, Shock, coming out in March 2001 looks a lot more promising."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn...","review":"As an avid Robin Cook fan, I was sorely disappointed in this book. I loved his others, so, naturally, when I saw that he'd written a new one, I was thrilled. It started out well, but then it just went downhill. I was surprised he went so far into the fiction ring. I mean, the others were at least plausible, but this one was just too out there. I think Mr. Cook should stick to what he knows and that is medicine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather disappinting","review":"The book started off on the right foot. However, after about 80 pages, the book changes tone completely. I expected much more from Cook, but got the book Abduction. The Sci-Fi-ness of the book definitely belongs on one of those TV channels, but this is definitely not something you'd expect from Robin Cook. Don't let this ruin your impression of him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Travesty","review":"Good Lord this was a stinker. Poorly conceived, clumsily executed, this book is stocked with the most generic group of explorers and aliens ever assembled. There's the Earnest Blonde, the Deep-Voiced Samuel Jackson Rip-Off, the Thuggish Navy Seals... And as for the Atlanteans, not since 'Santa Claus Conquers the Martians' has there been such an inept portrayal of an alien race. And on top of that, the dialogue is stilted, and the narration reads like it's been translated from a foreign language. But the saddest thing of all is that for all the fantastic setting and exotic background, the 'wonders' that await us in this undersea world are stunningly banal. It's all been done before with so much more ingenuity and class, that one is tempted to suspect that this Brand New Robin Cook Novel is actually a Very Very Old Robin Cook Novel; something he penned when 'The Man From Atlantis' was all the rage, and dusted off after watching Michael Crichton's 'Sphere.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dr. Cook, please return to the hospital!","review":"What a stinker. Having read many of Robin Cook's previous medical mystery novels, I felt suckered after I bought and read this one. It is a sci-fi attempt by an author way out of his genre. This stuff has all been done before by real sci-fi writers, and Dr. Cook's attempt comes out at the level a 6th grader might enjoy. When I buy Tom Clancy, I don't expect poetry. When I buy Robin Cook, I don't expect a preachy Greenpeace advertisement.

I Hope So!!!","review":"This was the disappointment of my lifetime! Ok, that's a little harsh, but this was, without a doubt, the worst novel written by the master of medical thrillers. It's not a medical thriller, by the way. Issac Asimov comes to mind. I couldn't even develop a liking to any of the characters of this book. I am convinced that someone made a mistake when crediting the author of this novel. My 15-year old daughter could have done a better job. Mr. Cook, forget this silliness. I am afraid I will never purchase another one of your novels. Many say the ending was shallow, but I say the entire movel was. Please return to your proper genre. I wasted too much time and money. I almost threw it away, but was sure there'd be a twist that would get this novel on the right track. It never happened"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Reading","review":"While most of the negative reviews of this book focus on the fact that it is not the \\"normal\\" Robin Cook, I think it was great to see a change in focus from the medical thriller to sci-fi. I agree with the review that stated Robin Cook's novels were starting to all sound alike. The problem I had with Abduction was with the overall writing and character development, or should I say lack thereof. If the Interrans were so \\"advanced\\" why did they giggle so much? Why were Richard and Michael so immature? Why was it so easy for the Americans to escape? For those that are looking to find the typical Robin Cook novel, don't buy this one. For those that are looking for a well developed sci-fi novel, don't buy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"How old was Mr. Cook when he wrote this?","review":"I have not read anything so juvenile for many years. Some of the childrens literature that I read while working for the School Library was far superior to this drivel. It reminded me of an attempt at Science Fiction by a 7th grader.

I was so very disappointed in this book. Reviewers like Chuck Hickey might put me in the \\"It's not Mr. Cooks typical medical thriller so I don't like it\\" box, but that is not true. One of his early works, \\"Sphinx\\" was not a medical thriller, and I loved that book. The problem with this book was that it was very boring, not suspenseful, and definintely NOT a thriller like his previous books. The only reason I kept reading was I was sure it would get better, but it never did. The ending was a horrible dispappointment! I wasted my money and time on this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong title","review":"Should be called \\"How To Use the Terms Vis-a-Vis and Apropos as Much as Possible\\".

The plot idea is good (two stars are given for that, eventhough the idea of immortal life is a take from Amitav Ghosh's The Calcutta Chromosomes), but the execution is very juvenile and for the last third of the book the author simply lost interest, how do you expect the reader to sustain it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"This can't be Robin Cook!","review":"The first few chapters of this book piqued my interest, until the crew of the submersible end up in Interterra.

It was a big let-down. I thought the topic of an Atlantis type world might be interesting, but the story turned out to be weak and the writing definitely not up to Robin Cook's normal standard. In fact, it was as if someone else had written this book under his name. The accounts of continual orgies were in my opinion in bad taste, the characters not believable, and the whole effect rather disappointing.Don't let this put you off his other books though. They are usually well worth the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will the real Robbin Cook please stand up","review":"This book was such a disappointment and not at all like Robbin's previous books. The story starts out fairly interesting and keeps you guessing what they are going to find by drilling into the earths core. A team of people get into a submarine to explore the findings and find themselves suck into a hole. Not bad up to this point but then you discover they were captured by aliens and the whole story goes down hill. I almost put the book down right there an then. But I thought it might get better. Trust me it doesn't. I still wonder who really wrote this book because it was not even close to the quality of writing Robbin normally creates. So will the real Robbin Cook please stand up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Close But No Cigar","review":"This is a poor attempt by Robin Cook to stray away from his typical medical thriller and try his luck at a Michael Crichton wannabe book but falls short.The subject has already been used before but nevertheless it is an easy read.

I also liked how Robin Cook used his knowledge and experience in the medical field, and brought it into his book. Even though this book is fiction, you get a sense that it maybe could happen. I usually am not into the scientific type of book, but this book pulled it off. Read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, but NOT typical Robin Cook","review":"The most important thing to realize about this book is it is NOT Robin Cook's typical book. There are no doctors, no hospital, no cutting edge medical technology.It is, however, a very good book in it's genre. This book really belongs in Science Fiction rather than mystery. The story is set in the ocean rather than in space, but many of the elements are the same as first encounter stories. It's a familiar story of the clash of cultures and the resulting problems.I found it very refreshing to read this type of story from Robin Cook. Hopefully this is the first of more stories away from the typical medical setting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Plot-Characters get old","review":"The book gets good ratings for plot, (very Michael Chricton like). But character development is poor. Michael and Richard are more like Beavis and Butthead than regular divers. It's funny at first but it gets old. Perry (the President of Benthic Marine) seems very boring (however, most company presidents are).Suzanne was the only character I liked. She seemed like the most intelligent and least predictable character.On the plus side, the book is very easy to read, and difficult to put down once reading starts. If character development was as good as the plot, I would have given this book 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not so Robin Cook","review":"I've read nearly everything Robin Cook has written, and I've got very used to hospital based thrillers. How different this book is! So plausible!,he manages to relate histoical fact to this work of fiction in such a way that you can almost believe it could be true.

I couldn't put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst Robin Cook book ever published","review":"Having read all of Robin Cooks books, I'm used to medical thrillers with good story lines and well develeped characters that make sense.

I have always been a huge Robin Cook fan, I love his medical thrillers. They are good, entertaining reads that leave you thinking. I am also a huge fan of Sci-fi and this book is some of the worst sci-fi ever written. The characters are so bad that to call them one dimensional would be to big a compliment. The actually story had some potential but it became so trite and superficial you simply didn't care what happened to any of these people. A noble idea that fell flat on it face is the best way to sum up this book. A much better story is Orson Scott Cards book \\"The Abyss\\" Now that is a fantastic book, far better then the movie with really interesting characters. Bottom line, don't waste your time with this book. If you are interested in a non-medical book by Mr. Cook, check out Sphinx. That was a great story!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yep this one's purty near awful","review":"Everything my fellow reviewers have said about this book is true. It is the first (since Coma) Robin Cook I've read. I read it because I thought he has been at the business of writing for so long, he has to have gotten good at it. And the premise sounded interesting (not shockingly new, mind you...but interesting).I nearly got out my red pen and went after several passages. There are several howlers...all unintentional.The characters ARE irritating and their actions make NO sense. BUT I give this two stars (instead of one or a half) because the plot DID keep me reading until the end. Now that must be worth something!So style is absent. So the characters are ludicrous. So we saw this society in Brave New World and ninety-leven 70's SF movies and 50's SF novels...there is still a spark of something new--albeit a small one. So IF you find yourself on an island, you COULD be stranded with worse. If you have nothing to read at present...believe me you could do worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not Robin Cook's best","review":"This book was a disappointment.

I only finished it because I couldn't believe it could stay that bad. Cook surprised me by managing to make it stink right to the end. As Opus the Penguin once said of a movie: \\"Okay, maybe it wasn't as bad as all that, but lordy, it sure wasn't good!\\"I'm still going to be muttering to myself about the future of America when there are people living here who think Abduction was worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never expected this from Dr. Robin Cook","review":"We need more of a Medical Thriller than inter-gallactic sci-fi ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"The story is beyond my imagination.

This is without a doubt one of the greatest books ever written.In this book we are introduced to Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy. They find a magic wardrobe that takes them to the land of Narnia where wonderful adventures await them.Memorable characters abound in this book: Aslan-the great lion, Jadis-the white witch, Tumnus-the faun, Mr. and Mrs. Beaver ... just to name a few.This is fun reading.

Interestingly the author wanted this book read after \\"The Magician's Nephew\\" where he details how the lion Aslan created Narnia and gave the gift of speech to its animals. I mention this fact since many readers have access to the seven Narnia books and may wish to read \\"Nephew\\" first. Of course I am assuming you are reading these comments BEFORE you read the books!In any event \\"Wardrobe\\" introduced us to the Pevensie children Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy. Who travel to the land of Narnia by entering and exiting a \\"magic\\" wardrobe in the attic of an old Professor. It is not my intent in these short comments to summarize the entire story, after all discovering the delights therein are one of the prime pleasures in reading. One of the pleasures for this reader was the illustration at the beginning of each chapter by Pauline Baynes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Choose Your Path","review":"Narnia is a series of books that reflect on the maturing of children's spirits into adulthood.

I had no expectations for this book, so luckily, I have not been let down in one form or another. I am not fond of mystical/fantasy books, and I could not get caught up within this world of Narnia. I found the action to be lacking, as it was described in short paragraphs, rather than shown, and I did not see any point to it. It is written very juvenilely, so it is easy to read.

The book goes through many emotions such as; sad, happiness, and excitement. For example; in the beginnig it starts in the house playing tag changing setting to the snow. I didn't even like the witch because she is very mean and is full of tricks, I think you should read this book because it will teach you lesson about love and caring."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Christian fairytale it is!","review":"This book is a great Christian fairytale that can be shared by all ages. Aslan, the Great Lion, was created in the image of Jesus Christ as the savior. They both completed redemption and overcame the devil in the resurrection. How Susan and Lucy felt about Aslan's death is similar to how we face the death of Christ. I love the special ending because it indicated that may be we'll forget Narnia one day, but whenever we open the cover of \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\" Narina is with us.

My favorite character is Lucy because she is the most caring and honest one in my opinion.The scene that meant something to me was the scene with the witch, the lion and the witch's friends at the Stone table, I can't tell you why or it will spoil the book.This book is adventurous and a great book to read at anytime."},{"rating":"2","title":"The classic Narnia book","review":"The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe is the classic of the seven Chronicles of Narnia books.

He was able to follow it when we read one chapter per day. Older kids will get more out of it.The story brings up interesting discussion. One of which is how do we know what is true? How do we know who to believe? What is redemption? Can people change? What is real love?Young kids may not think about these questions.

I told them they would read it, initially, as fiction. Then, in college, they would read it as literature. Then, as adults they would read it for its spiritual truths. The entire Chronicles of Narnia can be read from these perspectives, with differing emphasis in each book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent performance","review":"Michael York performs this story beautifully. Each character is distinct and enjoyable, and the narration, even the long, descriptive passages, is engaging. The only drawback is a slight volume difference between narration and character voices, which is only a minor nuisance in the car stereo. I still give it five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"My father used to read me and my siblings this book while we were little. Everyone got to be one of the charchters in the story. I was Edmund (although I'm a girl). While reading this book I kept pretending that my family was in the story. I was able to say to my siblings \\"That's you,\\" or \\"You're that one,\\" I enjoyed connecting to this book since it was quite similar to my family.The thing I didn't like about this book was the lack of connection between this book and the Magician's Nephew. The tree that Jadis was afraid of, wasn't in the book. However, the lamp post was. I think Aslan should have said something about the beginning of Narnia, Digory, or Polly from the other book.Overall, I wasn't able to give this book five stars because it didn't appeal to me as much as other books like Harry Potter did. (That's my absolute favorite book.) I think the story line is excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read for kids","review":"This book is great for kids to read from about Grade 3 and above. It can also be read to younger children. After reading the book watching one of the Narnia movies and comparing the two is a great comprehension activity.

Michael York reads the story in a revoltingly syrupy voice that sounds as if he is reading to a mentally deficient infant. This may be a children's book but it has appeal to all ages and even children hate to be talked down to. Look for another recording and leave this one on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book","review":"The book is amazing because ,I can picture most of the areas it is talking about in the book.

I know it's a children's book but it reads very childish to me. This is the main reason I just couldn't stick with it.My reason for 4 stars and not less, it was a great movie and it takes a great book to make a great movie.

I am constantly adjusting the sound volume. This is a great book, but it is exhausting and annoying trying to follow Michael York. I wish the producers had modulated the volume. I do not have this issue with any of my other audio books. For a contrast, try Christopher Timothy's reading of James Herriott's \\"All Creatures Great and Small.\\" Timothy also does a dramatic reading with different voices, but the volume is reasonable and the voices are plausible. I get the impression York was trying to treat reading \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" like a Shakesperean stage production. It is overblown."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Interesting","review":"A friend told me about this book and I suggested that my daughter should read it and loved it.There is nothing bad about the book.

The book is like Alice in Wonderland and Peter Pan. it is the story of Four normal children and how they enter a world through a wardrobe in an old house and come to rescue that world. It is a very symbolic book but i never picked up on that until I was at least in my teens. It is defintley not preachy and is a very simple engaging fairytale. i love this book more than any other and Every child should read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's In the Back of Your Closet?","review":"This allegorical book, supposedly aimed at children, provided Mr. Lewis with a wonderful medium to deliver a Christian message to readers of all ages. He casts the perennial contest between good and evil as a secret adventure of four displaced children in a land frozen under the control of a wily wicked witchy ruler. While good prevails, it does not come without struggle and sacrifice. Along the way the Lion of Judah acquires a new name and important lessons of loyalty and courage are learned.I really like books that are inspiring, thought-provoking, and fun. It makes me wonder what is in the back of all my closets! This book makes a great gift for young people that they will treasure throughout life.

In my humble opinion, Carmen was the most subtle, and the one with the best taste. Her integrity cost her dearly, and she never managed to score that one big hit that would secure her place in music history, but... BUT, she didn't need a hit song. Carmen worked harder than any other singer around, and she slowly managed to make a name for herself, and by the time of her death, was generally considered to be one of the finest, and most important, American singers in history. Her phrasing was unique (Mabel Mercer was a clear influence), and her diction well-nigh, and near perfect. This collection showcases a Carmen McRae at her very best. With class, style, dignity, and respect, she sings her heart out, uniquely, but always well poised. A real singer's singer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Carmen","review":"Love3 this album.

We recommend it to one and all. And if we may make a suggestion, we add that it is particularly affecting if read aloud."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting Agon","review":"Peyser's title marks him as a (gratefully belated)ephebe of Raymond Williams but the book soon reveals this as a revisionist strategy designed to mask Peyser's true critical father, none other than Henry James himself. As such, the book is an interesting agonistic struggle and if James is (necessarily) the winner, the willingness to take up the fight in itself marks Peyser as a noteworthy critic with great ambition and great work ahead of him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mythology of Middle-Earth","review":"I found this shallow and brief in its analysis and written in an annoyingly choppy style.

Of course this guy has to keep selling how excellent he is with stories of couples that gushed on and on about him, and without that, this book would have only been 5 chapters too long instead of 10.If need your partner to make you feel loved/wanted, then tell them how.

If we men are needing a better understanding or maybe just some clarification then this is a good book to help our love lives with more than just our wife or girlfriend.

Love itself is a universal language invented, established, and demonstrated by Jehovah God himself.

If I wanted to know how to build a motor, I'd ask Henry Ford. It just makes since. God is the answer.Oh and by the way it does not take two years for true love to take form as mentioned in chapter 3.

By nature we automatically show affection to others in a way that we would like to receive affection ourselves. We give love in the only way we know, but it's not interpreted as love by the other party. That person speak a different love language. Fortunately, when we realize what constitutes \\"love\\" to our spouse and other family members, we can learn to effectively speak their love languages.I credit Gary Chapman with a huge breakthrough in healing and strengthening our bonds with one another. No matter how difficult a relationship may be, I believe it can be improved by applying these simple truths."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE THIS BOOK!!","review":"This book is a great book to read.

I was surprised and impressed with the new insights into my relationship with my wife. I think the book may open the eyes of a few men once they read the book and look at themselves a little closer. I am a better husband after learning some truths about me, what I need from the relationship as well as understanding what I need to give. Share it with your spouse!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely great. I love it!","review":"If everyone learned to speak each others love language, the world would be a better place.

Everyone's perception if how to truly love another is different."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this book! So simple yet so important","review":"Something you'd probably never think of, something so simple and yet something so important. Who would have thought we all speak love a certain way?! It makes so much sense, and I have been able to realise so many things from past relationships as well as my present one. I can now see how love languages came into play where we had butted heads or ended up in a stalemate with love and intimacy. We both needed different things to feel truly loved, a certain way - this book demystified why things kept getting stuck and why we didn't feel overflowing with love at times - despite the other partner thinking they were being loving.There is no doubt a book like this can save marriages. We aren't born knowing how to be great in a relationship, how to make sure our partners needs are met or how to work them out - what really makes them tick - but this can help. I recommend it to all couples I know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it and very helpful","review":"Love it. I highly recommend this book for several reasons.

I can't believe these \\"help books\\" have any value. The author seems very proud of his accomplishments. The problem with help books is they tell you what you already know, or can figure out if you think about it long enough. This is the first and last \\"help book\\" I will buy. This guy is making money off this book and I'm embarrassed I bought it. \\"Five Love Languages\\" is a pat book on how to solve your marriage problems and offers pat solutions that really seem forced and insincere.

There is no easy solution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relationship saver.","review":"This book is geared toward married folks, but works just as well for the \\"seriously dating\\" as well. I had just about given up on my boyfriend of 4 years two winters ago.

I learned that touch is how I feel loved and show my love. My wife prefers quality time. Hopefully, having this information will help in my future relationships.Book is easy to read.

I just wish I would have read it sooner.It reminds me alot of buying a gift for someone. You don't buy the gift YOU want, you buy something they will want. That is precisely how we SHOULD show love. Show it in the way that THEY want it. I fell into the same mold as most where I would show love how I wanted it shown back, but like many relationships - he would show love to me the way he wanted . They just happen to be very different. I especially loved the quiz for you and your partner at the end.

An amazing entreaty against violence of both the left and the right, and a heartbreaking analysis of contemporary anti-Semitism. Comparable at some points perhaps to Koestler's Darkness at Noon, except that it deals with torture in a more direct (and horrifying, since it's nonfiction) way. I wish this were required reading in schools."},{"rating":"1","title":"memoir or political commentary?","review":"Although Timerman gives the best description of torture possible, I found this book to be a lot like reading a really long newspaper article. As a journalist, Timerman often gets caught up in the socio-political environment rather than the experience of torture and prison. This is supposed to be a memoir, not a political commentary on the situation in Argentina. I appreciated what Timerman wrote, but in all, I found the writing to be rather dry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Important nautical history presentation","review":"Tragedy at Honda brings out the cruel facts of one of the little known tragedy where a navigational error and \\"blindly following the leader\\" led to the loss of many brave sailors near Point Conception on the California coast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sensationalistic journalists should see this one","review":"Frederic March is the hard-boiled newspaperman who'll do anything for a story. Carole Lombard is the Vermont small-town girl who'll do anything to get out of that small town. I'm sure the French prefer the Jerry Lewis remake of this, but Sacre Merde!, how could they! March is tough and tender here, and is especially excellent in the scenes in which he goes to that small Vermont town to get the exclusive interview with the girl he thinks is dying of radium poisoning. Watch for the little tyke who takes a bite out of March's tuchas. Lombard is Lombard, or in other words, she's glorious, silly, sexy, and I'd have loved to have seen her play Lucy Ricardo!! This is one that deserves to be remastered, before the early color becomes too murky."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Sacred","review":"The title says it all.

The city takes her to its heart, and she and the reporter (Frederic March), who set up the whole scheme, fall in love. It was written by master Hollywood script writer Ben Hecht, so the dialogue fairly crackles, but the movie doesn't hold up too well after a few viewings. The early technicolor experiment was a disaster, too, though the DVD print isn't too bad (compared to the VHS release, which was horrible). Worth a watch, though - once."},{"rating":"2","title":"marriage should be sacred","review":"This is a good family movie.

Buy this one you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lombard Elevates Screwball Comedy From Mundane","review":"\\"Nothing Sacred\\" is something of a letdown because it doesn't deliver on it's promising premise. For sure there are any number of chuckles here but nothing that really aches the funnybone. The comedy is played too broadly to have any real resonance. It doesn't really work as a satire on yellow journalism for that same reason. The revelation here is the work of Carol Lombard who plays a smalltown girl who fakes radiation poisoning to parlay it into fame and fortune in the Big Apple. Lombard is a deft comedian who effortlessly straddles the lighter and broader comedic elements of her character and loses none of her glamour in the process. Frederic March, however, is something of a stiff here appearing to sleepwalk his way through his role as Lombard's benefactor from the New York tabloid."},{"rating":"1","title":"You'll never look at raw eggs the same way again....","review":"Hazel Flagg did something I never have seen anyone do with an egg before...suck the raw innards out!! This really grossed me out, but I guess back then it was the A #1 cure for a hangover. That was the most memorable moment in this movie...does that say anything??I really like Fredric March, and while he was cute and sweet here, I just didn't care for this movie at all. I found it too silly and shallow. But maybe I'm just not into comedy such as this. It was one of those movies, where midway thru you are thinking....will this be over soon??? I give it 2 stars only because Fredric March's handsome face graced this celluloid wonder. I recommend only renting this video..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie, terrible DVD quality","review":"This is a great film, but do NOT buy the copy of the DVD with the airplane on the cover, it is TERRIBLE.

No i bought the (WOOD) blocks for the that. They love those to. :)))"},{"rating":"2","title":"the Classic","review":"I bought this because I think that, with all of the Legos and battery operated toys out there, some things get overlooked which shouldn't. Blocks, in one form or another, have existed for hundreds of years. They are perfect for teaching balance, shape and color recognition, fine motor skills and a bunch of other things. There are so many things you can do with them that they can't help but spur some imagination. Even if that means building them up and then knocking them down with remote controlled cars.My 2.5 year old likes them but hasn't played with them too much. I'm sure as he gets older he will start building with them and using them with other toys as I did as a child. At least they will be there when his interest peaks.

A toddler can't do much with blocks that are 1 inch x 1 inch square. Another negative is that the blocks are super lightweight - you need some weight in a good building block in order to balance things when you're stacking them. My son initially tried to play with these, but he quickly lost interest after every tower he built containing more than three 1-inch blocks fell over. The color is nice, but the paint has begun to chip after minimal use. I'll be ditching this set and getting something larger and more heavy-duty. I would have expected better quality from a Melissa & Doug toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too small and uneven sizes","review":"I was extremely upset when my son dumped these blocks out on Christmas morning. First off, about a third of the box was filled with sheets of styrofoam, was that to make me think I was getting bigger blocks? Why not just make the box the size it needed to be. Second, the blocks were not uniform in size. Such as, some square blocks are smaller than the other square blocks. This makes it extremely difficult to build anything that will actually stand for longer than a few seconds. My 3 1/2 yr old gets very frustrated with these blocks. I will be looking for a replacement set from a different company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Melissa & Doug 100 Piece Wood Blocks Set","review":"The pieces of this set are much too small.

He's only 3 but I think the blocks are far more entertaining than other more intricate toys we buy our children to occupy them with. He and I build and tear down structures together for hours making it quite the interactive project that every parent should do and grandparent with their children. Keeping in mind it is educational as well. You go over shapes, you count with them and it gives their little brains that creativity they thrive on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Colorful wooden blocks great for toddlers!","review":"My almost 3.5 year old daughter enjoys building castles and rockets with these colorful blocks. She's pretty coordinated for her age, so the smaller size is not a problem, and I think that they will keep her interest for several years.

And, I can't say enough for the other Melissa and Doug toys we have and their quality.I would say that each rectangular piece is maybe 3 inches by 1 inch.The entire boy was maybe 18 inches by 12 inches by 4 inches.

He loves the blocks but he's not at the developmental stage yet to work with smaller blocks and balancing them. He is very interested in them, however. And the different colors are attractive. As well, it inspires conversations about colors while building structures. I have no regrets about buying these blocks and I think they're a great toy to have. I would recommend, however, the Pottery Barn blocks if you think your boy/girl might have trouble stacking and balance. I went to many toy stores before settling on both types of blocks (the PB blocks and the M&D blocks) and think these are the best of their type. Of course there are larger sets of blocks but if you're not looking for a massive collection of blocks, this is a good start."},{"rating":"1","title":"These toys are made in China","review":"For those of you that find this piece of information important to your buying decision, I thought I would pass this information along to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made in China","review":"Too bad it is made in China like all their other toys.

I didn't even open the cellophane wrapping but will donate them. I was mad at myself for not being more careful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pieces are too small and light","review":"This is a durable, quality toy. Colors are vivid and the paint endures constant falling/smashing. However, pieces are too small for any child less than 4; not because they cannot hold it but because they do not provide adequate stability when the child tries to build something. If the pieces are not leveled perfectly, they fall apart with the slightest touch because they are too small, narrow, and LIGHT. And if your child is less than 4 years old, s/he probably will not have the patience to built up anything that falls apart constantly. Overall, toy has very good material quality, but I would go for sets with bigger pieces if the child is not 4 or older."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad smell","review":"I was very disappointed by this purchase as the blocks have a very strong smell from the paint.

Block do make perfect sense and I've enjoyed seeing \\"cakes\\" and \\"tunnels\\" made throughout the day.Some pros and cons: this block set is small enough for toddler hands yet too many for parent-assisted clean ups; sturdy enough for building but small enough to where it's a bit painful when you step on them; great size for a two or nearly three year old but I suspect we'll have to search for bigger blocks when our toddler turns three.Overall, a great price for a big block set."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it","review":"Easy to play.

They definitely have been played with a lot since getting them. I think this would be better for much older children, since the blocks are so small. It takes a long time to build anything big from them, which can be frustrating for a 3 year old."},{"rating":"2","title":"good blocks","review":"I ordered these blocks for my almost 3 year old. Overall the quality is good, they are bright colors and my daughter enjoys playing with them. But when I ordered them I was expecting them to be bigger. The blocks themselves are on the smaller side so I do have to help her play with them which isn't a big deal. But if they were bigger they would be easier for younger children to stack without help. But I can see her playing with them for years to come so overall I am happy with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Toy for Grandchildren","review":"Because we have several grandchildren who visit us regularly, I wanted a set of blocks at our home for them to play with. The Melissa & Doug blocks fit the bill. They are colorful, durable, and easy to handle. The children play, build, and pretend with them.

The album, Be A Girl, was disappointing, and this ensures the follow-up, Bagsy Me, is such a surprising delight. The singles are really catchy punk pop, Hit (also a stalwart of UK TV advertising) and the delectable Shorty. But it all comes together for one big bang at the end with the awesome 9 minutes of That's All - a truly great track and captures this criminally underrated band at their very best. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Tour Guide","review":"This book is great fun in that you're actually a tourist through the time period.

Their strength comes from their ability to walk the fine line between homage and indulgence, taking the best from all of rock's early abandoned schools. Or, maybe, these styles found them, I mean, one look at a photo of the band, and your in awe of the glow of a laconic cool that hasn't been seen in the U.S. since sun-era Elvis...Anyway, I ramble, if you want a genuine good time, and a nice sampler (this is a compilation, not original album) of what is sure to be an underground sensation, give this a shot."},{"rating":"2","title":"great move on from Deep Purple","review":"A fantastic, rocky, and still modern sounding effort from Ritchie Blackmore's new band on leaving Deep Purple - actually all of Elf bar the guitarist, rebranded and given a punchy new sound.

Ritchie Blackmore took himself way too seriously. He left Deep Purple for this? Grown men singing about fairies, kings, dragons and the middleages? For, like, all the songs?\\"Man on the Silver Mountain\\" is a great, classic song (it is also acts as a bait switch...great first song and then all down hill from there). The instrumental at the end is enjoyable since it showcases Blackmore's guitar playing (which is the reason why most people checked this out).This sounds so silly and dated today. Ronnie James Dio's voice was a bad match for this muscular sound.Sorry metal fans, this stinks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent.","review":"This is the very beginning of Rainbow. Dio's singing has never been better. This proves that he had a soft side. He's not from hell. Ritchie Blackmore's playing is at his best. There's still a little leftover funk from Deep Purple, but there are some rare gems. Temple of the King, for instance. A very nice ballad. I love the instrumental from the Yardbirds. Classic. The only problem is that their isn't any long jams like on the 2nd album. Plus, some of the songs ramble on for a while. Catch the Rainbow should've ended around 4 and a half minutes, but instead, it's 6. Still, I can hear the power metal in the album. Nice playing from the keyboardist. I forgot his name. Very good debut."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blackmore's Rainbow","review":"If you're a fan of Ritchie then you have to have this! There's also \\"Rainbow Rising\\" which I have in the mail now.Use to have these when I was younger, on cassette."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard rock goes medieval..","review":"The cover picture gives quite an accurate representation of what this album is like: medieval imagery, castles and rainbows, shot through with some killer guitar from the one and only Ritchie Blackmore. Apart from the insanely out-of-place \\"If You Don't Like Rock N Roll,\\" it's 37 minutes of magic and mayhem. This isn't to say it's all fairies and elves - \\"Catch the Rainbow\\" is a sad almost-love-song that shows off Blackmore and Dio's abilities extremely well, \\"Snake Charmer\\" is an all-out hard rock tune, and \\"Still I'm Sad\\" is a wonderfully upbeat group jam that ends the album on a high note. And yet, it's still missing a star... only because Rainbow Rising is, in my mind, the most perfect work they've done. Can't give out those 5-stars like candy mints, they're reserved for the truly special cases. Anyway - if you like rock, guitar, medieval music, or either Blackmore or Dio, this is an album worth a few hard-earned dollars. After Rising of course."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than a Decent Album","review":"I keep reading reviews of Rainbow albums as decent or average, which is an understatement. While Rainbow never reached the musical heights of Deep Purple, the band was, in it's own right, influential in creating the gothic hard rock sound that so many derivative 80's English metal bands embraced. I admit that I AM biased in Blackmore's favor, but that's because he is THAT good of a guitarist and quite underrated.Listen to each song, but don't waste your time on \\"If You Don't Love Rock and Roll,\\" which elicits about as much emotion as watching lichens growing on rocks. However, \\"Man on the Silver Mountain\\" and \\"Self Portrait\\" are 70's metal classics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blackmore leaves Purple?!?","review":"If your a fan of Ritchie Blackmore,or Ronnie James Dio,this is a great CD to add to the collection! Essentially,this is Elf feat. Ritchie,but is a great cd nonetheless. Being a HUGE fan of Ritchie myself this was a must-have purely on already having it on cassette,and needing to upgrade,but what a great collection of songs! Man on the silver mountain,16th century greensleeves,and Temple of the king,just to name a few.

Saying that, I must say that this one, their first release, is astonishingly great, its great merit being the fact that each song is very different from the other, withou following the same old path or formula, but at the same time without sounding indulgent.

They are absolutely wonderful for quiet play. They stack well due to the very slight tackiness of the surface, which means that they don't slide apart or topple like wooden blocks do when not stacked directly on top of each other. He has been successful in building a stack 6-8 blocks high with the various shapes before it falls over. He enjoys kicking them and throwing them, and they will \\"bounce\\" rather than hurt furniture and other children. The large size makes them easy to pick up and hold; no more lost pieces under the couch! I liked the variety of shapes and sizes, and intend to purchase more. I wish that I had had these foam blocks when my children, neices and nephews were small; it would have made for much safer play time when all twenty-six of them were at my house or their grandmother's!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great building blocks","review":"These are nice because they are a good size, colorful, soft, durable and they float in the tub!!

True the pre print is from a 35mm original, and it is beautiful, but the film is transfered at a 1.4 ratio speed which shortens the running tme. This print runs only 76 minutes, which is 3 minutes shorter than the original film. It could be that a Euorpean print was used, as these prints alway run a bit shorter than the American print. Due to transfering a PAL coded print to a NTSC will cause a film to run shorter. In fact 4% shorter, 79 minutes X 4% = 3 minutes.

The fit is good, and it is comfortable. It also keeps you dry, until it rips.The first thing that ripped on mine was the the inner button up flap, this happened the second time I wore it. Next, I brushed up against something with the back, and it ripped. Currently the buttons on the sleeve cuffs are starting to rip out. The top flaps on the plastic are starting to rip as well. However, since it is plastic, you can use super glue and scrap plastic to repair holes.It is bright and it fits good, so that is why I gave it 2 stars. It would probably be a great jacket for use by a construction flagger or someone that does not do a lot of movement and physical work.

Halfway through the book my frustrations compelled me to read the reviews to find out what I had gotten into. By doing so, I saved myself from more hours of torture. I could not and did not finish the book. Just read the reviews and you will find that, the ending is as unsatisfactory as the beginning, answers will not be given, justice is a foreign word, and, in Jill, stupidity reigns.I heard Brenda Joyce is a good author. My friend gave me about 6 of her books. This was the first one I picked up. I might give her another chance, but I would rather re-read my entire \\"In Death\\" series by J.D.

I felt no emotional involvement with the characters at all. There was nothing about Jill for me to want to read about! The mystery was lacking and I did not care for the whole \\"Who am I\\" plot line. It was played...so played! I know Brenda Joyce has written five star books before, I have read them. This book fell short. I hope she can lure me back with something better in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the usual fare.","review":"I picked up \\"The Third Heiress\\" because I have always enjoyed Brenda Joyce's works. This book has more of a suspense edge to it; as do a lot of romances now.The problem with The Third Heiress is that the principle characters and their motives were not established early on in the book. One hundred pages into the book, I was still wondering what was going on in the book and why I should care.Going to a fiancee's funeral with his bitter hateful family, seeing a photo with the name \\"Kate,\\" and her last name on the of it does not make for a compelling mystery or much of a drama. Believe me, I did not stay up all night reading this one. There was no reason to. I did not like any of the characters, or care what happened to them."},{"rating":"1","title":"This broke my heart","review":"I don't like to read books where the \\"good guys\\" lose. Kate was such a lively character and in spite of the fact she disappeared nearly 90 years ago, the explanation of how she \\"ends\\" was horrible! Edward never found happiness and was estranged from the son he should have loved more than life itself. Anne's complete transformation to a hateful woman was hard to believe. Alex falling for Jill was tough to swallow, as she lost control of the car that killed his cousin. Hal's obsession and stalking of Jill was never fully explained. The ending was not only unsatisfying, it didn't bring closure to the \\"Kate\\" mystery. Pick up another one of Brenda's books to read..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho hum","review":"I purchased this book after reading a glowing review of Brenda Joyce's latest release \\"House of Dreams\\" in People magazine. Rather than spend the money on a hardcover from an unknown (to me) authoress I decided to check out one of her paperbacks first. I am in total agreement with all who have complained about her use of repetitious phrases. I was beginning to feel that if I read the phrase \\"Was Alex making a pass\\" one more time, that I was going to have to throw the book out the window. And all that business at the beginning of the book with Jill fainting at the drop of a hat was absurd, to say the least. Actually quite a bit of this book was absurd. However ... I haven't given up yet and plan to buy another Brenda Joyce today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Four Hundred Seveny Nine pages of Disappointment","review":"I was encouraged to read Brenda Joyce's new book on her past reputation. Sorry, I was disappointed. The story line had a lot of potential but it was too long and dragged on and on with no resolution in the end. It was like Ms. Joyce started writing with a great idea, then she herself lost interest and 300 pages into the story realized she had too may loose ends to tie up. Jill was a lunatic. I kept waiting for Jill and Alex to show some romance, and all I got was rough sex. The story from the 1900's was much better than the contempory. Other reviewers talk about the dialog. I was going crazy with \\"...she licked her lips\\". And whole thing with Hal's affection for Kate was weird. I just purchased another Brenda Joyce book. I hope I have a better read with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Third Heiress","review":"This was the first book by Brenda Joyce I've read and I loved it.

I am angry that I wasted my money and time"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good....but something was missing","review":"I have read a few of Ms. Joyce's books and I have to say that the woman knows how to spin a story. The Third Heiress is definitely a great book, BUT while reading it your under the impression that something is missing. I think the missing piece in the book is the romance that builds up between Jill and ALex. The mystery that the book has is superb but the love story seems kind of stilted. As a reader I found that I'd have preferred Jill to have ended up with someone else other than Alex because throughout the novel Jill can never trust in ALex and it makes no sense for her to end up falling in love with him. There is never that connection where you can say this seems like true love between the hero and heroine.Anyway...if you're looking for a romance novel this is not the book for you, but if you want a mystery read the book!! THe mystery is great! You get completely absorbed by Jill's fascination for Kate and her \\"quest\\" to find out her roots."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I thought this book was great! This is the first book that I have read by Brenda Joyce and it definitely have to read another! This book had me in suspense from the very first line! The only things that I didnt like was the ending. I wanted to find out what happened between Jill and Alex and what Jill decided to do..... is she went back to New York, if the family excepted her, ect! I hope that Ms. Joyce makes a second book to this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down.","review":"I hate those typical brainless, mushy romance novels that are about sex with a storyline written around it. This book had me hooked from the moment I read the first page. It wasn't ... your typical romance. It intrigued me, and I connected with Jill and Kate instantly. Yes, there are some faults to the book, but it's a great way to spend a rainy day. For those who don't count so well, Jill IS the Third Heir(ess). If Ms. Joyce continues to right in this style, she can be assured of adding another reader to her list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go back to romance writing, Brenda","review":"Why do the really good authors of romance books feel a need to \\"graduate\\" to thrillers and mysteries? \\"The Third Heiress\\" is full of implausibilities, errors, and nonsense. Did any reader really think for one minute that Alex was the villain? For that matter, did any reader even care? Go spend your money on a good, old-fashioned romance. Please, Brenda, forget this new trend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not In Keeping with Joyce's Usual Excellence","review":"I commend Ms. Joyce's efforts to shift into a more suspensful and mysterious gear, but for me, it lost the ususal in-depth romance between the characters. Maybe in an effort to write contemporary, Ms. Joyce is adopting today's common philosophy of casual sex between partners who never really get emotionally involved? I missed the communication and emotional turmoil that her characters normally have, and since I'm not much of a mystery fan - the plot that took it's place didn't fill that void. If you prefer a light romance, however, with a suspense twist - this might be more for you. In the meantime, however, I will be re-reading some of Ms. Joyce's classics like The Game and The Conqueror. Those were definitely her best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, but I thought this book was bad!","review":"To me, this book couldn't decide what genre it belonged in. Is it a romance, romantic suspense, ghost story, glitz? Who done it? I didn't care; the girl was long gone! Too many coincidences and stilted dialogue added to my dislike of this story. Then, there's the so-called love scenes; added I'm sure to give the author's fans a fair dose of her trademark sensuality. I'd pass on this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book!","review":"I could not put this book down - I read it in about 3 days. It's different from her other books, but nonetheless, very enjoyable. The first chapter draws you in and the storyline keeps you going until the end. I've read several times now and am still intrigued by it. I highly recommend it to romance and mystery novel lovers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My First Brenda Joyce book.....","review":"I am a little more than half way through but came on here today to see if anyone else who read this book picked up on an annoying little habit of Ms. Joyce's to repeat herself, namely the constant repetitiveness of using \\"she, Jill,...\\" and \\"her, Jill,....\\" over and over again as if we don't know who she is referring to. I was hoping this is not a trademark of hers because I'd like to read other books by this author, but this annoying habit has me wanting to hurl the book across the lawn. The only reason I haven't is because I want to see what happens! Little quirks aside, I am really enjoying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jill fainted","review":"If you're looking for a piffle to while away a couple of days at the beach, this is it. The romance between Jill and Alex isn't romantic. One thing that really irritated me is that Brenda Joyce uses the word \\"huge\\" to describe just about everything. I also found it annoying how Jill, who lived in a small New York apartment and had very little money, could meet a person and instantly identify Gucci shoes, a Hermes tie, an Armani scarf, etc. How would she know? The subplot about Jill's ancestress, Kate, is simply ridiculous. I felt no sympathy for the young woman being shut up in a tower--she was such an obnoxious character I would gladly have done it myself. It was really stretching it to believe her friend would do this.

The two plots are, in my opinion, almost EXACTLY alike. This novel is lacking originality and romance. The writing is adequetely written, but I wouldn't recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable Plot","review":"Normally I love Brenda Joyce's work, having read all of her novels, but I was greatly disappointed with The Third Heiress.I felt the plot was too ridiculous to be believed. I wondered why Jill had such a fixation over Kate, and why she'd be so concerned with a possible murder from 90 years in the past.Throughout this never-ending book, I found myself thinking, \\"Oh, please, let's be a bit realistic here!\\" No one, but no one, would be so concerned with Kate and what had befallen her so long ago, and I also found it hard to believe that Alex would willingly wrap himself up in this \\"mystery\\" as well. More than likely, he'd have walked away muttering to himself.One major annoyance--\\"He stared.\\" \\"She stared.\\" I was about to scream. Certainly Ms. Joyce can manage better than that.Normally a fast reader, I think it took me a week to get through The Third Heiress. I'd pick it up, read a few pages, then go find something better to do.I hope her next book is a much better read."},{"rating":"1","title":"1/3 into the book, I was not interested in the storyline.","review":"I usually finish a Brenda Joyce novel within 2-3 days and always am sad to see the novel end. The Third Heiress took me 7 days to finish. One third into the novel, I could not sympathize with Jill at all, I did not care about name dropping of clothing labels, Hal, Kate, Tom or any one of the characters. The story line between Edward and Kate was great, but short. I finished the novel just to finish it. Please Brenda, return to the gothic romances! I was enticed by the title, The Third Heiress, a great title for a Brenda Joyce gothic romance--but it was not to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read!","review":"I really enjoyed this novel. I am hoping that Brenda Joyce will come out with more like this one. It isn't predictable like a lot of romance novels and keeps you on your toes. The only part that really diappointed me was that Edward never found out what happenned to Kate during his lifetime. At one point he was very close. It was very sad the way Kate and Edward's story turned out in contrast to Jill and Alex.

I enjoyed reading about the various ways and the different types of teachers that influenced these writers. Surprisingly not all of the writers chose teachers that were a 'traditional' teacher nor did they all choose teachers who specifically taught english.

Like many artists Fuzz bridges the jazz between folk and electronic music. \\"Fantasy\\" sounds like inspired electroclash meets Primal Scream. \\"Bokka\\" reminds me of The Stone Roses. \\"C'mon C'mon\\" is like girl groups in the sixties. Fuzz likes to evoke all periods of music. He was once part of Bentley Rhythm Ace and seems like a producer of big fat beats a la Fatboy Slim.

I was lucky enough to find it used for a dollar, which is what it's worth to have this song. The song is fun, catchy, and has minimal vocals. Minimal vocals is a plus, since when there ARE vocals on the album, they're bland, tone-deaf, and very annoying (his voice is just too hard to bear). Not to mention that the lyrics are completely mundane. If you can't write good lyrics, PLEASE do us all a favor and alter your voice so we can't understand them. However, I doubt Fuzz has the technology or talent to even do THAT effectively. Please, don't buy this album.

As I got older, I never forgot that initial shock, and I realized that if I had had that strong of a reaction, I could only imagine the way the Ingalls felt. This book deals with some really intense and painful times (sanitized somewhat for children), although the family endures with its typical strength and spirit.

Another is when Jack was their dog and he died of old age.The author is telling about her life when she was a little girl. She is Laura.

This book is not about how God wants you to be rich and there's nothing in here about how you can enjoy material and spiritual wealth. It's Paul's explaination of how technology drives growth in a free market economy along with copious supporting evidence, prescriptions for changes in government policy, etc. While I agree with much of what he says, its nothing new and, frankly, he doesn't write very well.

The blessing promised to Abraham and people of faith is primarily spiritual and can include but doesn't have to include material wealth. To claim the Bible teaches that \\"God wants you rich\\" is an insult to all the godly men and women through the ages who weren't rich -- and those today who aren't. This book will sell in prosperous U.S.A but that doesn't mean it's basic premise is correct.

I suppose that question smacks of snobbishness. So be it. The question is never raised in the book, and so it is never answered, but I'm still wondering.If my memory serves me correctly, this town had 400 people and two Catholic churches. That is really hard to believe. The Catholic church I attended as a child had at least 200 people at each of 6 Sunday services; thus, it served at least 1200 people.

It definitely is loud, and I wouldn't recommend it as a fan primarily for nighttime, but it is very powerful over a small area and does what I need it to. I even accidentally sucked some plastic bits into the back of the fan and they wrapped around the motor, but the fan just automatically shut off and I was able to unwrap the plastic with no issues or damage to the fan.

This sure LOOKS like that other, excellent brand of fan that rhymes with \\"Fornado\\", but by comparison this fan is total garbage!! It moves a little bit of air at the cost of being able to hear anything else in the room, and the higher speeds don't really seem to increase the forward flow of air, although they do increase the noise even further.I made the huge mistake of buying a look-alike, and every time my room gets hot I regret my decision. Avoid the Honeywell. Yuck!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Noisy, Noisy, Noisy","review":"I recently bought the Honeywell HT800 at Walmart and actually heard it running before I bought it. It didn't sound very loud in the store probably because there were other fans running nearby. However, at home in a quiet bedroom it is not satisfactory at all. I am currently online looking for another fan to purchase. I will probably give the Honeywell to my husband to use in his shop."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best!!","review":"I had this fan for almost two years, and is the most efficient at its job I ever had. Yes, it is noisy, but in order to move the volume of air it does, you can only do it with big, slow, quiet blades, (and I mean BIG), or with small, fast, noisy ones.(Think of a hair dryer). Regarding those complaining about dust in the blades, sorry, but is not related to the fan, is directly proportional to the amount of dust present in the room.I find it well designed, well built, well balanced, and a real BARGAIN!"},{"rating":"2","title":"powerful well built fan.","review":"pushes plenty of airseems kinda loud but its a deep sound and for the amount of air it gives its fine.It could use some type of handle to move it around.I believe my fan died due to an electrical surge after about 2 years, but it was good while it lasted.the fan speed knob would buzz due to vibration - u just have to twist it a little to get it to stop."},{"rating":"2","title":"FAN FAN","review":"Definitely super, turbo, and high peformance -- not to mention a fine value. Plenty of power packed into a solid, well-designed appliance. A little heavy on the white noise, but that comes with turbomachinery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good circulation","review":"The fan does a fairly good job for moving the air. The main flaw that I see in this product is that it not very easy to clean since it does not come apart that way. If you can figure out how to get the dust out easily, then the product could be five stars since the price is good and it moves the air well."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Little Fan That Could....","review":"It may be little, and a tad loud, but the 'white' noise created by this fan is just what I need to drown out the noise. I love it! Plus it really does a great job circulating the air. Yes, I'd buy it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exhibits fan-like behavior, noise - satisfactory","review":"Like other reviews have said, it's not exactly a quiet fan, although the noise it makes isn't high-pitched or unpleasant. It blows air well, albeit in a narrow stream. I use my two \\"Super Turbo High Performance\\" fans 24/7 and find the tilting feature useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whole lotta power!","review":"This fan is small but it puts out alot of power. It is loud so if you were hoping for a quiet fan don't get this one because even on low it is loud. Makes a great fan for a garage or workout room."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loud but functional","review":"I've been using this fan for about 3 years now. It's loud, but it works very well, and it has lasted. I like the fact that it's loud, because I also use it as a white-noise generator for my dorm room.2012 Update: I ended up using two of these over an eight year period. Each fan lasted about four years before it started buzzing, and I eventually replaced the second one with aVornado Flippi V6. The Vornado is fine, but I would say the Honeywell was better because it was sturdier and moved more air."},{"rating":"2","title":"You just can't beat Honeywell","review":"Over the years, I've bought dozens of fans of various makes and models. I bought my fist Honeywell of this style (the very small office version) three or four years ago. I use it at work, everyday, year round. It still looks and runs like it did on the first day. I now own four of these small guys, as well as an 11\\" version and an 18\\" version. They are work horses and do their job better than any other fan that I've ever owned. I also have a Honeywell stand fan that I've owned for about 5 years now and, just like these babies, it's the bomb (it runs all night, every night). Don't tell Amazon or Honeywell, but I would have paid 3 or 4 times as much as I did for these fans - and they'd be worth every dime!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loud but high quality","review":"I'm reading a few reviews about the noise level of this fan. Its not especially noisy -- rather its about what you would expect, especially for how strong it is. I have this fan set on low, sitting on my desk, and I have to move it all the way to the back of the desk so that I don't get *cold*. Its definitely a good value for the money. Its a very powerful and solidly built fan. Its not going to break from everyday usage. The frame allows you to tilt it up so you can use it to move air around the room, similar to how you would with an \\"air circulator\\"-type fan. The fan does not oscillate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice little fan","review":"I say nice, and not great, because the fan is loud even on the low setting. In fact the low setting on this fan is about the speed of my 11 year old mini fan on high. Air circulation is great. If you have a room that has next to no air circulation I would recommend one of these fans. As for power consumption , I hooked it up to a testing unit;Low 27 watts at 380mAMed 31 Watts at 410mAHigh 35 Watts at 540mA(+/-2%)For those of you who like a form of white noise to sleep at night(I am one of these people), I would have to recommend you look elsewhere for that comfort noise. The noise of this fan is a little harsh in my opinion.Overall its a decent little fan for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for white noise","review":"These fans are great! I use them to create 'white noise' in both of my daughters' rooms. we have a small house and it helps block out a lot of noise. My youngest daughter had colic and we went through tons of batteries in her 'white noise maker'; this fan is terrific in place of that.It does get rather dirty (I use it 24/7), but a 'swiffer' can get it mostly clean. But, I have replaced her first one after a year - just so it would be nice and clean. For $10 bucks, why not??But, I will tell you that each fan sounds different. some are quieter than others...but yes they are kind of loud."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a fan for those who enjoy quality fans","review":"I am a college student and these fans are cheap and at Target, so most of my friends have at least one. The downside is, they are horrible, cheaply made, and downright dangerous. The base is too small for the fan, making it extremely top heavy. As a result, if the fan is on an uneven surface or ledge, like a windowsill, any jolt sends it toppling to the floor, or your head, really whatever is underneath. Moreover, it is loud, blows at very limited angles, and really doesn't move that much air. Even the cord is short.Seriously, don't buy this fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compact air pusher, white noise maker","review":"This fan moves a lot of air for its size and is suprisingly stable due to its low profile and wide base. It does make some noise, but its been safe around the kids and easy to move around, even in the van (with inverter and 12V). On the highest setting, you can feel the air from at least 10 ft way. I would rate the noise as being similar to the vent fan on a microwave or Jenn air exhaust. Its enough to notice its absence when you turn it off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loud loud LOUD!","review":"I bought this fan for my dorm room before starting my first year of college, mainly because it was so cheap (a fifth of the price of a quality Vornado fan). However, this little fan made such noise (even on its lowest setting) that I regretted not spending more money for a better-made machine. I regularly had to sit down and attempt to clean out the layer of dust it accumulated on its blades - I've never seen dust like that on another fan.Bottom line, it's a cheap piece, don't bother unless you're already deaf."},{"rating":"2","title":"LIttle power Fan","review":"Great little fan.. Its a very powerful fan, dont be fooled by its size. Great for airing out rooms."},{"rating":"2","title":"loud but gets the job done.","review":"This is the loudest little fan I've come across so far, but it moves lots of air, much more than I expected. I have it in my bedroom window to pull in air, and I don't think I've had to take it off the lowest setting. The white noise it creates doesn't bother me while I'm going to sleep, but I can see how it might be a bit too noisy for some."},{"rating":"1","title":"LOUDES FAN I'VE EVER HAD","review":"I read a lot of reviews to get this. I can't believe it's so LOUD. It's impossible to use it at home. Maybe it works in the factories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pushes lots of air, makes lots of noise","review":"Rather than spell out pros and cons, I'll just call them all \\"observations,\\" since one person's noisy fan is another person's white noise heaven. Anyway, here are my observations after having owned one of these fans for over a year:1) It moves a lot of air for its size;2) It has three speeds, the slowest being quite breezy and the fastest being only marginally faster than the slowest (in my opinion, Honeywell could've done without the middle setting altogether, or slowed down the slowest setting more);3) This fan puts out a lot of white noise, even on its slowest setting -- I would compare its slowest setting to the white noise of a box fan on medium;4) I used this fan unsuccessfully in an office environment (too noisy because I couldn't put the fan more than five feet away from my desk) but successfully in a home environment (white noise puts my wife to sleep while still moving quite a bit of air from 10 feet away from our bed)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just like others claim, it's a bit loud...","review":"Yes, it is a bit loud, but for $9.99, it definitely does the job that it's supposed to do. I sit in the corner of my office building, so it's real tough to get the building's air conditioning fully circulating through... I plug the fan in and keep it on my desk, and turn it on when necessary. I find myself turning it off for phone conversations because of the noise, even on it's lowest setting, but it REALLY moves air, which is why I bought it.You can easily read other reviews about the performance of this fan on its lowest setting, so I'll tell you about the highest. I've only used it once, and it blew everything off my neighboring cubicle's desk. A fan is meant to keep you cool. This one will definitely do the trick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adequate","review":"It isn't as loud and powerful as the other reviews made it out to be but for a cheap fan it does the job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly High Performance in this excellent value","review":"I bought two of these small fans. They proved to be very high performance, for their small size and value. They move quite a bit of air, and some noise goes hand and hand. Really great value for such a small amount of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very loud fan","review":"If you want to use this fan on a hot summer night to cool you off as you fall asleep, you won't be able to, this fan is far too loud. Its as loud as a large window fan. That being said, its the most powerful small fan that I have ever seen. Personally, I would rather have a quiet fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lowsy performance","review":"This fan takes at least a minute to get up to speed...very dissapointed in the performance"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, but can be noisy.","review":"This fan is surprisingly powerful, and does a great job. It is a bit louder than you would expect, and the 'low' setting is relatively high to start, but if you're looking for lots of air out of a small fan, and don't care about ambient noise, this is a great fit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low Quality fan","review":"I bought 5 of these fans because of the reviews I have read here. Of the 5 only one still works. They only lasted a year. They are cheap, but you get what you pay for. They are disposable. Expect to buy a new one every year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lasts About A Year - But It's a Good Year","review":"I go through these Honeywell fans like mad. Although they've got a 5-year warranty, they routinely fail in about a year of regular (daily) use. That is, they'll either stop turning very well, or develop horrible rattles and squeaks. As it would cost more to send it in for replacement than to buy a new one, the warranty is fairly pointless. That being said, these are great little fans for the money while they last. They REALLY move air, and have a good \\"white noise\\" sound (if you're looking for a quiet fan, keep looking - if you want something to help drown out background noise, this is it). I wish these were a bit sturdier - and could be opened for cleaning. But all in all, unbeatable for the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Powerful but Noisy","review":"These are nice small powerful fans. They pack a punch for their size.

Amazon has properly stopped selling them until Honeywell gets it's act together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Powerful, noisy, short life","review":"I bought this fan for use at night while I was sleeping. It worked great for awhile, and the loud noise drown out the birds that liked to wake up and play at 4:30 in the morning right outside my window.About nine months later, though, it's on its last leg. For 15-20 mintues after I first turn it on, the blades rotate very slowly. With patience it will get up to about half of the speed it had when brand new, which is still tolerable. It requires the highest setting to actually move any air, though.So it works great for a year or so if you're lucky. If that's worth $10-15 and you don't mind the sound, this is the fan for you. If you expect more than a few months out of a product, look for better quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaast delivery","review":"After ready many reviews that all said the fan was loud, I decided to buy one. I am glad. Like many others, I wanted something to make noise so that I could sleep. It is small, light weight, easy to move around. Perfect for my use. I could not believe how fast it was delivered. Two days from the day I ordered it. WOW!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Small yet powerful","review":"I bought 2 of them for bed room & living room and am very satisfied with this purchase.. I did a thorough research before buying it and this product had a very good rating.. When it arrived I thought it is very small and it may not suffice our need but when I turned it ON I couldn't believe the power this small thing had.. The 3 speed setting is just apt for the temperatures in summer in NJ..As this fan is fixed in only one direction it would have been the best fan if it moved side ways thats what I think.. But overall its good product and am happy with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Perfect","review":"This is a great fan. It moves air well, and is fairly quiet.If I could change one thing, I would add an even slower speed. The slowest speed turns pretty fast, and creates a breeze. Something a little slower that would just circulate without torrents would be a nice addition."},{"rating":"2","title":"great white noise, breezy, stable, portable","review":"This light, portable little fan works great. It produces a very smooth white fan noise that's not very loud, but not whisper quiet. It's great for sleeping and it moves air pretty well. It's quite stable for what it is - a small, portable fan.Anybody who puts a floor fan on a windowsill and complains about the results should not waste his money on a college education, and should instead invest in a clamp, or a different fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXACTLY WHAT ROCK NEEDS","review":"I am SO sick and tired of hearing the same type of ... on radio stations.

What you get instead is awesome songwriting and arranging with heavy metal influences. The metal is there, it's just not center stage all the time.This album has made it in my top 10 list...and that's pretty difficult to do.The first time I heard of this band was on my favorite Internet radio station, www.Reignradio.com.

The sound quality is pretty good, though a lot of the songs 'blast' more than they ought to. That's all possible to deal with. The part that can't be forgiven is the fact that nearly every one of these records is off center, and the pitch wobbles throughout the entire CD.

The content of Freud's book is still interesting today, of course. The Brill translation is stiff and somewhat old-fashioned but certainly enjoyable.This edition has problems. Though attractively produced and clearly typeset it contains many typographical errors. It also makes the bizarre decision to place the footnotes in the text, indented, proceded with both a number and a little bracketed notification that the footnote is about to begin, and then followed by a similar notification that the footnote is over and we can all relax now. I gather that the text is in the public domain and the publisher has released it with minimal formatting. Very disappointing.

As a parent, this means that they pre-date the FCC programming standards for children. The content on this DVD is troubling if you care about positive modeling and concepts for your child. In the first episode, the ponies are forcibly kidnapped and endure slave labor, and the bad guy cronnies plot to kill the evil princess.

The quality was really poor, the Alien and his Dragon spaceship I suppose were different from recent Alien movies I watch, he was a spaceman who resembled David Bowie. It was really a dumb movie.

The audio and video don't track together, with the audio being about one second ahead of the visual. This renders the entire movie into bad comedic farce.

Saw them live in the mid-90s and they were amazing. But after \\"Foolish\\" the energy just seemed to leak out of them until they've come to this. Alt, indie, rawken role--whatever its alias--should never have strings. Period. \\"Maturity\\" is no excuse for a viola or a cello. If you've really found maturity, write better lyrics. This is elevator music for indie punkers starting to gray around the temples. Sadly, the \\"chunk\\" could learn a little something from old punkers like Dead Moon about how getting long in the tooth doesn't mean you can't still tear it up. For those new to Superchunk, go back and listen to everything from \\"No Pocky For Kitty\\" to \\"Foolish\\". Those were great recordings and they had a good run. Too bad they outran their own legend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Here's to old age","review":"It's not that this is a terrible album in concept (or in title, Here's to Shutting Up is definitely a favorite for me, if only Fred Durst would make an album like that) but the album lacks any of the elements that Superchunk is known. This is not to say that they shouldn't explore new avenues, but this album demonstrates more of a lack of enthusiasm than a need for growth. It starts out ok and credit should be given that the opening track states the new mission state ment with folkier guitars and poppy back ground vocals, but the back is missing something. Even when they return to puchy guitar style of old they lack something vital. I suppose that if I can't put my finger on exactly what's missing, than it would be unfair for me to expect Superchunk to, but I still found myself growing increasingly bored as the album played itself out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Getting Better","review":"Now off the underground's official radar screen, professional indie band Superchunk keep getting better. Here's to Shutting Up, their eighth studio release, continues in the vein of the wonderful Come Pick Me Up. They rock less (middle age can do that to you) but think more, and the trade-off is equitable. They're picking up new sounds - steel guitar on the country-ish \\"Phone Sex\\", electronica on \\"What Do You Look Forward To?\\", string quartet (!) on \\"Late-Century Dream\\" - while never sounding like genre-chasers. A lot of forgiving and forgetting is going on in these songs, signs of maturity and/or defeat. On \\"Florida's on Fire\\", which might possibly be about a certain election, the chorus of \\"yeah, yeah's\\" that follow each line are both funny and haunting, absurd laughter in the face of overwhelming disappointment. Excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of their best albums","review":"I've loved Superchunk's music for about ten years and I think that \\"Here's to Shutting Up\\" is their best album since \\"Foolish.\\" Superchunk is one of the few bands to have matured out of their garage band origins without going completely limp like the Goo Goo Dolls, Soul Asylum or Paul Westerberg. In fact, I think that Superchunk has matured into being a better band than they were before. Doesn't happen very often so enjoy the moment.

So this is up there with 'The Godfather' and 'Citizen Kane'? Look, I get that this is supposed to be a lighthearted romantic comedy but it was utterly predictable and dull, with a cliched \\"fish out of water\\" plot right out of Scriptwriting 101. Sample scene: man tells his boss there is no way he is traveling to India. Want to guess what the next scene will be? The whole film is like this, moving from one predictable plot point to another with obvious jokes so blunt that they could be punctuated with a rimshot on the soundtrack. Josh Hamilton in the lead role doesn't help much as he is too bland to conjure any believable chemistry with Asif Basra.Yes, a lot of the events in the film are the types of things an expat would experience traveling and working in India.

But I do get a laugh-out-loud kick out of Americans who imitate the Indian accent. (I hope it doesn't offend anyone.) The only real hillarious part of the movie, for me, was when \\"Mr Toad\\" and Asha switched accents and some mannerisms on the ferry. First time I watched the movie, I laughed out loud during this scene and it scared my dog who was sleeping on my lap at the time. (Which made me laugh harder).I can't say I learned much about India nor were there any real eye-opening plot twists or turns.This movie is a good one for a relaxed afternoon when you don't have anything else to do but chill out on the couch with a dog on your lap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to recommend Outsourced","review":"This is a wonderful movie and I think it appeals to a wide audience. It is lighthearted but at the same time there is an undercurrent of relevance to our global world. It is also a romantic love story.

Granted, she hadn't even been around 5 years as of the release of this album, so there wasn't yet all that much to pick from. Mandy definitely has time to keep developing, keep putting stuff out there. Anyway, this album is a very listenable compilation, not much stuff that blows you away, just enjoyable music. The album does show some of the development of Moore from the bubble-gum stuff to more mature work. The song \\"In My Pocket\\" is a very good song and an exemplar of the development beyond bubblegum. It is genuinely different and interesting, with a Middel Eastern groove to it. Another excellent tune is \\"Senses Working Overtime.\\" It's an excellent melody and very catchy, as are the lyrics.

I thought they were very diverse and interesting. I wanted to know more about the characters at the end and stayed up until three in the morning to finish it.

More books like this one please!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read","review":"I usually do not write book reviews but I felt compelled to write this one. I thought Chocolate Star was excellent. The characters were well-developed, realistic because they had problems and the writer is extremely talented. I can hardly wait to read something else by her and have suggested this book to anybody who will listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genius, Pure Genius.","review":"Absolutely top draw. Mother's Pride have reeled off some of my favourite tracks and this is up there with the best. Floribunda was pumpin', but this offers far more. If you're in the mood to dance or sit back and absorb, this tune is quality. A vastly under-rated track that keeps growing on you the more you listen to it. Well worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly surprised","review":"I was thoroughly entertained watching not just the punk interviews, but the rest of the interviews(to the dvd's credit, they kept the shows intact). There are some nuggets buried in the annals of tv, and this show is one. Watching this reminds me how talented Tom Snyder was at riffing with guests of all stripes. It has a late night, unpolished feel that clashes favorably with the over-rehersed, celeb banality of today. More Tomorrow Show dvds please. If Dick Cavett can have multiple releases, Tom Snyder certainly should."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tom Snyder is a dork but this is a BLAST from the past!","review":"Lots of great vintage footage of great punk rock and new wave bands like the Ramones, Elvis Costello, Iggy Pop and Wendy O'Williams. Tom condutcts long and sometimes awkward interviews with these great icons of rock. This is a great collection that you can't see elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Convenient and well flavored","review":"A friend who sets up networks recommended these. His hours can be crazy and he always has his caffeinated mints and diet sodas on hand when he's leaving for a late night implementation. He is diabetic and has sleep apnea, so he needs to be careful about what he ingests. These help give him the edge he needs when night becomes an hour too long. I've reached for these little guys myself when leaving my computer isn't an option. Love having them on hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Live concert","review":"This is a live great concert from Arturo but the classical tracs are pretty weird.

However, the tag on the band of the skirt clearly states that these are YOUTH skirts, not Juniors. Fogdog needs to change their description and tags to reflect youth sizing. There is a huge difference in youth sizing and junior sizing. No way my daughter can wear this."},{"rating":"2","title":"¡Más!","review":"Hailing from Monterrey, Mexico's Volovan sound nothing like any rock en español you've heard before. Singer/guitarist Chalo Galván's influences are less likely Mana or Juanes than the Beach Boys, the Beatles, Blondie, and Britpop. If that sounds like a delicious combination to you, chances are you'll love this CD. There are 11 tracks, including two instrumentals, and whether you speak Spanish or not (I don't) you'll be humming these tunes in your head for days, beginning with the Strokes en español \\"Ella Es Azul\\", continuing with the Brian Wilson en español \\"Violines\\", and on to the Cheap Trick en español of \\"Me Vas Dejando\\". Galvan's voice is pleasant if a bit on the light side, but the harmonies of his fellow bandmates make up for any potential weakness there. Bassist Alejandro Gulmar is a buoyant talent - whether pounding out a one-note thrash or strumming a sunny countermelody, his sense of esprit keeps these songs afloat. All I can say, boys, is ¡Más!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Suave, relajante, y con energia","review":"Este es el primer disco de la banda Volovan y la musica es energetica pero relajante, las liricas son positivas y sonadoras. Se lo recomiendo a las personas que les gusta escuchar musica independiente que pocas personas conocen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that comfortable","review":"I bought this to replace an old gel seat that I've had for about ten years and that was finally giving out on me. Right out of the packaging, this Schwinn seat looks like it would be very comfortable, but it's got a hard base underneath that makes it feel like I'm riding on a layer of wood.Also, the product description says that it is designed for \\"spin bikes\\" and doesn't say that it's made only for Schwinn spin bikes, so I thought it would be alright to use for my Phoenix spin bike. However, it keeps moving and shifting around when I use it, even when I pull the draw strings as tight as possible. This movements ends up causing some chafing on my inner thighs, which is certainly not a pleasant thing.I'll continue to use this since I can't return it since I've used it a few times, but I'm not that impressed with it and would suggest looking at another brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"great temporary relief","review":"This product is great.

Truly."},{"rating":"2","title":"angel music","review":"Many reviews here compare Iron and Wine to people I'm not familiar with. My take is that our dear Mr. Beam is a cross between Donovan and Ben Harper with a little Simon and Garfunkel thrown in. This is one of the most unique and quietly uplifting recordings I've experienced in many years, and the soft home-made quality makes it all the more endearing. I anxiously await more releases but am certain as another writer was, that this one will join me on that desert island for sure. A gentle, welcome respite from this tough, cruel world we all must share. Thank you, sir for this gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Sam Beam's simply wonderful songs are peaceful, emotion filled, pieces that come from a soul yearning to be shared in a quiet, giving and gentle way. Sam's lyrics are amazing. Many times I found myself saying outloud: \\"Man, that's good.\\" His intelligent lyrics are perfectly woven into simple and melodic guitar strumming or elegant picking and sliding, that never gets in the way or detracts. All of it comes together in haunting purity. \\"Upward Over the Mountain\\" is indeed a beautiful song, and is brilliant. The reviewer who said it broke his heart and put it back together: that's it exactly. This entire album is filled with kindness, honesty, and generosity.This album is a true gem. A true find. Words don't do it justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"sweet songs for a tired man such as i","review":"I am useless at writing so I appologies, yet Amazon asked and well I thought I would write a line or two.Comparisons to Nick Drake yes and no. Unique yes, Very heartfelt songs. I am an old rocker getting to middle age and this band Brother and sister I belive are spot on with the deep touching songs.Being a Brit it is definatly American yet there seems to be no stomping of fervant Americanism Its sort of a tribute in folk dare I say rock to the great and complex land America is.I personaly love the sweet slow groove of Upward Over The Mountain.Great music."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great CD","review":"I discovered Iron and Wine on the Garden State CD. Since then I have bought 3 of their CDs. One of the best things I like about this CD is the style of their music is consistent. Iron and Wine sounds somewhat like Simon and Garfunkel with an edge to it. I highly recommend this CD, and Endless Summer Days, which is just as good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great disc","review":"This is a great disc. It is best done with a full listen through, letting the music wash over your ears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading reviews","review":"The comparisons to Will Oldham and Nick Drake in various reviews, including the editorial, got me hooked as I really like their work. Having listened to the album I am underwhelmed and feel that the reviews were very misleading. Where are your heads at? He is not like them at all! Iron & Wine is far more naieve and sentimental in a sincere singer-songwriter sort of way. In fact he is more reminiscent of Irish troubadour David Kitt, which is fine if you are into that sort of thing, but he is no Will Oldham. If you are a fan of the latter - approach with caution - have a listen to it before you proceed to checkout! It is unfortunate as I will be much slower in future to take a flyer on new artists on the basis of Amazon reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply boring","review":"I picked this one up after reading some glowing reviews on Pitchfork and Amazon. Well, it just goes to show you that Pitchfork can't always be trusted...this music is simply boring, folky music that puts me into a coma every time I try and listen to it in it's entirety. I'll admit that he has a gorgeous, rich voice, but the production is so lo-fi that I can barely make out half of the material, and the music itself is dull and monotnous. All I could think of listening to him was that he sounded like Jack Johnson, which is NOT a compliment, sitting in some liberal arts college quad strumming mediocre folk songs about peace and love on his guitar. I cannot for the life of me understand why this album is praised so highly. Too bad...I was really looking foward to hearing it the first time around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated and sleepifying","review":"This CD is certainly inoffensive, but hardly justifies the too-fulsome praise it has garnered here and elsewhere. Think \\"O Brother Where Art Thou\\"/Uncle Tupelo, but a lot slower and less interesting. As a co-worker/co-music critic suggested, it is perfect for lying in bed and reading, trying to fall asleep. Otherwise really not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better Than Sominex","review":"I bought this album after reading all the reviews here figuring this is right up my alley. I mean I love acoustic Dylan, early Bruce Cockburn, Nick Drake, all of that. How could I not like this? Maybe because it's mind-numbingly boring and tedious? Also perhaps because the lyrics are often half-baked and meaningless? If I'm ever brain damaged in an accident I will instruct my wife to play this cd when I become agitated; I believe I will be much more receptive to the \\"genius\\" so many people here admire. But as I am now in full potential of my critical faculties I have about 500 other cd's more worthy than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do yourself a favor and don't buy this CD","review":"This CD got the record for the quickest play in my cd player. I pretty much hated this CD right from the beginning. If you are looking for something to put you to sleep at night then this is the one for you. It seemed like Sam Beam kept playing the same chords over and over again for every song. I also found his lyrics to be a little outlandish at times. I actually read a review that put him in the same category as Elliot Smith. That is so far from the truth. Do not fall for that trap. I am glad that I actually downloaded all of the songs before I purchased this CD. I wouldn't have been this easy with my review if I actually paid for this album. Iron and Wine should be named Iron and 3 bottles of wine because you need to be drunk to listen to this."},{"rating":"2","title":"*****","review":"Gorgeous.I've not tired of this CD and I don't suspect I will.Almost a whisper voice, like he's telling me secrets...Fabulous!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent music handicapped by horrendous sound quality","review":"Hard to enjoy the music when the sound quality is so so bad. Very limited dynamic range and bandwidth and poor resolution of details, even for a home 4-track recording. Has been compared to Nick Drake but even his recordings from 40 years ago allow the emotion to come through unlike this one that is limited by poor production."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dreamy passion","review":"If you don't fall in love with Sam Beam's whistful voice in the first 5 minutes of listening to this CD, I don't want to know you. This album just sets you up high on a big white puffy cloud and lets you float through a sunny october counrtyside. With the leaves turning and the insects singing. Southern Anthem and Lions Maine will have you humming the tunes' in your head for days. As a previous reviewer asked, \\"where did this come from?\\" I answer \\"WHO CARES\\" just be thankful that its here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five Stars for Sentimental Reasons","review":"Put this record on when you're with a girl or boy that you like.

There's nothing of complaint in this recording, it's completely excellent. (Carmen McRae is of course one of the greats, for those uninformed.) The American songbook is large and Carmen sang a large part of it. It's advisable to choose albums with a minimum of overlap. I don't think this album can be overlooked if one wants these particular tracks. It certainly is a five star album."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE this CD","review":"I'm a programmer for a living, and working long hours in a Cubicle Farm means A) Little privacy and B) Even less quiet and peace to concentrate on work. I LOVE this CD. It is relaxing, inspiring, and easy to listen to. I find myself putting it on \\"repeat all\\" for most of the day. I HIGHLY recommend this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Awesome Collection For Fans!!!","review":"That's Right, if you're not a fan, this may not be the best way to introduce yourself to the music of Shakespear's Sister. This is more of a sum up of the \\"Everything Else\\" from Shakespear's Sister, whether you swing more for Marcella Detroit or for Siobhan Fahey, the remixes are a satisfying alternate from some of their best 12\\" singles.The B-sides, including the rare \\"Pretty Boy\\", the forgettable \\"Remember My Name,\\" and fun \\"Mr. Wrong\\" are b-sides for a reason, but have sentimental value to us fans, particularly those who bought the Run Silent 7\\" or 12\\" when it first came out in the late 80s. The only B-side which I always thought was almost as superior as some of the singles, \\"Suddenly\\", is also represented here.One thing missing is the supurbe alternate and more glamorized version of \\"Do I Scare You,\\" This is a trip down memory lane for fans of one of the best duos of the 90s."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Buy These Kinds Of Set For These Outrageous Prices","review":"You can buy these movies, All in one set , Much CHEAPER than the $60.00 that is shown here.

Many of the individuals in the book were people he knew from childhood, grade school, the play grounds...I had the opportunity to ask many questions about people like Blue, Fat Curt, Gary, etc. These people became real to me and I was pulling for all of them to make it - to escape - to survive. My fiance left Baltimore for another life - but realizing that he grew up amidst the turmoil and temptation of The Corner - has given me a greater respect for him. He escaped - God help all of those who weren't so fortunate.

There are simple illustrations in the book and Zachary Kent, the author mentions all of the main Confederate and Union officers who participated in the battle.

This album is an overview of her biggest hits, not a greatest hits. This album is for her fans, as a thank you to us.

Although, some of the tracks you could get on other Deathrow compilations such as their Greatest Hits or 15 years on Deathrow. It does have some very rare tracks. More than a few of these tracks are better than the original ones released on actual albums. Some highlights include: \\"Regulate\\" (Jammin' Remix), \\"Dre Day\\" (Extended Club Mix) and \\"I ain't mad at cha\\" (Radio version).Now if you are a big fan of westcoast gangsta rap and love the days of old Snoop Doggy Dogg then you'll love this old school gangsta rap when rap was still good. If you want a collection of Deathrow songs then you may want to buy the Greatest Hits album or the 15 years on Deathrow instead.

Excellent heavy rockin stuff from the legend shock rock creepy king."},{"rating":"2","title":"He's Back","review":"In my opinion every major studio release from Constrictor onward has been highly entertaining. Alice maintains this consistency with Dragontown. Last years Brutal Planet was definitely one of the best of his long career. Dragontown comes very close to Brutal Planet and is a little more musically diverse. As always Alice paints images of horror perfectly throughout the record. The imagery is even darker than Brutal Planet! Every track is a solid creation and performance.

Well the first book was great and the Key of Knowledge is just as hard to put down. I have never read so many books that I just did not want to end.

Not as pure as natural celtic music---but just as interesting.

Whoever remastered these tracks really knew what they were doing. With great players like Lester Young, Harry \\"Sweets\\" Edison, Herschel Evans, Freddie Green, and Jo Jones, along with Basie himself, it's impossible not to make great music. Tracks like \\"Jumpin' At The Woodside\\", \\"Topsy\\", \\"Shorty George\\", and \\"One O'Clock Jump\\" are so infectious that if you're not feeling them you might want to check and make sure you have a pulse.

He's one of those writers by whom I must read a book every two or three years -- but this one I did not like at all. Despite the usual brilliant prose, much of it as good as anything Conrad has done, \\"Tether\\" is a let-down -- astoundingly depressing! Most Conrad work posits a world that is inimical and uncaring, yet holds out hope that courage and integrity will serve to help us endure it all; \\"Tether\\" holds out no such hope. It concerns a captain who continues to pilot his ship even though he is legally blind, doing so in order to provide for his family. Nothing turns out okay, and no one ends up happy. I don't ask for a lot of hope from the books I read -- but at least a little!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A book about a hero but not for hero-worshippers.","review":"I'm disappointed that some readers felt the author was too critical of Washington.

Hero-worshippers should stick to books about chopping down cherry trees and throwing dollars across the Potomac."},{"rating":"2","title":"Washington from a distance","review":"I liked the very readable style the book is written in. It doesn't get bogged down on minute details but gives the readers an overall picture of Washington, with a heavy focus on his political life.I don't know if this is a result of the records or of the author, since this is my first biography on Washington, but I didn't get a good feel for who Washington was as a person. The book details his actions, but it doesn't let us into his motives and his passions."},{"rating":"2","title":"His Excellency: George Washington","review":"I have enjoyed this audio version of the book. I have read or listened to several books from this time period. The information continous to enhance my understanding of George Washington and the time of the revolutionary war. I would recommend this book to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Huge Disappointment.","review":"Ellis is a great author, and he did a good job of giving us a nice overview of Washington's life and accomplishments. Unfortunately, Ellis made it his mission to \\"dispel the myths\\" surrounding Washington and prove he is a mere mortal after all. I have no problem accepting the fact that Washington was human, but I was disturbed by Ellis' attack on his character. Every noble accomplishment that Ellis chronicled was followed by a negative attack on Washington. I think it unfair to say that Washington was more interested in own reputation than the good of the nation.Washington's life speaks volumes for the kind of man he was, and the belief he had in a great United States of America. It will take a lot more than a misguided author to change that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to forget Ellis' past mis-history","review":"George Washington is my favorite historical character, and I've read a number of GW biographies. When I heard that Ellis had written a GW biography, I hoped that my interest in Washington--and the anticipation that I would find out something new about him--might help me to overcome my memory of Ellis' deliberate \\"mis-history\\" as a teacher at Mt. Holyoke (Google \\"Joseph Ellis Holyoke\\" if you don't know or remember the details). Unfortunately, I was disappointed to find little new...or interesting, for that matter. There are a number of good Washington biographies available, and I think this book will probably be a disappointment to most who buy it thinking that it adds to what's out there already."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I was very disappointed with the disrespect shown toward George Washington. If you remove the negative comments made by Ellis about Washington, the book would be shortened by one half. Throughout the book he makes accusations about Washington's motives. According to Ellis, almost every decision that Washington made was based on some sort of arrogance, pride or self-esteem issue. And all of this coming from a man who lied about his own past and was severely reprimanded by his employer. Washington was beloved in his own time and now. I certainly understand that people have their flaws...and Washington was no exception. In the final analysis, this was a slander of Washington's character - I would definitely not recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great introduction to the most important Founding Father","review":"There are 330 other reviews on here that describe every possible aspect of this book, so I'll just describe how it applies to me.I read this book immediately after Founding Brothers, and it was the perfect next step. There's a reason another biography of Washington touts him as \\"Indispensable\\" in its title, and Ellis defines why that was the case with his usual clear and eminently readable prose. We get a concise yet descriptive story of Washington's entire life, from his beginnings as a soldier in Virginia to a national icon in the mold of Cincinnatus.Wonderful start for those looking to begin wading through all the recent Revolutionary War era biographies!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprised!","review":"When a friend told me about the book I was really interested in buying the book.Glad to see that Amazon had it and decided to take chance when it was notated \\"Used\\".When I got the book, it was in perfect condition!

As such, I was not looking for a conclusive treatise on Washington's life, but rather a fun, easy to read overview. (I figure I will have to settle for some dry, boring biographies when I get to the less written about presidents.) This book fit the bill."},{"rating":"1","title":"the de-mythed myth","review":"While it's totally hip to de-mythify things our parents (silly things) thought were good, Ellis's de-mythification of Washington is not satisfying. His basic thesis is that Washington was a nincompoop who happened to be in the right place at the right time his whole life. That's unlikely, and it doesn't explain why Washington was a legend in his own time as well as our own, unlike most \\"mythical\\" legends, whose myths grow in time.Five stars for doing what everyone else does.Two stars for insight."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting read","review":"Interesting read.

Now that I am two chapters into it I will put it down and not waste anymore time on this revisionist history.Joseph Ellis has been proven a liar and was put on leave from Mt. Holyoke for dishonesty. Look it up. It's not surprising that a dishonest man like Ellis would seek to tear down the image of a man who had so much to do with shaping the ideals and values of the founding of country.I would recommend the Flexner volume over this or The Real George Washington.

Washington is basically portrayed as a self centered arrogant man that is only concerned about his career and bent on making sure that posterity views himself correctly. Throwing rocks at a dead man (particulary the father of our country) is not the type of commentary I enjoy.

Ellis sublty insinutaes that Washington risked his life, reputation and fortune, and endured unspeakable hardships for the sake of his generation and all to follow (not only in America, but whereever freedom is coveted) all because he was angry at the British for picking his pocket. I am surprised other reviewers on this site don't at least mention it, let alone wail over it. Obviously, Ellis has never suffered, or risked much, because there ain't no way George Washinton was motivated by nothing more than his bank statement. I did give the book two stars because this book is not a piece of trash. Ellis is no fool. I have to give him credit as an author and scholar. Too bad he sees valor as a cover for pecuniary gain. He IS entitled to his opinion, no matter how wrong it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but too much speculation about motives without evidence","review":"Ellis is a good historian, but he has an annoying tendency to speculate on motives even when he admits there is no evidential basis for it, as part of what he apparently takes to be a charming conversational style. Three and a half stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"His Excellency: George Washington","review":"I'm enjoying this book right now. I just wish you/Amazon would print how many pages in your advertisement of all books. If a history is only a couple of hundred pages long there might be more historical information in a 1000 page history. Not necessarily better but, with more info."},{"rating":"2","title":"An great account of a great man.","review":"I found this biography of George Washington to be very good. It included information on the early years of Washington's career, and was very readable. It was interesting to learn about Wahington's background and his obsession with how he would be remembered in history. If you are looking for great details into Washington's life and career, this book may not satisfy your needs. However, for a concise account of his life before and after the war and his presidecnies I thought this book captured things very well. I would recommend it to all those with a casual and serious historical interest in Washington."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well done but too short","review":"What an excellent bio of our first Prez. Although it is very difficult to get at the heart of what Washington was thinking and feeling, since his most personal correspondence was completely destroyed, Ellis brings his impressive abilities from \\"Founding Brothers\\" to bear and the result is a very good read. If you've read recent bios of Franklin, Adams, and Hamilton over the past couple years or so, you will get a different perspective that will inform and entertain.One complaint is that this book is just too short. I realize that Ellis was probably trying to keep it under 300pp so that it could appeal to a wider appeal than Chernow's Hamilton bio or McCullough's Adams bio does, I found myself wanting more, not just at the end, but all the way through. That's the ONLY reason I give it 4 starts instead of 5.Fabulous read, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irreverent portrait","review":"Joseph Ellis writes and interesting, yet irreverent, portrait of our first president. If you are looking for an immature view of a man, this is your book. The facts presented are accurate. The words used are what you would expect from a college freshman who could care less about the subject, George Washington. Knowledgeable and accurate, yes. But the author is very juvenile in his presentation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The author seems to be trying to discredit Washington but at every attempt he fails miserably,don't waste your time with this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and to the point","review":"A great biography of Washington. I thoroughly enjoined Ellis' summary and analysis. It was refreshingly concise, but not too concise. It was also very revealing, and I learned a lot about Washington."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reality between conviction and culture","review":"I throughly enjoyed this book about Washington. Ellis has great detail and his narrative is wonderful. But the thing that most stood out was how the author focused in on Washington's dilemma related to his slaves. Washington had many slaves but he also had a desire to see freed.The catch was that he couldn't . . . You'll have to read the book to find out why. This author takes that challenge and how Washington deals with it and really helps us see a part of this famous founding father that we may not ever have seen before."},{"rating":"1","title":"The narration ruined the entire experience","review":"My daily commute is +/-3 hours, so I listen to many audio books. I love biographies and I was looking forward to this one after hearing \\"1776,\\" but I could not stand to listen to this book.The pace is painfully slow. The 13 CDs easily could have been condensed to 10 by a reader with a better pace. The narrator takes audible breaths at about two hours into the CDs, his stomach starts gurgling. (I thought there was something wrong with my car.)I'll have to get the book to comment on its content, because I couldn't get past the terrible narration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful vanity","review":"The vendor was extremely responsive regarding the status of my order and date of delivery. It was very well packed, and when I assembled it, there were no scratches, cracks, etc. The finish is frail, so therefore, do not let the side mirror panels hit the center panel, the finish will chip off. It is a beautiful piece of furniture for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous Book!","review":"This is a great mountain biking tour guide of one of the world's most beautiful places, if even you aren't going there you will love the book. I love his rating system for the rides and descriptions of the hardness of the rides e.g., \\"this is a trail for people who think body piercing is fun.\\" But be aware that Moab is a place that has a different rating scale for hardness and beauty than other places. If the book describes something as extremely scenic its more likely to be mind boggling, and intermediate difficulty is often intermediate for professionals, the layout of this book is great. Highly recommended. He has a website that nice to check out too, just do a google search."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost in moab","review":"First, directions to trail head very confusing. Then got lost on trail following directions in book leading to 10 additional miles. We finally called the bike shop who put us on the right trail. The trail was not named in the book. The trail named in the book is not \\"an actual trail. This is what it is referred to by the locals\\" according to the bike shop. No signs for the trail that was named in the book. Also, it was a road and no where in the trail description did it say it was a road. All guide books tell if it's a road vs Single track. This one is going in the trash. I don't trust it. I do agree with the other review. It is cute and witty. Cute and witty did not help us today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"I bought Tommy Greers three cd's, becoming one, here on cloud nine and angels kiss.

I am a Soldier with 2 tours in Iraq and I think this story is amazing. The actual Documentary itself was very well made and the whole thing is a tear fest. It is insane what these guys went through and I think every American should watch this film, these Marines of Lima CO are an inspiration for me. I am a Combat medic (the equivalent of a Corpsman) in the Army and for those of you that want to see the average experiences of the infantry in Iraq, this isn't average, this is the worst case scenerio.Another film that is worth watching and I think shows the average experience of life in Iraq is Occupation: Dreamland, which follows the 82nd. Another one is Gunner Palace and it does reflect how a lot of support personnel are living in Iraq, yet the troops in it are an embarrassment to the Army. An amazing documentary that covers WW2 is The War by Ken Burns, nothing compares to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Memories of Comrads in Arms","review":"Not at all like advertised. No real combat footage or drama. Feelgood stories of young marines who fought and lost close friends, came home and, with loved ones, talk about it. There is far more action documented on youtube. Simply not what I purchased it for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended","review":"I am not an American, and I don't support the war in Iraq. But I was deeply moved and impressed by the young Marines, their Officers and NCO's who appeared in this documentary. They are the kind of guys you'd like to split a beer with.The Yanks may have a tosser as their President, but you can only feel respect and affection for the guys doing their duty on his behalf.This is an intelligently made documentary. You will be moved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sound logic for the developing world and evolving Christian","review":"The Nonviolent Alternative presents an exhaustive compilation of Merton's dissertations about the role of the Christian, the church, and the citizen in the function of peacekeeping. The book specifically targets the topics of nuclear warfare, the Cold War, and the arms race.The reader will likely find the book at least slightly redundant of itself. The book contains constant references to catholic ideology -a fact which many non Catholics will likely find grating. However, the book challenges the logical processes of the reader and forces him or her into contemplations that the reader has unlikely grappled with before. The book presents a profound introduction to Merton as well as his rhetoric."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Price, But.....","review":"The boot has a great heel and sole, and the price is good for a work boot.

I purchased it believing I was getting a paperback copy of \\"The Professional Chef\\". I waited over three months before finally getting my copy. What a disappointment.

If you travel a lot in US, this could be ideal for you. It has sufficiently detailed maps to make you familiarize with the new place. And the price it comes for is simply a bonus.

The children learn to count using underwater sea creatures. I have a 3.5 & a 2 year old and they love this video. The video teaches counting from 0 to 20, division (sharing), and helps the children relate the written number with the amount.At first viewing, my youngest quickly became frustrated because there was not enough time for him to count each animal. This was easily corrected by hitting the pause button; afterwards, he enjoyed it and both children sing the songs even when not watching the video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to par with other leapfrog videos","review":"My 2 year old loves leapfrog..Numbers Ahoy really wasn't as upbeat as the restand doesn't get his attention as much as the rest.The 3 best ones you really should get and I HIGHLY recommend.Let's Go To School - Letter Factory - Talking Word Factory."},{"rating":"2","title":"L F Numbers","review":"my granddaughter just enjoys all the leap frog cds, everyday i get to watch them all over and over. so I will have to answer the same on all the CD I got thank you so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"LeapFrog","review":"My daughter doesn't like it too much so we don't use at all.

However, I tested him today, and he still insists on counting, \\"One, two, three, six, nine.\\" No improvement over his counting before we bought the video. The story is \\"fun\\" for kids, but there is no repetition of the basics, so that children will actually learn anything. Also, the video has some insipid rock-music at the beginning, which is certainly not going to inspire children toward higher learning....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy something else","review":"Ms. Flinders, despite her academic position, seems to hold traditional Christianity, and especially Catholicism, in contempt. Her prejudices show clearly (wondering why Mechthild of Magdeburg hasn't been beatified, much less canonized - read that crazy stuff!), putting her own spin on meanings of the mystics' writings. Perhaps, though, some of her readers will be inspired to investigate traditional Christianity, as opposed to Feminist Theology."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enduring Grace: Living Portraits...","review":"Enduring Grace: Living Portraits of Seven Women MysticsThis is an old title, but a goodie! The author of this book,Carol Flinders, writes just enough about each of the mystics to keep the reader interested. If you have ever read any of the autobiographies of the mystics you will understand what I mean. Flinders relates the stories of these seven mystics in a way which the reader of today can understand. Some of the feminist issues of the 12th through the 16th centuries are still hanging around today. The mystics are portrayed as deeply religious,empathetic feminists. They fought against an unfair system with grace and were successful enough to be remembered today. I lent this book to a friend. She liked it so much that she bought her own copy. You need to get this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reviewing Kindle Sample: no stars/did not buy book","review":"Sample ended at intro. I need to assess quality of writing in book itself before purchase. Fix it and sales may improve"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a book does justice to women mystics","review":"This book provides inspiring insights into two subjects which are rarely given fair analysis: (1) women saints and (2) the mystical experience. By definition the mystical experience is difficult to explain or analyze in words, but the author's approach and beautiful references help make the experiences of these saints come to life -- and these saints are not the life-denying, intellectual complex, emotionally stunted type, but the divinely inspired type. I would not call the author's perspective feminist but one free of conventional masculine/church biases. I will reread this book often."},{"rating":"2","title":"I keep thinking about what I've read in this book","review":"I will start by saying that, although I was raised a Christian, I am not one now. So I approached this book with some caution. However, it is well written and makes the medieval world that these women dealt with very vivid. It also makes what they did and wrote very accessible. I have found a lot to think about in this book and it made me want to learn more about some of the things discussed. That said, it is not a book to sit down and read all at one go. I read it a bit at a time, taking it on trips with me and keeping it in the kitchen between times. It was well worth the thought I had to put into the reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the bunch","review":"Of the US releases for Shonen Knife, I believe this is the best of the bunch. The CD goes through a few change-ups in tempo and is consistantly entertaining. My personal favorites on the album are Tower of the Sun, Explosion and Wonder Wine. But there really is not a lemon anywhere to be found.The bonus part of the album is really neat in the fact that a number of Japanese versions of the songs are included. Which I find just as listenable as the English versions. This I think tells much about the quality of music a band produces."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best","review":"shonen knife specializes in ramones/beatles-inspired pop-punk, so the most surprising thing about this disc is that many of the songs are at mid-tempo and reveal a depth that we haven't seen before. don't worry, there are still awesome songs about food, but the slower numbers have a beauty that i think shows artistic growth. how does one describe his love for \\"the perfect world,\\" which covers rumor-mongering, boredom and military action in a three minute melody? this is one of my favorite shonen knife albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliance","review":"What can I say, this album is AMAZING!Everything about this album blows me away. The unique cacophony of sounds seems like chaos, but with deep listening order can be found in it. It progresses throughout the whole CD making it hard to tell where the songs change. This is definitely a 5 / 5 and rivals my favorites such as Autechre / Boards of Canada / Jega for the top spot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soundscapes that weirdness is made of","review":"This is an awesome CD. Richard devine has done something special in aleamapper. The soundscapes are carefully consructed down to the finest details, and all sounds are impeccibly produced. All the elements are there - sub-sonic infrasound bass, odd noises hitting from all directions, and strange phased and morphed voice samples. In fact, many of the sounds morph into and from one another. This is a very technical album indeed. You'll love it, if you can handle it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"new RA cd","review":"If you like the Atlantic\\\\WARNER BROSS period of Rahsaan you will enjoyed these live songs never available before on Cd.

Sometimes the songs cut off mid-way. Of all the Rahsaan albums I have, I never listen to this one, and wasn't surprised that it was no longer available. There are so many good original Rahsaan disks out there, as well as good anthologies, this one just adds nothing to what you already know.

The helmet is ok, except that the adhesive pads inside came off the first wearing (and the adhesive got in her hair - what a mess!). The knee and elbow pads are too stiff to stay on her knees and elbows. And they are just a plastic bubble. The first time she fell, the plastic shattered on one of them and made it worthless and dangerous for further use.The big sell point was that it was pink and had the Princesses on it. Why can't Disney make quality products? They sure charge enough!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This item is junk","review":"Of course the real draw for this item is that it has the disney princesses on it. Let face it, you could put disney princesses on a piece of garbage and people will buy it. My daughter loved this when we gave it to her, but almost immediately the stickers popped off, the seams on the edge of the helmet were coming loose, and the strap that goes under the chin is cumbersome at best. I cannot say she has even worn the knee and elbow pads, as they are stiff and uncomfortable. Makes you wonder if anyone who makes this stuff actually tries it to see if it's any good. Do I feel ripped off? Yep. I do have to say that the best part of this whole set was the bicycle bell. It's cute and actually works.

The knee & elbow pads are useless because they don't bend at all and are pretty dinky. The bell is nice and easy to use, but the plastic that the screw screws into is pretty soft and the screw won't tighten very well but we got it tight enough to stay for the most part but it keeps slipping down. The helmet is ok, but when I pulled it out of the box one of the plastic pieces that was glued/stickered to the foam popped off and I had to stick it back on - though I haven't had problems with it since she's only had it for 2 days and I have a feeling I will.

As I've stated before, this guy is an incredible artist and a super nice guy as well. He owns his catologue of music so he has creative freedom. This probably also accounts for the fact that he is not marketed as well and thus extremely underappreciated. You need to buy all of his CDs so start with any one of them...I recommend starting in order with Run This Way Forever. You can't go wrong. But for pete's sake PLEASE do not buy these titles used for forty bucks from some scammer. Contact the artist directly and order from him (just google his name).

I would purhcase this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Important assembly information - to save you frustration","review":"First off, the two main pieces of the body are molded by some machine which leaves little pieces of hard plastic rattling inside both bodies. If you dont mind the bike rattling like its broken then this is not a problem; otherwise you need to shake the pieces out of each of the parts of the body, kind of like getting a pick out of a guitar. I took off the flag cover part to do this. It was a long and tedious process.Secondly, the instructions have a list of required parts: 2 of these, 3 of these, etc. You'll notice they list THREE of these red plastic caps that you hammer on the end of the dowel holding the wheels on. You will look around and notice there are only TWO in the box, which might cause you to get upset, as the instructions list three. Guess what? You only need ONE which you will only realize by assembling the bike. If that doesnt frustrate the crap out of you on Christmas eve I dont know what will.Otherwise an ok big wheel copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Radio Flyer Big Flyer","review":"My grandson loves this and flys around my driveway for hours. I love the flag that comes above any car window including SUV so we always know where he is by flag.

I would glue it, but then it wouldn't adjust when our younger grandson grows into it. Overall it has worked well.

Roughly 4years of age.My son was at 90th percentile in height at three years old. That makes him 39\\" tall. With the backrest on the lowest setting or closest to petals, his feet barely touches the petals with his legs fully extended and can't pedal bike. If he were to pedal the bike straight he will need an additional 3 inches in LEG length not 3 inches in overall height. Also when you turn the bike the pedal on the outside of turn moves even further away so he now needs an additional 3 to 6 inches of leg length to reach pedal. I estimate my son needs a minimum of 6 inches in leg length to reach pedals or 10 to 12 inches in overall height."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too BIG!","review":"Got this today for my 3 year old son. There is no way this is made for a child of 3, even though the box says it is for kids age 3-7. My son won't be able to ride this for at least a year.Super cool toy, and it seems sturdy enough, but honestly, by the time my kid is big enough to ride the darned thing, he will be riding a bicycle, not a toddler's trike.Massive disappointment for my son who picked it out, and for my husband who wanted his kid to have a big wheel \\"like Daddy used to have\\". Yeah, except Daddy wasn't riding it around when he was 15, which seems to be the age this monstrosity is built for.Now it just sits creepily in our house with nobody to ride it reminding me of The Shining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what they say it is!!!","review":"Got this for my 5 year old.

I just had to get it for him since I remembered just how much I loved mine when I was a child - yet mine was not nearly this cool! He tried riding it through the house (which didn't work out great) but after Christmas we did have a couple of mild days that were in the 50's, so I bundled him up and took him and the Big Flyer out for a ride. He LOVED IT! He realized he could go MUCH faster on it than he could his tricycle and it was just way more, well, cooler! I had the same concerns buying it, wondering if the front wheel would catch much traction on hard surfaces or gravel - but he had NO problems on the sidewalk in front of our house or in the gravel drive. Now, he just needs to learn how to turn it... which I'm sure he'll get down pat when the weather allows him to ride more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Radio Flyer Review","review":"Purchased 4 Radio Flyers for my 4 grandsons, 5,5,4 and 2.

It has two more. He'll be able to use this for a couple years. I'm a big fan of the quality of toys produced by Radio Flyer - and this is no exception.

He races around and spins out by quickly turning the handles- this is heart stopping the first time a parent watches. This down side is that he gets bruises on his back every time he rides it. I was very alarmed the first couple times I saw the bruising until I figured out what was causing them (not the nanny!). At 39\\" tall he can barely reach the pedals at the shortest seat setting. I think he is leveraging off the top of the backrest to get momentum and causing the bruising. I wouldn't not recommend this for kids until they get taller and can leverage with their legs better."},{"rating":"1","title":"pedal problem","review":"We bought this for my daughter's 9th birthday.

Shortly after the 1 year mark, the back tires just split down the middle and fell apart. I called Radio Flyer, who told me that it was out of warranty and there is nothing they could do...I could pay for another wheel if I wanted to. WHAT? I paid almost twice as much (compared to an original Big Wheel) for a product that I thought was made by a company known for durable products, and I barely get one year out of it? The Big Wheel that we had previously lasted longer than this. I suggest spending less money and buying a Big Wheel. At least when you have to replace it, you won't be paying as much.

The seat is also very uncomfortable for my son (when it stays on) and it hurts his back, so I have to drape a small blanket over it just for him to be able to ride.

Brand new out of the box and the stickers are already peeling off . The inside of the toy had plastic bits shaking around. To assembly the toy you need four wrench's (two sizes- one to hold one end and one to tighten, both on different size bolts), a phillips screwdriver and a hammer...so you need 6 tools to assemble a toy...I use less tools to change the oil in my car. Above all else is the total disappointment you feel when you realize something you had as a kid which brings back so many fond memories has started using it's name to sell crap manufactured in Asia.

I tried taping some cardboard to the pedals to raise the height, but even with that it's too far away! It seems Radio Flyer is trying to widen their customer base by lowering the age for this toy. If your child is below 4 years old, it will be a useless toy for them.

So my son pedals, but he won't get anywhere. We tried it on concrete, asphalt and grass. Unless you are going downhill, it did not budge.

I guess the main complaint is about the headlight having poor lighting abilities...with the standard bulb...All in all the total comes to around $30 with the 3W LED bulb but you get a really bright headlight with 4 AA batteries which means it'll last longer or about the same like the 2 AA Planet Bike ones that use 1/2 W bulbs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Schwinn light won't fit on a Schwinn bike","review":"I have a Schwinn bike and assumed the Schwinn light would fit, but I was wrong.I emailed customer service at Schwinn and they didn't apologize for it.I ended up getting a Cateye light which was so much easier to install and didn't require any tools.Do not bother with this Schwinn light. It is big, bulky, won't fit on a Schwinn bike and harder than it needs to be to install."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"There is no wires or switch in side just sping steel.

The headlight started out working fine but then after about 4 uses I noticed it started going dim. Eventually after about 7 uses the light wouldn't even come on even after replacing the batteries. My ride from home to work is only 5-10 minutes and the light shouldn't have given out this quickly. My advice to you, spend the extra few dollars and get a better quality product. I give this product two stars only because the backlight is still working fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bright enough for night time use.","review":"It looks and feel cheap plastic.

This product must be disassembled to install the batteries. I am mechanically inclined and everything looks correct but it takes fidgeting with. For an hour. To put batteries in and make it work. Do not buy Schwinn products."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap","review":"I bought this set and after one use the headlight stopped working. it also was such a narrow beam of light that all i could see is the light on the road. not the road. not worth the little I paid for it. the tail light worked fine"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another terrible product from Schwinn","review":"Schwinn might make good bicycles, but they offer poor quality accessories. This light set is yet another example. While installing the headlight, one of the hinges broke, so now there is a loose fit. Another flaw is that the light isn't very bright. I know that xenon bulbs are not the same as LEDs, but this is still exceptionally. The rear light is okay, but I have a rear bike rack that is attached to the seat post. If I attach the rear light to the seat post AND an carrying something on the rack, then the light is not visible. I wish that Schwinn had designed a more versatile set that could be attached to different parts of a bike. Simply adding screw holes would have easily solved this problem. Needless to say, I returned this to the store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blown Bulb = Blown Money","review":"I normally take 1 star review with a grain of salt. The front light is extra large, but I can deal with that. I bought 2 of these sets. The back lights are working ok, for now, but my wife and I used them for 2.5 rides. Her light blew on the second ride and mine on the next. I checked the batteries, solder points, etc. I jiggled the light and you could hear the blown bulb. Not worth replacing, maybe worth trying to return (although I glued a team mascot to the top of mine [the only thing the enormous size is good for]) definitely not worth purchasing... Trusted name in bikes just got a little shadier."},{"rating":"2","title":"works really well","review":"works as advertised easy set up be aware that you have to cut a big hole in your floor.would have been a 5 star if the shifter boot wasnt cheap, shifter works great boot is good but the ring is garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Refuses to recognize Israel as a Country!","review":"This book is either Anti-Israeli or is still following the Arab boycott of Israel. This book makes almost no mention of the country of Israel except in the fine print where the information is essential such as arrival information at Ben Gurion Airport in the back of the book. None of the maps mention Israel although Epypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia are labeled. I could never trust such a biased book. Admittedly the book is very well illustrated like all the Knopf travel books. I found Frommer's \\"Israel 2nd Edition\\" to be more informative, trustworthy, objective and helpful. It is the Frommer's book that I am purchasing from Amazon and taking on my upcoming trip to Israel. The Knopf book I am returning to the library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Resource","review":"I bought this book for a class. The author was the actually professor for the course.

If you use Rick Steves or Lonely Planet, this is a good counterpoint. I wouldn't use just this guide for lodging or restaurants because the listings aren't extensive enough and the book isn't updated annually but the book has inspirational descriptions of the varied pleasures of Provence. The book does not cover the Cte d'Azur; another Cadogan guide by the same authors does. If I had to use just one book while traveling in Provence I would certainly consider this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Steer clear of this unreliable guide.","review":"Don't be fooled by the witty writing; the writers are either ill-informed or malicious. 2 of 3 hotels they recommended were downright seedy. The Miramar at La Ciotat (three stars, \\"a classy, updated old hotel amid pine groves, by the beach\\") turned out to be a nicotine-saturated, dimly lit dive that charged our credit card before we arrived (we didn't stay). Pine groves? The hotel sits shadeless on an ugly stretch of tarmac. The \\"pine groves\\" were a few trees in the parking lot behind the hotel. There are many good guides to Provence; choose another."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mind Candy","review":"Caught this movie the other night on one of the movie channels, I pretty much fell in love with Kathy Long. The movie is interesting, little bits and pieces of a whole lot of other stuff as mentioned in the above reviews, but her character is very much like \\"The Man with No Name\\" Clint Eastwood features, with martial arts thrown in. Supporting cast is adequate to strong (I particularly liked Ginger Lynn, it's the first movie I've ever seen her in with her clothes on) and the biker gang was convincingly evil, reminiscent of the \\"Wild Angels\\". The landscape reminded me a bit of Mad Max. No big surprises here, Kathy dispatches the bad guys with relatively grusome ease, and looks great while doing it. I wish the ending would have been a little more definite on her identity, but you can't have everything. Worth watching, definitely not a chick flick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product, Value for Money!","review":"I bought this product couple of weeks back, and it's beautiful.

Little did I know that Sony had put a 5-disk tray into a DVD player with the reading ability of a single disk player, and then jacked up the price.In addition, I have to unplug the model to reset it once a week or so. If I don't, it starts chirping like a cricket during playback.If you're looking for a good 5-disk changer, DON'T go with this model!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I liked history...","review":"I can appreciate the history, truth, and exploration Graves provides, but the book as a novel wasn't something I was interested in. I'd rather read a list of interesting facts about a river than have someone take me on a boring canoe trip down it verbally. I like meat not needless fluff. I am very glad the Graves preserved this for us and hope those who do enjoy a nice mental cruise will indulge in it. However, if you're looking for a moving book this is not it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique look at a specific area and history of the Lone Star State","review":"I was very impressed with this book. Graves does so much in this enjoyable volume. As he takes a canoe trip down the Brazos near where he grew up, he shares the history of the land--both recent and not-so-recent. Through him, we learn the reality of life for the average settler on the edge of the frontier. He also seems to be detailing a life that in his time was declining and in our age is nearly completely gone. His writing is difficult to describe and unlike anything I have ever read. It flows smoothly with a combination of regional speech and erudition. As you read you feel like you are in the canoe with an incomparable guide to this region of our state. A great book that deserves to be read much more widely than it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Graves tells us about ourselves while telling us about Texas","review":"A great story that incorporates history, the outdoors, and philosophy. With the rugged country of the upper Brazos river as his backdrop, Graves takes you on an enjoyable journey that you hope will never end. You hear tales of the \\"Old West\\" and modern Texas as well. Graves' thoughts as he travels alone on the Brazos are classic for their insight and humor. I highly reccomend this book to all Texans, or anyone who wants to feel like a Texan for a while. I'm buying another Graves book soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"The importance of this book is undescribable.","review":"For those of you who love the Brazos river this is a must have book. The book informs the reader on the importance of the Brazos river for the Spanish , the American indian, the ranchers and for the many people today who love to paddle it waters to feel the spirit it possess."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a wonderful book!","review":"This is one of the most beautifully written books I've ever read. It is funny, provocative, and sad. It is very hard for any Texan to see the end of an era, the end of a river. I've read it many times and will read it again and again. I will make sure that my grandchildren read it too, just as soon as their vocabulary and reading skills can handle it. What a sad commentary on our continuing destruction of our natural resources!"},{"rating":"2","title":"John Graves Goodbye to a River","review":"An excellent Texas Writer.

This book explores the changes affecting China and the Chinese people as a whole. Cleverly written, it describes the period that encompassed the change in political structure of China from a communist country to a market-economy country.

And the pairing with Goodman sealed the deal. Then I listened to all the tracks and checked out the personnel: Krupa, Miller, Venuti, Red Nichols, Beiderbeck, among others. Great jazz at a great moment in jazz history (1929-34) played by the greats. On top of all this, the quality of the audio is stupendous: a lot of loving care went into preserving the sound of the 78 rpm test pressings and shellacs. Many thanks to the producers and technical mavens who preserved this musical history. But it's more than history. It's toe-tapping, foot-stomping jazz. Listen and enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Devotional","review":"This is a great devotional that, not only helps in increasing biblical understanding, but is a good day-to-day read which increases understanding on how we should live as christians.

It is a bit delicate and should be used with care. If it is forced open or closed the plastic tips that hold the two side shields in place will break and shields will fall off. I have used three different flip up on my camera. I spoke to a Hoodman representative about this design problem and they actually replaced one broken flip up for free. Use with care."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Design-breaks easily","review":"This cover only attaches at the top (it replaces the viewfinder cover). and can get snagged very easily on the bottom where it is NOT connected to the camera, such as when you put the camera in your bag. Mine is broke, so now the viewfinder piece and the rest of the body are separated. And the two side doors that spring out to hold up the hood when looking at rear LCD are flimsy. One of the side pieces broke at the base after only a few uses (and I'm not rough on my camera equipment). Hoodman needs to provide method to attach to the bottom, even if its some sort of adhesive. I suppose it would be nice if camera makers added some feature to allow for installion of this type of thing, but if they did, it would be proprietary they would charge 3x the price of Hoodman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extreme Ways","review":"A very dark and interesting song.

I couldn't even locate this item (in this color) in my local hardware or electric stores. The only problem I had was that the price for the item itself was so high at Amazon.com. Where the other sites had the item for a price of $1-$2, Amazon's price was nearly $5 just for the wallplate. The only reason I went w/ Amazon was that the combined cost of the wallplate and S&H was less than those of the other sites (they wanted $10-$12 just for the S&H).

Due Mondi is the only piece in it that is good and it can be found in other collections of his work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost as good as Pure","review":"Personally, I just about live on these. I generally have a couple in the morning before class, either of these or Warp Green Lemon Lime \\"mints\\", depending how much caffeine I think I need (the Warp ones are a little less caffeinated).A hint to the uninitiated: one of the nice things about mints, etc. is that is you can keep them under your tongue: \\"sublingual infusion\\" is the term for this (absorbing the caffeine through the blood vessels on the bottom of your tongue), and I find it not only works better, but comes on slower (not a sudden jolt to your system, e.g. less jitters), and lasts longer. Your mileage may vary :)Bottom line: get these mints. If you want to buy a smaller quantity, thinkgeek sells them individually."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lead Me To The Replay Button","review":"Gary Brooker's 1982 solo album is by far his best work away from Procol Harum. Song after song, there is no filler here. Brooker wrote all of the compositions, and proves he is a valid lyricist; he steps confidently out of Keith Reid's shadow and shows he was not simply a melody maker. Great session work by the likes of Phil Collins, Eric Clapton, Albert Lee, George Harrison, and Mel Collins to name a few. I'd have liked to see a track by track list of musicians, but neither the vinyl or CD release has this information. This is an incredibly hard CD to find -- I actually had to order mine from a local dealer as an import disc from Germany back in 1991. That particular disc was issued by LINE RECORDS in 1987, if anyone wants to hunt it down. If you can't find it online, search the used record/CD shops in your area. You won't be let down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gary Brooker \\"Never Lead Me To Water\\"","review":"This is another one of those releases I purchased only because of an ex-Beatle playing on it rather than for the release itself. George Harrison playing on 2 of the tracks (The Cycle and Mineral Man) is the reason I purchased this. Gary Brooker is a great musician and is a member (vocalist and key board player) of a great English band, Procol Harum (Whiter Shade Of Pale). Gary Brooker also toured with Ringo Starr in 2001. Gary also played the keyboards on George's LP's All things Must Pass, Sonewhere In England and Gone Troppo. This was difficult CD to find until a recent 2011 re-release on Esoteric Recordings. Needless to say, if you enjoy Procol Harum you should like this release as it sounds very much like a Procal Harum record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"Sort of a prelude to Prodigal Stranger, this album deals with family values (Home Loving), Helping friends in personal trouble (Hang On Rose), and other personal issues. Mineral Man is about being a tough macho man, Low Flying Birds is about issues with \\"easy\\" women. A beautiful and sensitive album. Who cares about the celebrity guest musicians? Not me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Modern fiction from a nearly forgotten author","review":"Jean Rhys does an amazing job telling interesting stories with believable characters. Her works should be required reading in any modern literature course. I am shocked that I made it to grad school before hearing about her.

It's so short that you can easily listen to it 10, 15 times in one sitting. And you'll like it. Do yourself a favor and buy this rocktubular album this very instant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a horrible introductory CD...","review":"However, only 1 track is worthy of consideration from music fans wanting something other than banal howls: 'Little Razor Blade'. With that said, LRB is a phenemonal song.To be more then a footnote in music history as \\"yet another 1 hit wonder\\", Pink Spiders need to up their game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful music wonderfully reproduced","review":"Well I guess there's a wide range of tastes when it comes to remastered 78-era recordings. I have thousands of recordings from this era and if I had to pick one of the best remastering jobs it would be this set (incidentally, if I had to pick one of the worst it would be the Sony/Columbia \\"Okeh recordings\\" set praised by another reviewer!). The set was remastered by Stephen Lasker, one of the best in the business in my opinion. Surface hiss is audible, but that's the price to pay for having music that retains its full range and dynamics. Most of the recordings I have heard that have had this hiss removed sound flat and sometimes even muffled (again, the Sony/Columbia \\"Okeh recordings\\" set sounds particularly lifeless). However, I'm willing to concede that this is a matter of taste. As for the music, it is truly wonderful - some of the best of Duke Ellington's early work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Expensive!","review":"Just a little tip for the less affluent: you can get 10 of the better tracks from this collection, plus another half hour's worth of some good latter day Duke, on \\"Duke Ellington's Finest Hour\\" for 12 bucks.Yes, these are wonderful recordings of the early growth of big band jazz, very good time music in the Fletcher Henderson vein. And add my vote for the Decca remastering school of thought: don't kill the music just to get out the noise. But I just really don't care to listen to so many alternate takes back to back. I ended up burning my own set with all the alternates sequestered to the 3rd CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, terrible results","review":"This is hands down the worst digital transfer I've ever heard of this material! It's got an astonishing amount of high-end distortion that has absolutely nothing to do with the 78s themselves, and will be torture for any dogs in your neighborhood. I've heard very low-grade copies of these 78s that sound better than this CD. The first few songs are pretty much unbearable even if you turn the treble all the way down. As the program goes on the poor transfer is still in evidence, but it's not quite as horrifying.If you have the slightest interest in this material, try the single-disc comps on Phonodor or Jazz Archives instead. They're not as extensive, of course, but the music's clear and clean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible crackle and surface noise!","review":"This CD set is particularly disappointing. The music contained on these CD's is essential Ellington, however, the the surface noice (crackle, hiss, pops) is so horrible that this set is unlistenable.Hopefully this important music will be re-mastered and properly re-issued without all the noise. I simply cannot listen to it this way. For now, opt for the OKeh set, which is contains an equally important collection of Ellingtonia, and is nicely transferred to CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"very powerful story for women.","review":"All women, Black or White should view this film.

One or two of the plastic pieces broke by the 2nd use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy unless you want to burn your house down!!!","review":"When the battery pack got so hot that it started to melt, I returned the toy for a replacement. I got the replacement and put in 3 new name-brand batteries and the same thing happened again just second time we used it. My son noticed that the battery pack was getting hot, so I opened it up and nearly burnt my hand on the batteries. The batteries were bubbling and the plastic outer covering was melted. Keep in mind this is a brand new item after I returned the first one for the same problem. DO NOT BUY!

I had to help her at the beginning to see how to put the parts together. But now she's got the hang of it and can follow the directions, finding the right pieces and putting them together. We discovered that the blue gears have a round or a square hole in the middle and the square holed ones are the ones to put on the motor. This toy is great for learning how gears work and how to follow directions. The finished results are great for showing off to friends during playdates."},{"rating":"2","title":"wacky wigglers","review":"I gave this to my 6 year old Grandson for Christmas and he absolutely loves it.

It is not a toy that they are finished with in five minutes and set aside."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work","review":"We ordered this for Christmas, but the motor did not work. The toy without the motor is useless. Companies need to have better quality control."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool concept","review":"We bought this toy for our 4 year old son for his birthday. He wanted a \\"robot\\" -- so we thought this might fit the bill. He struggles with putting it together with all the pieces that are included, but is quite capable at building a basic structure. We've found that the more elaborate structures doesn't always work as designed, and invaribly it falls apart quite easily. BUT, I foresee our son growing with this toy-- learning how to use more and more pieces, and creating more complicated designs. Overall, it's pretty neat and fun to play with."},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have listened to reviews","review":"This toy is great in concept, but the actual toy needs some definate readjusting. It is somewhat difficult to get the pieces pushed on all the way, but even if you do get it all put together it still may not move. We still have not adjusted the gears correctly so that ours will actually move; perhaps, it doesn't. The other BIG problem is that if you do get it together, it is not easy to get apart again. Therefore, I do not see a child wanting to take it apart much and create many creations (The whole point and learning value behind it).My child has completely tossed it aside, even though he was thrilled in the beginning to receive it. He loves to build, but this toy is too difficult and frustrating - even for me. I started to pull it apart and after getting several pieces off my fingers were sore. I too put it away. Oh well, I will chalk this one up as me getting so excited about a concept that I didn't listen to reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating!","review":"This toy has real potential to be fun and educational. My 7 year old son was excited to open it for Christmas; however, it is super frustrating. We followed the directions exactly and the gears keep jamming and so the creations won't work properly. It's no fun to spend time building something that won't work and just leaves your child frustrated and upset. I wouldn't recommend this set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price","review":"I bought this as a gift for a family member. She didn't it find it to work at all.

It vibrates so strongly, even on the lowest setting, that it was painful. I'm no sissy but I couldn't stand it for more than a minute.

Totally overpriced and worthless to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pieces breaking off after about a year of light use.","review":"I loved this until the plastic pieces started breaking off. The plastic screw caps on the top broke off after about a year of light use (2-3x a week for 15 mins). When the screw caps broke off, the whole plate lifted and vibrated noisily and exposed the electronics underneath. It seemed too dangerous to use after that and had to be discarded. Needless to say I am disappointed with the quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book","review":"Watch for Jeff Skinner's rising star. One of the best poets writing today, his work gets better with every book. Gender Studies is tender, intelligent, beautifully crafted, and moving. Skinner knows that what connects us, human to human, is not just ideas but also emotions. His poems give us both---fresh, interesting, exciting poems that a reader can return to again and again. I can't wait for his next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A hilarious satire and all-around fun read","review":"It will be a sad day when this novel goes out of print.

The writing is clever and inventive, a pleasure to read from the very first page."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the best book I have ever read!","review":"After 20 years in academia, BOOK exloded the political nuances of my experience into raucous humor. I laughed til I couldn't laugh any more and I have given away multiple copies, including one to a University president."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review: a review","review":"Presents on the surface as a murder mystery/thriller, but that is so not the point. The point is the most wonderful satire of literary theory since ThePooh Perplex, and of academic politics since, well, forever. Grudin has great fun playing around with language, couching different chapters in different voices (first, second, third), genres (narrative, nonfiction, drama, Q & A, etc.), marginal notes and footnotes (the footnotes attempt a takeover in Chapter 9, but are brutally suppressed--the marginalia tried to give warning!). I was going to ding Grudin a point for giving the novel Sovrana Sostrata a PR classification instead of a PS, but I take it back for the all-too-plausible postal abbrev for his fictional state of Washagon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reality Shock","review":"Sometimes I will find that I live my life expecting everyone elses to be comparable to mine. Love Medicine proves that the way I live my life is not the only way to live, even in the U.S.. The book deals with the a community of Native Americans and their culture, and hardships dealing with the American government and each other. They live the life they have been handed living on reservations and doing what they can. They seem to find the reservation, or should I say the people on it, as family even though many of the characters are not blood, and that is where they draw their strength pulling back from the world around them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book to Learn About Native Americans","review":"Love Medicine by Louise Erdrich is part of a tetraology. These four books focus on four different charaters. This particular book focuses on a character named June who is absent throughout the book. \\"Homing In\\" is a huge theme that a lot of Native American authors write about and it is evident throught this book. Love Medicine also shows the struggles of anger, desire, and the healing power of two families. Love Medicine is an excellent way to find out how Native Americans live on the reservation."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Love\\" Placebo Curses Very Little","review":"Love Medicine is the kind of book you read very slowly and very often to comprehend. It was one of the most confusing books I have read. It never really caught my interest. There were too many characters to deal with that water downed the story to the point where I did not really care about any of them. Maybe if I pick up the book again, I'd appreciate it more. In the meantime, two stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Medicine: Journal #8","review":"Louise Erdrich makes a poignant point in her novel, Love Medicine. Each of the disjointed vignettes serves to further separate the family into individuals connected only by nature. Allthough this may be disheartening to us, it rings true with a majority of families. However bitter her message be, it is delivered in a prose reminisent of poetry. A delight to read, your heart will twist right along with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"American Literature at its best","review":"This was a novel that I entered into unsure of whether it could transcend what I assumed was its genre, and it turned out to be one of the most profound explorations of American culture I've ever been exposed to. A truly complete exhibition of the similarities in all of us that go way beyond the passage of time or the perceived differences of culture and community."},{"rating":"2","title":"An unbelievably good read","review":"I first came upon this author at the thrift store, and read The Last Report on the Miracles at Little No Horse book through without stopping, I loved it that much. I now have every one of Erdrich's other books, and have loved them all. The people here who rate this one or two stars have NOT read this carefully or thoughfully, or maybe shouldn't be reading anything more difficult than a Danielle Steele novel. These are so lyrical and full of heart and meaning, so deep. I am in heaven reading these, all of them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great novel that transcends time and space.","review":"This is a brilliantly written story by an equally brilliant writer. Her novel, which is in fact a multitude of stories, spans generations, cultures, and boundaries. It is an epic tale of love, loss, and the constant opportunity that we may succeed and be made stronger by life's mysteries. It will touch any reader, regardless of race, age, and gender. It is, in fact, a book for everyone--a book about everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally confusing!!!","review":"This is required reading for class and I am so confused.

I found myself skipping over entire chapter (it was required reading for school). How complicated and uninteresting can these peoples lives possiblely be. Sorry, but i do not care the entircate details of their pathetic boring lives. I'd rather walk on glass than read the second half of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tender stories, Beautiful prose","review":"In the beginning, I had to discipline myself to read this book because the subject and the landscape was so foreign to my own experience. But soon after, I was swept by the drama, the characters and the beautiful writing of this novel. The author masterfully and imaginatively transports the reader to the scenes so that you feel that you are there. As there are multiple characters in this multi-generational story, the reader sees the same stories and incidents, but interpreted from different points of view. It is especially a great eye-opener for anyone interested in the Native American community."},{"rating":"1","title":"interesting but pointless in many ways","review":"I thought that this book was confusing. There were too many characters and too much going on. I found it to be interesting at some parts but VERY hard to follow. When I was done I did not come away feeling clear about what Erdrich was really trying to accomplish here."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Love Medicine\\"","review":"While this novel engrosses you in the life of a somewhat disfunctional indian family, I never really got into the novel. The one positive side is the characters are fairly deep and their are quite a couple intelligent revalations about family. Besides that, the book is a snooze. The stories the author tells are way to drawn out. I never got into the novel, I always felt like I was just reading it. The author never really got me into the indian atmosphere either. The relationships in the book are also not very interesting. If you are looking for a book with family and interesting characters, read The Joy Luck Club, it's better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very confusing, too many flashbacks, etc.","review":"I absolutely hated this book. There were too many flashbacks. I had to read it for school, and I hated it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out of the Dust","review":"This book is a very good book. I've honestly never seen a book so descriptive. It's unique because they wrote it in poetry form, but it didn't rhyme. But it was still correct! I never saw anything like it. I never thought you could do that.I have to say this is one of my favorite books. Not only does it tell you a story about a girl in the depression and the dust bowl, it also kind of teaches you about what people went through in the depression and the dust bowl. I'd never even heard of this book before I read it.I must warn you, if you're interested in reading this book, it's a possibility you may cry. I didn't, but it was really sad.I've already said so much, so I hope you go to the library or a book store soon because it is a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vivid Imagery and Figurative Language","review":"Historical ficition, poetic free verse and figurative language are all in this beautifully written story about a girl in Oklahoma during the dust bowl. It is told from the point of view of a 14 year old girl who experiences joy, tragedy, tenderness and pain yet she perseveres. Rich in imagery you can see, taste , feel and hear the dust storms as they approach and touch the lives of farmers. After teaching a unit on poetry, our 6th grade students loved this book , identified with the character and recognized and appreciated the poets craft."},{"rating":"2","title":"A quick, interesting read","review":"This was an easy book to read.

Its unique free-verse poem style allows the book to show feelings that words cannot explain. Each poem is written with hidden feelings. This book was brilliantly written by Karen Hesse about a girl's trial of life during the dust bowl. It was a tough trial in which she loses her mother, her brother, and her love, the piano. She has to fight through this devastating trial, and try to move on with her father.This is the most brilliant work of writing you can find about the tough times of the dust bowl. It tells the truth of life out in Oklahoma during the dust bowl, dust and death. It was hard to find something to live for in Oklahoma in the 1940's, but this girl finds a way to make it through the dust bowl. This book is a mix of hope, death, guilt, and truth. This book was written with great compassion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Into The Dust And Out! Dust Busters!","review":"The book I reviewed is by Karen Hesse. This Book is about a little girl who owns a farm, but still very poor. This is a very sad story and I reviewed this book because I felt the way she did while reading this book,this made me want to read it. This girl had a normal life,but then her mother dies and her little baby brother dies too! This makes the whole family not even like a whole family. Jo's(the little girl's name)most favorite thing to do while she is depressed or sad is to play the paino, but she can't because of her wounded hand. There is a BIG dust storm and I mean real BIG!, this makes her dad's farming worse and there would be no food growing out of the fields. Now everything is ruined their crops and family.

One is when a girl named Billie Jo threw a bucket of kerosene at her mother. The story includes some predictable events.

This book is filled with wonderful poetry and interesting stories about the little girl, Billie Jo. I liked the book overall, but I did not like the poetry form the story was in. It isn't that I don't like books, its just that I don't like poetry. I recommend this book to someone who likes poetry and Historical Fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out of the dust preview","review":"I really liked this book \\"Out of the Dust\\" because it got me closer to history. On what I mean by that is not everyday people want to know what happend back then. Most people don't want to learn at all. What made me want to read this without a teacher telling me what to read when to read. This book gives feelings and a piece of history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I thought this book was really interesting because, it showed me what life was like in the Dust Bowl. I couldn't imagine how my family and I would ever surivive back then. Many people would say,\\" That would never happen to me!\\" They think that just because it happened to Billy Jo's family that it can't happen to them. After Billy Jo's Maa died she talked alot about her in her writing. She said that when she came home from her piano she would think about her Ma saying, \\"I knew you could do it\\". I thought this book was a great book. Billy Jo described many good points throughtout the book. I gave this book four stars because I thougth it was really good and that my little brother would enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out Of The Dust","review":"This novel describes the conditions of the dust storms and droughts centered in Texas, Kansas, Oklahoma, New Mexico and Colorado during the Great Depression. Billie Jo, a young fourteen year old girl and her family are struggle to make ends meet. As the book carries on, Billie Jo feels though she is guilty for the death of her mother and the burns on her hands. Wondering what life would be like without the dust Billie Jo heads west to start a new life. I loved this novel as for it was displayed as a diary written as poems. I would recomend this book to anyone willing to discover the problems and struggles of families during the dust storm."},{"rating":"2","title":"out of the dust","review":"I thought that the book Out of the Dust was a very good book. I learned alot about the dust bowl and how Bille Jo and her family went through alot of pain and suffering with all of the problems. Some of their problems were having no food for a while, their mother was in the middle of having a baby and the babay died a short while after the mother in birth. There was a sickness called dust pneumonia and that was a very bad sickness that could lead to death of just get very ill, and sick. I rate this book a four because I learned alot about this time in the 1920's and I know understand how they all felt.

I am surprised that so many people said that it was depressing and \\"compelling\\". I had to read this for school, and that was the only reason I finished at all. This book uses the same classic milksop storyline as do many. \\"Oh Daddy, we're going to lose the farm. But I still love you.\\" I do give the author credit for her innovative way of writing the book, but at the same time it also made it worse. The way it was written lacked details in the more important things, like the whole scene where she runs away.

This book I would recomme if you like book like that."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have to disagree","review":"I really liked this book because it has alot of feelings that I can relate to. Shock and denial, acceptance, anger, etc.Billie Jo has her hard times but she handles it with help and on her own.Sadly I have to disagree with people who turn this book down. Yeah, sure, it has some depressing things but they all relate to real life. (Maybe not the kerosene thing but people DO get burned.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Out of the Dust is one of the most memorable books that I have read in a long time. Karen Hesse, the author, captured the despair and tragedy of the time period in a remarkable way. The story takes place during the mid 1930's in the heart of the Dust Bowl and is told in poem form through the eyes of a young girl named Billie Jo. She tells us that her name was the result of her father's desire to have a son. Billie Jo's life unfolds in a series of poetic journal entries that disclose the events she is forced to endure. Some events are good; however, most are tragic and life changing for our young narrator. The events force us to feel the pain of this likable young girl as if we were personally experencing them with her. I highly recommend this book to all who enjoy reading books that evoke powerful emotions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out of the Dust Review","review":"\\"On Sunday, winds came, bringing a red dust like prairie fire, hot peppery, searing the inside of my nose, the whites of my eyes. Roaring dust, Turning the day from sunlight to midnight.\\" (Hesse, 46) Billie Jo, a thirteen-year-old girl, had to face this horror day after day. Out of the Dust is a compelling tale of Billie Jo's hardship of living in the Dust Bowl and Great Depression. Every time a dust storm hits, her family is in danger of losing their farm. After the stove fire crisis, which leaves her mother and Billie Jo terribly burned, eventually kills her mother as well as her newborn baby brother. When the tragedy strikes, Billie Jo's love grows stronger for her father, and for the piano. This is a very interesting and compelling story of this young girls courage, and I enjoyed it very much. I recommend this novel to eight years olds or older. I think once you have read this book, you will be captured by the courage and strife that comes with the dust storms.

It tells a story of a girl named Billie-Joe who's living in the dust bowl. The story is told through diary entries. The fact that it is written in diary entries makes it easy to relate to her and understand what she's thinking. You could tell how heart broken she was when her mother and baby brother died. In the begining, Billie-Joe just wants to be out of the dust. But in the end, she realizes that the dust is a part of her now, and she can't just leave her father because he was her family and she couldn't just walk out on him. It had a very poetic ending, but it could have been stronger and had a greater impact on the readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Out of the Dust by Karen Hesse was a very well written book. It kept me wondering throughout the entire story of Bilee jo's life and her family. I enjoyed reading her story in free verse. The author wrote in clear and understandable language. Karen Hesse also put thought and feelings into her work. There are so many emotions you will feel in this book. To me the sadest part of the book was when bilee jos mom died because she was burnt so badly and people think its Bilee Jo's fault. Another emotional part of the book was when the dust storms occured. Bilee Jo explained that many people that she knew in her town died or or got pneumonia. Although there are parts of the book that are sad the ending suprised me the most. It shocked me that Billee Jo's dad found someone new that he will spend the rest of his life with.

So if you like well-written books but are extremely sad and depressing then this is the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"My review on Out of the Dust","review":"I am rating this book a nine. The reason for my rating is because I love to read books that make you feel like you are present in the story. This book made me feel very sad about the way the dust destroyed peoples lives, and what they had. I think this book was very well written by Karen Hesse. I love how Billie Joe, the 14 year old girl who took place in The Dust Bowl,speaked freely about how she felt and the way she explained the way some damages looked that were around her. I would recommend this book to children that are twelve and up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out Of The Dust","review":"I gave the book 4 stars because there is allot of detail about how the storm was and the different kinds of storms there were. And about the names that they came up with to name the storms.What I also liked about the type of book is that it described Billie JO's life. I can go along with what she had to put up with by living there like the bad storms. Because of the different kinds of storms that I've been in and the decisions I had to make like leaving that state that sec or not. But I was in a different state where there where storms like what they went through but not as badland the story made me think of what I would do if I was in that situation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out of the Dust Review","review":"I think the book Out of the Dust was a well written book by Karen Hesse. It explained to me what the dust storm was actually like and how people had to live and suffer through all of it. On a 1-10 rating scale, I would give this book a 9. I would rate it a 9 because even though there was a lot of action, there were some bad parts to it. Like the part where Karen Hesse said that her mother \\"erupted\\" into flames.I think that word is a little dramatic. I think the part where Billie Jo tried to put out the flames with her hands was very brave. Even though her hands were severly burned and because of that her life had been changed forever. I really think this book was good and it gave me a better understanding of the Dust Bowl."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out of the Dust","review":"As we walk together, side by side, in the swell of dust, I am forgiving him, step by step, for the pail of kerosene. As we walk together, side by side, in the sole-deep dust, I am forgiving myself for all the rest. That stanza is my favorite poem of the book. It shows how the torn relationship of Billie Jo and her father is slowly healing. And how her relationship with \\"herself\\" is healing also. Over all I think Out of the Dust is an outstanding book. The poems are excellent at times. However, Sometimes the poems interfere with the flow of the book. That is why I only gave Out of the Dust 4 out of 5 stars. The book is chiefly the story of two years during the Dust Bowl, shown through the eyes of Billie Jo, a young girl. It offers much insight on what it must it have been like to live through that terrible time. It is deeply depressing, but at times light hearted and almost fun. I liked this book because it makes it easy to picture such a horrific time period in your head."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Out of the Dust is about a 14 year old girl who lives with her ma and pa. Her name is Billie Jo. She lives in the Panhandle of Oklahoma. Her ma gets pregnet. There was an accident. She has the baby, and it was a boy. A few hours later her ma died. Before Billie Jos ma died they named the baby Franklin. The baby died later on that night, so they buried baby Franklin with Billie Jos ma together. Billie Jos father went out drinking with the emergency money. Aftr that night, he decised to go to night school. The only reason he wants to go to night school is for the women. I gave this book 5 stars, because it teaches people about the Dust Bowl. I learned about the dust storms that happenedin the Panhandle. That should be enough. Go out and get the book and read about the dust storms yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was the best I have ever read!!!!!!","review":"I liked this book a lot.

The night sky kept flashing, lightning danced down on its spindly legs\\" (Hesse, 39) I like the poem \\" Fields of Flashing Light\\" because it is very descriptive and uses a good metaphor. Out of the Dust by Karen Hesse, is a compelling, long narrative poem,gruesome which depicts the Dust Bowl in 1934. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to feel depressed and realize what he or she is thankful for. The poetry in the book was exceptional. I enjoyed the book a great deal. Some of the events were a little depressing though. The mother gets burned in a fire and suffers for a few weeks and then finally dies .The father and Billy Jo aren't too close. Billie Jo runs away in search of something, but doesn't find what she is looking for so she returns home. Overall this novel was mediocre. Some of the poems were a little graphic but it was still entertaining"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hooked on this Book","review":"This book is wonderful!

The reason I dislike this book has nothing to do with it being \\"very sad\\" as some other reviewers have commented. Instead I dislike the book because the story is lacking and I do not think the author does a good job of creating empathy towards the characters. Usually when a reading a \\"sad\\" book I have sympathy towards the characters. In this book there was none. Also I felt the character development was lacking. I don't reccomend this book if you are looking for a good story I do reccomend it though if you are interested in learning about free verse or seeing how the author shaped the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"None","review":"I really don't understand why people like this book. There is not very much plot, and as much as the great fans will hate me for saying this, the book isn't well written. Poems, okay. I get why people think the book is special, but it's not good.What's the point of the book? What is the solid underlining point? Is there any? Or is this just a book of letters, painted on in a completely random pattern?I give this book two stars because some of the poems would have been okay had they actually been that, poems. There is nothing outstanding about this book, save the fact that it is written in poems. There are several other books out there like that. I don't think a book that is special deserves to have the label, good. There is a difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Out of the Dust by Karen Hesse was about a family with two parents and two kids who lived in a town that had dust storms all the time. There was a tragic fire in the home and the pregnant mother died while giving birth. Billie Joe, the daughter, witnessed this tragedy. My favorite poem is \\"Not Too Much To Ask\\" because this family has very little of anything and they (the mom) are still willing to give to others in need. I think this book should be read by the age group of 13 year olds and older. This group would have the ability to understand what is happening and appreciate it. One literary technique that is used in this story is imagery. The descriptions of the area make the reader feel as if it is a personal experience. The reader feels the dust in their mouths.

There are a few big word and it sort of confusing. But it is a really god book for 10 and up.There is a lot of imagery in this book. One example of imagery is when she wake up and says there is a dust outline of her head.

Just about everyone in my class liked this book, and their ages range from 18 years old to 60+.I liked all of the poems. This story would have been excellent if it wasn't in poetic prose, but the style Hess used enabled the story to be told in fewer words that had more meaning.Another reason I liked the poetic prose is because there was a definite rhythm! It made me feel that Billy Jo was telling us her story through piano playing. Some of her songs were happy, and some were sad.LUCKILY, this is one story that Disney will never try to make a movie out of.I recommend this book for older children up through adult."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book!! Karen Hesse does a wonderful job of pulling the reader into the 1930's.

But it was worse for Billie Jo and her dad after accidentaly throughing a pail of Kerosene at her ma. After her ma dieing from the burn and giving birth to Billie's brother Frankin who soon died later. The book described in detail the conditions, feelings, thoughts, and events taht took place during her life. This book is a free verse which means that Billi Jo wrote the book the way she did and about her own life and not by someone else. The author wrote the book in good detail and gave information off about the Dust Bowl and how the people survived throught that and the Depression. This book was great and i enjoyed reading it. The only bad part about it was the end of the book. It didn't give enough detail on what happened but it still told what happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of the Dust Critique","review":"I didn't like anything about this book. The book wasn't exciting at all. Almost the whole book was dull. I think it would have been more exciting to me if the dust storms would've been in Phoenix and not in Oklahoma during 1953. Although I didn't think it was very good, Out of the Dust taught me how hard it was to live in the time of the Dust Bowl. I gave this book two stars, because it was dull and boring.

There were times we could hardly control the tears and sadness for this realistic character. Excellect period piece (5th grade history project). We loved it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok book","review":"I think that the novel Out of the Dust was an ok book. It is made of a series of poems writen by the main character Billy Jo. The author of this book is Karen Hesse. It takes place in Oklahoma during the Dust Bowl. This novel is only 227 pages long and the peom set up makes it a very quick read. It was realy hard to distinguish between the rising action, climax, and falling action of this book though. So really you feel like something is going to happen but it never does. All the main character talks about is how dusty it is and how she wants to leave. The dust and wind is so bad that they can't grow the wheat they need to survive. The only real events that happen in the book are that the mother gets burned by Billy Jo and later dies giving birth to a baby that just dies, and Billy Jo finally runs away from her Father and the dust at the end but she just comes back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Out of the Dust is a book about a girl named Billy Joe.

This review is about how I rate the book from 1 to 5. I rate this book one because it is a really boring book and it is all poems. The poems are all quite boring. The main person in the book is called Billie Jo. She lives in the dust bowl during the Great Depression and wants to get out of the dust bowl. Her mom dies and she lives with her dad. They both miss her very much. Billie Jo finally figures out that she wants to still to live in the dust bowl. What im trying to say is the book is REALLY BORING."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Billy Joe lives in Oklahoma.She accidentally burnt her mother by acccidentally throwing kerosine on her apron.Her mom was making breakfast before she caught on fire. I would rate this book A onebecause it was very very boring! the whole book was a poem.A boring poem in that case.so, listen to me and don't BUY THIS BOOK!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I have read this book and I am leaning to one feeling about the book. I give this book a one. It deserves a one because it the same thing over and over again. You know waht is going to happen next. Dust storm after dust storm came and it bored me dearly. I feel that the author went on about the same thing and made a mountain out of a molehill about dust storms and stuff like that. The one thing I did like about it was some of the poems were good and interesting. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone, but if you wanted to try it I would say it's for teens and young adults. This book wasn't one of the best i have ever read in the past."},{"rating":"1","title":"the not so good review","review":"i didn't like the book because the book was just a long poem.

The poetry format lends itself to pointed description and reader involvement.Voice of the narrator is very clear and poignant. It is the first Karen Hesse book I have read, but will read more of her offerings."},{"rating":"2","title":"bite the dust","review":"Out of the dust was a very good fiction book. Even though it was fiction it told the true story behind the oklahoma dust ball. This book is AWESOME!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I liked this book. The way the author wrote this book was great. I enjoyed reading it like a poem. If was very educational. I learned alot about the Dust Bowl. I gave it 4 stars because it was very good. It was interesting becasue you learned how to live durning the Dust Bowl. I didn't like it when the author stated that there was \\"Dust in the food\\". There was dust in all the food and in the drink. They turned over the plates so that the dust wouldn't get on the plates. Overall, I enjoyed the book very much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out Of The Dust?","review":"This book is very well writen and easy to read for a younger audince too. I liked how the book is in a poem form so the pages arnt that long. This book describes the dust storm very well from a person prospective even though this was a fictonial character. The author did alot of research on this book to be soo descriptive. I gave it the four stars because it got a little boring. So in conclusin i would recomend this book to alot of people because it is very interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out of the Dust Book Review","review":"My favorite poem, in Out of the Dust, is \\"Met\\" because in this poem the daughter, Billie Jo, returns home after running away. This is when they learn how to be happy and start to become a family againsince the death of her mother.I think this book is appropriate for people in 4th grade and higher because I tried reading it in 3rd grade and couldn't understand many of the concepts and the vocabulary.I liked how in the poem, \\"The Dream\\", the placement of words on the page is set in a unique way. This is done because unlike the other poems it is happy and set in a dream.Overall, I like this book because it was interesting to learn about what it might have been like to live during the Great Depression."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overall, a pretty good book","review":"My favorite poem in Out of the Dust is \\"Out of the Dust.\\" It starts off with her telling about how she knows that she is going to die if she stays. She decides to go and hitch a ride on a train. She goes west to get out of the dust. I like it because the book is named after it.I think that the book is appropriate for anyone who can read. People who like non-fiction books, or realistic fiction books would enjoy it. I think that older people might like it because they might be able to relate to it.The free-verse form in the book is an essential piece. It lets the author express what she wants to in a poem form. You don't see many books written this way, so that makes it unique. It also makes it easier to read, I think.Overall, I think that I would rate this book two stars. It is good, but personally I didn't like that much. It has lots of historic background, which I think is good to have in a book. If you give this book a chance, you might like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thriller","review":"This story of love, tragedy, and fear, is a great book about the depression and the Dust Bowl. 14-year old Billie Jo narates the story from her point of veiw, giving good perspective from a young persons eyes. Papa is taking the Dust Bowl the hardest, and put a bucket of Kerosine by the cookstove. It starts on fire. Young Billie Jo doesn't know what to do, so throws it out of the house. Mama is coming back into the house, and she starts on fire. Little does the family know that Mama's baby is coming soon, and when she has the little child, Not only Mama dies, but so does Baby Fredrick. To find out how the family is doing, read this awesome book. I was supposed to read it for school, and thought is was going to be boring since it is like a diary. But from the moment I picked it up, I couldn't put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I have read!","review":"This book was great and I think its a book everyone should read. It's so realistic I would have thought that it was a true story. Although some of the parts are hard to fallow along, it was an amazing book for all ages. The ending makes you imagine something so that everyone can end it the way they want. I could even imagine some of the stuff in the story, as I read it! =)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Drewesies","review":"I thought the book was was good overall, I liked how it was free-verse style, so it wasn't too long. But I also thought it was a bit gross during some parts of the book, like when her mother gets burned, and her hands,about how they hurt, and what they look like, but it was still a good book overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Out of the dust was a wonderful book. I was moved by what the author had to say. I'm telling everyone to read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out of Oklahoma","review":"This book is pretty good. It is a very sad storie about this girl from Oklahoma. It's about 120 pages long but it goes buy fast. As soon as I started reading it I couldn't put it down. The suspence is a killer. It is a journal book. It has won the newberry Medal and it is a nominee for the 1999-2000. This book has some big words in it , so I would suggest readers from 10-14 years of age."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is really great I love it.","review":"The book Out of the Dust is great. It was about a girl named Billie Jo who faces alot of problems. Billie Jo is enerjetic and loves to play the piano and eat apples. In this story it tells the order some of the events happened in her life. Some events are tragic, some are happy, and some are unusual.Even though this story is written in free style poems it is easy to get the hang of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creative and emotional,Hesse scores big with Out Of the Dust","review":"Wow!!! I must say, I was completely BLOWN AWAY by Hesse's Newbery winning novel. It surely deserved the honor. At first glance, I thought the book would be boring and tiring to read, seeing as the whole story was written in free verse poetry. Was I EVER wrong!!! The unusual style made the book all the better. I found myself near crying throughout most of the book. The story was about Billie Jo, a girl right in the center of the Dust Bowl. Her awful misfortunes grip you and make this novel a can't-put-it-down kind of book. I was especially moved when...oh, wait, I can't tell you. You'll just have to read it for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exaggeratingly Sad book","review":"The book is written in nice,figurative language, but it is far too sad. The book starts out like not such a bad story, but then suddenly it hits this spot with terrible sadness and frustration. Yet, it gives far too many details of how terribly some of the people in the story die. Basically what happens in this story in the sad part is when 2 people accidentally make dangerous, careless mistakes, which lead to the killing of 2 other people. When I got to that part, I felt like not reading this book anymore. I can't believe this book received about ten awards."},{"rating":"2","title":"sarah's reveiw","review":"I thought this book was very good. It was written with alot of description. A few parts were confusing."},{"rating":"1","title":"hard to rate a product you don't recieve","review":"I realize this was years ago when I needed this book for a college course but I still have never received my book in the mail from this order."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Karen Heese Material","review":"I still can't believe Karen Heese wrote this. It's like a social studies book. I've tried to get through this book for I don't know how long but I still haven't finished it. I've read enough to know I don't like it and I would only recomend it to people who like the Laura Ingles Wilder books. It's very old fashioned and well, boring. The plot doesn't have a climax, a begging, or even really an end. It drags on way too long.If you wanna read a GOOD book by Karen Heese, then read \\"Music of the Dolphins\\". That is one of my absolute favorite books. That's why I can't believe she wrote \\"Out of the Dust\\". It is way different than Music of the Dolphins, and it didn't take place 100 years ago. Don't judge Music of the Dolphins from reading Out of the Dust, trust me. You wouldn't know they were by the same author if her name wasn't on the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully written, but incredibly sad","review":"This book ends on a hopeful note. The verse is stark, unadorned, and beautiful in its simplicity. As a piece of historic fiction, it encapsulates powerfully the loss and devastation of the great depression. The strength of the main character and the eventual healing of her family is a great story. Highly recommended, but you will cry reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Used for Poetry Unit","review":"This is a story written in prose poetry. For those of you who yawn at poetry, don't expect to do so with this book. It IS interesting, in fact it held the attention of my 6th graders during and reviewing a poetry unit. Understandable diction and creative, flowing structure. A good read for anyone who wants to flirt with the creative writer they've locked away in their inner cavern."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Like Dust","review":"This book is very bland. It is exactly what i expected to be, very dull and boring. Being that there is no climax, i don't find any point to the book. The only amazing thing about it is that, she can write a book in all poems and make it blend together like a real story. Although the story goes by fast, it seems like the days it takes place in are slow. I wouldn't recommend this book, if your looking for a fun thrilling story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out of the Dust is emotional!","review":"Out of the Dust was an excellent book because it was well written in a unique format. This is a book for teenagers because they can relate to the problems that Billie Jo was going through. Billie Jo faced tragedy but didn't let it overcome her. Since it took place in the dust bowl (1930s) she had more worries than she reckoned for. This review was written by two seventh graders in Tallahassee, Florida. If you read this book we hope you see why it is emotional."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful read!","review":"Out of the Dust is written extremely creativly, through poetry. It tells all about the adventures and tragedies of a twelve year-old girl, living in Oklahoma in the Dust bowl. It has short chapters and even if you do not like reading this book is still for you. It kept my attention and it will certianly keep yours!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a very suspenseful book!","review":"As Billie Jo is growing up there are many dust storms in Oklahoma.

I recommend it highly!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lynz's book review","review":"Out of the dust was a pretty boring book. It is about a girl named Billy Joe who overcomes a lot of obstacles like living in the Dust Bowl in the late 1920's. After a Freakish accident, left Billie Joe motherless, her baby brother dead, and not being able to play her beloved piano things went down hill.I would only recomend this book to a person who likes boring books that have no point. This book went on and on. It never went strait to the point. I don't like slow books and this book was very slow. It was quite sad and not very exciting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carly's book review","review":"I read Out of the Dust. Personally I didn't like it. I thought it was boring and was uneventful. I rated the book with two stars. I would not recommend this book to anyone. It was just about the girl and her life in a dust storm. It was written in poems and I thought it was very very boring. It was a girl who's mother died after the girl burned her accidentally. She also burns her hands and isn't able to play piano anymore. She decides to run away but then comes back. The book seemed to drag on and on and on. It was slow paced and it made me want to fall asleep. Everyone I talked to hated the book such as my friends and classmates. If anybody asked me a book they should not read I would say Out of the Dust. It was awful to have to read this book. I will never read this book again. I don't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what i thought","review":"this book was a boring book. the cover was even boring. it is all about a family that started with 3 people but ended up with 2 because billiejo's mother had a baby but died right after and the baby died too. ths book is sad and all but it keeps on repeating the same thing over and over again. i have never read a book that is all poems that tell a story that reapeats everything at least twice. there is not much to say about this book because it wasn't all that exciting. all i can say is that i wouldn't tell one of my friends about this boring book. But im not the one that is stoping you from reading this book because everyone has a different opinion about everything so you could maybe try it if you like and see what you think of it and maybe you can write a review of your own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out Of the dust","review":"Billy Jo a girl from Oklahoma describes her life living in the Dust Bowl.

This book really taught me a lot about loniness. It was very well written and the plot was very unusual. The plot was very dramatical and it painted a very vivid picture that I can imagine.

Be prepared to have your heart warmed by a young girl's story that you will never forget.Billie Jo was a memorable character. Her determination and kindness really stood out to me.

Billie Jo has a very strong character and I think that Karen Hesse did a very good job with that. Hesse also did a good job when she stirred in the facts about the Dust Bowl.

Although many of the events in the book are tragic, the book is overall uplifting. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't rate this book as high as many. I get tired of dust.","review":"Being forced to read a book which uses the word dust at least 200 times forces me to submit a review that is not as pleasant as the general population's. I did not enjoy the book a great deal. I think that the plot needs more substance than the dust that swallows Billie-Jo's town. I found the book depressing and unneccessary to be read at school. It is alright if you don't mind that sort of thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book really stinks!","review":"The theme of this book is death.

It is really depressing when everyone dies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book if you want to be depressed","review":"This book takes realistic fiction for children too far. Although it is well-written, it is very depressing. It gives the reader an interesting inside view of life in the dustbowl, and the narrator is a very interesting and likeable character, but her life goes from sad to tragic to VERY sad to EXTREMELY depressing to UNBEARABLY sad - and only near the very end is there a somewhat positive ending. The overall feeling that this book conveys is depression. More space should have been given to dealing with issues in a positive manner and, possibly,how to overcome obstacles - even if only small steps can be taken.Most kids can think of depressing situations - very few know how to resolve conflicts and overcome life's setbacks. This is the type of book that adults choose to show their kids \\"so you think you have it bad...\\" and some are caught up in the novelty of the easily readable poetic form, but I don't think many children will enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a very good book.","review":"I liked the way Karen Hesse writes.I thought it was good because it was sad and I learned how people lived back then."},{"rating":"2","title":"Barbara's Review","review":"The book is good.

Billie Jo's mom gets burned bad and Billie's hands are not in any condition to play the piano. The towns people are blaming Billie Jo for her mothers condition when it's not intierly her fault. The baby is on its way. Her mother dies givind birth. By the time the Aunt gets there to take the baby away to raise it as her own the baby is dead too. What will happen to Billie Jo and her father?The type of person who would like this book is a girl, Who has read any of the American Diary books. I don't think a boy would be very interested in it. The book is about a young girl and I don't think a boys are ver interested in that kind of book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book It One of the worst books you'll ever read","review":"This book is sooooo boring.

I would always leave class bored and depressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"The big dust","review":"(By:T.B.) I did not like the book at all. I hated how Billie Jo was scarred for life. Her mom died with the baby it name was franklin because her father was looking forward for his wife to have a boy but she had girl. Her father burned Billie Jo and her mother. Nonething grow in the field not the wheat or the apple. The boy Billie Jo likes is gone his name is mad dog. Her best friend gone somewere. This book I would recomme if you like book like that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I disliked Out of the Dust partily because it was in freeverse and because it would never stop.

This book made no sense and u wouldnt like it unless u like boring and dull books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out Of The Dust","review":"In my opinion, Out Of The Dust was a great book. The perspective it gave on the Dust Bowl really made you think about what it must have been like. The main character, Billie Jo, was really interesting and not dried up and boring. Whenever she succecded, you celebrated with her. Whenever she went through pain, you felt for her. I really liked the way the book was written - in poems. Since it was written like this, I think it allowed the book to be more personal. What I didn't like about this book was the fact that Billie Jo often used confusing metaphors. She often compared her life to the dust, or the future to thr rain. That just gets confusing. I would reccomend this book for people 10 and up. It might be a little confusing for people under that age. That is why I would give Out Of the Dust a 4 out of 5. It is a really good book and worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Out of the Dust, a heartfelt tale that vividly describes the tragic life of living in the Dust Bowl during the Great Depression.

One thing i didn't like was whenfamilies were forced to leave their homes that they had spent their life savings. and sometimes it went beyond money, they put blood sweat and tears into their crops, homes and famlies. I recommend anyone who likes to read to read this."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Really Enjoyed This Book!","review":"Out of The Dust is the story of a 14-year-old Bille Joe and all the hardships she face while living on the Oklahoma panhandle during the Great Depression . The most horrible of all the hardships is when her mother dies in an accident which she feels she is partially to blame. I love the way Karen Hesse writes this book in free verse poem. I felt it gave me a better prespective of Bille Joe. I also felt it had much more emotion then it would have had if it had been written as a regular novel. This book reminded me not to take everything I have for granted an to be thankful for what I have. I thought this was an excellent book, however I would only recommend this to people 10 and up because it is extremly depressing. If you enjoyed reading this book I would recommend reading Letters from Rifka or The Music of the Dolphins, also by Karen Hesse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out of This World~!","review":"This book is by Karen Hesse. This is a loving family in the middle of a dust storm. The 14 year old little girl's name is Billie Jo. She loved to play piano~! There was an accident right before Ma had her baby. Then the accident happened and it hurt everyone but not as bad as it hurt Ma.Well, i will let you start the book for your self but i swear this will be one of the best you will read. I highly think if your looking for a good book this is the one for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"It was a great book, and it was one of my favorite books I have ever read. It also taught you alot about overcoming adversity. The only bad thing about the book was all the people that had died. But I still loved the book and it was also interesting to see how a family would live in the Dust Bowl, and the family facing many problems like money, and Billie Jo's mom and Franklin dying. I also liked the ending how her dad met Louise and they stayed in the dust despite the money trouble and the constant dust storms. If you like books that are sad, but have a good ending you should read this book"},{"rating":"2","title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Out of the Dust is about the Oklahoma dust bowl,and how Billy Jo and her family had to do to survive threw it.Billy Jo is a only child and soon to have a brother until a terrible accident happend.The terrible accident was that mom died giving birth to Franklin the soon to be baby brother.Most of the people in the community blamed it on Billy Jo because she spilt the kerosine on mom wich caused mom to get sick.In the inside Billy Jo new it wasent her fault and that she couldent do anything to help because her hands were so burnt that she couldent give mom water and the whole time she was trying to help, Billy Jo's dad was out getting drunk.I personaly liked the book and i think the age group for thise book would be 11 years of age and pluse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awesome book","review":"The Newbery Award Book Out of the Dust is an exicting and sad story. I liked how the author put this book in diary form. The girl in this story is scared about a terrible accident that happens in her life. She has alot of feelings she can't express. She is scared of herself. She thinks her dad doesn't care about anything anymore. This book talks about dust storms in the 1920's in Oklahoma. If you are looking for a real life story try reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out of the Dust","review":"The is about all the the dust storms that happened all the time in the Panhadle. The book was baseically about a 14 year old girl going through very rough times in her life living during the years of the Depression.The main characters were Billie Jo,Mr.Kelby,Mrs.Kelby,and her brother Franklin.What I liked best about is that it had so much drama that shocked me.The worst thing I didn't like about the book was that it was that it was so confusing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sad and Clear","review":"I think this is a sad story and will make you cry. This book is very clear because the poems are detailed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out of the Dust - A very educational, and wonderful book.","review":"This book was absolutely fabulous. I loved reading it. It really gave me an idea what life was like living in the Dust Bowl during the Great Depression.If you ever think things are bad for you, just read this book and you will realize that they're not as bad as they seem. At least you have food, clean air (except for polution), water to drink, and a little money.This book really helps you grasp how much life is worth and how graeful you should be."},{"rating":"2","title":"BULLSHOOT...BULLSHOT!","review":"GOT THIS ALBUM IN THE LATE '70'S AND ENJOYED IT A LOT.

It was long, but I finished it all the way to the end. After reading the book, I became interested on the other books written by David. First I read all of the Mallareon and then the Belgariad. Thanks for providing me a book that could spark my interest, David!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Reflections","review":"It seem to me that \\"Belgarath the Sorcerer\\" is the most mature work from David & Leigh Eddings. Some of the long-standing humor and plot techniques they have developed over the years are missing from this work, and in their place, one finds depth in the storytelling."},{"rating":"1","title":"just a rehash","review":"This book is, unfortunately, mostly just a rehashof plot elements previously mentioned in Eddings'previous books. While there are a few new eventshere and there, the fact that the overall plotis already somewhat obvious makes it tedious toread. This books was hugely disappointing afterall the other excellent and captivating booksby Eddings. It is almost as if it was written bysomeone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"GET A NEW PLOT LINE!!!","review":"If you are truly interested in reading more of the same drivel that he has pumped out since the Diamond Throne then go right ahead and get this nicely expensive book that will contribute to his royalties...and persuade him to make more boring rehashes of the same characters...COME ON DAVID...Have some originality that many other authors have"},{"rating":"1","title":"Time for a new story Mr. Eddings","review":"Honestly, it's time for a new story. David Eddings has told the same worn-out story at least 3 times now. (Belgariad, Mallorean [sp], Diamond Throne, etc.) \\"Belgarath\\" is an expert re-hashing and fleshing out of story already presented in other novels. The only thing that keeps Eddings' work going is his characterizations, and even his characters are starting to look the same....."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T try to be funny","review":"To be fair, I'll admit that by the time I read this book, I already wasn't into David Eddings anymore. Still, I USED to like the Balgariad. After readings this book I've come up with a rule: never get to in to things. Belgarath was one of my favorite characters up to the \\"Malorian.\\" Now he just seems stupid. If someone can live that long without learning anything, he MUST be. Maybe David Eddings never spoke to old people, and so doesn't realize that years themselves - even if nothing tangable is acheived - make a differance. Also, through this book Eddings managed to do the nearly impossable task of taking out any element of magic and mistery that remained.. An amazing talent, but one, I hope, that will not be wide spread"},{"rating":"1","title":"*YAWN*","review":"Very broing and truly disappointing......other then the maybe four humorous parts, this book went absoutely nowhere. I dont think I will ever look at Belgarth the same way.....I would rather scrape my eye out with a dull rusty spoon than read this again"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceelent","review":"Book was in Excellent condition received in modest amount of time due to United States Postal System automated distribution center which operate about as reliably as Mr. OBAMA"},{"rating":"1","title":"i love this book","review":"now the reason that i gave this book only one star is because it like all of the other books by david and leigh eddings in the belgariad and mallorean series' are only available as audio books. now don't get me wrong i love my kindle but i didn't buy it to listen to books i bought it to READ books."},{"rating":"1","title":"J.P.

Listening to it was laaborously cumbersome; thus I could not finish listening past chapter three."},{"rating":"2","title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"I was halfway through reading my hard-cover version of Belgarath the Sorcerer when we decided to go camping. instead of packing a large heavy book I decided to download the story from Amazon to my kindle - brilliant decision!! the e-version compares well to the printed version."},{"rating":"1","title":"great book, not on kindle, should bed","review":"Let me start by saying this isn't a one start rant due to the book not being available on kindle. This is a one start rant because Del Rey let a great book go to print, in paperback, missing three chapters, literally goes from chapter 45 and jumps to chapter 49. This isn't Amazon's problem, but if the publishers released the book for kindle, maybe I'd have gotten my $7.99 worth!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great for the fans","review":"I thought this thick book would be at worst repeating things already mentioned in the saga, as the style of Eddings is similar to fairytales rather than an attempt for a realistic feeling world, and the stereotypes (particularly describing the various peoples and cultures) he already created in books 1 to 5 were repeated enough as it is. I was right about that, he repeats some things but generally speaking 90 percent of this book is all new material, as the history from Belgarath's point of view.I had a great deal of good laughs; the book has a slower pace and allows for greater detail at points, but Eddings spares us a lot of boredom and still manages to capture not only great events but also everyday life. Robert Jordan could learn a thing or two from Eddings even though he might have greater talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comically Entertaining!!!","review":"Let me start off simple. I liked this book. While it will not satisfy that demon in you that wants realism and balltes and betrayal that is believable, it is a rather humorous account that spans an incredible amount of time, which is interesting, being read by us humans who have so little of it in the scheme of things. Eddings manages to contain well-placed humor and seriousness within this book that draws you in. While Belgarath the Sorceror will not go down in history as one of the best fantasy books, neither will it's author, who is normally only meager at best. But this is quite realistically one of his greatest works and worth a look."},{"rating":"2","title":"Filled in a lot of the gaps left by earlier books.","review":"This book filled in a lot of the gaps and elaborated on many of the things implied but never fully explained in \\"THE BELGARIAD\\" and \\"THE MALLOREAN\\" series. I thought it was an excellent book and a fitting conclusion for the earlier books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Belgarath's self-styled humorous autobiography","review":"Husband & wife team finally reveal that they have both been authors of all the books! In Belgarath they provide fans with insight into the Eternal Man and how he came to be. Humorous, insightful, entertaining and above all, comfortable - like a visit with old friends. Readers get to see aspects of the distinguished, regal Polgara when she was a child with dirty knees climbing trees. I strongly recommend this book to readers of the Eddings' other two series, but not to first time readers - Check out the Belgariad first. One big disappointment was that the sex of Polgara's twins has not yet been revealed!! I guess we'll just have to wait for the next book...Polgara the Sorceress"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yechh...","review":"This could have been a cool story. Could have. That is, if it weren't so liberally punctuated with the bad humor that has become Eddings' trademark. We don't really get to know the characters, with the exception of only a few scenes, and the story is just one rehashing of Belgarath and Polgara being Great Sorcerers after another. Boring. The more he extends a series, the worse it gets (same with Sparhawk). So stick with the books from the beginning."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved and still love this book.","review":"I read this book first before buying the Mallorean and Belgariad series. I'm glad I did. This book makes you wonder and think of the characters. Infact, at the end the end of this book, i was so shocked of how it ended! THAT'S what made me get the series and also the Polagra book! I just HAD to know how it began and ended. I love an author that can do that to his readers!This book is a great overview of the 2 series! His portrayal of Belgarath is very comical and heartwarming. Whenever i need a good book, i'm sure to pick up and reread this book or start the series all over again.This book is made to delight the reader. If you are inclined to dissect a book and its author, then you need to relax and let yourself go with this book. This book will let you wonder and feel that you are with Belgarath."},{"rating":"2","title":"Belgarath the sorcerer","review":"In my opinion this book was more or less unbeatable, but as i said thats my opinion. If you dont like heavy reading, i suggest you read the Belgariad and Mallorian first. in Belgarath the sorceror there are a lot of names to remember,and the belgariad introduces these at a lesser extent so you can actually remember what its telling you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BELGARATH THE SORCERER","review":"I HAVE BEEN READING \\"THE BELGRIAD\\" AND \\"THE MALLOREAN\\" SINCE THEY WERE FIRST PUBLISHED.

The greatest danger Belgarath faces in this book is when he first meets Torak. Through the rest of the book, even when he fights Zedar in Morindim(DID ANYONE ALSO NOTICE HOW INCOMPETENT AND WEAKLY SKILLED IN SORCERY ZEDAR WAS?), you know that he isn't in any danger. Even CTUCHIK is shown as being incompetent when compared to Belgarath.If you're reading this book too see some excitement in Belgarath life, don't. Read the third book of the Belgariad and see CTUCHIK give Belgarath the fight of his life."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star to much!","review":"the belgariad started out real well, the sequel was a ill written repetition tragically followed up this book and an even more horrible one about Polgara. The question still remains... boy! why did u read them all? -hmm... -no idea, I guess I hoped they would improve, well they didn't, and I don't think Mr and Mrs Eddings will ever put any reall effort in writing again... they don't need to... we are stupid enough to buy it anyway!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun","review":"Don't look for anything deep but if your looking for something that is fun for those rainy days read it.

Arch Enemy of the Evil god Torak, The eternel Man, Old Wolf and a hundred other titels. From when He was born as a pesent in the town of Gara until he was feared by all the world over. Brilliant Another Eddings classic.\` If you have read he Beligaid and the Malloreon read this next!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An outstanding effort at filling in the gaps.","review":"If you're not interested in the history of Belgarath's world, and can't handle repetition, you've not only missed one of the key points of the Belgariad and Mallorean, you shouldn't buy this book. If you think Belgarath's a god, and can't handle the tarnishment of his character, you obviously missed what Polgara's been hinting at with a sledgehammer all these years. This is a book for people who love Belgarath's world for what it is: a rich tapestry of the ages, interwoven with true family values, and incredible character development and interaction. The Eddings' Belgarath succeeds where Tolkein's Silmarilion failed: it fills in the wonderful backdrop of the earlier books without becoming a dull academic paper. And as the end makes obvious , one man can't tell the whole story, even if he's 7000 years old. There's Polgara's story as well, and (we hope) the stories of Poledra the Wolf, and that wonderfully cantankerous Beldin the Hunchback."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stuff!

I couldn't put it down!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother!","review":"I have read every single book of Eddings' fantasy serieses(except Polgara's story) and I have liked some of them but this book is merely a long overview. There is nothing very amazing and new in this book and it isn't deep story. It was quite boring to read it and it took long time to finish, which is quite unusual for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just reread the Belgariad instead.","review":"Worse than I expected, and my expectations were pretty low to begin with.

The only problem I have with any of their books is how long it take for the next book to come out. This book answers alot of questions while at the same time opens the door for a lot more questions.

I look forward to reading Polgars's side of this story which has ended but keep evolving"},{"rating":"2","title":"What can you say about it?!","review":"David Eddings and his wife have done Justice as it should be done. The way the books tells the story of the Sorcerer Belgarath and his life is awsome. If you have read the series that go along with the book, it would mean even more than you think. This book is the one of the best books that has ever been written. If you haven't read it, read it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much yet not enough","review":"Being a fan of Edding's work I was disappointed in Belgarath. It was such a long work and I felt needlessly so. While I agree with earlier reviewers that one doesn't read Edding's for literary genius, I do expect the books to be well thought out and entertaining. Going into this book you know the outcome if you read the Belgariad. That makes it hard to inject any suspense into the work, which meant that it needed to be overcome with skillful writing and plot twists. I didn't feel that there was any of this in this work. When a situation headed towards a difficult problem the \\"necessity\\" or \\"Garion's friend\\" bailed everyone out conveniently. I just didn't find this work to be very imaginative and below Edding's standard in the first five books of the Belgariad.This book is like the movie sequel that didn't need to be made. Does Smoky and the Bandit III ring a bell with anyone?"},{"rating":"1","title":"New ideas wanted!","review":"You liked the Belgariad and the Malloreon? Keep it this way. Belgarath the Sorcerer will reveal nothing new despite going a way back into the future. At least nothing you wouldn't expect. I also don't recommend this book as a starter to fiction reading. I believe only desperate readers continue with Belgarath, Polgara or the Rivan Codex."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many inconsitencies","review":"As an avid reader of Eddings works, including High Hunt, I found Belgarath the Sorcerer, and Polgara for that matter, a real disappointment. There are a number of inconsistencies between them and the Belgariad. For example, all of Garions ancestors call Belgarath \\"Grandfather\\", but in the original series, when Garion first calls Belgarath \\"Grandfather\\", it comes as a surprise to him (Belgarath). Polgara's engagement also conflicts with what Aunt Pol tells Garion when he suggests she marry Durnik in the Belgariad also. I have read both the Belgariad and the Malloreans, and the Elenium and Tamuli series for that matter, numerous times, I doubt that I will revisit Belgarath or Polgara."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go to the movie-theatre instead","review":"This is really no good...

This book takes you back before the Belgariad even takes place, starting with Belgarath's childhood, and the earlier parts of his 7,000 year life. This book has all of the things in the Belgariad and the Mallorean that you only briefly read about, such as the cracking of the world, Belgarath's story of becoming a desciple of Aldur, Zedar's treason, The meeting of Poledra and Belgarath, as well as many other stories that are finally revealed in all of their glory in this book. This book is a definate buy for someone who has completed both the Mallorean and the Belgariad. It also clears up a lot of confusion that you might have encountered throughout both the series.WONDERFUL BOOK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"sun dogs","review":"Not what I expected.

But it means that Mickey's hands are permanently at 3:50 and the thin double-bladed metallic hands tell the actual time. Those thin hands are a little difficult to see; also has a red second hand. Look at picture carefully; it is accurate. A light burnt brick red diamond shape and a darker muted plum colored diamond shape on inside of band. A plus for me is that it is packaged in a metal box.

It is fast paced, witty & edgy.What I enjoy most about \\"Sugar Skull\\" is how Ms. Hamilton is able to weave several stories into to one novel (\\"Sugar Skull has teenage squatters, a mayoral race, and Mexican American music) and tie it altogether into one nicely wrapped package. Also, Eve Diamond, the main character in this novel, is well developed and very likable."},{"rating":"2","title":"nicely built socket","review":"Powersport Superstore, politely informed of the delivery date, and I recieved this tool on time. It's a well made thin-walled socket as advertised. Although this socket truly is a thinwalled socket, I needed to grind down the wall thickness even more to make it fit my 98' KLR 250. My reground wall thickness is now under 1 mm at the lower 1/2\\" of this socket... which is scary, and makes me wonder why ANY bike munufacture would purposely design the spark plug access tolerance that close.This product is designed to fit the Honda, and most likely will fit that bike's spark plug well, but don't expect a miracle if you plan to use this socket on a KLR 250."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remarkably light yet incredibly dense","review":"This book is a deceptively light read. Gilson's writing is so clear that it's easy to miss the profundity of it.Just as he compares the history of philosophy to a scientist's laboratory, I'd like to compare this book to a science class. That is to say, do your homework. When a teacher explains things in class, everything makes perfect sense, but unless you take what the teacher said and see how it applies to different situations, you won't learn very much.This book is great, but I wouldn't recommend reading it unless you have time to really think about the things he says. Of course reading it quickly won't hurt, but just like you wouldn't chug a bottle of fine wine, save this one for when you've got time to really appreciate it.One more thing I'd like to mention is how impressed I was by his ability to show the greatest respect to philosophers of previous ages even while he explained why their ideas are hopelessly mistaken."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gilson has spoken, the matter is settled","review":"\\"The Unity of Philosophical Experience\\" is an incredibly boring book by leading \\"Neo\\"-Thomist expositor Etienne Gilson. But then, have you ever read a *fun* book by a Thomist? I didn't think so either.Like an ersatz pope, Gilson speaks ex cathedra, knows all the philosophical answers (imagine that!) and attacks everyone else, including fellow Catholics such as St. Bonaventure, Thomas à Kempis or Meister Eckhart. Brother Etienne hath spoken, the matter is settled?When finished, our knight-errant have valiantly defeated the Platonists, Nominalists, Cartesians, Kantians, Hegelians, Marxists and one Giovanni Gentile. Despite this, we are not any wiser than when we started the journey.Besides, what on earth is the *point* of philosophy, if all important issues are known only through revelation, anyway?Two stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Writers in Training","review":"This book transformed my professional life. Having students write a short amount for homework every day and talk about their writing for 5 minutes a day dramatically improves their writing plus it lightens your load as a teacher.

I'm glad this wasn't remixed, the cheap sounding production and the out of phase guitar and vocals were part of the charm that still hold up 22 years later.

Hans Holbein's macabre and morbid series, \\"The Dance of Death,\\" gives us a chilling view into Europe during the time when its denizens, well, weren't really expected to make it too far into life.This Dover edition, though not as thorough as the complete 1538 French series (now out of print), provides a faithful reproduction of Holbein's masterpiece, with the original textual accompaniment in Latin (with English). In these marvelous woodcuts, the viewer can easily sense the feeling of dread within the European community during a time that death came all too easily.Of course, death is a theme from which we can never truly escape, so I suppose Holbein's art speaks to all the ages.

It gets worse from there. The author's assertion that 1994 was a fluke has no rationale basis of any kind. Dionne proves to be a poor prophet in that he presumes a Democrat takeover in Nov 1996 or shortly thereafter. To date that has not occurred and it has been nearly 7 years. Over and over again Dionne inappropriately and clumsily attempts to parallel modern politics, circumstances and consequences with ancient history. The worst thing about Dionne's theories is that they aren't even very interesting. Clearly Dionne is living in the past when forward-thinking is needed to save the Democrat party from itself.

Inexplicably, the evil magician Rothbart is also a friend of the Prince's and is present in most of thecourt scenes as well as lakeside. The choreography is merely competent.

One was worse than the other, but both are difficult to read. If I had seen how light they were printed, I would not have bought these copies. That is the disadvatange of buying on line. To some extent it is like buying a pig in a poke.

I've bought many crossword puzzle dictionaries over the years. The best one, by far, has been The New Comprehensive A-Z Crossword Dictionary. It has the most entries and the most choices per entry. The only thing I don't like about it is the soft cover edition. The binding doesn't last long. I've had to purchase three already. Barnes and Noble (the store) doesn't display the hard cover edition.

She finds it very helpful when she gets stumped."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely unbelieveable","review":"I can't for the life of me imagine why James found Katherine in any way worthy of love. What an arrogant twit she was. The ending was completely unbelieveable - she was the cause of his losing everything else he might have held dear in his life, but it didn't matter because he loved her? I thought her responses were incredibly immature and self-centered, and I felt sorry for James for being so caught up in her. This is one of the few books I've read lately where I just intensely disliked one of the main characters, and the ending didn't resolve anything for me because I didn't believe it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defies good taste.","review":"I cannot imagine how anyone could fall in love with the heroine, who is a brain short of a lobotomy and a pathological liar. The hero must be a masochist, for he keeps on coming back for more betrayals, the last of which leaves him without family, friends, home, fortune and very nearly, life. I found their romance preposterous and pathetic. Too bad because a lot more could have been done with the premise. Gaffney's Wickerly series (To Love and to Cherish, etc.) is much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"It could have been so good....","review":"This book started out great, the first half does a good job of setting up the story. The interaction between the two main characters is funny and romantic, and then it takes a turn for the terrible. At every opportunity for the characters to grow and develop along with a premise that could have been very interesting, the author plunges the characters into more hateful acts. Instead of exploring a developing relationship between two people at cross purposes, this becomes a story of a sick psychotic love obsession.In a romance novel the lovers have to be someone worth winning, not someone that you are sorry they got stuck with. In true Jane Eyre style, by the end of the book you can't stand the selfish, stuck-up, \\"heroine\\" who knows whats right but can't do it, and you feel so disgustingly sorry for and disappointed in the ruined \\"hero\\" that you put the book down feeling sick. Worse, you feel as though you wasted your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flexible, easy to use","review":"It's a good product for the price. It's very flexible and easy to use.

Not only the amazing pictures that make me grade it 5 stars, but the amazing story told was also the point. The real story about working on the stealth fighter that people seldon get to see was told what will the pilots must & mustn't do before boarding the plane & after landing the plane.

One thing that I could definitely notice was that they had gave the horn section the boot as featured in some cool songs they included in the Soul Love album. The pace is really slow and the album never picks up. The songs are played with much of the same instruments that they seem like one boozy haze. The lyrics did not get me curious attention even through several listens.Having released this album for quite a year now they have yet to score a hit and that is just the story of this album, nothing hits home!The only saving grace for this album is Cryta Jones' voice which I have grown attached to. That aside I would have given it the no star rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent DVD","review":"I was amazed at how quickly this dvd arrived!

Mahavishnu is, but this here is not.","review":"I have bought this CD, paying a lot of money to get it, being influenced by the 5 stars amazon.com reviews, but it turned out to be a huge mistake I have made. I am a big listener of John Mahavishnu's recordings (I own the best of them, from IMF to VOEB) and I consider that there is no possible comparision that can be made with Magma. Mahavishnu is a milestone in the 20th century music, while Magma is only a boring, a very boring, 100 % not musically band. No history. No one would remember anything about them. No wonder it is a french band. They should do what they do best and leave the progressive rock and the jazz-rock fusion for the anglo-saxon world. No ofense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as \\"Nice\\", but still fabulous!","review":"Is it just me? Or is this band really good? Two really good cds(I only have two.I'm not rich you know!) and also on track number ten, is there hints of Beatles songs in there? It sounds like some chords were changed, and one line has a familiar sound to the Beatles song \\"Day Tripper\\". And more too. Sunrise is a great song, and is going in my comic book 9My friend and I want it to go into the tellie!) Its a great pop song. Hi Hi is catchy, the theme song to Hi Hi puffy amiyumi. Friends forever is a good track, though it was used on Scooby doo 2 (that bothers me). My favorite tracks have to be Hi Hi, Friends forever, Planet Tokyo, Joining a fan club, V-A-C-A-T-I-O-N, True Asia, Boogie Woogie No.5, Sunrise, December, and Teen titans theme (I can't get enough of that theme) Well, end of my review.

From PuffyAmiYumi's SoloSolo.True Asia: A hit song by the duo in which they sing of their love for all things Asia....and of course Teen Titans!

Most of it sounds like a troupe of untalented high school sophomores trying to mash up Monty Python, Firesign Theater, and the Mothers of Invention.It doesn't work."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Interesting Look At The Events Leading Up To Pearl Harbor","review":"This book is another look at what events transpired before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and how individual clues that might have indicated a possible attack were missed or ignored.This book concentrates a lot on the issues with the Navy Department's Second Deck which caused problems when all of the information that should have been distributed to several commands was concentrated in one person's hands with only his own impressions deciding who would see what. There were power struggles going on within the Navy as well as between the Navy and the Army over who was responsible for what.This is a good short book on Pearl Harbor and is a good read for those interested in the period as I am. It adds a few new items to the discussion, but no major revelations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hitch lovers will find it a cut above!","review":"New and vintage interviews {along with countless clips from the franchise} highlight this loving tribute to \\"The Master of Suspense\\" and his 1960 masterpiece that started it all.

If I could give more than 5 stars, I absolutely would!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"I shared the same opinion with the creator of this documentary. I got the Psycho sequels on DVD and was bummed that there were no special features. NONE! I have been following this documentary since it was an idea on Myspace and it's great seeing it being sold.

I am a Star Trek fan, but knowing William Shatner's historical bios, I wasn't sure how well I would like it. I finally broke down and bought it. When my wife and I watched it, we loved it. We found it very insightful as it looked at the impact that Star Trek has had on our culture, and Shatner made it funny at times. Great dvd!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shatner Makes Self-Promotion Easily Enjoyable","review":"Shatner has seemingly made a career out of the art of self-promotion (countless commercials, books and short films to that effect), but I think that's because he's one of the few Hollywood types that is actually successful (a la George Hamilton) at it. The light-hearted humor and sly self-parody are almost enough to give self-promotion (in their cases, anyway) a good name. Plus, I enjoy watching someone who has as much fun as he has being serious! There is also some meat, at least, to the science-fact part of what he's talking about, so, of course, it works on that level just fine, in fact, even if you're NOT religiously familiar with Star Trek - but, it's just as eye-opening if you are, too. Highly recommended - a very enjoyable 120 minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful DVD with science, technology and humor!","review":"I rented this from Blockbuster on-line and liked it so much, I'm purchasing a copy for my son and my brother.

However, somethings do require function over fashion. These being such the case.Buy your normal size in these. Don't go by the indications they give. Many of the reviewers commented that the sizing was off. Part of that problem is since these are 100% cotton, they look positively ginormous when you take them out of the package. After washing a medium is a normal medium.The two benefits that make it worth the 'little boy whities' look are the longer than normal leg which is great for tall guys like my man.

It was a huge let down. Jai Uttal has abandoned his incredible talent in mixing Indian rhythms and melodies and has gone super religious ! If I want to listen to a pure kirtan CD, Id pick up some original kirtanists from India. There are scores of them. What made Jai's earlier work with the Pagan Love Orchestra so great was the mixing of Western instruments with Indian chants..Jai, when will you go back to your roots again ? Please dont disappoint your fans..Nectar does not have a single decent song except perhaps for the last track.Its time for Jai Uttal to get the Pagans and go back to the Recording Room ! His comparative advantage is in mixing his Western musical roots with Indian music, not in becoming another Indian kirtanist..There are 2 million of them in India and they have an authentic Indian accent ! Although I must say Jai is getting better and better at his Sanskrit.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"I echo the reviewers below in saying that if Jai went back to more interesting music and blending east with west, he would be better off. I don't need to buy a cd with an american singing kirtans when i have more beautifully produced cds of authentic kirtans from india (without the american accent). The chanting on this cd is leaning towards a repetitive \\"hare krishna\\" type sound and i dont need images of bald hare krishnas dancing around in my mind as i hear this....sorry but his earlier albums are better...it seems as if he put this cd out cause he HAD to and probably took all of maybe a couple of weeks.

Sinbad is that funny on this DVD! The entire 90 minutes plus is filled with material that EVERYONE, all ethnicities, cultures, backgrounds and economic status in life can relate to. Sinbad's real genius is his inate ability to respond, impromptu, to audience member's responses to his questions, especially about relationships. And, as everyone else has stated, he doesn't use profanity...he shows to be funny, you don't have to. This is his best performance yet...and I didn't think he could get any better than he already was. Sinbad....whereever you been...make sure you don't go away again!!

Not what I would suggest for personal viewing or to have Christian friends over. Saddened by that. I usually enjoy Sinbad's clean comedy. Maybe because this came out through comedy central that Sinbad felt he needed to push the envelope to re-enter the spotlight. For those with the same concerns, take note."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sinbad: Where U Been?","review":"I was disappointed in this particular performance by Sinbad that I had hoped to share with my high school students. Based on Sinbad's various interviews in the past I believed his material stayed above the crass and the lewd. I purchased this well reviewed performance and was surprised at the amount of adult sexually based humor that made up this performance. I knew I was in trouble when the Advisory appeared at the beginning of the DVD. So, teachers, if you're looking for a wholesome stand up contemporary comic DVD, this will not be it. All others: enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"First time I saw Sinbad not be funny","review":"I purchased this DVD because we always thought Sinbad was funny and very entertaining.I was very disappointed (after 15 minutes of listening to him berate conservatives, and his political leanings I had to turn it off.If I wanted to hear a political speach I would have turned on CNN or Fox.

The man has skills and is able to maintain the funny without a lot of foul language. He is a just a great comedian. I liked 95% of the show ... And for those of you who are not an Obama fan he only spoke about him for 5-10 minutes max and I have to admit what he said was funny!!!!!! I've watched this video at least 4-5 times already. The only part I did not like was the musical part in the end ... I just didn't think it was something for a mixed crowd such as he had...and I am not into that kind of music, which is why I gave the show a 4 star and not a 5 star. It is great for young, in between and just the young at heart :-)!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still very funny!","review":"After all these years, sinbad is still funny. I lincredibly funny.

It took ages to even try and snap together the cheap plastic pieces and when it seemmed like i finally had it ( and had my 3 yr old clapping for me) its fell apart on the very first try. I was then unable to put it back together again. I am going ot try and take it back to toys r us but as i dont have a receipt at all ill see what happens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be loads of fun but. . .","review":"My son loves the truck and talking garage from this set so I could never return it. However, the pieces for the ramp will not snap together so it is impossible to play with that part. It would be a great toy if they put a little more time into its design. I thought at first perhaps mine was defective but after looking into other reviews it looks as if it is a poorly made toy. I think it is a great idea, the colors are wonderful and fun, the talking garage makes my two year old laugh and laugh but I cannot reccomend it to others since it is impossible to play with the entire playset. It is surprising coming from Tonka who I trusted to be more durable."},{"rating":"1","title":"a dud","review":"don't bother with this toy. it does not stay together long enough for play. because we bought it at full price, we gave it a good go, but just couldn't get anything to work or stay together. toysrus was wonderful to exchange it for us!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a piece of Junk! Can this be \\"TONKA\\"?","review":"Please...save yourself the money and DO NOT purchase this toy. It looks really cool, but within minutes of assembly it will fall apart and leave you with a fussy, frustrated child. Since my husband usually does the \\"assembly\\" work on our son's toys, I figured I did something wrong putting it together...NOPE...It is just that cheaply made. Too bad. My son likes the idea of it. I have reassembled this toy a dozen times in a few hours and I am ready to return it! The model I bought is actually the Police Station version and it sounds like they all have the same issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chuck does what?","review":"What exactly is Chuck supposed to do? After watching commericals and looking at the box in the toy store, I thought the truck would actually stop different places: the chute, loading dock and then to the garage. All the truck does is drive out of the garage, moves in a circle or two and then goes back into the garage!Sending Match Box cars down the chute and loading dock, and pushing Chuck around and dumping the boulders are more fun for my 3 year old than watching the truck drive in circles. If you are going to purchase this toy, don't bother with the batteries, they're not worth it. I am very disappointed with this toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A brilliant new way to look at cities","review":"Who rules cities? Logan and Molotch have a theory. This book lays it out, in fairly simple terms. It argues that landowners have a shared interest in \\"growth\\", i.e. increased property values (land's exchange-value), and are willing to do whatever it takes to get them, including taking over government. This puts them in conflict with residents who care about their neighborhoods (land's use-value) and don't want growth's unstoppable engine.It's a brilliant book, with insights on every page and some poignant stories as well. Logan and Molotch are sociologists, not writers, so the book drags at points, but it's well worth it for anyone who's interested in the subject. My major critique is that it underplays the importance of planning and doesn't provide a good explanation for it, but that's a rather minor criticism, all things considered. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The city as growth machine","review":"Logan and Molotch use the explanation of the city through the tension that exists between owners who see the city as exchange value and the residents who see the city as use value. According to the authors, the local elites are associated with politicians and local media to generate a coalition, whose speech is that the results of their actions will benefit everyone. Such discourse is needed to operate the \\"growth engine\\", transforming the city and its value in use of all, the exchange value of a few."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! Not for grandma!","review":"This is the ultimate book of fantasies for couples. I have looked for many years for something \\"interesting\\" for my wife and me, but this is one of the first successes (others were way too tame). It seems every common fantasy is covered in a story, including women taking their men, women encouraging transvestitism, the traditional rape fantasy, hookers, public exposure, lesbianism, groups, and even man-man couplings involving women in some way. To truly enjoy this book one must have an open mind and be willing to escape into the stories. Anyone who is even the slightest bit uptight or prudish would be immediately embarrassed or even offended.Golly.... I must be awfully kinky myself to enjoy it so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"i give it five yawns.","review":"most of these 'five star' reviews read like they were penned by the editor herself--overwritten, overenthusiastic and overstated. this book just simply isn't good. the erotica itself, though tackling interesting scenarios, is mind-numbing and disappointing. yes, there is new ground to be covered in erotic anthologies. and no, this isn't it. try reading the collection from 'nerve: literate smut,' if you want something truly interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring.","review":"Mediocre at best. this is one of the only erotic books i've read but this one is so bland.

Anti- Jewishness as he understands it has to do with Christianity's conflict with Judaism on matters of faith and practice. Anti- Semitism he insteads see as irrational, and fueled by imaginative constructions and fantasies. The latter as he understands is a reflection of Christian uncertainty in itself at this time.Langmuir has a wide knowledge of sociology, and anthropology and his writing focuses on understanding collective and social phenomenom.This work may not be the comprehensive history of Anti- Semitism which would explain it in all its various historical manifestations. But it is an informed scholarly work for all those who wish to understand the medieval Christian variant of this form of human evil."},{"rating":"2","title":"Steel guitar like you've never heard","review":"You dug THE WORD...

I'm sure everyone will enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best single disc anthology of Anderson's classics","review":"This 20 track disc of original Decca singles is the definitive retrospective of composer/arranger/conductor Leroy Anderson. All the classics are represented in their original hit Decca versions. No matter how many orchestral versions have been recorded, no one has managed to touch this recording of \\"Sleigh Ride\\". It's the little differences. Example: the horseclops, the sleigh bells, the sound effect of the horse. And the sound quality on this disc is nothing short of perfect.

They often have extra cuts, screensavers, or some kind of surprise with their releases. This is also the case with the \\"You Wanted More/Sugar\\" CD now available. The surprise? The exclusive acoustic version of \\"You Wanted More.\\" It's very tastefully done and quite passionate. You can't go wrong if you like Tonic and buy this CD, with their hits \\"Open Up Your Eyes,\\" and \\"If You Could Only See.\\" Tonic is currently on tour, and this CD is the perfect preview to a show that may be coming near you. \\"You Wanted More/Sugar\\" is simply the Best Of Tonic, at a great low price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"perhaps appropriate for Middle School","review":"Anyone looking for anything beyond the most basic and overly simplified introduction to great scientists should look elsewhere. Not only is this book written on a very basic level, but it provides no visual aids to assist the reader in understanding complex ideas that very often have powerfully visual/tactile components; for example, the chapter on the periodic table makes frequent reference to earlier models but provides no reproduction of them to illustrate the comparative discussion. Throughout this book, it seems written in a rush and published on the cheap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gangsta not at his best","review":"I like Gangsta as an artist and a person. He's got a classic OG style that I can relate to (i.e. hittin switches three wheeling and cap peeling). But this album is missing just that. It's on the verge of being on that commercial style where a lot of cat's is going now to try to get paid. I aint haten on nobody that's trying to make some \\"mail\\", but at the same time you disappoint the true fans. I hope Gangsta's next album is more like his old style. If you wanna compare, go and cop the \\"Comrads\\" 1st album, \\"Bad Azz\\" album titled \\"Word On The Street\\" and listen to \\"Addicted To Crime\\"(track 10), and if you can find his first solo album titled \\"Wanted\\" you'll definetly will see what I'm talkin 'bout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Above average","review":"Very functional sling but really nothing special.

My granddaughter (3 1/2) and I found the rhymes a good jumping board from which to launch our own versions of where the nose could have hidden. The illustrations are very colorful and the way the nose isn't shown until the end is very clever. Perhaps at this time of year it is appropriate to have on hand, especially with so many children's noses running!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nightwish 'Once'","review":"As a newcomer to the band of Nightwish, This was the first album that I have come attached to. I was orriginally captured by the track 'Romanticide', But now I can account for the other tracks including the two bonus tracks on this CD. The Vocals on this album are so incredible, you will believe that you are appart of a movie at the most exciting part the whole time. If you but this album you will not be dissapointed at all, and you may also become attached to the other finnish rock bands the country has to offer."},{"rating":"2","title":"RE: The songs are Stupid.","review":"Just because you don't understand the lyrics doesn't mean the songs are stupid. True, Nightwish lyrics contain more metaphores, and reads out like poetry, thus harder to interpret...but it is definitely not stupid.Creek Mary's Blood tells of the Trail of Tears--basic American history stuff--where Native American lands were invaded by the white man. Nemo means \\"nobody\\" in Latin so that should explain a lot. And, in response to a previous question, I Wish I had an Angel is mostly about lust, but that thirteenth disciple analogy hints some betrayl as well.I don't feel like analyzing all the songs. Besides, lyrics are often left to the interpretation of the listener so if you don't get, make up something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"This is one of the few albums of the last few years that really knocked me on my butt, along with Opeth and Nevermore's latest.I always liked Nightwish, but to be honest, the slightly cheesy keyboards always kept them from really realising their potential. Where they tried to sound epic, they sometimes ended-up sounding a bit too close to Journey. Even with all the modern advancements, keyboards have their limitations when trying to sound like an orchestra. I remember listening to Century child and thinking, \\"Damn, imagine if they had a real orchestra\\". Well this time they do, and it makes a huge difference.What used to sound a bit too poppy to me, now sounded properly epic and dark. \\"Once\\" sounds much more like the epic vampire movie soundtrack they've been trying to make, and that's a good thing. Picture the Lord Of The Rings soundtrack with Hetfield on Guitar. The guitars are chunkier and heavier as well. This is my absolute favourite, and I really hope they stay this course."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 1/2 stars","review":"I heard Ghost Love Score first- and just like everyone else--thought it was a really cool song. So i bought it--and found it was the only real decent song on the album--a couple others come close--but overall its just blah- and boring sound effects! SAVE YOUR MONEY"},{"rating":"2","title":"Once","review":"Once being Nightwish's 5th studio album and 2004 is more great symphonic power metal with the amazing vocals of Tarja Turunen. The album was a massive hit and peaked the charts in Germany, Hungary, Slovakia and Norway. Allmusic gave the album 3.5/5 which I think is to low. The booklet contains all the lyrics and has some very neat photographs of the members of the band. This is the last album with Tarunen and next album they changed vocalist to Anette Olzon. 4/5."},{"rating":"1","title":"BLAH","review":"I heard ghost love score and was hooked-now im tired of that song cause its the only good track on the album- agree with other negative reviews- STAY CLEAR- trust me!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A wasted effort more like !","review":"Whats this twit on?

This is a goodish album but the lyrics are stupid. I'd actually be embarrassed if I were to be playing this to somebody and they asked me what the song(s) were about. If Nightwish could put together some sensible chorus lines to their tracks, then they would most probably have more appeal."},{"rating":"1","title":"GIVE ME A BREAK! THIS HAS ALL BEEN DONE BEFORE!","review":"NIGHTWISH ARE JUST A TOTAL RIP OFF OF EARLY DREAM THEATRE AND SYMPHONY X WHO WERE A HELL OF A LOT MORE TECHNICAL AND HEAVIER THAN THIS. THE HEAVY GUITAR RIFFS HAVE ALL BEEN DONE BEFORE AND THE STUPID OPERATIC BACKGROUND SOUNDS ARE EMBARRASSING TO LISTEN TO. I RECKON SOME OF THESE '5' STAR REVIEWERS HAVE MORE TO DO WITH THE BAND THEN WHAT THEY ARE LETTING ON, CAUSE I HAVE NEVER WITNESSED SO MANY ALLEDGED REVIEWERS ATTEMPT TO SUCKER PEOPLE INTO BUYING THIS !!! CHECK OUT DREAM THEATRE'S EARLY MATERIAL AND SYMPHONY X, THE GUITARISTS CAN PLAY DECENT SOLOS FOR STARTERS. I'VE LISTENED TO EVERY TRACK OF NIGHTWISH THROUGH MP3S AND THEY ARE ALL CRAP!!! SO BUY AT YOUR PERIL !!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid at all cost!","review":"I have read all these reviews and have listened to every track that Nightwish have released to date, and there is nothing special about this band at all. Dream Theatre is much better than this. They are heavier, they play decent guitar solos and they write original material. What half these people are on beggars' belief. Nightwish's music is annoying to listen to. I was listening to their album \`Destiny's Child' and a track called \`Phantom of the Opera'. I have never heard such a stupid track ever. It's total b******s. The album \`Once' is just a bigger compilation of stupid tracks which only a **** head could get into. The opening guitar riff for starters has been done a dozen times before. What let Nightwish down are 3 main things. Their singer is awful, they can't write anything original and they are blatantly ripping off music from past metal bands. If you are looking for something original, avoid Nightwish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame 1 Star is the lowest","review":"This album is 1 of the worst records of the decade.

Proms type outtakes with a heavy guitar riff and out of key vocals sounds crap in my mind. In fact Nightwish are one of the worst bands I've ever heard. Kids will love em though, and from reading most of these reviews, I doubt there are many reviewers over 13 years old that are praising this band. Except of course the Finnish loyal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Once is a big Number '2'","review":"I don't know what this reviewers is on, but to describe this album as the best thing going is very naive.

The first track alone makes you cringe and as for the rest, it's just ripped off from scores of metal bands before. The vocals are dia, the guitar playing is crap, the arrangements are stupid and I bet there isn't one reviewer for this album that has given 5 stars that's over 14 years old. If you are a pre-teen nerd then you must really enjoy this trash. For later generations I would avoid Nightwish because they Suck! Suck! Suck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another poor attempt","review":"Nightwish have once again failed to progress. In a desperate attempt to capture Metal and Opera they have failed terribly. An earlier review said that 'Once' was like an adventure, yet I would have to be high as kite to agree with this becuase the adventure would only go as far as my trash can. The singing is out of key. The guitars are toned down too far and mixed with silly synthesiser sound effects makes the whole charade give you earache. I would much prefer to be tortured with electrodes then put my music system through this again. However, there is one good thing to say about the album 'Once', it makes a dam good 'frisby'. So Nightwish, go back to Europe and die."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute crap","review":"If this is the best from Finland, then no wonder they f*** up everytime at eurovison.

Not just any orchestra but the same one that Howard Shore used for the Lord of the Rings movies. Can and other band say they used that orchestra? No why because no other band has used any Oscring winning orchestra. Nightwish has done what no other band has very been able to do. THEY USED AN ORCHESTRA IN THE RIGHT WAY. A REALLY TO LIFE ORCHESTRA.This is not mainstream. Mainstream would never want to play this. You want crap music then go listen to your dame Britney Spears. You want good music pick up a Nightwish CD. You want crap metal music then pick up a Korn CD. You want good metal music pick up Nightwish. You want a crap singer pick up a Avreil(sp) CD.

The first 4 tracks absolutely smoke. Lovely mixture of symphony, opera, heavy metal and synth pop.Complex arrangements, soaring vocals, head-banging rythems and majesty weave in and out on this masterpiece.

Not as symphonic as normal but it was actually a good choice with this one. It's amazing what a band can do when they change their music direction and try something different.

The band is known for having a great haunting female opera voice and they are giving that up. I very much doubt that they can find someone to match those vocals and as with every band that loses their vocalist (if the vocalist was unique like we have here), Nightwish are doomed to go back into obscurity and eventually die. Maybe someday they'll re-unite and do another album together, but by then it will be too late (see Iron Maiden)."},{"rating":"1","title":"How do you say \\"overrated\\" in Finnish?","review":"Being a fan of hard rock bands with female singers (Within Temptation, Lacuna Coil, The Gathering, and yes, even the dreaded Evanescence), more people than I can count have told me to check out Nightwish, with \\"Once\\" being the album most recommended. So I did ... and came away from the experience unimpressed. Tarja Turunen does have an absolutely beautiful voice and the band rocks extremely hard, but the juxtaposition of the two sounds like Renee Fleming geting lost on the way to the Met and ending up in the studio with Iron Maiden. It just doesn't mesh. Tarja is now out of the band so perhaps the band will get (or has gotten) a singer that's not so technically perfect. I can see where the music would have appeal, but it's just not for me. Your mileage, of course, may vary."},{"rating":"1","title":"SOMETHING TO BUY","review":"This is one of those if your a collector like me you just have to purchase it to make the collection complete. I've been listening to Nightwish since Wishmater and fell in love with them. I have all their cd's. This is probly the most annoying cd that I have of them. I have all their cd's and most of their singles and I just can't listen to this thing except for a couple of songs. NEMO, I WISH I HAD AN ANGEL and PLANET HELL that's it. It was and is a pleasure to see them come to the states, I have seen them 3 times, ATLANTA, CHICAGO AND MINNEAPOLIS. Great shows, great songs, but awful new album. Please, I beg you please, to go back to Century Media you released some great albums with them and when you reunite with them, you'll release your greatest album('s) ever.
