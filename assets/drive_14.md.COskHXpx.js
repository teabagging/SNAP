Its sentences were written in old English, which got you confused. The sentences were also pretty long. There word choice was hard and confusing. On page 118 the 4th sentence has like three hard words. The description was good but at times the plot was confusing. A significant event that happened was when the mutineers attacked their ship and killed Flint.My personal opinion of this book is I thought it was bad and hard to understand. It was written so far back that the old English was so confusing. It seemed like there were like ten different things happening at one time. So a good age for a reader of this book would be around thirteen and up. Twelve year olds could read it to if you're a good reader. But if your not that great of a reader than you might think the book is confusing like I did.

I prefer to play computer games."},{"rating":"2","title":"A timeless classic at an inexpensive price","review":"This classic by Robert Louis Stevenson should have a place on everyone's shelf. When we think of tales of pirates and buccaneers, we can not help but thing of Captain Flint and Long John Silver.Why this edition? Although this is by no means a keepsake, it is an inexpensive and well-done edition. It is unabridged and has an illustration of the treasure map as well as illustrations from other scenes in the book (such as Jim Hawkins' meeting Ben Gunn). It is easy to carry around when you are out on vacation or doing some hiking. You can't do that with a keepsake.The story is written in narrative fashion, mostly from the perspective of Hawkins, but sometimes from Dr. Livesey's point of view. Either way, it is fast paced and hard to put down.I would recommend this edition to anyone not willing to invest in a hardcover keepsake. You can not go wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just for kids...","review":"'Treasure Island' is one of those books everybody's heard of, but not everyone has read.

It's often billed as a \\"boys' adventure story\\", but it's far more than just that - the superb writing, fantastic characters and exciting story transcend age and gender.

Apart from the fairy tale plot there is superb dialogue and dialect hidden in the pages. The relationship between Long John and Jim unfolds grippingly. There are also superbly detailed scenes of action and adventure allways achieved with an economy of language. The seafaring language is used very deliberately without any ostentation. Always a pleasure to read. Great pace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Treasure Island","review":"This is the best illustrated classic book I found so far.

The strap material is soft and didn't cause any irritation or discomfort from day 1. The arch support is made for someone with moderate arches so it should be comfortable for most people.

If you're planning to use these to sneak your alcohol into a sporting event then I'd come up with another strategy. But they do make a good conversation starter. The only reason I give them four stars instead of 5 is that the dram is made of hard plastic and so reduces the cushioning in the heel area somewhat.

Many of us are waiting for him to re-integrate after his world explorations. In the meantime, see the other side by checking this album out. The themes are fresh, the effects and moods appropriate. The music moves with strength and none of the cutsey, folksy, or yet overwrought elements one finds in too many New Age albums.

All 4 of us, female fans in our 30s to 40s were very disappointed with Mary's performance. Basically, she sounded terrible. I never knew that Mary was a studio baby but her LIVE sound is awful. It was just over an hour of screaming. The band wasn't that talented. And she didn't do a grand production with costume changes, fancy sets or dancers like other singers who basically don't need all that artifice because they can sing! Quite frankly, I needed to be distracted by something else because her sound was disturbing.I own concert dvds of Beyonce, Tina Turner, Janet Jackson, Madonna, Micheal Jackson, Prince, USHER, Cher, and others. I know a good concert when I hear it, even an okay concert. THIS concert was BAD.Buy Mary's albums and stay happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good MoBo","review":"It's a good Motherboard, if you don't want to spend a lot of money this is perfect, the only thing I didn't like is, the product description doesn't specify you must have a 24 pin Power Supply, so, when my MoBo arrives, I change my old one, the CPU and video card, and couldn't use it becuase I have a 20 pin Power Supply, I had to buy a new PS."},{"rating":"2","title":"The 64 bit Motherboard","review":"This motherboard works very well and very fast.

I only used the first one occasionally, but in my line of work as a Legal Nurse Consultant, I am constantly using a Medical Dictionary & Encyclopedia. Each time I reach for this book now, I know now that what I am looking for will have a good probability of not being in the book, or a poor description. For example, I was looking for the typical symptoms of hypocalcemia - the book tells you \\"hypocalcemia - a diminished level of calcium in the blood\\" - that's not very helpful.There are many other situations that have rendered my opinion of the usefulness of this book to be minimal if you need to rely on a medical dictionary/encyclopedia.This book was very dissapointing as I am trying to build my library. That is one reason for being able to see a book first, and have a few examples you want to look up in the book before buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"NRBQ Kick Me Hard","review":"I had an NRBQ album back in the 70's, and was glad to find this album.

No complaints, would've rated it a 5 it it had been free."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautifully performed, however","review":"this recording is NOT comparable to JRB's \\"Songs For a New World.\\" The accompaniments are nowhere as interesting and the lyrics/storytelling, along with the endless melodies, are nothing short of cloying. As for the reviewer who mentioned that Mr. Bucchino is an up and coming B'way composer, it must be noted that he has now had but one show on B'way, A Catered Affair, and many of these tunes are recycled from many years past. A cabaret artist maybe, but this endless ballad style would never make it past the public at large"},{"rating":"1","title":"Saccharine Sickly Sweet","review":"If you have a taste for hyper-earnest sentiment and treacle, this is the CD for you.If the very notion of some \\"spiritual\\" composer navel-gazing and pondering life as \\"The Artist at 40\\" makes you gag, run in the other direction!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Songs to Make You Believe in the Power of Music Again","review":"I have been keeping an eye on John Bucchino's music for about 20 years, and know (and have loved) some of the songs on this CD from previous collections. However...the new songs on this album practically made my heart leap out of my chest! I believe that this is the finest cabaret songwriter alive today, and his songs are deep, and chewy, and soul-affirming, and unpredictable...and in touch with something deeply spiritual. Not a lot of \\"popular\\" music can stand up to analysis, but this stuff gets better and more meaningful the more intense the scrutiny. It's ridiculous to compare him to Jason Robert Brown or anyone else. This is a unique artist, courageously self-revelatory, smart, uncynical, and generous."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Can't Compare Apples and Oranges","review":"This CD is AMAZING. To compare it to \\"New World\\" is unfair to both composers. Both are wonderful recordings of great songs. Yes, these are more introspective, but beautifully so. I suggest buying both."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. Bucchino/ Not a craftsman","review":"Although there are a few moments where the sentiment works with the music, this is very poor craftsmanship, in my opinion. The lyrics are full of psycho-babble phrases, (therapist references and all) really wordy- and as any hack knows- if you place dense lyrics on complex musical phrases- you get ponderous overfull stuff.And this music is complex. Whereas the track THIS MOMENT is deceptively simple and works very well.

Some of their other \\"Great Singers\\" bios are definitely worthwhile. I'm not talking about a split infinitive or two, but rather about such choppy syntax and punctuation that the reader has to do all the work to derive any meaning at all. Also, it conveys no real sense of the great Stevens. The 40-buck price in the jacket flap makes it all the more jaw dropping. The publisher should have at least hired a temp for a few hours to clean up the worst of it. I'm wondering if the sole criticism in Mr. Pennino's defense is a friend or relative.

You can't get better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"timeless joy and beauty","review":"One of the most joyfull music there is. This disc offers beautifully performed traditional music with ever so subtle interpretative treatment that brings it to present. The cover suggests only a fiddle and piano duets but here comes the surprise. There are three other musicians accompanying Alasdair Fraser and Paul Machus, including Glenn Moore (\\"Oregon\\") on double bass. Many other reviewers described the music so well that I can hardly add anything new. I have been looking for quite some time for a celtic based/inspired music that would sound real without being folksy; and contemporary without sounding new age.

The sexual romp provides a lot of the funny situations of the movie, but it is the emotional and dramatic tragedy of father-daughter love and true love for lover and friend that really makes the movie. The racist interplay even within blacks is displayed.

The half-Caucasian, half-aborigine Detective Inspector Napolean Bonaparte (Bony to his friends) becomes involved in this case hoping he's found the perfect murder. A man named Marks visits Windee Station then vanishes. The local police assume he was lost in the bush but Bony has reason to think differently. This mystery is populated with a host of interesting outback characters, aborigines, blackmailers, secondary mysteries, and an awe-inspiring fire. The vision of 1930's Australia is exotic to us in this day and age, yet presented with complete understanding. It is worth noting that Bony and his contemporaries are well aware of his biracial status and some of the language used may bother some. The original copyright of this story is over 60 years ago though, and Mr. Upfield's heart and intentions are in the right place."},{"rating":"1","title":"UNABLE TO RATE BECAUSE...","review":"AFTER ORDERING THIS BOOK, WAS ADVISED THE SELLER HAD INSPECTED IT AND FOUND THAT SECTIONS OF IT WERE DAMAGED/MISSING SO...THEY DID NOT SEND IT AND REFUNDED MY CREDIT CARD PAYMENT.SINCE THE FIRST AND SECOND BOOK OF THIS AUTHOR'S SERIES IS UNAVAILABLE (OR PRICED TO SELL TO VERY SERIOUS COLLECTORS ONLY-- READ: EXORBITANT) I PROBABLY WON'T EVER GET TO READ THEM.ANYWAY, I SHOULD BE HAPPY I DID NOT RECEIVE A DEFECTIVE BOOK AFTER PAYING FOR IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing book..turned a high-school dropout into a high-tech success","review":"I was 26 when I first read and used this book.

Today (I'm now 57) I can look back over a great career in high tech and a great marriage (35 years) with many other rewards as well.

I like the MB-CP10 Battery Pack for taking vertical photos. It adds body and convenience to the camera. However, I was disappointed to find out that it is not a supplemental battery. The user must either use the camera battery OR the CP-10. So, if you are using this item for taking vertical pictures...understand that you will only be using the \\"AA\\" batteries, which burn up pretty fast."},{"rating":"1","title":"I own a Nikon 8400 and I'm considering this","review":"Battery pack, but frankly it's a bit too pricey. And appears it would clumbersome to use. Especially in the horizontal position as the viewfinder is in lower postion. Anyway, the whole idea is to have more power available vs the battery pack which comes with the camera.Just make sure you buy NiMH 2300-2000 AA batteries.Great concept, but a bit too expensive, Nikon needs to price it more like in the $75 dollar price range, but consider extra battery packs cost only $42, well. You can see my point of view.You can buy alot of battery packs for $170 bucks.If you get one of these, make sure you post a review and what type of photography you do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wiccan imagry, but not unfamiliar to anyone...","review":"the Tarot of the Old Path is certainly pagan in tone. the illustrations are subtle, incorporating traditional tarot symbols (like the two pillars in the high priestess card)without being any less origional. i found that the cards had enough similarity to standard rider-waite decks to be familiar, but were much more attuned to Wiccan philosophy than to ceremonial magick. I would recomend this deck to Wiccans and Pagans primarily, but also to anyone who collects or likes a variety of artwork."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book is not necessary.","review":"The Tarot of the Old Path deck is beautiful and quite original, but all you need to interpret it is the instruction booklet included with the deck.

I could not stop playing the \\"STUNT\\" map. It's addicting and entertaining. As time progressed I kept my N64 but lost track of the game. So one day I unplugged my Xbox360 and hooked up my N64 and decided to play some Smash Brothers. It was then when I remembered Rush. I bought it on Amazon and played it for hours. If you played this when you were a kid, this will take you back to better times. Times when you had no bills to pay... Not a care in the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"The standard for racing games.","review":"Even a year after it's release, Rush 2 stands alone as the best racing game out there. The depth of the tracks and precise control of the cars make for a game that you never get tired of playing. You can play a track four different ways. Forward, backward, mirror image and backward mirror image. This forces you to learn every track inside and out and there are shortcuts that can only be reached in one direction which adds to the fun. The ability to control every nuance of your cars handling makes for a challenging interface and the variety of available cars is awesome. Let's not forget the stunt track. This is a special track that in multiplayer mode is fiercly addicting. Overall, this game is simply awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool Fast and Fun What more could you want?","review":"Rush two is a great improvment on the first rush. With the ability to adjust each of the 12+ cars color,handling,engine sound,and mags this game has it all. It also has a great sound track to go along with it's well designed tracks. Two player action is great and the stunt course provides hours of fun. Of all the racing games for the 64 this has to be one of the better ones money well spent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rush 2: Extreme Racing U.S.A.","review":"It's one of the best games I've played in a while. The only problem is you have to set the car perfect or you can easily over steer. The selection of cars has grown with adding some and deleting some. I like how you can change the engine from a V6 to a V10."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best","review":"This game is my favorite game for the N-64. If you like fast cars and awesome tracks, then that alone makes it worth it to buy the game. The stunt track is one of the best ideas I have seen in a car racing game. Also, there are more shortcuts then you can count in all of the tracks. This game is completely awesome with a HUGE replay value. I can't wait for Rush 2049 to come out. It will be equally great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful gathering of literary verse revolving around birds","review":"This pocket-sized hardcover of poems about birds provides a beautiful gathering of literary verse revolving around birds, separated by general bird categories from 'backyard' and 'barnyard' to 'birds of prey' and beyond.

I have a cat that loves to sleep inside the closet and she leaves her beautiful white hair over every shoe and piece of clothing in the closet. So I now have one useless metal contraption hanging over my door and an abundance of cat hair in the closet.

Never have I been so moved by a love story. When Anne and Captain Wentworth finally overcome their own guardedness and the pressures of society and re-declare their love for each other...... It is the most wonderful scene ever written. I have never read a more wonderful love story. I think this to be the most romantic of Jane Austen's novels. The mercenary marriage market Jane Austen ridicules in \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is portrayed in a darker and more destructive light in \\"Persuasion\\". Two lovers torn apart by a society fixated on class, wealth and position, only able to find happiness together once this obstacle has been overcome, but in the mean time..... OH THE HEART ACHE!!!!!

P&P is more sparkling and witty; Persuasion feels more mature. Definitely a book to read over and over. And the letter from Captain Wentworth to Anne(you'll know what I'm talking about when you get there!) is the best-written letter in fiction. Read it! You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"As an Austen fan I was disappointed.

Although we all know it will have a happy ending, Austen sustains the emotional suspense of *how* Anne and Wentworth will finally reunite, and I was not disappointed. Wentworth's letter brought tears to my eyes; it was so wrenchingly emotional and bare. Aside from the romantic plot line, this novel also draws a clear and humorous picture of the characters and social dynamics of the time, which I found fascinating. I recommend this book highly, especially to those who may be new to Austen, as it is shorter and less complicated that some of her more famous ones. The ending makes it all worthwhile!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Persuade You to Read this Book!","review":"The novel Persuasion by Jane Austen is very good. Although slow at places, it definatly redeems itself throughout the novel. The protagonist, Anne, is in love with a man, but is persuaded out of love because of his social status. The book is a classic romatice novel, but is not cheesy to say the least. I encourage everyone who enjoys a good novel to read this book, but especially females. This book is centered around the social status and appearance of the people in the early 1800's. The way Anne doesn't care, makes her differant than the rest of the characters, but also helps the reader consider thinking for themselves instead of being persuaded by other people's thoughts. By the end of the novel, the reader has the decision whether persuasion is good or bad. I really enjoyed the novel. The reader just needs to be able to make it through the first couple of chapters, then the book is really enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now THIS is true romance. Jane Austen's best!","review":"Short and Sweet Review, by Michelle:Persuasion is my favorite Jane Austen novel. I love Anne.

If you like Jane Austen even just a TINY bit, then read Persuasion. I know that you'll love it as much as I do.Oh, and after you're done, watch the movie version if you haven't already.

I was very excited to start this book, hoping I would love it just as much as P&P...; but I have the exact oposite feeling about it. I was bored in the begining, but I forced myself to keep reading thinking that it would get better. Finally I just couldn't stand it & moved to another book.

Perceptive, emotional, profound and even painful at times, it still sparkles with Austen's humor and flair for turning a clever phrase. Anne Elliot is a heroine's heroine, and one with whom the reader feels an instant sympathy and affection. If only Jane Austen had been given more time on this earth to share her splendid and amazing gift--but in the little time she did have, she has given all of us who love her work a never ending source of pleasure and enjoyment.

It should not be. If a person believes himself or herself to be a well-rounded reader, but does not insist upon reading every major work of Austen's, they deceive themselves.I thought I had an adequate idea of Austen's works by watching the films \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" and \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". I decided to read these two books, simply out of curiosity as to how they would stand against the films. I found the movies to be lacking the absolute finest portions of each story, so I decided to read Austen's other works that I had not been familiar with.Persuasion, as well as everything I have read from the pen of Jane Austen, does not disappoint. Well, except that it does, eventually, end. It's worthy of as many accolades as her more famous works, and as the others do, causes a sense of general happiness in its reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good, quick book","review":"This was a typical Jane Austen love story and a well-written piece. I actually found it quite quick. My only gripe is that this story (compared to \\"Mansfield Park\\" or \\"Pride and Prejudice\\") is quite incomplete in descriptions about the mannerisms between some characters *at the time of their occurance* that, though explained fully in the last couple of chapters, a reader would not find them as easily recognizable as one would hope.

No one else in my book club made it through..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just don't like Austen!","review":"This is the third book by Austen I forced my way through, but I must admit, I find her writing dry, humorless, dull, and always the same themes. It's the constant talk about class, and who is good enough for whom, and the woman and man who just can't seem to get together until the very end when they admit their mutual love. It's all very tedious. I don't find a clever word or thought in her books. I only got through 1/2 this book, and then, in boredom, threw it aside for SINISTER STREET by Compton Mackenzie. Besides, there were many characters introduced throughout the novel, and I couldn't keep them in mind. They were not at all developed as characters. They were relatives and friends, and I didn't care about any of them for they were not portrayed in enough detail to distinguish them apart.I guess, I will give up on Austen. My favorites are Trollope and Hardy. Sinister Street, so far, is superb. One really understands Michael Fane and his little sister!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How does Chinese water torture sound?","review":"Chinese water torture? Sounds like a welcome diversion from this boring redundant work of \\"art\\" to me. I feel for the trees that were wasted in the process of creating this horrendously boring soap opera in paperback. It is possible that I missed something while reading this work because I spent most of the time trying to stay awake. However, in the future if I want to read something of this caliber I would write NBC and ask for the script of their least watched daytime \\"soap\\". In conclusion, not only do I NOT recommend this novel, but I pledge to do my best to begin an anti-Persuasion League, to prevent the widespread development of narcolepsy in high school students who are forced to read worthlessly painful novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, like all other Austin novels","review":"I must say Jane Austen is incredibly boring and all her novels are stories of women's aspirations to marry wealthy and noble men to support them. Most great literature is so wonderful because of its timelessness, touching on universal feelings and ideas. While it may have been groundbreaking in its time, it is so dull now. We women have already established our desires of equality in culture and have already acknowledged at least an inkling of what feminine independence is but this novel is a back step. Also, it is so predictable. Of course all of the characters will end up married, and most likely to their man of choice. This book is dull and predictable and is restricted by its time period. If you want to delve into the past then maybe pick it up, but otherwise, it's unexciting, and it still feeds on social classes and marriage as a woman's reliance on a man for social and fiscal support."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wise and eloquent","review":"As always, an Austen novel is a pleasure to savor like a very fine wine.

I want to thank Penguin Classics for the endnotes in this edition. They were comprehensive, clear, attractively presented (instead of being wedged into the text), and helpful to 21st-century readers of this early 19th-century novel. The scholarly introduction (with a spoiler warning, how thoughtful!) and the biographical timeline help place the book in both literary and chronological context, and were substantive additions to this work."},{"rating":"2","title":"An unknown masterpiece by Jane Austen !","review":"Persuasion is one of my favourite novels by Jane Austen. Like in all her other novels Jane Austen describes with wit and style the life of a cute heroin. At that point Anne Elliot is slightely different, because she found her real love when she was a young woman, but she had to break her engagement, because the family matters wanted her to. After a few years she still loves the man she broke up with. As she meets him again a couple of years later, he has made a lot of money as Captain . At first they try to keep out of their way, but that seems to be impossible. They meet eachother really often, because the relatives of Anne want him to mary one of their daughters. The love is still there , in both of them, but manners and doubts make it impossible to tell.Like in all Jane Austen's novels there are implications and disaccords that let you always hope for a Happy End .And for my opinion Jane Austen wrote the most romantic loveletter in that book."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first Jane Austen Book!!!","review":"Wow!

When she has a second chance at love with the same man, we fear she will fail again, but Austen keeps the reader on the edge of the chair in suspense and (sometimes frustration). What a master at turning the phrase, of creating so vividly the class conflict, and the tension inherent in Victorian manners. A definitive exploration in the art of persuasion. Now I'll have to read some others, but I chose Persuasion as my first, because it got the best Amazon.com reviews.

Romance, suspense, jealousy, unrequited love, all of it. By far one of the best books I've read since Pride and Prejudice. Jane Austen's books really draw the reader into the story and cause the reader to empethize with the heroine. She knows just how to tug at a person's heart strings through the plight of the main characters. A wonderful book, and one that I will read again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Persuasion","review":"Persuasion is a very good book. It's slower than the contemporary novel, which is to be expected (it is nearly 200 years old, after all). Like all of Austen's other novels, it is of course a social commentary. It's a story of delayed love and patience. It's been called her 'most romantic.' The idea of the old love, Captain Wentworth, coming back after years apart and both parties still being in love IS very romantic, but I disagree with it being her most romantic. It's a very sweet story, and also pretty straightforward. It was a lot of fun to read, and a good story."},{"rating":"2","title":"persuasion","review":"One can get lost in this story and spend some time in places of beauty, both in the heart and in the world.

Anne Elliot, on the verge of spinsterhood at 27, is reunited with the man she let her friends talk her out of when was 19.

It was the first and last of Austen's that I will read. She may well have captured the mores and social rules of the time, but she didn't create characters I could really care about. I stuck with it to the end and found the revelations about Mr. Elliot to come out of nowhere and the ending romance to be something we could see coming from the very start. I'll take Edith Wharton over Austen any day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Austen's best","review":"I am a fan of Jane Austen's work, but this is definitely not her best novel.

As a result of this, the slant of this biography is more psychological than previous books. It is scrupulously detailed though, which is a real treat for those who want to know what her life was on a micro-level. It is fascinating to read the excerpts of her therapy sessions and then be able to relate her actions to her psychological state of mind and see how all of it influenced her poetry.This is not a particularly literary biography - so if you are a PhD in Literature, it probably won't add anything to your understanding of Sexton's use of meter or rhyme schemes. It rigorously follows the events of her life but does not spend much time on her formative years. However, the scope and depth of Middlebrook's psychological research is wonderful, and someone who appreciates both psychology and literature will enjoy this book immeasureably."},{"rating":"2","title":"Biography reminds us we need to read Anne Sexton","review":"This biography reminds us we need to read Anne Sexton, as she was one of this country's fore-most confessional poets.The biography was engrossing, and elucidated many things I had not known about Sexton, or had only vaguely heard discussed.Such difficult times she and her fellow confessional poet, Sylvia Plath, lived in.One cannot help but wonder how things might have been different for Sexton and Plath, had they been born a couple of decades later.Very well worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Psychologically compelling","review":"This biography is a psychologically compelling, fascinating portrait of Anne Sexton the person. I wouldn't call it a relaxing read, but if you are interested in Anne Sexton or in a rather mysterious mental illness this is for you. I've been telling many friends about this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is Making Someone Look Like a Mess a Feminist Statement?","review":"Obviously I do not think so. Sexton was I think more aware of the impact she was making and what \\"turf\\" was available to women writers in the Fifties. Same as today -- the body. Writing about her own body she could reach for universality. But Middlebrook is not willing to really examine her poems except to analyze their \\"clang\\" or rhyme scheme, and after awhile comes off as kind of dull-witted; eternally pointing out that Sexton can rhyme. The meaty stuff of why Sexton became a celebrity, commanded high speaker fees (for her time) on such small book sales Middlebrook doesn't go into. I would rather read the biography by Sexton's daughter Linda if I can find it. I think Linda also forgave her mother for being sexual, later; but I may be wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Psychiatrist overstepped; did it help?","review":"Patient records are privileged; Dr. Orne justifies releasing tapes of Anne Sexton's therapy because the daughter of A.S. approved. He wrote the preface to the book, displaying a rather passive attitude to the malfeasance of the therapist who slept with A.S. And does the end--understanding creativity/a poet's life and death--justify the means? Do outpourings in therapy tell readers about where creativity comes from, how it is shaped, the interplay of life and art? I doubt it. People \\"edit\\" their therapy talk, too, though differently from their public utterings. Readers may be seduced by these secrets, hoping to find answers that cannot be given, even--maybe especially--by therapists.

Even the best of fans should never own Conan the destroyer. Destroyer is a really bad movie. Barbarian is one of my favorite Arnold movies. The extended edition of Barbarian includes deleted scenes, A digital remaster of the decaying original. You get longer scenes of silence. Conan in the comics did contemplate in peace, a sharp juxtaposition to the man's violent side. The juxtaposition is balanced in the extended edition. I loved following along with the director and Arnold in the commentary. They pointed out the things I idly let pass. Each scene Arnold would try his hardest to remember how he had gone through the scenes. But it was a long time ago that he had done the movie. The director discribed the undertones of the movie.

Everyone thinks they can do it but it takes talent to do it right but in this case they don't. Too many one-liners and total lack of development. It's clumsy at best. There are also some scences that are too dark for most kids like the dead turkey scence,the scence where we see the ladies in their dressing half-naked and scences where they talk about killing somebody. The songs are gargabe and just as bad as the songs from the Tom & Jerry film. Overall,If you want to see a good Rodney Dangerfield Movie? Go watch Caddyshack or Back To School.

Scale has built up in the pump and now they are recommending you use filtered water. How about having a filter built in like a brita? No amount of descaling using vinegar has been able to get my Keurig working consistently. This product is designed so that there is no way to open it up to clean out scale that has built up inside of the machine. And of course, Keurig can do nothing but offer me the same model at a discount.

I was very happy and excited to use this brewer and k-cups, and it worked fine for approx. 8 months. I followed the cleaning and de-scaling instructions, but it would intermittently have trouble brewing. It would work after re-booting, but progressively got worse. The coffee maker lasted for a year and a half, and at that point it completely quit. De-scaling didn't work, and it seemed that the system sounded like it was trying to brew a cup, but the water would never come out. The support line was extremely unhelpful. All they recommended was cleaning the system, and unclogging the tips. After telling them I did this twice in one week with no help, all they could offer me was a $70 discount towards a new Keurig coffee maker since it was past the one year warranty. Spending $150 on a coffee maker that lasts a year and a half is ridiculous! Why would I buy another one?"},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"Don't waste your money- mine broke after a year and a half and when I called they told me the best they could do is give me deal on buying a new one for 80 dollars!!

Oh and I have known 6 other people who have had to return theirs within the first two years.

Don't get me wrong I love the coffee, but to only last about a year and to fork out over $100 each time is just not cost effective for me... I've owned a Cuisinart drip coffee maker over 5 yrs and paid around $100 and it still works great...

I'm conflicted since I love it so much(I'm the only person in my family that drinks coffee) and use just the hot water feature often to make tea. Thinking of trying the new Bunn but it does not have a reservoir or an off button. I just hate to give repeat business to Keurig for these makers that don't last very long for how expensive they are.

Lots of size options, control of water temperature, ability to make iced drinks. So I bought it. Immediately found out that most of the K-cups I tried had a slightly burnt flavor--and I tried lots of types, Green Mountain, Caribou, Coffee People, Timothy's. Found out that the Green Mountain Kenya AA did not taste burnt, so I might suggest sticking with that--if your machine should happen to keep working.Within about six months, mine decided to have spasms of not brewing--boiling, spitting--but nothing coming out of the spout. Read a few other posts--people suggested removing the water reservoir, that this breaks a vacuum. Did that. Sometimes it worked and sometimes it didn't. Tried the old give it a tap where the pump seems to be located. Worked sometimes, not others. Today, total death. So I paid almost 200 bucks for something that works some of the time for 18 months.

I have tried nearly every coffee maker I've seen. My most recent one was a Senseo. I was always spilling water - either filling the tank or after a cup was brewed. To use a travel mug, I had to brew into a regular mug and pour it into the travel mug. The Keurig B70 solves these problems. Almost all of my 16 oz. travel mugs fit under the spout. You can remove the tank to fill it but I leave it on the machine and fill it with a jug. I remove the K-cup right after brewing and there is no leakage. There is a big variety of coffees available or you can use your own (and adjust the strength of brew) using a separate adapter. I will buy another when this one finally quits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great while it works","review":"It is the best coffee maker I've ever owned. The trouble is it does not last very long.

I challenge Keurig to stand behind there product and add a 2 year warranty. But, you know they won't do it because they know exactly how long each unit will last. Go ahead and call there customer service and ask why don't they offer a 2 year warranty. Anyway, if you want to buy this I strongly recommend that you purchase an extended warranty. I don't know if Amazon offers an extended warranty. I bought aBlack & Decker DCM18S Brew 'n Go Personal Coffeemaker with Travel Mugto replace my dead Keurig.

I have not yet contacted Keurig but I wonder whether the GREAT coffee is worth the hassle if these things need to be replaced every six months...?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not reliable","review":"I thought this was the best thing since sliced bread....until the brew size stopped working, I am on my second machine and the same thing is happening after only a few months with the replacement and now the temp. is not very hot.

We have 2 of the smaller older models both in our offices. This one looks great, makes a wider variety of sizes, makes a hot fast cup, and is VERY quiet. The big problem we encountered was it required a full day of decanting (running vinegar through the machine instead of water) to get the flavor cleaned up. The initial 15 cups tasted so much like PLASTIC we had to dump them! So after a series of decanting and then running only water for about 10 containers full, it is now making a tasty cup of regular coffee. Of course, this may not be the coffee maker for people who love the last cup from a pot that's been brewing all day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Junk","review":"Keurig B70 failed within 30 days. A total engineering and quality failure. Won't pump water to fill a cup and the LCD display started to fritz out. Save your time and get a plain drip maker.

We will never buy another Keurig product ever!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted only 1.5 years!","review":"It is out of warranty so Keurig (Green Mountain Coffee Roasters)is replacing this for $80.00; however, I must return the K-Cup holder and MY expense to prove that I am not fraudulent!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT FOR WEEKEND COFFEE DRINKERS","review":"We bought ourselves a Keurig for Christmas. Although it makes weak coffee, we have enjoyed it (this whole week). But we're returning it....why? It KEEPS WATER IN IT ALWAYS. We are only weekend or company over coffee drinkers. So we find it very unpalatable to always be drinking coffee after water has sat in it for a week or more. Yes, they tell you how to \\"purge\\" it. But that involves adding more water so the water flows through, it still keeps water inside. THERE IS NO WAY TO EMPTY THE WATER. It won't even show you the menu until you have it loaded with water. Not a good idea for weekend drinkers. Now I'm looking for a pod brewer that actually empties."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic GARBAGE","review":"I wish there was a no star rating. This coffee maker is nothing more than expensive plastic garbage. It lasted just long enough for the warranty to expire. \\"Probably the pump gave out, we can offer you a sizable discount on a new one\\" You can't you repair the pump and the sizable discount is about 20%. Big deal, why would I throw good money after bad. Save yourself lots of money, don't buy this coffee maker."},{"rating":"1","title":"If Specialty Coffee Is Your Thang, Do NOT Buy!","review":"I was really excited to get this machine, hearing lots of good reviews about it and exploring the over 200 fabulous (sounding) flavors that are offered. However, when i got the machine, there was only one taste i could find: bitter. I tried over 15 different k-cups, ultimately only liking one, the cafe mocha (escape). None of the flavors could be tasted properly. Gingerbread, hazelnut, french vanilla, breakfast blend: BLECH!*If you are the person who goes to Starbucks for flavored coffees and frappuccinos, do NOT buy!The only reason i gave this 2 stars is the concept, simply putting a cup in and some water and receiving coffee in less than 20 seconds.Great idea, terrible coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keurig B70 Platinum Brewing System","review":"I purchased this coffee maker from Amazon. I have had it about 2 weeks and it brewed coffee excellent. There were no leaks or any problems. This morning I put a cup in and turned it to brew and nothing happened. It tried to pump and then shut off. I fooled around with it for about 1/2 hour, but finally declared that it had died. I really liked it and will order another as soon as I get a refund on this one. I hope I can give it a better review than I did this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanna pay more for bad coffee with extra environmental waste?","review":"Well you're in luck.If it wasn't for so many other commonplace consumer blunders, I would be shocked that these Keurig units have become a mainstay in coffee drinking culture. The fundamental problems as I see it with all these singe serve models are:1. You pay more for coffee.2. The coffee is generally poor quality to start, but the brewing process ensures a bad cup of coffee.3. There are now millions of non-recyclable little plastic cups headed for the landfill.Want a good single cup of coffee, get a quick boiler and a french press, or a single drip cup for over your mug.Virtually any other method of producing a single cup of coffee (while taking perhaps 30 sec. more time) will give you a better cup at a cheaper price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ever Wonder What Planet Some People Might Be From?","review":"I don't know where these ''problems'' that some are proclaiming from damaged parts to the simplest. Read the instructions first I guess is the best advice? Anyway, this is the best product and I've brought this particular version, the B70. AND cheaper at Khol's. Wait for it.......$149. Plus 20% off coupon they sent thru the mail!! So far, I've had no gripes whatsoever with Keurig brand. The reason I went for this one was because the amount of water this one held. Versus the ones below this B70 held much less and didn't want to keep refilling with each cup of coffee or two. Great buy. Especially the amount of money I've saved let alone for the price!! #WooHoo! :D"},{"rating":"1","title":"Keurig a bad buy!","review":"My machine died after 1yr and 10 mo.

The variety of coffees available in K-Cups is expansive. The machine is super fast, which allow you to offer guests a variety of options without taking all night to get their drinks right."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the one!","review":"I've used one of the smaller pod machines (Senseo) for a year or so for a quick morning cup. The coffee was nothing great, but it was convenient. I decided to get a D-70 for my office, mostly because I had seen one at another office, and I liked the presentation -- a selection of coffee types in the chrome rack. This thing makes GREAT coffee. I bought a second one for my home. I recommend spending the few extra dollars for the B-70 model, as opposed to the B60 or B40 models you see in stores. The B-70 has a larger water tank, but is still very compact. It also offers more cup sizes, and has a bigger LCD. The few people here that have voiced concerns about weak coffee or needing to use two k-cups, just haven't figured out the system. If I'm making an 11.25 ounce travel mug size cup of coffee (available only on the B-70), I just make sure I pick a strong coffee type."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Parts?","review":"We had this thing for slightly over a year and it quit working. After two nights in the garage I finally managed to get the thing apart and found out a water solenoid was bad. Guess what, you can't buy parts according to Keurig. How green is that. I don't mind spending alot for a nice machine like the Keurig but for gods sake it should be fixable. Next time it's a cheap Mr Coffee so I can chuck it. Sad world!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You will pay about $10 a month to \\"rent\\" this...","review":"...then you will need to buy another one. On my third sold from various sources.

I used it without problem for the entire 10 months. Then all of a sudden this morning, I brew one cup of coffee and it was apparently its last. It's just dead. No error message, no weird noises. Just a dead, blank screen. I had such high hopes mine would be the exception. But no. I hesitate to get another one, but it's just so darn convenient.

Mine has failed repeatedly search Keurig Problem and look at how often the solenoid valve fails, the pump won't pump, the lines plug, etc. - people using compressed air to blow out the lines, pinching off the recycle line to the tank, using only distilled water, etc - I have done all of that and here is the easiest route if you choose the path of this coffee maker. I bought mine where there is a no questions asked return policy, first failure to pump and the machine is boxed up and exchanged for a new one. Hopefully this method will put enough failed units on the manufacturers doorstep for them to build a better machine. If you buy one, get extended warranty as you can see from searches most people are past a year of ownership.I like the tea from these machines. I use a tassimo for coffee as it makes a better and stronger cup."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME Customer Support","review":"I bought my Keurig machine two years ago. In a household of 5 people, we each used the machine at least once a day. We descaled it once every three months and have NEVER had a problem with it. This machine is wonderful! About a week ago, it started to malfunction, it spat water back into the reservoir or just didn't brew coffee despite \\"Brewing\\" on the display. I called Keurig customer service and she put me through the \\"paperclip\\" cleaning, but after that failed to solve the issue-THEY REPLACED MY MACHINE FOR FREE!It was two years old and they sent a brand new B70 to my home! For how often this thing worked consistently coupled with the excellent support I received, I would recommend this product to ANYONE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keurig B-70","review":"I just got my Keurig a week ago, I love it, It makes great coffee, I know some reviews on it is not so good ,But I know if you follow the directions and take care of it , it will last a long time .

I told my son who owns one for two years now and it is still working fine. true some times there are lemons I know how that is I have seen it in the auto industry for 30 years. But the Keurig company will take care of any problems that might pop up. Like I said the key word is Maintain it and it will give you good coffee for a long time.

It kept me happy until it began to clog. I would place the coffee pod into the machine, and water would not process through the pod. It would overflow the pod and make a mess. I rinsed it with clean water and still, it would clog. Nothing worked! It was junk. A few co-workers were talking about coffee makers and one person asked how I like my Keurig. I told the co-worker that it broke long ago and went into the trash. The co-worker told me that the same thing happened to their Keurig and to another co-worker's Keurig.My recommendation: DO NOT BUY!! They make great coffee ... while they work ... but they are junk machines!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great when working","review":"I've owned this unit for about 8 months and have had all the exact same issues with my brewer that you'll see on all the 1-2 star reviews. When it works, it's a fantastic little coffee maker, but absolutely infuriating when it won't draw water. Tells me to descale when I've already run gallons of vinegar through it, etc. I'm seriously considering not purchasing another one even with the all the convenience these offer."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for the office","review":"I bought this for my office because I was tired of throwing out a half pot of coffee every day. This way, each person gets a cup of coffee, cleans up their own mess, and I don't have to throw away coffee or come back from the weekend to a moldy mess if I forget to clean the pot on Friday. Very convenient."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive junk","review":"This is the biggest piece of expensive junk I have ever seen. I got one for Christmas in 2009 and had to have it replaced 4 times. All four of them after anywhere from a few weeks to straight out of the box would fail to pump more water from the tank in order to make coffee. I would have to take the tank off and on, unplug it,etc. Sometimes it would work again, sometimes not. Now number five, which has worked for about six months, is short cupping. Water runs out the bypass while brewing and makes about half a cup, so I have to run it multiple times. I'm done with them, going back to a regular drip maker. I don't need to start my day with all this aggravation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quit working within two weeks","review":"We bought this based on Keurig reputation. It quit working within two weeks after only a few uses. It quit puncturing the seal on the single-use cups so the water poured around the cup instead of into it. We returned it to the store and received a refund. The clerk said he had worked in Returns Dept. for five years and they were seeing more returns on this product than any other he had experienced; they were averaging three returns per week in that store alone (chain has over 500 stores). He then pointed to their returns basket where another sat stating it had been returned only minutes before we returned ours. Let the buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep your receipt handy!","review":"Buyer beware! Received 25 Dec 09, and it stopped working properly 15 Jan 10. Right in line with many other negative Keurig reviews. The water stopped filling the heating reservoir. We had to unplug/plug back in, and pull out/replace the water tank each time we brewed a cup of coffee. We aren't heavy coffee drinkers, and would estimate we brew 2 cups a day. Our local Bed Bath & Beyond was great and let us exchange for another, with the option to bring back for refund if we have any further issues. Wouldn't have bothered with a second unit, but love the convenience and quality of the coffee.

Malfunctioned a couple of weeks ago (stuck on \\"not ready\\") so called Keurig and they sent a replacement AFTER having me clean out all the holes in the cup assembly with a PAPER CLIP. It was obviously a malfunction in the electronics but they had me do all of this useless troubleshooting anyway.The replacement they sent malfunctioned after two days. This time shutting off before brewing. Called customer service and they told me they would call me back. Called back next day after not hearing from them and they said it would be \\"up to 48 hours\\" before I would receive a call back.This is disgusting. I see another reviewer noted that Amazon would not continue selling this useless junk.Update: Never received a call from customer service. Amazon allowed return.

Maybe that is why I've not have any problems with my Keurig that I bought at Costco a long time ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lot of money for a cup of joe!","review":"This is an expensive machine and the coffee was not hot enough when you added milk. In addition, my travel mug was too large for this machine and would need two of the K-cups to make a stong enough mug of coffee. Also, the used K-cups are not recyclable and at $20+ for a pound of coffee it is too costly for the sake of convenience. I brought it back to where I got it after three days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great coffee maker","review":"We looked for a long time and were going to get the Tassimo. Then a friend suggested this and it works really well. The size is good for keeping on the counter--others take up too much room. Maybe the only drawback is the water tank needs to be filled frequently because we drink so many mugs of coffee. The mountain green coffee is a good blend, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quiet is the word","review":"I purchased the B70 first time around in August this year, unfortunatly it was defective on arriving. I was able to get a feel for it though as it did try to go through the motions, it was extremly loud and vibrated all over the counter. Amazon was great about the return process and gave me a full refund. I almost gave up on the B70, but I saw a review that said a new B70 was coming out anytime. Well, I just got mine in, and I can say it is SO much quieter than the first model. No vibrations and hardly any sound. It also has an Iced brew mode which I haven't tried yet. So as long as the model you buy has the Iced brew mode, then expect one quiet machine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"We have a graveyard of these at my office.","review":"Long story short, it is a bad idea if your buying these for an office space.

The past three have been covered under the 1 year warranty. This one is a month and a half past warranty...I imagine we're stuck. Will call them later to see. We brew two cups of coffee every morning and sporadically will heat water for hot choc. or tea. We do keep it on so the nice blue light stays lit....maybe that is whats killing the motor. We also use a reverse osmosis system to fill it so I don't believe build up is happening. Sad, because I love the coffee and idea but product definitely has a flaw."},{"rating":"1","title":"So sad, such a wonderful machine","review":"We absolutely loved the Keurig for 2 1/2 months, then it just started acting up.

I am sorry I did not pay attention to the poor reviews. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Keurig won't fool me twice.","review":"Most of the five-star reviews on here appear to be from people who've owned their Keurig for a week or two. Yes, mine worked great back then. After about 9 months, averaging less than one cup per day (clearly not over-use) mine started \\"short-cupping\\". I have experienced the same poor results as others utilizing the telephonic customer service suggestions. My unit does fine when I run straight water through it, but it doesn't have the oomph to force water through the K-cups, and the backflow dribbles the water back into the reservoir. Clearly this is a pump problem, not a plugged line. Mine has passed the warranty period now, so I am simply going to resurrect my Hamilton Beach Brew Station which still works well after many more cups than the Keurig ever did. The Keurig cost three times as much but didn't last a year. No, there will not be a 2nd Keurig in my home, let alone a 3rd or 4th! Buy one if you dare, but don't expect it to last beyond a year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quit working less than two weeks after purchase!","review":"Although this brewer is convenient and makes great coffee, I can't recommend it. I bought a new model and it quit working in less than two weeks. The display would read \\"not ready\\" and then the machine would turn itself off. I searched the internet to see if other people had this problem and learned it is a major problem. I'm mostly disappointed with the Keurig customer service. I called them on a Sunday. You speak to a representative who takes your information. Then, a specialist has to return your call within 24-48 hours. They returned my call 3 days later and outside of the times I said I was available. Unfortunately, my husband checked the voice mail and found it unintelligible and deleted it. I called Keurig back later that day and couldn't speak to a specialist again, and have to wait the 24-48 hours again for a return call. I feel ripped off after spending that amount of money on a defective coffee maker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failure of two units in under two years","review":"I had two units overall and both died due to a water pump problem. The first died within 4 months of ownership so with the warranty they sent me a new one for free. This second died just right outside my warranty window. The only thing they would do is offer me a replacement for a \\"discount\\" which was still expensive. From reading around it seems that this is a common failure mode of this machine, with the water pump failing or pumping slowly. I tried to argue this but the customer service rep didn't care telling me that it's still a \\"good deal\\". This company needs to own up to its design flaws of this product. This is criminal and cannot believe they get away with this. I will never buy a Keurig machine again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unit failed in 26 days","review":"Started out nicely, but on the 26th day of ownership the B70 developed this problem:After brewing a K-Cup, the unit does not suck in water and after it times out, the blue 'low water level' light flashes, even though the reservoir is nearly full. This can be cleared only by unplugging the B70 so that it reboots, but that wipes out all programming. This has to be done after each cup.We returned it for a refund and went back to our 3-year old Keurig."},{"rating":"1","title":"You'll be dissapointed","review":"These are very temperamental machines. Depending on you luck or water quality, they will only work for a short time. I've had two in about a year and they stopped brewing after about 6 months. They seem to clog up inside and only make a partial cup. Kuerig tells you to clear out the piercer with a paper clip, but that may or may not put you back in business. They claim it is a hard water problem and that you need to descale it, or use bottled water. We have soft water and 6 months use, making 1 cup per day, 5days a week... I had a Mr. Coffee for years and never had a problem. There is a serious design flaw with these machines. They are expensive and you will have a huge investment in k-kups right when the thing goes on the blink. Better not to get started. Wish I had known...

There is a serious design flaw with this model","review":"My Keurig Platinum worked perfectly for one blissful week. Then the machine began to turn off after finishing the brewing cycle. It's necessary to pick up the water tank and drop it back into place several times until the water begins to draw down. Once you can get it to brew, the coffee is excellent, however it's a big annoyance to have to finagle the tank after nearly every cup. Keurig should't continue to sell this product when they know that it has this flaw, and I will not be purchasing any other products from this company."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brews a cup of coffee in less than 40 seconds!","review":"I choose five stars because my keurig machine is awesome.

Thought it was \\"gimmicky\\". Well, we have had it about 3 months now and both absolutely love it! There are so many coffee and tea choices! It is fun to try them all (I recommend sampler packs). We use this both morning and night. The iced feature is great too! We love both iced tea and iced coffee in the summer.

I said no thanks, I was replacing it with a B&D that brews into a travel mug for 20.00. This maker was used by only me in my shop. I made one-three cups a day M-F.

The machine is great, I love being able to buy different flavors and coffee/tea/cider/hot chocolate k-cups to brew in an instant with no mess. However, for $175, I would have hoped it would have lasted more than 14 months. Like other customer reviews, the problem with the machine is that it would say it was brewing, but nothing happened. I tried everything to get it to work (descaling, clearing needle head, etc), but nothing worked. It's pretty disappointing....I figure it cost me $12.50 per month while the machine worked, and I am okay with that cost in return for the convenience of brewing a single cup at a time. I'm going to buy a second machine, but if it also stops functioning within a year or so, I will not return to Keurig as a future customer. Let's cross our fingers and hope for the best.

First it started short-cupping and then it more or less quit brewing altogether. It would dump the hot water back into the reservoir. It's been cleaned many times & de-scaled often. I usually used the carbon water filter and it wasn't abused or mistreated. It was just expected to work! It's a great coffee maker while it works BUT...when you factor in the cost of replacing the coffee maker annually/semi-annually & the cost of the K-cups, one might as well go to Starbucks/DD everyday. Or go back to a drip coffee maker (my old drip machine is still going strong after 8+ years). The reliability of this coffee maker is extremely short for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great coffee maker","review":"I got the Keurig B-70 B70 Platinum Single-Cup Home Brewing System a few weeks ago.

Worked well for 13 months then stopped working. After having googled this and read many reviews I have realized that this product is very poorly designed. Our coffee maker started by short cupping. Then I attempted to descale it by pouring literally gallons of vinegar through it per the descale instructions. This did nothing to remedy the problem. In fact the computer started to malfunction and pour all of the vinegar/water out without heating it. Descaling did not work. Finally after weeks of trying to fix it I have given up. Of course it is one month past the warranty so I have no recourse. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. Numerous other consumers have had the same problem. If you see a good review it is usually not related to reliability/durability. It usually starts with...\\"I've had this product for 2 days and it works great\\" Fair warning."},{"rating":"1","title":"3rd Down, none to go","review":"I am on my 3rd B-70 in less than 2 years.

Issue range from drawing half the amount of water, shutting down in the middle of brewing to buttons that no longer respond and a display that died.Keurrig is very eager to take your money for this overpriced junk but when you need warranty support, then good luck getting a response and even if you get to them the fix is more expensive than the value of the machine.I am so tired of this overpriced system that we decided to whip out the ole Capresso machine and you know what: the coffee tastes better, is hotter and were are spanding sooooooo much less.

Keurig does not repair their coffeemakers, stating that the process is not cost effective. In some cases they will offer a replacement if your device is within warranty.

For some reason when using the french press I need to make the entire 4 cups to get the best flavor. I also bring my water to a boil and then let it sit for 20 seconds or so before adding it to the coffee grounds.

I love love love love it so far ( have had it about a week ).The only downside to this machine is there are so many varieties, in the morning I have been trying 2 - 3 different varieties and by that point I have hit my coffee limit for the day :(How is that a downside you ask? Well the coffee produced by this machine is so delicious and refreshing ( compared to the bland coffee I am accustomed to ) that I want to keep drinking more and more!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best cup of coffee","review":"This is not our first Keurig. Our first was great too but we decided to buy a new one. You just can't beat these brewers. They are fantastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good taste but...","review":"First of all, make sure you get the Platinum PLUS machine. It doesn't cost much more, and it has a rinse button. This ad seems to be for the plain Platinum machine but I don't see Plus on Amazon anywhere so something is weird.The coffee that comes out of this machine tastes really good, but I hate the machine itself. It is so SLOW. I'd rather just drive to Dunkin Donuts. The water trickles out in a slow drip, which causes maximal splash-back all over the machine. Even when I just want hot water it droooools out so slow. And the controls are hard to remember, I'm always press press pressing to try to get the right size cup of water. I wish I got a different model, maybe not the Keurig brand, but still using the K-Cups."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed in Product Quality","review":"After visiting a relative, I bought a Kuerig Platinum coffee maker and persuaded my mom and aunt to do the same. Now about a year later, all three of the coffee makers no longer work. We have tried everything in the manual to correct the problem without success. The water flow out of the coffee maker is so slow that you cannot even make a full cup of coffee and descaling does not help. I might be able to justify one of our coffee makers having a problem, but all three? When purchasing a coffee maker for $160.00, I certainly expect it to last longer than a year. Stay away from the Kuerig coffee maker or you'll be buying another one in a short amount of time. Very disappointed in the quality of this product and its longevity!"},{"rating":"2","title":"convenient and cool","review":"I will say that the machine has worked well. It's quick and super easy to clean. Best of all it makes a decent cup of coffe and I no longer waste coffee since I only make what I need. My only complaint is that the keurig cups are pretty weak. I like a strong cup and there is no way to adjust the strength of the coffee so it is a little weaker than I prefer. Once all the intro k cups are used I plan on using the reuseable filter cup to add an extra teaspoon to get a stronger cup.Overall, I like the machine and would recommend it but not the k cups."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish we had done more research--VERY unreliable","review":"It was only AFTER our new B70 Keurig crapped out after working flawlessly for 10 days, that I googled \\"keurig doesn't draw water\\" and lo and behold found the hundreds of discussions and complaints about this machine. Don't be fooled by the 4 stars shown on Amazon. The thing is deeply flawed and unreliable. Read the 1-star reviews for the real story. Too bad, because when it worked, it was GREAT. It's hard to beat a great cup of coffee in 10 seconds. But it DOESN'T WORK for an awful lot of people, including me, and from the volume of problems out there, it's a poor design and not worth the huge amount of money. Don't waste your money on this item until they have made major reliability improvements."},{"rating":"1","title":"I LOVE the idea, but my machines keep breaking!!","review":"I love the idea of the Keurig brewer. My husband and I drink different coffees so this is a geat appliance for us. However, I have been through 2 of the B70 brewers. I always take care to descale and properly care for it, but it is the most fickle machine ever. Customer service is always helpful, and they can usually get it working again.. but, who has time to spend 30 minutes on the phone with customer service once per month?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Screw the Environment","review":"This product just shows how lazy people have become and just haw ignorant and uncaring people are of the environment. It really is sad. Every serving of poor coffee/hot chocolate/etc required you to throw away a small plastic cup that cannot be recycled and will never break down. That is millions of these lille waste bombs a day!! If you can live with yourself for that, you obviously do not care about the planet or anyone living on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Far So Good","review":"After reading the mixed reviews I was skeptical about purchasing the Keurig B70 Platinum. However, I found this coffee maker for $30-$40 cheaper at a store, cheaper than the stores website or any other site on the internet which gave me more incentive to purchase it. Plus the B70 included a variety of 60 K-Cups and a K-Cup reusable filter which allows you to use your own ground coffee... Phenomenal deal, assuming I don't run into the myriad problems others have alluded to in their reviews. If I incur any issues, I will return it back to Costco.For the time being, I'm giving the Keurig B70, 5 stars because it was very easy to set up and use. The coffee was not as strong as what I'm accustomed to but that may be a result of my choice in brand/flavor K-Cup. I am a one cup per day drinker, coffee of course ;) so I will update my review in a few months. Hopefully my rating won't change."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hit my b-70","review":"For three months I loved this machine now I beat it with my can opener. It won't brew when it says it ready. Now I am searching for a better model or brand. Any ideas?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Well engineered, awful coffee","review":"We have the B77. Did everything we could think of to ensure a good tasting cup of coffee. Flushed the system, used bottled water, different brews from different suppliers. Could not, no matter what we tried, get a cup of coffee that was not bitter or sour. It's going back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will wake up the family with NOISE!","review":"I had an older Keurig machine which was bigger but great. I purchased this Model which looks more like something out of sharper Image. the water container has an internal blue LED light that illuminates the water a Star Trek like blue and will flash when the water gets low. So if you like a nice big cup of Joe or tea you'll need to fill it often. Now that said, about the noise factor - this thing sucks in water and growls very loudly, like a coffee grinder. If you are filling a big mug of coffee, you will need to fill your cup twice which means the machine will have to suck water in 4 TIMES which lasts about 6 or 7 seconds. It rattles anything on the kitchen counter from the vibration frequency. Sounds great doesn't it...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repeated Pump Failures","review":"After having 5 of these machines in the last 2 years I can say without question that Keurig does not make a quality product in the B70, B60, B40. Keurig's customer service did replace two of the brewers free of charge, but every time they fail in the same manner, the pump stops drawing in water and therefore doesn't make a cup of coffee.Please vote with your dollars and purchase another version of the single cup machine. I also have an old (+ 3 years) keurig desktop brewers in which you have to fill the stainless reservoir before each cup and it works great to this day."},{"rating":"1","title":"COMPLETE JUNK","review":"For the first six months I absolutely loved this machine. The ease of making a single cup of coffee throughout the day made it vastly superior to making a whole pot that lost flavor as time went on. However, after about six months the machine started making 4 ounce cups rather than 8 ounce cups. I have used only filtered water since day one and had descaled the machine as well to prevent any mineral buildup. After numerous calls to Keurig and researching the issue on the web I could not change the short cupping problem. It seemed as though the water pump was just giving out. At about 8 months the machine finally stopped working altogether. Have seen reviews of the Keurig OfficePro line that are positive and have decided to give that one a try. While supposedly containing a noisier water pump the machine does not seem to stop working suddenly. Will update this review after using the Keurig OfficePro."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 units quit working after about a year :(","review":"When it works, it is a good unit. It is very expensive per cup. The parent company owns most of the many brands available for the machine so you get many choices of mostly very average at best coffee. The many choices let you think you'll eventually get a great coffee, but **sigh** you wont find the best beans in the greenmountain or keurig parent owned coffees. The coffee you will get will however make lots of money for keurig. Having said that, it is really fast for a fresh cup of coffee, and works good at making quick tea. You can use the large size setting on the b-70 to make a quick pot of your favorite tea, and that can be gourmet tea if you want which is nice. I have had two units. Both broke after about 11 months to a year. So don't expect them to last for a long time. Still I will probably buy a third. Im a 5-7 cup a day person and sometimes you need a quick fresh cup of average coffee."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Keurig","review":"This machine was given to me as a Christmas present and has been well used and much appreciated. It was simple to set-up and program, super easy to clean, refill and no real maintenance has been required almost 8 months later. No cans of coffee or filters taking up space in my cabinets, no coffee stains to clean up off the counter or coffee pot to scrub down. It fits multiple size mugs and has a very conveniant programmable on/off feature. It is so easy to pop a cup in before I get in the shower and it's ready when I go to walk out the door. I am always finding free samples of different K-cups online and even always seem to find flavors on sale or clearance from Macy's to the Christmas Tree Store so I have not found that to be a huge expense. I highly recommend this product for low-volume coffee drinkers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great item","review":"I was told about this product by a friend.

I wouldn't waste your money on this unless you like a 180 dollar paperweight. I had my old coffee maker for 8 years and it only cost 30 bucks... Wish i would've kept it instead of giving it away...

Troubleshooting alleviated most of the problems for a while, but then they progresively got worse until two weeks ago, when the unit totally failed. The unit will not power on at all.I researched the K-cup units for the past two weeks and they all get terrible reviews (Keurig, Cuisinart, Hamilton Beach, and Mr Coffee). The units all have various problems, including but not limited to failures, weak coffee, and temperature issues.I debated for some time about purchasing another K-cup unit and decided that they are not worth it (too much maintenance and expense (cost of unit, k-cups, and impact to the enviroment), so I purchased a drip coffee maker instead (Zojirushi Fresh Brew 10-Cup Thermal Coffee Maker), which got rave reviews.Now, what to do with my current K-cup inventory ..........."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keurig Stopped Working","review":"After only 43 days, this machine stopped working. It would not pull water through, therefore it would not brew, it wouldn't clean...it just quit. Customer Service was awful...almost non-existent. We returned the Keurig, and replaced it with the Cuisinart that brews K-Cups. It cost more, but it has worked beautifully and is virtually the same machine. It feels more solid, also.I cannot tell anyone that the Keurig is worth the money. As one reviewer said, take out the pump to make it a bit lighter when you toss it in the trash!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One chronic problem that will drive you nuts","review":"When the Keurig machine functions properly, it's a great machine. I own three of them, but I'm replacing them with the Breville unit. The problem is that the Keurig machines constantly, and I mean constantly, go out of prime. That means you'll put in your k-cup, press the button and ... it sits there. Nothing happens. Or you'll select a cup size and a fraction of that amount will dispense. Workarounds include turning the machine on and off, lifting the handle up and back down, lifting off the water reservoir and putting it back on. As I said, I own three of the machines and all of them manifest the same problem. The workarounds usually eventually work, but at this price one would expect a more stable functioning machine. I have had no such problems with the Breville, not once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not use if you have softened water","review":"I really liked this product. I have a well and have to use softened water. I did not want to buy water just to use this product. I went through 2 units before I gave up. My money was promptly refunded. The company techs said it has something to do with the sodium ions introduced by the salt in my water softener. Although the company recommended using bottled water in their advertisements, they did not mention anything about a water softener. Had they mentioned the water softener, I would not have bought the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful . . . when it works.","review":"I received the B70 as a Christmas gift and was thrilled. It took a while to find a coffee strong enough for my taste, but once I tasted Emeril's Big Easy Bold, I was hooked. Unfortunately, within one month my machine malfunctioned like so many others. It would make a loud noise like it was trying to work and then shut off. I called customer service and they sent a new machine. It worked for less than a week! I called again and they sent a second replacement. I was told that the problem had been resolved and I should have no more problems. Unfortunately, though, I have had this third brewer for just over a week and it is already shutting down automatically. I am so disappointed.

When I package it up in the box and then take it to the post office, by the time I get there the box is wet from the unit leaking.

You have to repeat the process until water comes out, then its either too little or too much water."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"We love coffee... particularly Kona Coffee, which we buy from Hawaii regularly. While in DC, I stayed at a place that had this machine. For a week straight I had the best cup of Green Mountain coffee every morning. I loved the time savings of not having to grind your own beans, and it looks really cool! So I logged online and bought it the next day, along with the carosel and every coffee, hot chocolate, and tea product you could imagine. The Tea is pretty good, but we haven't had a good cup of coffee yet! Coffee is weak on largest cup and too strong on lower cup size. Type of coffee doesn't seem to make any difference ... they all taste terrible. Even tried our own coffee with the special attachment. No good. My husband wants our old $60 coffee maker back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely the best!!!","review":"I received this coffee maker as a Christmas gift and have been using it 2-3 times per day since. It is so quick and easy and makes a perfect cup of coffee every time, provided the coffee itself is a good brew. I have found several brews that I don't like, but part of the fun has been trying the sample packs that came with the unit and others I received as a gift.I will say that the only disappointing thing about the Keurig is that a regular (non-EXTRA BOLD) K-cup is only strong enough for a 6-oz cup for me. I must purchase EXTRA BOLD K-cups for a good 8-oz cup and I'm more limited to the types that are available for EXTRA BOLD. That being said, even the EXTRA BOLD are too weak for the 11-oz travel size and that is very disappointing to me since I would like to be able to fill up a larger mug with perfect coffee. Guess I'll have to do two 6-oz cups for a larger size. I hope the K-cup companies come up with a way to make K-cups strong enough for the travel size option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brews coffee WAY too hot","review":"You have to wait for your coffee to cool down for 20 minutes every time you use this machine because the coffee will come out as EXTREMELY hot.

We had only had it a few months, but were gone for over a month of that time and it was getting no use at all. Plus, my husband is the only drinker of coffee, so it was barely broken in.

I showed it off to my friends and we had wonderful \\"coffee klatches\\" over the 4 years that this brewer worked. But then the problems started. Just take a look at the videos and you will see what can go wrong. Once the problems start, they escalate and you start wasting k-cups, doing a variety of cleaning tasks in order to produce a cup and over time, the one-cup feature loses any value because you simply cannot produce a cup of coffee. The only solution is to buy a new brewer...well the performance of the old brewer certainly discouraged me from buying a new one, even at discount!"},{"rating":"1","title":"PRIME PRIME PRIME","review":"I had my original Keurig B-40 for years, not a single problem.

I am now on my third \\"upgrade\\" model B-70. Each and every one brews for a couple weeks then starts randomly throwing the PRIME message after a single cup.I don't care what Keurig says or anyone else, there is no other solution than to unplug the pot and let it cool down for 5 or 10 minutes, then plug it back in.So, I give up with upgrading, I am going to give Keurig one more shot by downgrading to the original model I had.

The design ensures a minimum of cleaning and avoids the usual need of coffeemakers to get a thorough cleaning to remove residual coffee acids and that make it bitter, also allowing each cup to be custom made , with many, many flavors, vendors, and blends available (so many, I cant ever remember which one I like the best). that said, it has a couple of issues. the coffee is pretty expensive, with the cheapest coming out to ~50 cents per cup, compared to ~25 cents for other single serving types and at least ten times regular drip coffee makers. I have also had its software get confused, requiring a cycle of the power, interesting that something as simple as making coffee can be complicated enough to require this (welcome to the 21st century) The only other missing feature is that it doesnt remember your last setting, so you have to push a few buttons to get it the way you want it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Keurig Model 677 coffee maker","review":"It was a christmas present, makes good coffee.

We called Keurig and they said return it for an exchange. I did and the new one one made (notice past tense) great coffee and now after a month it is making watery coffee. Why I don't know seems like a pretty basic operation. The one at my office works fine.Obviously there is a defect that causes the unit to make watery coffee.

(update) Not that bad.","review":"I didn't listen to everyones reviews or updates on this brewer. It was great.........while it lasted. 4 months later and it's dead.

Maybe I jumped the gun a little. I think the problem was when you use K-cups at altitude, they build pressure. If you stick the cup in the holder and just close the lid, the pressure release from puncturing the top, blows coffee back up through your brewer. My wife now puts the cup in and pushes it down to puncture the bottom first. We haven't had any of the issues we had before.

I had performed the maintenance ahead of schedule to prevent future problems, but that didn't help.It took a few calls to customer service to convince them that the unit was bad, but once they believed me, they replaced it quickly. The new one (less than two months old) has worked well, and I did notice a few changes between the old unit and the new unit. I'm hoping those changes fixed the problems.Funny thing is that there were no return instructions for the old unit.

Talking to owners of other models, they have not reported the same issue.While I love the convenience and the quality of the coffee, I can no longer recommend this model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke in less than 6 months","review":"I love the Keurig, but I need a coffee maker that will last a little longer than 6 months.I woke up this morning unable to make a cup of coffee, thanks Keurig.

Wrong. 3 stopped working within the warranty period and they were replaced by Keurig. No. 4 died this morning. It is out of warranty. The same thing happened to our daughter and son-in-law. They have had one replaced and the second one died 1 1/2 mos. after warranty. Keurig offered them a new brewer at 50% off retail. They opted to go with another brand. I am going back to a regular brewer. Good Bye Keurig. It is great while it works. Just hold your breath."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT RELIABLE!!!!","review":"I had mine for 18 months and it stopped brewing coffee. I used only bottled water and it stop putting out water. It stated to descale which I performed twice. Descaling did not fix it.Keurig said it was not repairable and they offered me a discount to buy another one. They want me to spend $80 on another coffeee pot that may not last.

In fact I still have it...thank god because this is the third time IN ONE YEAR that I have had to pull it out to replace my keurig. this thing is ridulous - I don't use it any more than I did my Tassimo. If Tassimo just added more options my Keurig would be in the garbage!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could Have Been A Real Nice Coffee Maker","review":"The product worked well for the first 6 months. Then the pump started to act up and either not start pumping to enter the brewing process or just shut the machine down. I purchased this from a third party and not thruough Amazon, which was a big mistake. They said that they (E & B Electronics) have a 30-day warranty and thats it. I called Kuerig and they basically told me it was the water I was using. The only water that this machine has seen is RO water. Is there any better, not in a standard residential kitchen. At a price point of 200 bucks you would think someone would back their product up. DO NOT PURCHASE A KUERIG SINGLE CUP BREWING SYSTEM WHATEVER MODEL. Great idea but cheap design and parts cause it to be the worst coffee maker I have ever owned."},{"rating":"1","title":"A piece of junk 3 times over","review":"My first B70 lasted 3 months and stopped pumping water. Keurig replacedd it with a new unit. That one lasted about a month and started shutting off in the middle of brewing. After 90 minutes with customer service and getting the third degree, keurig said we'll send you a new one, but if we don't receive the K-cup holder from that unit by mail within thirty days you will be charged for the repacement unit. A few days later I received a email saying they were out of inventory and it would take 2 weeks to arrive. The third unit finally arrived and guess what, after 2 days and 4 cups of coffee the pump stopped working. After reading all the bad reviews on amazon it appears Keurig has not attempted to fix the problem and just keeps sending out defective units and hoping for the best. I'll be calling today to try and get my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"First One Worked Much Better","review":"Like others on this site, I bought a Keurig B40 over two years ago. It only had one 7oz button choice. That Keurig is still working great and makes a great cup of coffee/tea. We bought the Keurig Elite last year, and we really don't like it. The coffee taste is just \\"off\\", and it often spurts and sputters, works slowly and then makes an insipid cup of coffee that is the wrong size. After buying 3 of them, throwing out one and returning the other 2, I think this 2nd B40 model has problems. Apparently the company is not making just the simple Keurig B40 with one 7 oz coffee button, so now we are going to try a mini in hopes that the simpler machine will perform like our first one. Good luck everyone. When you get one that works, you will love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"My mother first saw this machine at a doctor's office. I did the research and we both decided to get one. I have the B70 and she has the B60. We both love them. I love the variety of coffees and the option of making tea and cocoa as well. My husband used to make the coffee too strong for me. Now we both get our way. I didn't see any negatives except for refilling the water a lot and the vibrating noise the unit makes when it is heating the water. Many of my family members are in the process of buying one after they saw the way it works. If your in doubt, go for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Search is over!","review":"At home coffee search is complete. This thing is the way to go.

After 3 weeks it made only 2 oz cups no matter the setting. Replacement did the same thing after 3 months. The 3rd machine kept turning itself off mid brew after about 6 months. 4th machine will not suck any water after 14 months. It just says brewing....brewing ... brewing. The one positive is they keep sending me replacement machines with little argument. Just PLEASE improve the manufacturing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The machine is very short lived","review":"I bought this machine and used it for 18 months. Despite regular cleaning and descaling, the machine is broken and completely non-usable at this point. It won't brew anymore and keep asking to be descale even after multiple times of descale as recommended by the manufacturer. I will not recommend anyone to buy this machine. Keurig needs to work on this system a lot more to make it worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"This model seems to have a LOT of failure.","review":"I've had mine since 12-2010. It quit last week after a process of about a month of gradually cutting back on what it would brew and then just dumping the water back into the resevoir instead of through the K-cup. Very disapointed. I used it 3-4 times a week and that much use in a year shouldn't cause it to quit working. I've contacted the company but not sure they will do anything about it. I won't buy another until the reviews don't show this high rate of failure."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a piece of junk","review":"What a piece of junk! We have one of these at the office.

This machine is less than 2 weeks old and has quit working. Only draws water when it feels like it. (not very often) Constantly shuts itself off, and when it feels like brewing a cup it takes 10 minutes. I called customer service, and they jerked me around for several calls. They are finally sending out a replacement unit,but it has been over a week and still no unit. (they were much quicker to take my $170 when I bought it) To be honest, i really don't want the replacement.i think the product and the company are worthless.

We got my parents one for Christmas. The convenience is great, the coffee is great (especially if you get the reusable filters to cut down the cost of individual pods)...We loved it until our realtor couldn't meet us one morning... Apparently her Keurig was on as she was doing morning chores. Turns out the thing exploded and literally burned her entire home to the ground (because it was in a park area with no hydrants). The fire department told her \\"you have a solid case against the manufacturer\\". This was enough for us to stop using ours. Granted, millions of people own them with no problems, but it hit a little to close to home.Here's a link to a news story about it: http://74.125.47.132/search?q=cache:Fvd050arpT8J:www.cleveland.com/suncourier/news/index.ssf%3F/base/news-0/1235659290272110.xml%26coll%3D4+broadview+heights+house+fire&cd;=13&hl;=en&ct;=clnk&gl;=us"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Keurig B70 Gourmet Single-Cup Home Brewing Systemis just a disappointment.

It makes a decent tiny cup.Using the same size K cup to make a small to xlarge cup just doesn't work. The brewing time is the same, so if it drips more water through the same amount of grounds, how can you get the same strength for the large cup of coffee? I bought the Senseo Supreme and it's great.

My husband also has a similar one at work (the commercial B100? ). I read the reviews and thought I would give it a try. I was very disappointed in the coffee. It tasted very weak, even on its smallest brew size. Only the \\"extra bold\\" varieties were acceptable. The hot cocoa was a joke! The water does not have enough time with the beans to extract good coffee flavor. I feel that it is not worth trying every K cup out there to brew 6 oz of OK coffee. Cuz its really all about the coffee. If you don't love it, you'll be back to buying it at your favorite coffee place. Yes, perhaps I had a dud. But my gut is telling me that I will feel the same way if I got another unit. I really wanted to LOVE it. It makes a lot of sense for our family. I wish that it would have worked.

Oh, this is my 2nd Keurig too. First one died after about a year too. Can't say \\"you get what you pay for\\" because these are not cheap and should work longer than one year IMO. When I came home today, it was OFF and no way can I get it to turn back on again. I have been having some problems with small amounts of coffee brewing so I knew the end was near.

Making one cup at a time is perfect for me. I think overall the unit is good from a design stand point with a few minor gripes:1 - Power switch should be on side or somewhere more accessible.2 - Reservoir could be easier to remove - seems like I shouldn't need to tilt or should be easier to grab when removing and replacingHOWEVER, and this is a big one, it just doesn't seem like these things work for long. I've had two units and both have had issues pumping water. I'll need to get another.With that said, their service seems decent on the phone. They have long hours and are convenient to reach. Plus, they shipped a unit to me without having to ship old one back.We'll have to see how the third unit I get works and if it lasts."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's basically junk.","review":"I've had the machine just under 90 days. About once a week, it fails to brew and there's nothing you can do about it except unplug it and try again - and that often takes several tries and 20 minutes - and you'll need to reset the clock each time.Sometimes the device pumps water back into the reservoir. Sometimes it pumps water all over the counter. Since I've missed Amazon's window to return the damn thing, I'll keep using it until it completely fails, but then it's back to Melitta cone drip coffee for me.At $150 for the machine and .80 a cup for just OK coffee, this machine isn't worth the expense OR the trouble.

I will try another brand now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak coffee while it worked.","review":"The pump died in my B70 a little over a year into operation. As with other reviewers I discovered that this seems to be a trend with this manufacturer. Beyond that I often found the coffee weak in flavor and would end up using extra bold cups to match the regular flavor one might find in regular coffee at a coffee shop. The reviews on this coffee maker say it all, while there is a large amount of five star reviews there is a considerable amount of unhappy customers. Based on reviews as of today over 26% of people who bought this machine gave it a one or two star review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scored big on a used B-70","review":"I was hoping that a gamble on a used machine would work out, but the result was more than satisfactory.

It turns on but will not dispense or suck up the water properly. Any machine that fails in 11 months is completely useless in my book. Especially a coffee machine that is sold for $160.

After 1 year I have the dreaded \\"Not Ready\\" indication that 1/3 of all other reviewers seem to have. The pump will not draw water from the reservoir, then turns off by itself. It is not operator error, just terrible reliability. I used the coffee maker once a day with filtered water only to prevent scale.

We've returned each one for a new one to Costco, who have told us that they have had a ridiculous number of returns (on the previous one the woman told me it was the third one she'd taken back that day!).Wonderful machine when it works, but this is ridiculous. If this one dies also, we'll try and get through our remaining K-cups and then give up on Keurig.UPDATE: 8/11/11 Just returned the fourth Keurig, as it quit working altogether, and this time did not purchase another.

It is taller, and it does allow more space than an average coffee 16-20 oz to-go cup I typically find. I rummaged thru my cupboards and found one to fit. It worked out well.

Not kidding, I dont know how people can ignore this. There is also the big thrill of beeing able to shop for about a hundred different 'crappy' flavors.The final straw is that they are cheaply made (like most everything these days) in China and expect it to last about a year or so.

My husband, who is very handy, took the machine apart to see what was wrong with it and he found faulty celluloids and rust on the inside of the machine. I called Keurig back and they said that while they understood my issue with their $170 coffee maker, even if I hadn't been out of warranty, taking it apart was a warranty breaker. Huh?

By the end of the 13th month it got more erratic until it stopped dispensing coffee at all. I followed all of the cleaning instructions, I used distilled water for making the coffee, and only used keurig cups in the machine. I expected more from a coffee maker that cost as much as this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over priced and poor quality","review":"The product lasted a little over one year before it stopped dispensing water. I typically use it for one cup of coffee a day at most. Customer service is worthless and has you clean needles and descaling over and over again to make you think you are accomplishing something. This thing is just a glorified water kettle. For the money buy some other product."},{"rating":"1","title":"PROBLEM BREWER...BEWARE","review":"There is a probblem with this model brewer. After a short amount of time the selonid leaks onto the air pump and transformer. This will shorten the life of this machine. You know it's going when it can only deliver 4oz or no coffe at all!The other problem is it must remain upright or water leaks back into selonoid and clogs it from opening..thus no coffee.AVOID THIS MODEL!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BigKitchen =big no no","review":"I ordered this product from BigKitchen on the 9th, and i recieved an email today telling me that they had a \\"data integrity issue\\" and were unable to give me the item at the price i agreed to pay for it.

Nothing against the product, just trying to let people know to stay away from BigKitchen"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bait & Switch?","review":"BigKitchen sold me this product and before they could fulfill their order they decided that I hadn't paid enough for it. They are blaiming a 'data integrity issue' for the price I purched this item and have offered me a coupon for 10% that expires in 5 days. Wow, thanks for that token. BigKitchen should honor the price they sold me this item. Watch out for the bait & switch that BigKitchen is doing to me!!! I'm sure if I paid a price higher than I could find elsewhere, they wouldn't give me the difference and would say, 'this is the price we both agreed to'. I say the same for BigKitchen.

Now, my kids aren't big coffee drinkers (3, 7 and 11), but they love the cocoa, apple cider and herbal teas. If you could set the temperature say, down to 150 or 160 degrees, it would be perfect! Otherwise, LOVE it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money if You Like Hot Coffee","review":"All the features and convenience of this brewer are great, except for the fact that it doesn't dispense a hot cup of coffee. I purchased 2 of them at the same time, one for my office and one for the kitchen. It's marketed to brew up to 192 degrees, the reason I upgraded from the mini brewer. After speaking with customer service I was told that 192 is the brewing temp (inside the tank) but it dispenses at around 170...into a ceramic mug and add a little milk or cream and you have a luke warm cup of coffee that has to be nuked for 40 seconds. I'm out $300. Don't want you to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"First received the Keurig platinum B70 in January of 2010. I am now on my 4th replacement. These pots are junk. The first 2 after a short time you could hear water running but would not pump so they kept shutting off. The third one started short cupping after having it a short period of time so they ran me through all that cleaning bit, descaling and running three cups water through it and it continued to do the same. Called them back and got a different person and they had me do the same stuff again. Finally they sent me a fourth one and now it take 3-5 minutes of listening to a quiet motor running and it will say brewing before anything happens. A great big expensive piece of junk. Do not buy. You are guaranteed to be sorry. Spend you money on a different brand. Would be a great pot if they kept working. I am tempted to send it back in pieces to keurig I am so frustrated with this. The longest one worked good for me for about 3 months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keurig b-70 Single cup home brewing system","review":"We like it.

Love it for a fast cup of coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after dozen uses","review":"I used the product about a dozen times, and then it would not work anymore. After contacting customer service, they stated it is because the water was sitting in the reservoir, and the unit was not descaled. I find this difficult to believe since it was used only a dozen times. In addition, our office had a Keurig unit for over 5 years, was used by 15 people every day, the unit was never descaled, and functioned just fine. The office is now on a second unit, has been in use for over a year by over 15 people, has never been descaled, and continues to brew just fine. I think they sold a defective unit, and were more interested in selling a new unit than fixing my personal unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning","review":"I just tossed in the garbage my less than 2 year old Keurig Brewer. This is the second one I owned and the second one that didn't last for more than two years. I should have heeded the negitive reviews I read on Amazon. The good reviews are from people who haven't had one for a longer period of time. I agree the brewer makes it very convienent to make coffee but they are not reliable over the long run. The brewer should last much longer than the ones I owned considering the cost of these brewers. Customer service offered a discount on another brewer but they couldn't come close to the price Kohls Department Store offers If less that two years of service is acceptable to you then go ahead and buy one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keurig coffee maker","review":"Very convenient.

The coffee maker made it just over a year before we started getting the, \\"Not ready\\" that I have recently found out about. Not only do we get the not ready but the machine will turn on by its self and start spitting water out now. The only option for this machine now is the trash. It was great while it lasted. Guess we got one of the better built ones as it made it a year before crapping out.Update - 1 Feb 11 - we attempted to contact Keurig customer service to find out if the machine could be fixed. After waiting a month for someone from Keurig to contact me, the machine stopped working all together and is now in the garbage. I have since bought my wife a Bosch Tassimo and she very pleased so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved it until it stopped working","review":"I used this coffee maker almost every day until it stopped working. It says it's brewing but nothing comes out or it brews a very small cup. I am out of the warranty period and I have not been able to receive any help from Keurig's customer service in how to repair the unit. I am very reluctant to buy a new one now that I have found that this is a big problem with the B70 and B60 units and Keurig is doing nothing to remedy the situation. For $200 it should last longer or at the very least be repairable through Keurig."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst product ever purchased.","review":"Keurig has a real problem! I liken their brewers to eight track tape players, sometimes it works but most of the time it doesn't. It constantly turns its self off. The top needle becomes dull and rips the foil causing grounds to back up into the system. The needle also gets clogged a lot. Please spend your money on a really good traditional coffee make that is reliable."},{"rating":"1","title":"ANOTHER DEFECTIVE B70!","review":"Count me as one frustrated Keurig B70 user. Bought mine at Costco about three months ago. Only use it to make one or two cups per day with highly filtered water from a Kinetico system. Two weeks ago I had the problem where the machine just hummed and no water or coffee came out. Called customer service (you have to call on off hours to get in reasonably quickly). They told me to do the de-clog and vinegar rinse thing.Did that, then a week later, I have the same problem with no water for tea or coffee coming through on the brew cycle. Called back, I'm told I'm getting a replacement. Hope it has more longevity than three months! When it works, it's great but so disappointing when you start trusting it every day for your morning coffee and you can't have any! Thank goodness I kept my little $20 Cuisinart 4 cupper. It takes forever but still makes a good cup of coffee in a pinch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I give it a lower rating?","review":"[...]These brewers only seem to last for maybe a year or so....I've gone through four of them and now the fourth one is having problems. I will NOT buy another one.Shame on me for giving Green Mountain (yes they are the ones behind Keurig) my money.I bought my first one from amazon which was replaced by keurig, when that one failed they wouldn't replace it but I had 8 boxes of kcups (at $9/box - you do the math) - i bought another one from another retailer - that failed after 10 months, yes they replaced it and now that one is having problems again...save your money buy a starbucks gift card or a french press."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very pricey for a disposable coffee brewer","review":"I bought this in May 2009 as a replacement for a B70 which died after 17 months of use.

I'm probably an idiot for giving it one more chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can you worship a coffee maker?","review":"I adore this coffee maker. No longer do I have to make a whole pot of coffee if I only want one cup. No longer do I have to have 2 coffee makers because my husband likes one kind of coffee and I like another.

That's my fault. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best coffee maker ever!","review":"I won't go on and on about how great this machine is, but you will not be disappointed. If you share my lack of enthusiasm to make coffee in the morning and just can't get it right, this machine is for you. Even if you can make coffee, you will truly appreciate this machine. I fell in love with the vending version years ago and bought the first model that Keurig put out. When I moved to the east coast for contract work, I bought this model for my house here. You might think the kcups are a little pricey but I still think it is a machine that just cannot be rivaled with other 'pod' or one cup dispensing machines."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!","review":"My co-worker and I bought this is a gift for our boss on Boss's day. He's the only one in the office that drinks coffee and we'd make a whole pot for him on the old coffeemaker only to throw more than half the pot away every day because he didn't drink it all.One of the other attorney's in the office had a Keurig and recommended it to us. The boss LOVES it. He likes that he is able to choose from a variety of coffees, and it makes a perfect cup each and every time. The gift was a hit!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It was great while it lasted....","review":"We loved our Keurig brewer for a few months while it worked. But then the problems started, as everyone else stated on this website. We lasted as long as we could, and thinking we may have gotten a lemon, we bought Keurig Brewer #2. More expensive than the first. We figured we'd go much longer with it than the first one (which lasted about 2 years off and on). We were foolish to think this. The Keurig Platinum lasted us less than a year. I de-scaled it until the cows came home, I gave it the \\"love tap\\" like many suggested, I even removed the bottom of the unit, blew out the air valve, and sealed her back up. To no avail. I will not be buying Keurig #3. Time to move on. It was wonderful and convenient while it lasted. But just too expensive to keep trying to make it work."},{"rating":"1","title":"1-year limited warranty; Mine die at 1 year 20 days...","review":"K cups are roughly $0.50.

Think about all the money ,they make off the K cups. Too bad we use the adaptor to use our own coffee.

I called Keurig after the last one failed and they wanted me to wait 10 days for a new unit; I told them to stuff it! After I finish using all the previously purchased pods with my new unit, I am finished with Keurigs. It is not worth the aggravation of my wife waking me up to tell me the machine is not working.

My husband french-presses Starbucks for us every morning, which, if you are a \\"french-presser\\" you know you just can't get a better cup of coffee---but it has its limits in terms variety and flexibility and takes a good amount of effort. We wanted the machine so we could have more variety and have a cup whenever we felt like it without the hassle. We are so glad we went for the \\"upgrade\\" and got the B-70. It is so sleek. They suggest keeping the power on at all times so it is ready to go. It literally takes 30 seconds and its ready to sip! It takes me longer than that to choose which mug to use! ;)We are hoping Starbucks gets on board and starts making K-Cups---but until then, we are going to use the \\"My K-Cup\\" filter.

And the K cup system is great.However, this B70 sounds and feels like it's grinding coffee. Every time one brews a cup of coffee, the machine vibrates before and after the cup is filled. If I leave a spoon on the drip plate, it will vibrate off. I've tried placing the B70 on various vibration absorbing materials, but it doesn't help. I've spoke with Keurig customer service twice, and they tell me this vibration is normal for the B70. I wish I could have seen it in action prior to purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"2nd Keurig that lasts less than a Year","review":"I have had 2 Keurig coffee brewers in the last 2 years. Neither one has made it one year. Considering the investment, I would think Keurig could make a brewer that lasts past the warranty period.

When they replaced the first coffee brewer under warranty, we were told that they would not replace this one if we had any problems. I will contact them regardless. By the way, I have followed all of the instructions to de-scale (even though it was not time to do so and we don't have hard water) and have cleaned the water resevoir, etc. I only use filtered water anyway.

I performed regular descaling about every two to three months and cleaned the needles/screens every few weeks. I'm an old electronic tech so this morning I pulled out my tools and a multi and discovered the pump was receiving dc voltage but it was not turning when triggered.

It started short-cupping me, so that I'd have to hit the brew button 3 times to make a cup of coffee. By the way, this started very shortly after one of my regular descaling procedures, so I don't think scale is the problem with my brewer, although the service people insist that it's a scale problem. Their thing to get you off the phone seems to be \\"You need to descale more often\\" and \\"You must use bottled water\\".The company does not seem to stand behind their product, and the only thing they can do now is give me $30 off a new brewer, $130 instead of $170, which I think is laughable.

I have made two cups of coffee with my own Starbucks coffee and both were very weak. I filled the filter cup with Decaf Expresso recommended by the manager at the Starbucks store which is bold, and I like a substantial cup of coffee, so I chose the default mug size and it was watery.

Also, the amount of coffee portioned out seems to vary even when using the same setting. Took it back and heard many others are having the same problem with the unit shutting off. Too bad. I'm going to give the second unit a chance because we like the concept...but the unit must be reliable. We'll look for other options if this one also fails.

Keurig replaced it at no charge. The trouble we have with our current one is the needle clogging. Several times a week, we have to unclog the needle using a paperclip (per Keurig's tech support) to get a cup of coffee. Descaling helps, but doesn't cure the clogging. We shake the cups before brewing and/or run a brew cycle with plain water to rinse any coffee grounds out,but it still clogs. We love the convenience of our Keurig, but for all the trouble we have had with these machines, these coffee makers are definitely not worth the expense. When this one dies, it will not be replaced. Our advice? Save yourself a headache and buy a grinder/brewer combo instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the B60 instead","review":"We bought this as an upgrade since it has more choices for brew size. Like many others, it quit working after a few months. Keurig customer service was no help. We went back to the B60 which has been reliable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works great for just over a year, then throwaway","review":"We have had this coffee maker for just over a year. Worked fine until just over a year. Then it died, does not push water out. Tried email and calling the Keurig support, absolutely worthless. Complete waste of time. For the price of this unit, I expect something that will last longer than the warranty time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Good Coffee...But It Broke Within A Month","review":"I absolutely LOVE this coffee maker. It's quick and easy to make a cup. It looks stylish. Only thing is it broke after a month. The machine automatically shuts itself off now as it's finishing making a cup. Good news is Keurig is very responsive and they're sending me a new one. Fingers crossed for better luck this time. Only other complaint would be the coffee doesn't get hot enough. Even at the highest temperature, it cools down very quickly so you have to drink up quick. All this said, I'd still buy it all over again. Great convenience (when it works) and good tasting coffee.UPDATE: While Keurig did send me a replacement machine, it was also shutting itself off within a week. The phone rep actually admitted they had a bad batch of machines and were trying to rectify the issue. I had to downgrade the review here since this is clearly a defective product. It's quite unfortunate considering the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Keurig Quit working","review":"I had heard good things about your coffee maker and talked my husband into spending $139.00 for this item in December 2010.

While it was working it was great not it is worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money...","review":"I shopped around and read reviews about several of the single cup brewing systems on the market. After much deliberation I decided on the Keurig B70 Platinum system. On Monday of the next week I started using the machine and it was dead by Friday morning. The screen says ready to brew but it will not brew a cup of coffee. It makes a lot of noise, but only a few drips of water come out. I called customer service and they stated the pump used in this model has been known to cause problems. They no longer repair/fix the machine but they would replace it if I wanted to pay for shipping (both ways) and a possible fee to diagnose the problem. Obviously I do not think I should have to pay anything to have a [...] system replaced after less than a week of use. Save your money....this model has several known issues. Buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Cup of Coffee!","review":"I am editing this review - I really liked these coffee makers - they just don't last. I've had two and both have died within a year. I wouldn't purchase again.I purchased this brewer after having the B60 at my office. This brewer makes a fabulous cup of coffee, in silence. If you're researching on whether to buy the B60 or B70 .. spring for the $30 more in price. The B60 is very loud and the B70 is nice and quiet.It's just such a pleasure to be able to accommodate everyone's individual tastes of flavored coffee, tea, hot chocolate, a mild blend or a bold blend without having to brew a separate pot of coffee or have tea kettles. This brewer even has an iced drink setting. I haven't tried it yet, but I think it's going to be awesome this summer.There are many, many different K-Cups to try. It's difficult to choose so you need to keep a list of what you like from the samples they send you with the brewer.Happy brewing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good coffee terrible machine","review":"We are on our third B-70 in two and half years. I regret having ever recommended this coffee system to friends and family. Our household brews about 6 cups a day, after about six months the machine would start making short cups after another couple of months the machine just stopped working. We cleaned our second and third machine twice a month and still had the same problem. Of the dozen friends and family that purched or received as a gift from us a B-70, everyone is on at least their second some on their third machine. While it does make very good coffee having to replace a the machine every 8 months is very annoying. We have gone back to brewing coffee the old fashion drip way. It's cheaper and we don't have to feel guilty about throwing those little plastic coffee pods."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not reliable","review":"What a great cup of coffee!!!! That is, when it works which is getting worse each day. One day it will deliver a nice cup of coffee - the next it will churn and grind and either deliver a partial cup or a few drops. I use only distilled water and have followed the descaling instructions. And of course, the warranty has just expired. This seems to be a common problem as it has also happened to several friends. I would not recommend this to anyone. I would've given it a one star but it did provide about a year of good coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought two - both quit in about a year","review":"I use this at my office so it is very convenient.

It started giving small amounts of water, then stopped giving water entirely. I read articles on the internet and it appeared that the air pump that pushes the hot water out of the heating tub was what failed. I dismantled the machine enough to get the air pump out. It was totally seized due to rust. I did not take the Keurig apart enough to find out what was leaking onto the motor. I think it was the solenoid. POOR POOR design. Nearly impossible to service. Parts not available if you did want to service it. I don't know what brand is better, but this one should be avoided."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful idea but short on delivery","review":"I bought my Keurig B-70 in Jan of 2010. Within the first week, the water would not refill from the reservoir. The customer service replaced the machine, but the 2nd one failed to refill as well after couple of weeks of use. I am on my 4th machine within the year, but I've learned to make it work by removing the reservoir and slamming it down when it doesn't refill. However, now from time to time, the machine stops making coffee even though it says it is brewing. I love the fresh coffee it makes with every cup, but it isn't without some frustration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice....Other than its tendency to break!!!","review":"We're on our second \\"Platinum\\" coffee maker. The first stopped brewing after nearly a year. The company was great with a replacement, especially considering we no longer had the receipt. We did, however register the machine after its purchase. Unfortunately, the replacement has failed and apparently in the same manner as the first one. It shows \\"Brewing\\" but it isn't, and no water will pump. Others have had the same failure on these machines, also. I have a lot of K-Cups laying around, so maybe I'll try another brand. Unfortunately, I've read some of them have \\"water pumping\\" issues, too. Hard to recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor reliability of this coffeemachine","review":"Purchased this coffee machine in 2008. One year after (one use per day), got the pump to die.Unit had been replaced under warranty by KeurigOne year after, this unit failed again (pump)This time Keurig did not provide me with a replacement unit (whereas the replacement unit was supposed to have one year warranty)Conclusion: even when using the machine one time a day (not a lot!), pymp has a very poor reliability.Also, sometimes, it needed some reboot because the software had bug.Bad choice. I will not come back to Keurig."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for me!","review":"This is the perfect coffee brewer for me. I was so excited when single cup brewers started showing up on the market, but I had no idea which one to purchase. I don't like drinking stale coffee or reheating coffee and the mini 4-cup brewers don't make that great a pot of coffee. Going to the coffee stores is a VERY expensive cup of coffee even if it is quite good. I tried a cup of coffee from this brewer in a high end kitchen store and it was a great cup. Plus with all the drink options (reg, decaf, tea, hot choco), I was sold. I bought from Amazon on a special purchase deal and got the My K-Cup for free.I love this brewer. I get one perfect fresh, hot cup of tea, coffee, or cocoa every time. There is very little waiting and no filters or pots to mess with. The different cup sizes, the timer, the style are all great features."},{"rating":"1","title":"What good is it if it breaks in a few weeks?","review":"This coffee brewing system as a serious design flaw. The pump stops working after a while and stops pumping water. It says \\"brewing\\" but nothing comes out. There is no excuse for this happening as I use nothing but filtered water.My coffee machine broke after 3 months, as the pump stopped working. It says \\"brewing\\" but no water comes out! I bought a new machine to replace it thinking it was a fluke and after only 5 cups of coffee the exact same problem. For the amount of money they charge for this, this company should be ASHAMED to make such a poor quality product that breaks so easily. This really makes me wonder who exactly it is that writes all these glowing reviews for this product as this is clearly a problem with this machine that still remains unresolved. Do not buy this machine unless you don't mind paying this kind of money for a fancy brewing system that works for a few weeks or a couple of months."},{"rating":"1","title":"b70 Don't waste your $$$-Major engineering flaws","review":"I'm on my 2nd Keurig B70 unit in 2 months.

The pumps evidently are either badly designed or shoddily made, because they simply quit putting hot water through the K-cup. (No, there is no blockage. That's the first thing we checked.) Both units have gone back to Costco for a refund. Bottom line is - DON'T BUY THESE unless you want to roll the dice, hoping to get a good one.

After cycling power it would sometimes start making the right size for a while again. A few months later it stopped making coffee altogether. It seems like the pump is broken. It makes fine coffee, there are lots of great choices in k-cups, but this is my second Keurig and they both failed prematurely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Coffee when the brewing system works","review":"We love this coffeemaker. It makes delicious coffee quikly. Depending on the situation, I enjoy the donut shop and breakfast blends.In our experience, the coffeemaker fails at an alarming rate. We went through three of them in a matter of weeks. Fortunately, the service department was helpful in acquiring a new one when the old one failed. The old ones were a few days to a few weeks old when they died.The fourth coffeemaker lasted some time. It could have been 5 months. To our dismay, it failed recently.We want a coffeemaker with some build quality that last. We might consider the Breville version of the coffee maker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of trash","review":"My brewer turns off after each cup and sometimes only brews a partial cup. I've gone through every troubleshooting trick with the customer service people. They are very polite, but clearly read from a script and don't have much technical knowledge beyond that. They offered me a coupon for free Kcups, which would come in handy if I had a brewer that worked properly! There are dozens of similar complaints on the QVC website from where I purchased my brewer. I notified them of such, but that doesn't get very far. It sounds like some machines work well, but there are a bunch of lemons out there. I would just say Buyer beware, and make sure you save your packaging materials for at least 9 months as this was when mine kicked the bucket."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy different model or different brand all together","review":"The first one I bought was completely defective so sent it back. The second one they shipped was partially defective (although it lasted about 9months before it started leaking from the bottom and filling espresso size cups when putting it on large cup setting). Don't get this model because it seems they rolled it out a year or so ago without making sure it was built properly and before fixing the flaws. I know different people that have the cheaper models which doesn't look as fancy and they never have any problems with clogging, leaking, etc. and they've been using theirs for a lot longer than I have.

We even bought the re-usable K-Cup filter and used my coffee that is wonderful and it still tastes like rotten horse piss. Needless to say the thing is going back and not worth the price. I also did some research on the web and found it is not the most environmentally friendly device either. The little cups are not recyclable because of the type of plastic. If you are thinking about buying one of these save yourself the $$$ and headache.My advise is look the other direction if you are considering one of these.

I also emailed the manufacturer (several times) for a price break on 10-20 machines of another model with better reviews, they ignored all my emails!

Now, having used this machine for 6 months, I found that I am throwing out so many plastic packages. So, I bought re-usable coffee filter, but it was just messy and the coffee was not that great. And all the convenience is gone. You might better use the normal brew coffee machine that use a single sheet filter.There is an another option of using K-cup pod maker, which I haven't tried. But then again, you have to go through making pods by yourself, which may not be an option for the poeple who just want convenience.Unless each k-cup is being made recyclable, wasting plastics for each cup of coffee is a wrong thing to do, especially when we have many ways of coffee making without hampering our environment.

The coffees themselves are marginal and expensive to use. When I used my own coffee the coffee holder is too small to hold enough coffee for the larger cup.

Stolen Kisses, a continuation of the Antoine Doinel character, could possibly qualify as one of the worst (okay, a bit of an exaggeration, but it is bad). Truffaut obviously decided to go for a farcical Antoine, which proved to be a big, big mistake. Antoine is no longer that edgy, rebellious character struggling with the constraints imposed by authority. Remember how he reacted when he got slapped in the face? Very little reaction, which was perfect and believable. In Kisses, you have an Antoine who is more fawning than stoic, more mimicking than reserved. The result is this viewer's disappointment. In addition, the plot is haphazard, breezy, and meaningless. The ending is forgettable, in complete contrast to that of The 400 Blows.

It's worse than Megalon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the most silly movies ever","review":"The delivery was fast and excellent, but the movie in itself was really goofy and silly and imature. Can be fun to watch on that account-maybe."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't get worse than this","review":"Oh yea, this is a winner. gamera travels to an alien planet to battle a monster shaped like a knife, the fight scenes are so bad, there bad. that's it. You thought you've seen bad dubbing? wait till you see it here. liked the alien women though!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateurish","review":"Although some of the ideas have potential, this book is very amateurish. The adage \\"Never judge a book by its cover\\" did not hold true here. When i looked at the cover, my first impression was slightly negative. Then i browsed through the book. There are so many pictures completely out of focus! At first i thought my eyes were faltering, but that's not the case (quite yet). Go to page 61, 103, 106, even the photo of the author's son in the dedication! This should be unacceptable, especially in a book that tries to convey suggestions and ideas for projects in a visual way.I did not care much for the romantic quotes and new-agey messages interspersed among the pages. Some of the projects look interesting and i might even attempt to try a few of them. But in general, i was disappointed with the quality of the book and would recommend that you think twice before purchasing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best song is missing!","review":"Great, atmospheric soundtrack, truly haunting. My one major gripe is that they have every single track from the movie, even minor ones that play only momentarily, and yet they leave out my favorite one. The song that starts in quietly when Jack is watching the threesome through the binoculars and kicks in fully when it cuts to Sheri dancing for him. Such a great track and they didn't include it in the soundtrack. That track is what actually made me decide to finally spring for the album and is the only reason it doesn't get 5 stars from me. If anyone has that track or knows where it can be found that would be greatly appreciated!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for what I got it for!","review":"I purchased this to place 2 paintball guns in. A tippman 98 custom & a tippman a5. They both fit on the bottom level just perfectly. Placed the Removable foam layer on top of that then placed the hoppers for both in the middle & 1 20oz. co2 cannister on each side of the hoppers. When I close the lid it's a little tight but the foam depresses after a few moments & releives a bit of the pressure & settles in quite nicely. Absoloutely perfect for this purpose. Can't really comment on durability at this point seeing as I still have it in storage in my basement now, but for $[...] with shipping included even if it lasts a few years to and from the paintball course & storage I would be glad to get another. It seems very sturdy, I haven't tried to test it much but when I got it & tried squishing it together with my hands from a few different angles, not really much movement so I'm happy as can be with the purchase. Would definitely reccomend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent value","review":"This gun case holds a lot more then 4 guns. I put 6 guns 2 speed loaders, bb's pellets, and co2 cartridges in it and it held it secure. This is a pistal case not a travel case. My guns did not move one bit when I did transfer it from one place to another. The lock part, not so good but if your like me I don't leave my guns unintended, If they want you guns , they will take case and all. This is a good case for the price, I bought 2 of them they protect your guns and keeps them dry."},{"rating":"1","title":"No longer has diced pick-n-pluck foam","review":"I have about a dozen of these cases holding various pieces of camera and lighting gear. Nothing too heavy duty, but up until my last order of 2 more cases, they've always come with a thick inner foam panel made of diced pick-n-pluck foam. This made customizing the case interiors easy and very nice to create compartments where I wanted them. The last order came with the same good (cheap) cases and foam, but the 3rd foam panel is UNCUT, UNDICED, and thinner than before. Really frustrated by this change which wasn't documented anywhere before I re-ordered. Prior to this change, this was a 4-5 star product given it's price bracket"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pistol Case...","review":"Very nice case for the price... under $15. Pretty good locks and it's MADE IN AMERICA... This is not a luggage quality piece by any means but it's made here and it's only $15..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of space","review":"This holds both my pistols, extra clips, quick loaders, and laser sights with room to spare. Only issue is the latching mechanism is a little finicky and requires a little wiggling to get it to set right."},{"rating":"2","title":"This case is awesome for all sorts of things","review":"So the case itself is very strong, as well as the clips that hold it closed. It comes with more removable padding than even usable, which is awesome. I do not, however, use it for pistols, but for my Warhammer 40k miniatures. The vehicles, ranging from tanks, drops pods, to super heavies and trygons fit perfectly if you remove the unattached non-cartoned slab of foam. The minis don't move, and the case keeps them very, very secure. You can easily fit:2 dreadnoughts2 predators3 land speeders1 vindicatorand 2 rhinos insideAlso, you can take the non-cartoned foam and make customized troop holders, just as good as GW's holders!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than Average Case","review":"This case is alright. That is the best that I can say about it. It is very flimsy. I was expecting it to be a bit more durable...like the standard Plano tackle box. When the case is closed, it feels misaligned, as if it may come open at any minute. When the case is open, it's flimsiness is immediately evident. I would spend the money on something more rigid next time. It will serve it's purpose for the time being. Caveat emptor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Gun Case","review":"You can't beat this for the price. It securely holds 4 pistols, clips and shells. At a great price."},{"rating":"2","title":"It does hold four pistols","review":"While it does hold four pistols, it doesn't do much more than that. The middle layer of foam could stand to be much thicker, and the accessories I usually like to store with my handguns do not fit unless I remove a handgun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great purchase for the price!","review":"I rated 5 stars because it fulfills my need at an affordable price... I'm using it to store my airsoft pistols. It's very roomy (maybe a little too much space, because things do move around a bit when carried). Currently it's about full having 3 guns and 6 mags in there: mac10 (1 mag), 1911 (3 mags), and m9 (2 mags). I'm not so sure it would hold up to heavy duty abuse or real firearms as they are heavier.This leads me to my only complaint. For all Plano cases in general, make the foam a bit denser because heavier, skinnier guns (including accessories such as magazines) will slide around during transport and bang against each other.Overall, well worth the price... if you're looking for something heavier duty, you gotta shell out more money though."},{"rating":"2","title":"just what i wanted for my weapons","review":"i wanted a case that would hold all four of my pistols and extra clips as well. this is the perfect size and weight also, not too heavy or bulky. nice easily molded padding fits weapons perfectly and keeps them from sliding inside the case."},{"rating":"2","title":"High Quality Gun Case","review":"The Plano Four Pistol Case is a great case at an affordable price.I have two handguns,one placed on the top section with three magazines.The other gun placed on the bottom section with three magazines.The three layers of foam protects the guns from scratches and my guns stay in one place.I highly recommend this gun case!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"HIGH QUALITY","review":"Strong hinges and clasps. Rigid case body. Firm foam inserts. Made in the USA really makes a difference. I highly recommend these cases."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy and cannot lock it securely","review":"This box is flimsy which is in my expectation. It only has one off-center locking place which makes it impossible to lock it securely. For a box meant to store pistols, it should have a way to securely locking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plano Pistol (Reel?) Case","review":"The construction is everything you would expect from Plano, excellent hinges and rigidity. Plano makes one other case very similar to this one, but I have to wonder why anyone would buy it other than lack of research.Plano's reel case sports the exact dimensions as this case. In fact, they appear to be carbon copies of one another with the exceptions that it is tan instead of black and the foam is two-piece instead of three. I find this 2nd cavity quite useful for storing spare spools and spinning reel handles while not in use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good item for semi autos","review":"I just purchased one of these for my 1911 Semi Auto and Model 29 .44 magnum. The foam is too light to hold my semi auto or magazines in place. As soon as I picked up the case, my 1911 and magazines fell to the bottom. Since the Model 29 has a rather large cylinder, that does not seem to be a problem with my big revolver, but who has 4 hanguns without one of them being a semi auto? I do not recommend this case except maybe for large caliber revolvers. They decided to skimp on the foam and the result is a product that fails its most important task: protecting your handguns."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"I normally don't go discount, but decided to try this case...but its disappointing. The foam compression is such that my Ruger Mark III Competition and my Ed Brown .45 will not stay in place inside the case and move around inside. That makes the case all but worthless as a gun tote to the range. I gave it to my son for his paintball gear and am buying Pelican with plunk n' pick foam instead. This case is very basic, and offers only marginal protection. Skip it if you have nice firearms."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super durable and very high quality","review":"Very impressed with this case. I got it for my cousin so he could transport his pistols when needed and we are both very impressed with it. It's incredibly durable and you could easily slam it on the ground or up against a wall and besides maybe a scratch, nothing would happen to the box or it's contents. Also, the foam pads inside are very nice and very durable to accomodate most anything. I'd definitely recommend this. Very good product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nicer than I thought it would be!","review":"This case is very nice construction and should stand up to the years of use it will face for my son's airsoft pistol collection. It can actually fit like 6 of them in it. It arrived fast and was much nicer than I had expected. Don't hesitate to buy this case."},{"rating":"2","title":"As Expected From Plano","review":"I own several Plano cases and was not disappointed with this latest 1404 case. They are high quality with great lockable latches. The two layers of foam in this case makes it very versatile. Only reason I didn't give it 5 starts is because it would be nice if there was foam on the inside edges. If you have really heavy items in it, they slide to the bottom when you pick the case up. It would be nice to have foam on the bottom edges to protect those items when they move. Lighter items don't move but a fully loaded pistol or, in my case, 33 round Glock mags fully loaded tend to move. Other than that, great case for the money and well worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A cheap case with issues","review":"I picked this case up in order to fly several handguns home. I had to drill out the handle to accept a more substantial lock. I ended up using a brinks adjustable shackle lock straight through the handle. I loaded it up with 5 handguns in gun socks. TSA had no issue with the case as modified. It rolled out on the conveyor at my destination cracked completely through, bottom corner to case buckle and was missing a 1\\"x2\\" chunk out of the bottom at that location. Seeing how it failed I would not recommend this case for hard use, the plastic used is just too brittle and the lock location is a joke. Invest a bit more in a better case. Plano has replaced the damaged case at no charge, which says a lot about their customer service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be cheap.","review":"Unfortunately, this case is not designed for pistols (no matter how they designate it). Squirt guns, yes. Real guns, no. Not a bad looking case online, but a flimsy, non-secure choice for pistols. Is it worth the price? Sure, I guess. Is it worth buying to carry guns? Not if you are serious about your weapons. Don't be cheap like me. Pay the extra bucks and get a case made for guns. If you do buy this, I hope you intend to use it as your kid's lunch box. That's all it's good for. Happy shooting!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for 2-4 handguns!","review":"This case is perfect if you have more than one handgun that you want to travel with (as it is airline approved) or that you want to keep locked in your closet, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"need more foam","review":"This case is an absolute travesty. If you want to keep guns stored flat without ever lifting the case by it's handle it would be fine, but as soon as you pick up the case all your guns slide to the bottom and scrape against each other. Horrible, horrible, gun scratching, collectible destroying design. Ff the foam were just a bit thicker it would actuall HOLD guns in place. And heaven forbid you remove foam to pocket your guns in...that simply allows for more crash room in the case. 20 bucks going in the trash, OR another 20 for a second case just to have enough foam. Either way one case will be at the landfill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great... if you like your guns and mags in a pile...","review":"Cheap was what I was looking for, and unfortunately what I got. I figured it'd be inexpensive and a good value like other Plano cases I've bought for other purposes. I placed a couple of pistols and magazines in the case, closed it, picked it up and heard noise. Set it back down and opened it to find my pistols and magazines slouched to the hinge side of the case.Ok, so there is pick and pluck, but if you use that, you have only one layer, not the two advertised. Weak.I just bought a Seahorse instead, I've used that brand for my camera gear and trust it as much as Pelican."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for the price","review":"This case will hold a couple full sized pistols, several magazines, and a couple boxes of ammo. I would recommend this as a cheap multi pistol case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously?","review":"Seriously? $50 for a 50-page book? I just bought a Bourke's parrot, but it cost less than the book.

Unfortunately my good first impression came to an end. Despite every trick known to a computer geek and following Panasonic's instructions to the letter, I cannot get the camera to \\"talk\\" to my PC. Therefore the digital camera function is worthless to me now. Panasonic's product literature states the Windows 95/98/Me/2000 OS is required. I am using Windows XP. So I went to Panasonic's website to download the newest iteration of the software but that didn't solve the problem. I called Panasonic's customer service and despite numerous busy signals, finally reached a rep who was basically clueless. It might be the cable, but I don't want to buy a new one. I'd really like Panasonic to solve the problem!"},{"rating":"1","title":"camera doesn't work","review":"After I charged up the battery and attached it to the camcorder, turned it to camera and it was stuck in pause mode, couldn't figure out how to work the camcorder even with the instructions, I notified the seller and she promised she would get back to me after she looked into it.

Satch Plays Fats, The Summit Duke Ellington and Louis Armstrong, etc.This album is another one. Generally when you think of Krupa and Rich what comes to mind are showman with talent but who just bang away on solo's. In this album you see the real talent to play with the best like Dizzy and Jacquet.

In this case, you are actually DRILLING INTO THE WOOD!

It didn't take me much time to finish it as it's usually the case. This book is still good after all those years.Noel Cummings finds himself helplessly sucked into a very different life. Through it all, the reader can't help but to feel with Noel, forced by the police to be tbe bait -Lure- to capture Mr. X, the killer. To do so, he tries to find his way in New York's gay life, all along, trying to fit in.Fascinating to the last page.I remember that I liked \\"Like People in History\\" by Felice Picano before, and I didn't imagine that I'd read or like any other book by Mr. Picano. Guess what? I think this one is even better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Freaky Star Trek episode music?","review":"Contrary to what the one other person who reviewed this said, it does NOT sound anything at all like Latin American ethnic music. If you want that, scope out a CD called Flutes of the Andes.

Bad, bad, BAD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jewels of the Rainforest","review":"I have been wanting this book since I started raising dart frogs. The pictures are incredible!

The song are soooooooo boring. it's just like listening to cold play but even cold play being on drugs, because sometimes people don't do things as well when they're drunk or on drugs. So, if cold play was on drugs they would not play good music and they already suck and levy is like way worse than cold play so what that does that say about their music. It's just so bad. the guitar player needs to take more lessons, maybe from the lead guitar player from new found glory becuase he rocks. ok that's all.Jason Mitchell"},{"rating":"1","title":"Middle of the Road Mediocrity...","review":"With so many rip-off acts out there these days, Coldplay being one of the biggest offenders (in my opinion)... it's a shame to find a band that is copying off of a copier... Coldplay. That's not to say there aren't any original themes at all on this record, but the overtones of pop music riffs and subject matter dominate.The high point is the title track, Rotten Love, where they find a bit of success and find a sound of their own, to create a decent slow MOR ballad, perfect for mix radio or possibly even college radio listeners.A Coldplay fan would probably like this album, but I wouldn't recommend it for anyone searching for a bit of substance in their music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sentimental but cool stuff","review":"This album is really great, if you like Coldplay, Travis, Slowdive, Belle & Sebastian, and Doves. And it really is that derivative. But, that's cool. It's great stuff. Lots o' fun. There are songs that you can sing to. Songs you can rock out to. All very accessible. I'm looking forward to their next album already - actually, it already came out. So that's another album on my list I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Little Disappointed","review":"I was given this CD from my sister, who knows I love to dig into up and coming bands. I was not impressed. The only song I found to be fairly original, in at least the sound, was In the Woods, which I wouldn't list as the fulcrum this album turns on. The remainder of this album disappointed me with its appeal to emotion that was trying a little too hard (as is the style these days), hammering out repeated chords and vocals that have that familiar deep delicate sound. Now, I don't like Coldplay. I don't have any of their albums. I hate to say this, but it almost sounds like Levy is really trying to pull off some Coldplay covers. Make sure you listen to the samples before you buy this CD, because I'd hate for someone to accidently buy A Rush of Blood to the Head Part II."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pictures","review":"I saw this book at a friends house and just had to order it.

And I have to say I was really disappointed in both. There was so much potential for them both to be exciting as well as informative and musically captivating, but both fell short. Way short. The first was nothing but a bunch of kids riding up and down the streets all night long, obviously out of boredom, and only creating more boredom, to good music that was always too far in the background. The second movie followed them as they progressed into the 60s era, and this time in three or four separate and completely chopped up scenarios, and again with good 60s music that was not pronounced enough to bring back many memories to the viewer.I'm actually sorry I didn't just watch them on cable and forget them. Neither are movies I would want to watch again - unless I was having trouble sleeping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good movie, but a little disappointing!","review":"I have seen the first American Graffiti and I liked it! But this movie is just about the New Year's Eve in the 60's and Vietnam. It doesn't even compare with the first one. I thought it was going to be like more greasers and alot funnier. This movie wasn't even funny. It is still a great movie but it's nothing like the first. I got a little disappointed that Richard Dreyfuss wasn't in it. It was also hard trying to find Harrison Ford but he is in this one. Anyways I guess if you liked the first one you would like this one but not as much. The first one is the best.

Not much of anything","review":"More American Graffiti was exactly what I figured it would be.A movie made that doesn't break new ground, but instead uses it as a foundation to make money for the cast, crew,caterers, etc. Good for them, bad for most of us.I will admit I am sequel bigot\\" with a deep abiding resentment against exploiting an original ideal which was the classic \\"American Graffiti\\"I bought the second one so I could \\"have the complete set.\\"But the two don't make a set. The magic of the original is gone for the most part, great actors (Paul Lemat, Ron Howard) are going through the motions waiting for payday.

With few exceotions,avoid films with \\"2\\" or \\"More\\" in the title. \\"More American Graffiti\\" issimply more money for the producers."},{"rating":"2","title":"WELL MADE SEQUEL","review":"I gave this movie four stars out of five for one reason - Richard Dreyfus is not in it. Apparently after he received his oscar in 1977, he felt he should get more money for doing the sequel. This movie is different from the first. It does not take place in one night but on New Years Eve in four years (1964, 1965, 1966 & 1967). Director B.W.L. Norton wrote the screenplay, expanding it from the George Lucas's epilogue at the end of the first film. The film is dramatic, funny and depressing. That was indeed the 60's! The music selected for the film includes Diana Ross and the Supremes, Martha and the Vandellas, Aretha Franklin and the Doors. It is DIFFERENT from the first one but SEQUELS should be DIFFERENT. I'm hoping that Universal will release the movie on DVD soon and in the WIDESCREEN format too! The film was shot in Cinemascope (2.35:1) and flat four (1.85:1) aspect ratios as well as 16mm for the Vietnam war scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"More is less","review":"I hate to do this.As a lover of the original American Graffiti I had high hopes for this title.That having been said, More American Graffiti sucks like a Hoover & makes a mockery of the characters & themes from it's marvellous predecessor.Don't contaminate your fond memories of American Graffiti with this Dreck.Fair warning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Under-rated","review":"Although widely panned for lacking the same mood and style as the original American Graffiti, its hit predecessor, More American Graffiti is an entertaining movie that gives a sense of the transition from the security of the early 1960s to the unrest and uncertainty of the Flower Power era. Most significantly, the movie manages to create tension around the fates of John Milner and Terry the Toad, whose early demises were reported at the end of the first movie -- however, you expect it to happen, it won't.Although the original movie took place in a mythologized Modesto, California (despite being filmed in Petaluma and San Rafael), the city is not a character in More American Graffiti after the first appearance of Steve and Laurie's subdivision house. Action moves largely to the Bay Area, though the Bolander's conventional, middle-American relationship stands the test of 1960s strife fairly well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Double Feature","review":"Pretty entertaining stuff!

Even though the fault was mine, Panasonic doesn't seem to want you to have their products repaired, they would rather you buy another one, as the repair technician stated to me.

In a test I made, I could run about 2 sets of christmas lights for over 5 hours and in another set up, i run an Ipod plus speakers for almost 10 hours straight.

I tried calling xantrex to see why there are so many problems, but getting their customer service is impossible. When it works, it's great, but doesn't have nearly the operating time that it says.

Unit worked fine the first months and then summer came and didn't need it until the next fall. Unit worked a few times and then refused to take a charge. This seems to be a problem with this type of unit so first thing I would do is look at the warranty. If it is less then a year I would be suspicious. Some have a two year warranty. I would also suggest looking at the manuals on line, some like one Sears unit requires you to turn on a switch to enable the usb port. Strange thing is that this switch also turns on the jumper cables which I find a safety issue. Especially since the 12volt ports are hot all the time. Why not the usb?

One thing I use it for is when my power goes out I take it into the basement and with the DC to AC converter built in I power my sub pump so my basement doesn't flood. Usually when the power goes out it is raining or snowing so you def. need your sub pump. Overall works great, keeps its charge a long time and you can keep it charging constanty without worrying about reducing the life of te battery. If you need more power you can also hook the jumper cables up to another battery and there you go more battery power. A++ 28aH battery with AC-DC converter, small light and AM/FM radio built in.

The display function button also wouldn't toggle the display, so the battery charge % never showed. I am currently waiting for my third unit to arrive.Why did Amazon even start selling this lousy product? The quality control over at Xantrex is clearly dismal, if not nonexistant.

It is the classic account of Red October as told from the viewpoint of an \\"outsider\\" who identified with the Revolution as a member of the universal working class. However, it should not be forgotten that Louise Bryant was not only present as well but also wrote an account of her experiences. Six Red Months in Russia is the indispensable companion to Reed's work; the two should be read in tandem. As of the date of this posting (05.23.03) it is in print from Powell's Press.

His words paint pictures so vivid that I could smell the ale from the saloons, hear the laughter from the comrads, feel the salty sea air around Fulton's Fish Market, and tast the diner/coffeepot food. Mitchell succeeded in creating nothing less than magic in these stories. Each is so independant, but yet together they weave incredible tapestries.

He has said it. Why bother?This book is a collection of four books, including the classic Joe Gould's Secret (the last piece he ever wrote). He shows us what writing is meant to be: lyrical, poetic, filled with detail and observation, full of life about life full of meaning.The Rivermen, which details the life and times of Edgewater, New Jersey, is my favorite piece. It dodges and meanders, building a backdrop and developing some characters, and then WHAM, the meaning of life. I remember my wife asking me what the piece had been about, and I think my only clear response was: everything.He has style, and he also has meaning. His prose drives the reader toward his final sentence, and like Joyce he manages to leave the reader awed at his conclusions.

And in addition to describing places with attention and nuance, Mitchell is equally adept at bringing to life a cast of Old New York characters that range from a street preacher to a movie house ticket seller.In the end, Mitchell's greatest achievement is that he evokes a time and place like few works of nonfiction ever do.

Worth while.","review":"While not being even close to the greatest book I've ever read, The Giant, O'Brien was still very good. I'm glad I read it. Shows in depth the bad side of human nature, especially greed and pride. Definitely worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mistake for those interested in the history of medicine.","review":"I began the book knowing that it was primarily fiction not fact. However was very disappointed in the overwhelming \\"fantasy\\" nature of the novel. Somewhat shocked as well at the portaitures - necrophiliac misanthropes - of the Hunter brothers. Students of history look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Messy Misfire","review":"I wouldn't mind the fragmentary style (which even the book's defenders admit to), if the book had heart. But it doesn't. What it does have is a certain messiness and nastiness. And at the end, you think, \\"Well, what's the point?\\" The last line is good. Too bad the rest of the boook isn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking Description","review":"At first when I received this product I felt kind of stupid for buying something that only worked with a bike rack.

If you can get the thing onto your bike, it works great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed overall...spoiled by his great ones","review":"The gore, the language and the extremely confusing story made this a true disappointment for me after this exciting wait. I could not wait to get it and then really had to convince myself to even finish. I did read it to the bitter end hoping for a string to be pulled to make it all worthwhile. Alas! No string. Just a disturbing story that did not make it worthy to recommend in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I am an avid King reader and have read just about everything he has written. Like other readers who have reviewed this book I found myself unable to finish this one. A couple of the characters are interesting but they take a back seat to the characters that aren't and King's real strength, his ability to build suspense, is simply missing in this book altogether. You keep asking yourself, \\"when will this chapter end so we can get to something interesting?\\" Eventually, I gave up looking for something interesting and gave up the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another King Bomb","review":"I wish Stephen King would realize that he does his best writing in novellas and short stories and lay off the over-long novels which only fill pages. And please....try writing a novel with no children in it. Look back over King's novels and you'll find he seldom gets away from this ploy. How about his giving us a nice 300 pager full of adults and maybe then he might be scary again. By the time I read the last chapter I was hoping all of the characters would die and Mr. Gray would win. Perhaps he's killed his leg demons now and can try writing something less soul cleansing and more mature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dreamcatcher","review":"I was reccomended by a friend to read \\"Dreamcatcher\\". I had always known about Stephen King but never read one of his books. I can gladly say I was not disappointed. I can say I loved, I can say I liked it, then why do I give it four stars? It is confusing and childish at the times when the men were boys. Otherwise it was a beautifully crafted book filled with heart and horror. An interesting technique in this book is that it is written in third person but switches points of view from section to section, giving scenes depth that is not found in other books. I liked it but i would not reccomend it for a first time King reader. Try \\"The Shining\\", it is King at his finest with classic horror and genuine spookiness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why all the silly flatulence stuff? I don't get it.","review":"THis had everything to be a great book about the good old alien theme. But King blew it.The friendship between the five characters is very touching, I really enjoyed it. But the book keep coming back and forth, the Kurtz character is so cliched, the flatulence stuff is atrocious, the ending is disappointing. And there's noc lear explanation to what will happen. And it takes so LONG to finally understand (more or less) how the aliens operate, how the fungus work and why there's that canibal worm.But King is such a master writer that even so I found myself reading it fast and anxious to reach the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didnt even finish it","review":"This was the ABSOLUTE worst King book I have ever tried to read. I always finsh his books, even when he gets a little to long winded. I was so anxious to buy this book that I bought it the day it was available. I got half way through thinking OH MY GOSH this has got to turn the corner for the better. A few more pages and I gave up. This was the only King book i never have finished. When King's next book comes out, I will wait a few weeks and check out the reviews on amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe Stephen King Lost His Mind When He Was Hit By The Car.","review":"I could not take this book after 100 pages, this is not Stephen King as I know him. This may be his Worst Book every written, The language was really going over the edge, Not even Clancy went this far.

Grade: D-"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreamcatcher--more of a nightmare","review":"This books starts well but ends with a fizzle. Stephen King obviously lost interest in the book. This book doesn't begin to compare with Hearts in Atlantis or Bag of Bones. If I didn't know better, I would think it was written by someone else. I wouldn't recommend this profane, grotesque, absurd story to anyone. If you have read or listened to the excerpts, you've heard the best parts of the book. I lent the audiobook to two friends (Stephen King fans) and they each gave up listening after two tapes. Yes, it's that bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"T'is a pity","review":"I hate to say it but this book stank. Not that Mr. King's writing style is bad, I just suppose I want REAL EARTHBOUND SUPERNATURAL TERROR! Mr. King, leave the psycho and alien storylines alone please! I found myself quickly ripping thru the pages looking for a scare. Unfortunately, I found none."},{"rating":"1","title":"As boring as boring can be","review":"I guess I'll be the first to pan this monstrosity. The first two hundred pages weren't bad, not scary, not thrilling, but not good either. Then the book started to fall apart for me and continued to bore me until, for the first time ever reading a Stephen King novel (and I have read them all and loved most) - I STOPPED reading and gave up. I didn't care about the characters (a very poor imitation of \\"The Loser's Club\\"), I didn't care where the story was going - where did it go anyway? Big disappointment for me as I am a big fan of King's. Not since INSOMNIA have I hated one of his books so much. I found it boring, wandering, illogical, and very UN-scary. The theme has all been done and been done better. King was way off this time. Maybe that Waterman pen he used sprang a leak."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"Don't read this book even if the first 200 pages catches your attention. The rest of the book is drawn out, lacking energy and originality. The theme of \\"alien among us\\" is done to the death and this book offers nothing that can't be seen in other similar stories. Total waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"typical King","review":"I was a big fan of king up till the shining and since then he's just another get paid by the word hack.I got the loan of this book from a friend and spotted every single old idea of his that he's recycled hundreds of times over....The man just isn't scary and he's oh sooooo predictable. \\"HP Lovecraft\\". your mantle of the best horror writer this century remains unclaimed."},{"rating":"1","title":"King's worst one yet!","review":"Being a big fan of Stephen King, and having read nearly everything he's ever published, I picked up Dreamcatcher on the day it hit the bookstores. At almost 600 pages it looked to be good value for my money, but I'm warning every King fan who's contemplating buying this book: it's the worst one he's ever written. Take a heavy dose of Tommyknockers, add in a little It mixed with second-rate science fiction (that's trying to be a mix between Alien and Close Encounters of the Third Kind but fails miserably) and you have a very tired-feeling Stephen King novel. If you've read any of the above-mentioned books (or seen any of the films), don't buy this book. And if you haven't, don't do it anyway. Read The girl who loved Tom Gordon or Pet Sematary instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"great idea..horrible story","review":"I really like Mr. King. I have read nearly all his books, and devoured them all. But for some reason, this story just doesn't get off the ground. It has a great story idea, but no real direction and no real plot. I found myself dragging myself through the pages in hopes that it would get better. I have to say that I was extremely dissappointed in the story. Sorry horror fans, but this was a flop"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is Stephen King loosing it?","review":"I understand the author was not going through his best time when he wrote this book but I was very disapointed: the characters are not specially well developed (I hardly got to know any of them at all by the novel) and the aliens did not seem at all interesting, or scary, or fun even. Hope Black House brings back Mr. King as I formerly knew him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast moving sci fi horror.","review":"Stephen King is my hero. At least four of his books occupy my top ten list of best books of all time and he deserves every bit of the success he's garnered. DREAMCATCHER is one of the fastest moving books he's ever done. It is a gruesome tale of aliens among us and the military's take-no-prisoners response to them. But it is also the story of a friendship between a group of men and a boy with Down's Syndrome and their unique psychic bond. King pulls out all the stops with this book and along with his usual depth of character it is one of the most action packed books he's ever done. An exciting, and harrowing blend of sci fi and horror. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try the library first!","review":"I gave up on this book at page 124.It is coarse and the characters are not very interesting. The story seemed to be heading in the alien abduction direction, but I found I did not care enough about any of the characters to bother reading further to see what might happen. I have seen this book compared to \\"The Stand,\\" which was a very compelling read, and I cannot understand why unless a whole lot more happened beginning with page 125!If you have an interest in owning \\"Dreamcatcher,\\" I suggest you check a copy out at the library first to make sure it's something you want to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring As Hell","review":"I wish the man would just tell the damn story. I couldn't wait to get my hands on this book--bought it the first day it was available, made no week-end plans, announced that carry-out food only would be served for the following days while I plunged into the pleasure of a Stephen King. About halfway through the book I gave up--a major yawn and somewhat irritating to try to read. I imagine Hell to be a road trip with this book being on the tape deck."},{"rating":"1","title":"A $... Disappointment","review":"As a fan of Stephen King for over 20 years, I bought this bookwith high expectations but have been heartily disappointed by it. Across between \\"The Tommyknockers\\" and \\"Invasion of theBodysnatchers,\\" \\"Dreamcatcher\\" chronicles the tiredworld of ET's attempting to take over the world. Two-dimensionalcharacters do not help the story. I knew and cared about every singlecharacter in \\"The Stand\\" but I kept getting the relativelyfew characters in \\"Dreamcatcher\\" mixed up. Stephen King'sfascination with secret government operations is also gettingold.This book reads like a first draft and lacks the carefulcharacterizations and brilliant plots of books like \\"TheTalisman,\\" \\"The Shining\\", and so many of King's earlyworks. I do not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extreme Patience Needed...","review":"I love Steven King! This novel, however, was a disappointment. I could not wait for it to arrive and begin reading it. It started off great and then for about two hundred or more pages it really dragged on and on. I was determined to finish the book to the end but it took me a very long time to get to that point. I found it confusing and boring for two thirds of it; gripping and exciting for one third of it. The plot had so much more potential but something was definitely missing. I was delighted to see that Mr. King chose a young man with special needs to be the hero, that in itself was a great thing. Thank you for that Mr. King."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment.","review":"I have to say that when we got the advance copy of Dreamcatcher in the bookstore where I work, I could hardly wait to read it. I was truly excited that King was finally returning to his roots and his fans with supernatural horror, always his strong point. The size of the book didn't daunt me--I thought it would be 700 pages of greatness! Color me WRONG. I tried to like the book. I kept reading long after I lost interest and emotional involvement. But in the end, I had to quit 200 pages short of the end. I don't know how this book ends, so I can't ruin it for you. But I have to warn you--I don't CARE how this book ends. If you're a die-hard King fan, wait till it comes out in paperback, then it might be worth your money. But for now, just wait. And don't get too excited over it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for new King readers","review":"All of Mr. King's work's are good; some are better than others. DREAMCATCHER, unfortunately, goes in the \\"others\\" category. The story is complex, the references to earlier works (IT, TOMMYKNOCKERS) are plentiful to the point that a casual reader will think he's missed something. Still I enjoyed it (as I enjoy them all), but I would not recommend this as a place to start if you're not already a diehard King fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened?","review":"I think I have read just about every book by Stephen King and I will admit that sometimes his endings are lacking. But this book was ridiculous. I had no idea what the book was about. I mean I had an idea but it had one of the worst story line Ive ever seen. I just didnt see the point of the book. He should have cut it down and made a really short story of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"But the aliens are cool","review":"I'm judging this book having read it once, waited a year, and then read it again, and this book did not survive the journey well.Every plot twist was predicted, every villain was a stereotype, everything, everything in this book could be seen in advance or simply mirrored some other book or story, and served only as a pale imitation of the sources it copied. The only good thing in this book were the aliens. Sorry, better luck next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"An exceptional book from the king: can't finish it","review":"Being a very loyal Stephen King reader, as I started reading the book, I was very astonished that King published this book (you have the freedom to write, but this doesn't mean that you should publish it, right?) The story starts well, you think something good will come out of it, but even after a hundred pages -a lot of things happen but- nothing happens actually. After around 250 pages I could not go on reading any more, I pushed myself several times to move on, but it simply did not work at all, and then I realized that I actually don't care what is going to happen next, or what is going to happen in the end, and I don't care if they all die or survive, because I didn't have any feelings towards any one of the characters.Stephen King is the king of making people believe the unbelievable. But in this work he fails in putting \`unbelievable' things together to make a good story out of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get to the point, King!!!","review":"I was very excited to read the new King book, especially since this was supposed to be his big comeback to horror. However, with the exception of ONE scene in the book, NOTHING at all was terrifying. Not scary, not even a little creepy. King had 879 pages to work with and did nothing with them. Sure, the writing itself is good -- no one denies that. But he needed to get to the point a lot sooner. Master horror authors such as Bentley Little and Richard Laymon could have wrote this book much more effectively in less than half the space! He rambles on and on and on. Maybe the reason this book is so mediocre is that King's real-life car accident did permanent damage to his brain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dreamcatcher","review":"King's two primary strengths, those things that he does better than anyone, are showcased in this novel.His characterizations are exquisite. As usual, he bombards the reader with the characters when first introduced, staturating the pages with the flavor of the character while leaving plenty to plumb later as the story develops.In addition, King's voice rings through as clear as ever, like an old friend. I hated for the book to end because I wanted that voice to continue telling me about Duddits and the rest.Unfortunately, King's biggest weakness, in my opinion, is also a big part of this novel, namely his inability to bring his opus to a satisfactory conclusion. Of course, his endings never live up to the promise of the rest of the work but all in all, that's okay. Us King fans are used to it and the novel's charms make up for in spades."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trippy Alien Adventure","review":"This was a fun book. I will never look at Bacon the same way again. I listened to it on Audio, and toward the end I would drive my car around the block a few extra times just to hear some more of it. It really is a comfortable book, and unlike some of King's stuff, it has a triumphant ending. Jason F. Smith"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tommyknockers Part 2, with ZEST","review":"This books has some of the Maine elements but we are not all that wierd. There is darkness in rural Maine. But comapare these folks to Elise, the Maine heroine in Defenders of the Holy Grail. Elise surmounts her Maine situation, even her hunter husband. Well, King is a treasure, yes. This work is well done. King makes you afraid of the woods. To explore the other side of Maine, read Ken Agori's novel. Agori leaves you reflecting on the mysteries of the cross and true love. Both are excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a surprise","review":"I read, TommyKnockers, Thinner, Talisman (my favorite), and others by Stephen King I dont remember right now. I was expecting alot from this book. This book was nothing compared to his previous work I read. I found it boring, and confusing, some parts were not detailed enough, and why did he have to go describe exactly what EVERYBODY is thinking? Some of the characters were typical,and predictable. Most of all, I hate books that seem like they could become cheesy \\"made for tv\\" movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of Stephen King's best efforts...","review":"I bought this book hoping that it would be similar to \\"It\\" or \\"The Tommyknockers.\\" Unfortunately, it was very disappointing. The story started out well enough, and the flashbacks to youth were very Stephen King-esqe. Even the 4 adults were somewhat likeable, even with their flaws. The middle of the book was muddled, confused, and meandering. I can't explain why, or I'll be giving away too much. With the weak middle, weak overall plot, and basic confusing premise, the climax of the book ended up being unsatisfing as well...Skip this one unless you are a die hard Stephen King fan. This book will not make you a fan!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"RICHARD BACHMAN RETURNS??????","review":"Anyone you talk to will tell you that I am probably the biggest Stephen King fan they know; I love his writings!! HOWEVER, I was greatly disappointed in Dreamcatcher. I found it to be very dark and downright WEIRD (not to mention that the language was atrocious even for Stephen King!) much more reminiscent of Richard Bachman than the Stephen King we've come to know and love of recent years. It's my humble opinion that this book was SK's way of lashing out at all the pain he's suffered both mentally and physically since his accident. Want a good King novel??? Pass on Dreamcatcher and pick up THE TALISMAN --now THAT'S a story!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Sci-Fi Book","review":"I saw the preview for the movie last month and had to read the book ASAP. What a dissapointment. I was hoping for a good sci-fi book that at least explained something about the aliens. King cops out in the worst way in trying to explain where these creatures come from and why they come to earth. There are logical flaws so huge that really take away from the otherwise fine writing. You are left with an empty feeling at the end. Those who want to read the book for King's writing, go ahead, but those who like sci-fi, avoid like the plague."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dreamcatcher","review":"This is the first book I read from S. King. So I can't compare it to other books of this author. I wanted to read this book before the movie came out, so I did. The book tells the story of a four: Jonesy, Beaver, Pete and Hendry. Every year they take a short hunting vacation in a cabin deep in the woods.... Untill they get confronted with some thing from another planet!The story is a combination between the movies: Alien andX-files. The snow and the darkness in the woods adds a great dimension to the story.I don't really get scared from a book so for me it was more like an adventure tale. It's a great book to read in the fall or winter, 4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too weird","review":"I'm a big King fan and I think the man is a great storyteller BUT. I could not finish this book. The farts and body function descriptions went on and on and on in the beginning then I became so disinterested after the bathroom scene (which was great classic King) that I became confused about what was going on because my mind started to wonder and everything ran together and I didn't know where the characters were or who they were or what they were talking about..... It just could not hold my attention. I may try to read it some other time because I did pay for a hard copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read","review":"I was surprised to see all the negative reviews for this book. Although it started out slow, after the first hundred pages I could not put this book down. It's hard to believe that all 617 pages take place over the course of 36 hours. This is a great book and I reccommend anyone to pick it up and give it a chance. You will not be dissapointed. If not for the slow start, I would have given this book 5 stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stephen King is back","review":"It's nice to see Mr. King return to his roots.

I think the story was more of a psychosomatic vomiting relating to King's recent accident and sounded rather morphine tainted. It was like a fruit salad (parts and pieces) of his other stories and lacked it's ability to stand on it's own. Sometimes less is better, and even though I love a long read, \\"Dreamcatcher\\" needed to be downsized and rehabed into something a little clearer and crisper.Why have all of Stephen's books gotten progressively more infected with profanity? I'm not a prude, but knowing a million ways to rhyme the f-word and other crude language really doesn't captivate me.

I picked it up again last week and read it one more time with a bit more comprehension. But still, the aliens were straight out of Roswell...incredibly cliched.Remember the good ol' days of \\"Cujo\\" and the like? Even though those characters were flawed, they were real people!

The character's childhood friendships could have been developed more and I found the characters had no depth at all. I had to finish the book, but I felt like King forgot he already wrote \\"IT\\" and was trying to capture the same glory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely memorable...will read again","review":"Like most of Stephen King's work, DreamCatcher is a very original story that is hard to forget once you have finished. There are certain parts of the story that jump out and grab you. Stephen King has said in many ways,Dreamcatcher is a mean book. He's right...DreamCatcher goes for the jugular and doesnt hold back. Hands down, Dreamcatcher is flat out GROSS. This was one of those stories that made me feel sick and uncomfortable. Translation, Stephen King Delivers the Goods! Great bleak story from King Writimus Maximus. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Stephen King's Best","review":"Two years ago I saw this book at a bookstore with \\"The International Bestseller\\" printed on its cover. I bought the book, hoping it'd draw me into another world like many other Stephen King books have. But after 5 pages, I put it down because it was boring.Last week, I took the book from the bookshelf and forced myself to read it. There are a few fascinating bits within, like how Jonesy, Pete, Beaver and Henry met Duddits, but the book has generally been tedious to read (and I'm only halfway through).The massive amount of jumping back and forth through time is confusing. Some parts of the book just seem like rambling and fluff.I'm a Stephen King fan, but this book is a little disappointing. I'd recommend The Shining, The Bachman Books and IT to first time King readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Imaginative","review":"This book was probably the most creative King has ever written, with the most pyscological metaphors and interesting ideas.

After the first six chapters, the book was really boring me. If it weren't for the fact I had to write a book report on Dreamcatcher for my class, I would have quit reading it right away. A couple of parts were interesting, but the alien conflict was little to none. I guess you could say Stephen King caught the wrong dream to write about this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"The Dreamcatcher started out great! The pace was good, the content exciting and building and then BANG! Everything stopped dead and this book got boring, boring, boring. Plus, it made me feel bad. Usually King's books either excite, scare, or make you want to duck under the covers. This book just felt bad.The pace picked up some further on, but it really never got it's rhythm back. I usually can't put a Stephen King book down, this one took me a couple of weeks to finish. What a disappointment. Stephen....what were you thinking? It does have a certain feeling of the book \\"IT\\", a little Langoliers and a few other of his books. I felt like I was reading Stephen King's version of the movie \\"Aliens\\".

I was a little disappointed when I started this novel, like everyone else, I was anticipating another \\"It\\", or \\"Stand\\", but as I got into it(200 pgs. or so), I found that I was coming to know the characters, and getting involved in their lives. I love the King-isms of all his books and I just enjoyed being with him again through another story. True fans of King will like this book for that reason only. Anyone who hasn't read King, should not start with this novel; this is for true King lovers only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best at all!","review":"I have read every Stephen King book ever written and I couldn't wait to get my hands on this one. Well, what a let down this was. Dreamcatcher was not a good book in my opinion. The start was great but after a while you get the feeling the author was just making it drag out to get the 600 words. This story could have been done in 300 words, it would have been better. All up I was seriously disappointed. The story line was totally unbelievable and way too far fetched. I didn't like it and would not recommend this book. It wasn't in the slightest bit scary.

Each is having difficulties in their lives and look forward to the hunting trip. But this year, a man stumbles into their lives and the cabin, missing teeth and time and carrying a frightening parasite that not even he knows about.This is not King at his best, but as he wrote this book while recovering from his near-fatal car accident, it is wonderful that he has written again, period. The book is frightening and, at time, gross. There are flashes of King brilliance in this book, but a lot of the 700+ pages are taken up with sub-plots and routine stuff that could have been left out of the book. I rejoice that Mr. King is still around and still writing - and recommend this book only half-heartedly."},{"rating":"1","title":"My first disappointment...","review":"Sometimes it happens even to the #1 fan...It looks like king was trying to write a long episode of x files.And not quite comprehansive one.The story lose momentum as you past the first 60 pages. Even the attempt to tie the character with the dream catcher faild.Is this the same author of the stand and IT ?Does King become soft after the near death experience he had (i hope not)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Catch a Great Read","review":"I put off reading this novel for almost a year after I bought it. Shame on me. I was expecting a snoozer a la Bag of Bones. What I got was a book that took me back to the days of It, The Stand, and Needful Things.Mr. King tells us in the Afterword that he wrote this novel longhand rather than using a word processor. I think it made a difference. His love for the art of writing shows on each page. The rhythm and flow of the words are unforced and natural.Dreamcatcher is bravura storytelling. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"What a disappointment. Nothing like my favorite, The Green Mile. Dont waste your time. Boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm ready for another Dark Tower book","review":"SInce \\"IT\\" King has been very hit or miss. And this one is a miss. His worst book alongside \\"Insomnia\\". This one reminds me of \\"Bag of Bones\\" too. A 300 page story inflated to 600+ pages. There was some great writing but it lost me at about the 200 page mark. The stuff with the weasel-like parasites was great but once Kurtz showed up I became bored."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreamcatcher by Stephen King","review":"Having waited quite awhile since King's last release, I was elated when Dreamcatcher hit the bookstores. I read numerous reviews that praise it as a \\"masterpiece\\" and \\"a gripping title.\\" However compelling, the reviewers neglected to mention the vulgarity, bathroom humor, and cliched subplots that pepper the book's contents. Not only is the dialog extremely redundant, but the books references to the past experiences of the main characters are limited to a few short anecdotes which seem to be repeated every other page. Even the main plot of the book is relatively obscure, and throughout most of the book there is no sense of urgency that King is apparently trying to express. After reading this six hundred page book, I realize it could have been written with a third of those pages. When you do put this exciting thriller down, I hope it's in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately, it's one of King's worst","review":"It's too long, much too long, for the story. The characters are thinly drawn, the portrayal of Duddits is hopelessly sentimental, Kurtz is a stereotype and a cliche, the biology of the aliens makes little sense, nor does the connection between the four friends and Duddits (we never quite know just what Duddits has been doing, if anything) and it all has a hangdog, been-there-done-that feel. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"the dreamcatcher","review":"i didn't like the story at all iam not a big fan of scary moviesi felt that the book was very confusing it had you going back and forth from the past to present then back to the past again. i give the book one thumb down."},{"rating":"1","title":"DreamCatcher","review":"Stephen King is a great author. I felt like he should had written a better book. I watch his movies and stuff, but I can't read any books if his. This book started out with four close friends going back in their past to survive.

I wouldn't have read this book until someone special picked it out for the whole class.That's my personal reaction after I read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a bore!","review":"I love a good horror book & this was not it. This was a total waste of time. I had to force myself to finish it only so I would know what people are talking about. A book has to be really bad for me not to finish it. I found it really stupid with all the belching & flatulance although I imagine teens will really like that part of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"No!","review":"Sorry, but this book doesn't live up to the name of the author.In this work, King almost undermines the existence of extraterriatrals by vulgarizing their intelligence into some mass-produced weazel horror movie that has become so cliché.Probably written during one of King's bored periods...Only two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"OOPS","review":"I think Mr. King suffered brain damage in his recent accident. This novel starts out with a great idea and then becomes an un-readable jumble."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. King, have you no shame?","review":"Just curious, but, am I the only person who was offended by the repeated advertising in this book? There are at least five references to specific products such as a semi-popular bottled water, Napa or some such thing.Why do we need to be subjected to advertising while reading a Stephen King novel? Is he so financially strapped that he has to do that crap?I'm disappointed not only in how King took a storyline that is more than a cliche, wrote a bad book, but also had the gall to make us read ads throughout it as well.It is sad to see King use the same formula that he has used a number of times before, big threat to human existence, some gifted person or persons who may or may not be able to overcome the threat, one of whom is extra special, then, lo and behold, the world is saved. Does he use the same outline for these stories now?What do YOU think?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I expected more from King, much more","review":"I am an avid fan. I have read each and every book that King has written. This book was a TOTAL disappointment! I was so excited when I noticed his book in the bookstore. I purchased it immediately. Well, I can't get past the first 100 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it just me?","review":"I have read almost all of Mr. King's novels and liked most of them, but this one seems a little splattered. The premise, aliens in New England, seems interesting enough, but somewhere along the way, I kept losing interest, skipping ahead pages and not really caring what happened to most of the characters. I don't think this one is up the standard I associate with Steven King novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"A story that wasn't for me","review":"I consider myself a big King fan however this I will erase from my memory. I did find some parts of the book interested like the relationship of the friends, how they cared for Dudits and how they had all been friends for years. I loved the story until the guy with bad farts came along. I am not into aliens and do not find story lines along that nature very exciting but I thought King would pull it off. To me, it was just like any other Alien story... a bit more creative and gross but not anything I wanted to read. I didn't even finish the book because it was getting too ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"dreamcatcher","review":"IT WAS SAID IF YOU LIKE BAG OF BONES YOU WOULD LOVE DREAMCATCHER. WELL, I DO NOT AGREE. I READ BAG OF BONES IN A MATTER OF DAYS, IT HAS BEEN A MONTH AND I STILL CANNOT GET INTO DREAMCATCHER. IT IS VERY SLOW AND DOES NOT SEEM TO PICK UP ANYWHERE. NOT AMONG THE BEST KING BOOKS I HAVE READ."},{"rating":"2","title":"dreamcatcher","review":"This book is about four boys that have been friends since their childhood days. They acquired some special powers from a reterded boy called Duddits. Duddits is really an alien and he knew that an alien invasion was coming which is why he was preapring the boys for it.Twenty-five years later it becomes a battle to save the world. Fans of horror will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreamcatcher","review":"I have read a few Steven King novels, but this one just did not do it for me. I normally do not read novels dealing with Science Fiction, but it did sound a little interesting. After reading the first chapter I completely lost interest in it. After reading further, I disliked the book more and more. The book jumped around too much, I could not follow the content at times. In my opinion, King is an excellent writer, but this one was not one of his best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horror?","review":"In some funny way, this is absurd humor. Horror it ain't. Grasping at straws, it gets boring, so humorous it also ain't. So what's the point? I guess living up there in Maine, a body's got to do SOMETHING to while away the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"strange coincedences","review":"I enjoyed reading this book 30 days ago. Last night however I watched the movie Fallen starring Denzel Washington and noticed many peculiar similarities between the book, recently published, and the movie, released in 1998. Just some of these are an entity or spirit 'jumping' and possesing one human to another. Also both feature main characters named Jonesy. Both feature a Rolling Stones song as the main theme song. Both have key plot elements involving a remote woods cabin. Lesser likenesses include characters in both which have degress of mental retardation and both main characters use or consider suicide. Pure coincedence or something more? Read the book, then see the movie, in that order and decide for yourself. Peace Out"},{"rating":"2","title":"does anyone remember the tomyknockers?","review":"I SELDOM READ REVIEWS OF MR.

About half way through I almost gave up. It is hard to follow and sometimes you have no idea what he is talking about. The book started out great but, it's easy to get confused with all the characters and their thoughts. I am very disappointed as I always look forward to his next book. Maybe Mr. King should go more for quality instead of quantity."},{"rating":"1","title":"At 200 pages \\"Dreamcatcher\\" would be CLASSIC...","review":"Too bad it's over 600. This book becomes the most monotonous of Stephen King's career. I have read all of his novels, and this is one of his worst. The only thing that saves it from being THEE worst (that honor still belongs to the overrated Christine) is the first 200 pages, which are gory, over-the-top fun. The rest of the book comes off as both trite and pretentious, at the same time. The characters are developed fairly well in the first 200 pages, and then go no where. The character of Kurtz is the ultimate cliche, and having him sucking up a large part of the last 200 pages was a BIG mistake. The extended chase at the end is tedious, not at all frightening, and turns a novel that started out excellent into an absolute disaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"well below par","review":"I was very disappointed in the latest novel from MR. King. I found it way to long and convoluted. I wonder if he is being paid by the word. I also have this same problem with Tom Clancy's more recent works. In Mr. Kings case his best works were his earlier creations. The dreamcatcher for me was just a bad dream."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"Don't get me wrong, because I really enjoy Mr. King's books, but \\"Dreamcatcher\\" did not grab me.

I own most of his stuff and have been working on reading everything of his for years now. But this one just doesn't cut it for me. It's boring and hard to follow compared with his other stuff.

He has plenty of others that will blow your mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!!!","review":"This is the most boring book I have ever read.

This was the longest I have have waited for a product from amazon. I contacted customer service and I did not receive a reply. However I did get the item."},{"rating":"1","title":"what was he thinking?","review":"This book had the ability to be something truely amazing. With well rounded charactors and an enticing plot...and S**t weasels?!?! The story took a huge dive and pluged in to the territory of a horrid B-movie plot line. It had the feel of a split personality one side the chance to be a intelegent classic... and the other a freakish dead weight draging the story down in to the neither world of a bad read. I wish I had stopped reading before the downward plunge of plot so that i could still appricate the charators with out shuddering."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is confusing, boring and retro.","review":"I bought this book with great enthusiasm. The New York Times book review was great. But,in contrast, I found the novel to be confusing, boring and retro. Retro... It reminded me of the segment King was in in the first Tales from the Crypt movie. Remember King playing a red neck whose farm is hit by a space ship and then he drinks the water and turns into a giant topiary? As some of the other reviewers have stated, I also had to page back to try to find references to what I now was reading. This novel is a regurgatation for King. I await another Shawshank Redemption, Green Mile,The Stand. Mr. King, I love ya. But not this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"My last Steven King novel","review":"My only hope is that Steven King occasionally reads some of these reviews because if he did, he would notice a growing number of us who have become increasingly unhapphy with his work.My theory is that the author has an adversion to any form of editing. The result a 350 page novel that is bloated to almost 900 pages. Fortunately for the author, there are still a large number of die-hard fans who will always buy and praise anything he writes. I'm convinced that Steve King could publish the white pages of a large city phone book and not only his loyal fans buy it, they would also give it their customary 5 star rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"suspenseful","review":"For a alien type of novel by Stephen king it is very good , lenghtly on certain sections but overall it held your attention because you really wanted to know what happens and if anyone at all survive especially in Kings Novel with ending that is all way a SURPRISE."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book is far better than the movie...","review":"Dreamcatcher is not for everyone. But It surely is amazing. I've seen the movie as well and the book is far better. For starters, the book is able to paint a better picture for the reader, then the movie did on back stories. My only problem is how hollywood changed the story half way through. So that is one big reason why people should read this book. Another is that it has the same dedication to the way Mr. King plays on words as he did with some of his earlier work. All in all, for myself, it's a 4 out of 5 star review. The reason it doesn't have 5 stars? Not as gripping as some of his other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not King's best, but entertaining","review":"For me, this book probably ranks right about in the middle between King's best and worst books. It's entertaining, and you can get into the characters, but I guess the book is more of a \\"downer\\" than most of his. I won't say and spoil it for anybody.As far as the audiobook goes, the reader takes a little getting used to. He reads in kind of this matter-of-fact \\"Mr Rogers Neighborhood\\" kind of voice, which at first seems really odd given the subject matter. Eventually you get used to it though, and it's not so bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book with little minor flaws","review":"I enjoyed this book enough to be satisfied. But there were little things that keep it from a five-star review. First, while this is a plot to remember, in the middle of the book, it all gets confusing when King describes Jonesy's mind games with Mr. Gray. I had to at least read Chapter 11 and 12 three or four times to know what the heck was going on! The story starts off great, then it tumbles, and gets a push at the end when everything explains itself(especially with Duddits's ability). The ending of the main story is overall good, but the epilogue is one of the worst writing I've seen from King.Overall this is not King's best, although being King, that's not necessarily a bad thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Dreamcatcher","review":"I have read every book SK has ever written, and I must say, I was very disappointed in this book. The first few chapters, I thought, OK here we go...but about 1/3 of the way through the book, I became disenchanted. This book reminded me of the Tommyknockers, the one book of his that I was not to thrilled with either...I was very interested in the characters at first, but suddenly they are all mostly dead...this book flip flopped back and forth with little explanation. Unlike IT, which also flip flopped back and forth, but that was very easy to read. I felt this novel was NOT easy to read, and found myself skimming over too much, just because I did not care...which is very unlike me when I read a SK novel. Hopefully, the next one will be better !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreamcatcher is better than Unisom!","review":"First, I'm a hardcore Stephen King fan. The man is a great writer on many levels, especially his hurmor and sense of irony. But, this one doesn't make it. I think King is trying too hard to work through his emotions since he was hit by a van, and I understand that. However, in so doing he's created a story that is so jumbled it's hard to follow. And what's worse, it's hard to care about any of the characters. The story is all over the place, and one of the characters even has a near fatal run-in with a car. Plus, the four main characters, men who were friends since childhood, are too much like the kids in \\"Stand By Me.\\" I hope Mr. King can come to grips with his ordeal, and I wish him well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quality King.","review":"Like a previous reviewer, I nipped and nibbled at this book with only marginal enthusiasm that slowly diminished as I neared the end. The characters were more interesting as they each recalled their childhoods than they were as adults, meaning that the plot in the book's present time was not that exciting. Poor character developement for the antagonists is partially to blame, but I also feel the story could have been told in a series of at least three books that may have fleshed out several of the characters along with the overall story. Try reading some of King's older works instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"I thought it would be nice to read the book before going to see the movie. However, after reading the book, I do not want to see the movie at all. There are a lot of cheap thrills in the book...the play on bodily functions, while funny, is dull after awhile. Duddit's cancer and Down's Syndrome seem somewhat overly dramatic, like the book is trying too hard. Plus, by page 200, I cannot help but feel stupid for reading the book. Nothing in the book is fresh or imaginative. The emotions that are supposed to be stirred up are unconvincing and uninspiring. Although the plot is interesting enough for me to want to find out what happens at the end, I feel like I wasted a lot of time reading all 600+ pages of it when I finished it. If you are a Stephen King fan, this may satisfy you. However, if you are not a fan, don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Not So Grand Finale","review":"Avoid unless desperate for a Kingfix. This novel blows a gasket in the final \\"act.\\" Up until that point, I was hooked, especially after two hundred odd pages of a gripping chase sequence. But the long heralded return of the Duddits character, while moving, is also a major let down. King is one hell of a yarn spinner and sustains interest throughout, but tale's end is an abrupt fizzle, downgrading this into a routine X-FILES pastiche. DREAMCATCHER does not continue King's winning streak begun with BAG OF BONES and then THE GIRL WHO LOVED TOM GORDON. No worries, he's sure to get back into the groove in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sigh, I really had my hopes up","review":"I love Stephen King. I have read most of his work and I was really looking forward to adding this one to the list. Sadly this book is probably one of the worst ones ive read. I have actually been a fan of King's newer novels, but this is the first one were I am able to see the deterioration of his work. There was not a single point in this novel that I cared about any character. The plot not only has huge wholes but delivers a surprise ending that not only makes no real sense, but is contradicted many times in the novel itself. Dont waste your money on this book in hardcover. If you must read it wait for it to come out in paper back."},{"rating":"2","title":"DreamCatcher","review":"I thought the book DreamCatcher by Stephen King was an extremely interesting and well written novel. Despite the length it is certainly a book that many people should consider reading. The details and descriptions are awesome. It is certainly worth the time and once again it proves what a great writer Stephen King is."},{"rating":"2","title":"dreamcatcher review","review":"Dreamcatcher is a story of five men who have grown up together, pete, henrey, beav, jonsey and duddits. The four (besides duddits) have gone on a yearly hunting trip to main for the past 25 years. However this year a stranger comes into camp. Along with him comes military quarrantine, ANG, and undescribable forces inside their heads. These forces allow telepathy and other powers. Will the three remining men be able to stop the infection of the northeasts main water source? Read this book and find out for yourself and then tell your friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Book but not the Best","review":"Dreamcatcher was a good book but there were a few things i didnt like aboutit.I didnt like how Stephen King sometimes wrote like he was talking to himself.Sometimes i got so mixed up with it especially when he kept switching between past and present and what was happening at the Hole in the Wall and Duddits....Onthe upside it was a good book with lifelike characters and a really scary plot. It was one of Stephen Kings better books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dreamcatcher-4 stars","review":"Dreamcatcher is a very interesting and horrifying book. This is another story by Stephen King where he takes an ordinary event and makes it into a horror story. It is about four friends who are in Maine for their annual hunting trip. Suddenly, a stranger comes into their camp, lost and delirious. Then, the four friends are trapped with a creature from another world, and the only thing that can save them is their friendship. My favorite part was when the four boys save Duddits (a retarded kid) from bullies."},{"rating":"1","title":"A story patched together from previous works","review":"I've read nearly every King book written, and when I read this one, it was as if he cut and pasted old books together to build this story. There's aliens, like Tommyknockers; there's childhood friends who reunite as adults, like IT, et al; there's a child with disabilities who has an extraordinary mind, like Desperation; even the ending is eerily reminiscent of the ending to Needful Things. The list just goes on and on. If you like Stephen King and you don't mind that the utter lack of originality, go for it. But be warned: I bought it in hardcover and was left unsatisfied. If you need a King \\"fix,\\" I recommend one of his books from the 1970s - Firestarter, The Shining, Christine... they were original, interesting and eerie stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Stephen King REALLY write this?","review":"I love King books. I do. I was even given the complete uncut version of The Stand as a Valentines Day gift. But this book was (and there's no nice way to say this) utter crap. It didn't even seem like a King book. Maybe some parts did but the writing style was very odd. I do NOT recommend it, not even for die-hard King fans like myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"strap in for a fun ride","review":"Heeeyahh!!!! That's what i felt as I read this book. It's light. No great moral or message, but fun. And what's wrong with that? King has the ability in inject wicked emotion with abstact imagination and there are scenes in the Dreamcatcher that rank with his best: the escapade of the eggman, the bacon fest (ew!), and Jonesy's veiwing of Sympathy for the Grayboys; they reminded me of the Trash Can Man's trip to Vegas with the Kid--roaring with freaks and fun. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Is Not King At His Best","review":"This book is not King at his absolute best like \\"The Talisman\\", \\"Carrie\\", \\"Desperation\\". The plot is tightly woven as always, stays on the psychotic and narrow, like always, but there's something there that teases the reader. In this novel, King writes like a tired, exhausted writer, barely able to fashion the tip of his pencil into writing a word. Some of the passages seemed forced, like King was prying them out of his head with a dessert spoon! It just seemed remarkably unbelievable. This isn't new for King, but when a homicidal car started terrorizing people (\\"Christine\\"), I was a afraid of my Crown Vic's seatbelt, because he made me believe it. But with \\"Dreamcatcher\\", he failed."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a joke!","review":"After 30 years of writing, I guess Stephen's ideas are gone? \\"Hole in the Wall?\\" What is this... Sound's like Stephen wants to write westerns now! For a fresh taste in modern horror, I would suggest the new author Mark Ventimiglia.Mark is possibly the BEST KEPT SECRET OF MODERN HORROR FICTION! His imagination is gripping and his imagery, vivid! There are many stories in his book (THE RESIDENCE) that defy reality! There is a tale of a ring that eats its owners fingers; a story about a house that is possessed by a spirit of cockroaches and it makes a father whig out and slaughter his family using only sandpaper and a wire brush, there is an awsome Lovecraftian type of tale that vividly shows an innsmouth transformation, and a story about a declawed housecat that extracts vengence on its owner for declawing her. There are many other stories here too, and some poetry, as well as cool art work. What this author was thinking when he wrote these pieces is anyones guess! FANTASTIC!"},{"rating":"1","title":"could be stupidest book ever","review":"Predictable, boring, and above all STUPID. I love sci-fi horror even bad sci-fi horror. But let's get real. This is an unconvincing book that is a complete waste of time. The characters are predictable and stupid. After 15 minutes I found myself wanting to put the book down but had to read on (my bad). I found myself wondering who really wrote this? If it was King I was sure he must have alzheimers because he sure forgot how to write. The movie is even worse!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best effort!","review":"I much anticipated this book but am disappointed. I hope that Stephen King hasn't lost his touch!

I found myself rushing through this book to go onto the next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreamcatcher put me to sleep","review":"I am a Stephen King-a-holic. I buy everything as soon as it comes out... Even though there are few characters, I had trouble keeping up with them. Duddits speech patterns were annoying because I could never figure them out unless King translated. This is the only King book that I skipped over boring parts and had trouble reading to the end. I usually finish a good King book in a day or two but this took me a week because it wasn't good. I miss vintage King (The Stand, Salems Lot) those were good books. This one unfortunately, is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was co-written...","review":"Stephen king may have outlined the plot but it was not written totally by him. One of the \\"ghost writers\\" was English.I read the book but I am getting increasingly bored with the mass produced stuff. Tom Clancey is doing the same thing.

There are 20 CDs read by DeMunn! This is the longest story I've ever heard. I went through most of them on the road between Kansas City and St Louis. Though the reader may have to go back and forth in time with the development of the story, it's still manageble and will feel relaxed if heard from DeMunn, one of King's best storytelling, 'an actor of great skill and subtlety who knows that less is more especially when it comes to this book's ample blood, horror and ferocious little aliens'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't We Already Read This?","review":"I am a dedicated Stephen King fan, and I will continue to read his works even after reading this lackluster, disappointment of a novel. Despite my love for King's work, I found this book to be a giant letdown. Just as everyone says about this book, it IS a lousy combination of many great King novels. It's X-Files meets It meets Tommyknockers, without any of the excitement. I had to give it 2 stars, because King writes well as usual, but the plot and the actual story stink. I found myself not caring if the characters lived or died, and instead, simply hoping that the book would end soon. Unless you're a dedicated fan, don't waste your time with this, the worst novel in the King catalog."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth \\"Catching\\"","review":"Anything the guy writes appeals to me but this one just didn't seem to hold together. A lot of good ideas but none explored or exploited the way it could have been. Really a mish-mash in which King, himself, doesn't seem to know where the story is headed or why. Could have used a good editor, too.Black House is, so far, much more enjoyable but gosh, do I miss the King-days of \\"The Shining\\", \\"Dead Zone\\", etc., etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"His Worst","review":"Characters- one dimensional. Couldn't identify with any.Story- Kind of silly.Execution- Overlong and overblown.Readability- Very confusing at times. Flashbacks within flashbacks within flashbacks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give It Up King!!!","review":"Once again in Dreamcatcher King has delivered the literary equivalent of 5 pounds of horse manure in a ten pound bag. I used to love reading King but his last 5 books have proven to be a great disappointment.

Everything about this novel is good but the alien was joke. Only the alien that all that why i give 4 star out of five."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame","review":"The setup is by far the best part of this clumsy tale about friendship and aliens. I don't want to give away the plot, but I was hoping that the four (five) friends would stay together and their relationships would deepen. Instead, the story fragments and turns into a tangle of cliches.While King's trademark humor and descriptiveness are present (the reason it even gets 2 stars), and some of the characters are developed well (Jonesy, Henry, Duds), the whole thing reads like something you've read before, only flimsier, more rambling, and less compelling this time around.The Duddits character and the flashback scenes are worth saving. Too bad he couldn't have written a 400 page book and concentrated on that part, and left the little green men out of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"One word: BORING","review":"I had to force myself to get halfway through.

The book discription can mislid you to think there's a connection to \\"It\\" but it doesn't. the book is about dealing with the past and the present. the book is about a trip gone bad when everyting goes wrong. But in my opinion the book is about King's fighting his own demones. Like in every king's book you can find a character who resamble himself ,and here one of the characters had a resent accidant (like King) and by that his diffrent from everyone els on the planet (to know why you have to read the book , I hate spoilers). so if you want to read somthing more then the ordinary King's book. The reason i gave this just 4 star is that i hate aliens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sick, dull, and insulting","review":"Talk about a waste of paper!

Some fungus grows, and a evil/crazy army general runs around playing Rolling Stones tunes, and by the end you no longer care what the point was.I've seen the quality of Kings books as a downward slide after Salems' Lot, so guess this is sort of the literary version of \\"Freddy Got Fingered\\" In other words, it's so bad, sovile, and so poorly written that people are going to line up to throw more money into King's pockets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreamcatcher [UNABRIDGED]","review":"While not the WORST King has written, I hardly think that any comparison to \\"The Stand\\" is in order.

I loved all the characters (even Mt. Gray). I really half expected the men in the yellow raincoats or Roland to come in at the end and was somewhat disappointed when they didn't. Stephen King is one of the most talented writers of all time as far as I'm concerned. I only wish I didn't have to wait so long between books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to follow","review":"I enjoyed the parts of the book about the four friends and their strange powers, but once Kurtz and his crew came on board, it got hard to follow.

I thought this one felt a lot in tone and mood as The Tommyknockers, easily the weakest King novel of them all. The punch isn't really packed here, I'd expected more. The first 250 pages were the hardest to get through.I wouldn't compare this to IT. In a sense of scope, it is, but on the whole... I dunno.That multi-angled thingee could have been done sharper. This is just too blunt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Terrible!!","review":"As most Stephen King fans, I bought this book without following any suggestions,or reading any reviews---just because he is Stephen King. I began reading this book over 3 weeks ago, and I finally put it down yesterday because after 400 pages, I just didn't care to finish it.(I read the first 200 pages in a little over a day). Shame too, because \\"Dreamcatcher\\" began as such a promising story,written by the man who I attribute many hours of captivating reading. Not this time. Don't bother!"},{"rating":"1","title":"couldn't even finish it","review":"I am normally an avid Stephen King fan. I was terribly disappointed in this book. I had a hard time following the frequent jumps from point of view to point of view. Plus, I am not that big of a fan of the alien\\\\government conspiracy storyline. In my opinion, this was more cynical and more bitter than King's other works. He has written much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"therapy catcher","review":"Mr. King obviously has a little anger to work out. In the first three chapters of the book, three of the four main characters are in major car acccidents, depressed, suicidal and just plain angry. While most people pay for therapy, Mr. King has obviously discovered a way to foment his anger about the universe and car accidents by writing about his own personal experiences, thinly veiled by the fiction the publisher prints.But the real problem with the book is not the story, the unfairness of the universe or aliens bopping into Maine. The problem of the book is simply that it is an ugly book. Characters in the book display no beauty, speak in an unending stream of four letter words and provide laughs through sophomoric stunts of farting and belching.I truly thought \\"The Sixth Mile\\" was one of the most uplifting pieces I have read. But obviously, \\"Dreamcatcher has not caught the dreams of beauty and truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lot of recycled garbage ...","review":"For the first few pages I entertained the hope that SK might be back to something of his old form. However I soon noticed that no sooner had the story started to get interesting than King would switch away to another storyline, completely killing the suspense. The plot lacks originality and owes a great debt in particular to the Alien films. It is rambling and incoherent and I suspect that without the King name it would have never seen the light of day. He has managed the feat of writing a book which is way way too long yet failing to fill in many important details of the past which are hinted at all the way through the novel. The so-called plot twist at the end was just confusing and left me wondering why I bothered to finish the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long","review":"Why always so long. Good story with excellent ideas and some very well written elements. But seriously rambling in places. King seems to believe the quality of his books is proportionate to the length. Disagree."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only a true fan can finish this book","review":"This book is NOT one of S.K.'s best. He is still a master writer, however the flashbacks every five pages got a little annoying. As always the characters lept off the page, but the plot is left seriously wanting. Don't read this book unless you have major patience and time to kill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nowhere near \\" Stephen King at his best\\"","review":"After Bag of Bones and Hearts in Atlantis, I was hoping for a truly well written book. I know he is still capable as the Green Mile and Wizard and Glass have proven. So what is this? Not his worst book. Remember Tommyknockers or Needful Things? But certainly nowhere near his best work. There is some great dialogue and neat concepts in this book, but not enough to save it. Wait for the paperback edition and save some money if you really must read it. I will not buy another King book right after it has been released. I am that disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"cobbled together, it's a re-hash of earlier works","review":"I found that this book to be much like other books written by King, and it even mirrors King's apperance in the 80's film \\"Creepshow\\", in the segment where King himself plays a character who is reduced to the \\"Hemingway solution\\" when a certain green growth overtakes his person and house like kudzu after a meteor falls. (Sound familiar?) Certain elements from \\"Stand By Me\\" (the four childhood pals), \\"The Stand\\" (telepathy and the end-game plot) and of course, \\"TommyKnockers\\" (aliens who make your teeth fall out) are also re-hashed in this novel. I feel that Robert McCammon's \\"Stinger\\" is a better novel depicting human-to-alien transformations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreamcatcher Ho-Hum","review":"This is just one more of Stephen King's recent ramblings. It probably has a good plot, but the constant use of \\"shock-words\\" and vulgarities detracts from a good story. It is way too wordy and could have been written as a novelette such as \\"Thinner\\". All indications are that this may be my last Stephen King purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Capable of doing better!","review":"Stephen King is one of my top five favorite contemporary writers (along with John Irving, Richard Russo, Neil Gaiman, and Bruce Alexander, in case you're interested.) However, Dreamcatcher is one of my least favorite Stephen King novels. There are traces of the things that have made me a devoted SK reader, but they are scarce. Perhaps the best part of the novel is the character Duddits and the role he plays. A major weakness is the impression that much of the novel seemed to be written with Hollywood in mind. And while we have all reluctantly learned to expect grossness in SK novels, Dreamcatcher carries it to new extremes, and seriously hindered my ability to enjoy the novel. Don't expect anything approaching the greatness of The Stand or It or The Dark Tower series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreamcatcher not a dream","review":"Stephen King, the brilliant author of so many wonderful stories has so disappointed me with this book.

Not new territory for King, yet it felt as though he was taking chances, both with the bones of the story and the language he uses. There is one military character who drove me nuts, and I agree with the reviewer who reminded us that King isn't Tom Clancy. But I'll bet this character was fun to write. My advice to other readers: Read this book on its own merits and try not to compare it too much with King's other novels. As irrisistible as that might be, considering where Dreamcatcher takes place . . . and what it's about . . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninvolving, Disappointing","review":"I eagerly anticipated the new King book as I always do when one of his books comes out. Sadly, \\"Dreamcatcher\\" was just not up to par. The characters are fairly interesting, but like \\"Gerald's Game\\" and \\"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon\\" there just isn't enough to keep the reader interested.I felt that this book had a lot of potential, but was completely destroyed by rambling writing and tedious attempts to gross the reader out.There was so much more that he could have explored about aliens, but instead this book reads like a pale imitation of \\"the regulators\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of my least favorite King books","review":"I guess I am one of the minority of those who reviewed this book, but I didn't care for it at all. I have been reading King for 20 years, and while I have my favorites (The Stand, Christine, Pet Sematary) I have never before disliked one of his books. I was very disappointed in this effort by him.

Dreamcatcher was disappointing due to its tired \\"flashbacks\\" and lack of a moving plot. He's still a master of words and sentence structure, but he's lost his old \\"exciting plot\\" ability.

I read 150 pages of this book before growing bored and vaguely repulsed. If you enjoy numerous bloated, over-inflated descriptions of bodily functions (stinky burps and farts), you'll love this book. The characters were dull and poorly defined (I kept mixing them up), the pace was glacial, and the plot dull. And I generally love Stephen King. I think he wrote this as therapy, as one of the characters was recovering from a near-fatal car accident. But it wasn't very entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where am I?","review":"This book caught my attention the first 300 or so pages and then I was totally lost. What in the world!

I found it at a book sale for $1 so I figured I didn't have much to lose. I should have taken her word for it! I got up to about page 150 and I just had to put it away. The story just didn't seem to gel together and at the point I put it down a truly out-there thing had just happened in the story which I just couldn't buy into.I recently re-read Bag of Bones for the third time, also by Stephen King, and it was just light-years better than this book...don't waste your time with Dreamcatcher, read Bag of Bones instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"dont waste your time","review":"I have read almost all of stephen kings books and of all that i have read this is by far the worst.

I was upset when my hopes were dashed (for a while I even tried to convince myself that MAYBE Dreamcatcher was taking place in a parallel world, in which Jonesy is Big Bill's twinner...) Needless to say, this didn't work for long, and I eventually had to come to terms with reality: Dreamcatcher is not very good. What amazed me was that the prologue contains some of King's best writing (I can only assume that the prologue and the rest of the novel were written at separate times). My advice to you is this: read the prologue while enjoying a coffee at your nearest bookseller / cafe. Purchase something else, such as Hearts in Atlantis (which is, in my opinion, one of King's best!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of his best","review":"Any Stephen King fan would have to admit tha his past few novels, \\"Green Mile\\", \\"Bag Of Bones\\", and \\"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon\\" were a sort of renaissance for him. His writing and plotting were in peak form. Unfortunately, \\"Dreamcatcher\\" fails to keep the streak going. While it starts off fast and furious, it runs out of gas about halfway through. The plot threads seem to unravel at various times. Try as he might, King can't maintain the suspense. Part of the problem may be that he has returned to familiar territory with this novel, and many of his old tricks just don't trick anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful..just awful","review":"I looked forward to this book like crazy. It got off to a slow start then picked up and then it went right down hill again. I kept speed reading through some of the pages-something you should never do-but it was so bad.

I bought it as i have all of SK's books and will continue to buy them, sometimes he can suprise you. but let this one rot on the bookshelves. it will never go out of print, i mean Geralds Game is stll around (what a howler that one was).

Stephen King apparently wrote this while he was recovering from a car accident, and you can definitely tell from the 500 pages of incessant rambling that is a pathetic excuse for character development. The other 200 pages are actually used for good scary plot development, which is not much, but it prevented me from burning this damn thing. In this 700 page monster chalk full of gore and utterly repulsive images, I could sense a trace of good ideas smothered under meaningless words which is why i give this 2 stars instead of 1.

I reeked to much like some of his earlier works combined together. It just lacked some of his originality. One of the things I love about Stephen King is his character development.

I had heard both good and bad comments about this one, so I wasn't sure what I was in for. I was so amazed by the first hundred pages. The way in which we are introduced to our main characters is brilliant. The flashbacks to childhood days in Derry are well timed and never grow repetitive.What will stick with my are the suttle and not so suttle references to Conrad's Heart of Darkness, as well as Apocalypse Now. Imagine Conrad's amazement at the story of the Congo River becoming Vietnam, and now the Maine wilderness.If you haven't read this yet, as Duddits would say, \\"got some work to do now.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Stephen King or The X-Files?","review":"After reading over some of the reviews for this book, I noticed that everyone seems to be comparing it Tommyknockers. Dreamcatcher reminded me more of The X-Files. Ok X-Files fans lets see it this plot line sounds familiar. Aliens from space come to Earth to spread an intelligent virus so \\"it\\" can take over the planet. King did write an X-File story with Chris Carter a couple of years ago. Maybe Carters influence rubbed off a little more then he knew. But if you're going to borrow from your buddies at least do it with your own style, and that's what King has done. The book is written with Kings familiar characters, locations and dark since of humor. Thank you very much! This might not be one of his most thought provoking stories, like Apt Pupil or Hearts In Atlantis, but it's still a fun ride."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreamcatcher Gross Out","review":"I am an avid Stephan King fan and have read almost everything written by him and I thought this book was horrible. The initial story About the five friends is interesting but the description of the aliens being born out of people's butts is disgusting. I was so grossed out by the persistant description of flatulence accompanying the births too. This was also the most profane of his books with the F word on at least every page and the S word almost as much. It has too many unnecessary characters that are described in detail and then killed off 5 pages later. It was gory, gross, laden with profanity and mental plot lines that didn't make sense. Of course I did finish it being such a fan of his but I would not recommend anybody to waste their time reading this 600+ page book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I decided to love it","review":"I love stephen king. i have always tended to become very involved in his stories, i.e. stay up until the wee hours of the morning just to finish one more page........ anyway, for a while there i was starting to notice a big change in his writing, the way he depicted his characters, etc. i was disappointed to say the least because that was what drew me to his books.

I may even listen to it again, all 20 cd's."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time","review":"I found that I couldn't get more than 200 pages into this book. The book made no sense.

I read about them yelling and thinking, \\"f* this and f* that, and \\"dickweed this.\\" It just reminded me of a bunch of R-rated adolescent junk. Nothing intelligent seemed to come of the story line. I am ready to send the book back to the publisher and demand my money back. What a waste of time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many plots!","review":"Dreamcatcher has several good plots but it never brings them together into a cohesive whole. The first 80 pages were by far the best of the book, the rest rambles and jumps from story to story. This is novel that doesn't know what it is or what it wants. It could have been a great horror novel. It could have been a great novel about friendship. It just never delivers on the promise of that first 80 pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"great story","review":"An alien invasion is always a great story when it is well written. This is well written. But calling the story just a alien invasion is not doing King justice. This is the story of four friends that manage to always get together for an annual hunting trip and what happens to them when they are contacted by the aliens. Dreamcatcher is as much a psychological drama as it is a scifi novel. The are many layers to this story: the friends, the army, and one of the aliens(Mr. Gray). How the aliens control their victims is not much fun when you think about it. There is a twist when one of the controlled victims also can fight back against the alien in his own mind. This story reminds the reader of War of the Worlds, except without the saucers. The ending also remind me of the War of the Worlds. This is a good read and it is fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite SK Book","review":"I may be alone having this my FAVORITE,but i have only read a few other stephen king books such as MISERY,PET SEMATARY, and THE TALISMAN.This is about 4 friends going to woods somebody comes and then theres lots of aliens,then there is this evil army guy named Kurtz who wants to kill them,then they chase eachother around and stuff. Not such a big deal is it?

King's mastery of description and imagery make the 620 pages go by with ease. Personally, I didn't think King would wander into the realm of alien abductions and whatnot, but he does a better job than anyone else. I found myself looking over my shoulder more than once while reading this book. However, don't take my word for it...read it and experience it for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't finish it","review":"I really, truly wanted to love this book. I have been reading Stephen King since the late '70s and always look forward to anything new by him. I could only get through 300 pages before I just had to give up. I reached the point where there were three Jonesys and then I realised it was time to throw in the towel. King is best when he does straight horror and Sci-fi is not my favourite genre, but this book was kind of muddled and kept jumping all over the place. I think that this story would have benefited by being 200 pages less and not delving so deeply into the whole psychological thing. Anyway, I will continue reading Mr. King's books, but just can't really recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"To put it nicely....","review":"This book really stunk.

Surely the editor wouldn't have let him ramble on and on about snow, and trees, and oh-my-god the smell and sound of the bodily functions of these \\"people\\". I vowed that I would never again rush to the store to buy one of his books because they have been so diappointing, but I did this time because it was tauted as \\"a return to horror\\". I now once again vow to NEVER rush out to buy his books. The used bookstore will have plenty of his stinkers for 50 cents in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"First \\"King\\" book I regret buying!","review":"I have been reading Stephen King books since discovering \\"The Stand\\" at the age of 14. (over 20 years now) But this is the first one that I would even consider returning. I kept thinking that it would get better and it never did. While there were some good parts, there were certainly not enough. I just hope that this was a result of too much time since the last book and the ol' writing skills were a little rusty. I look forwarded to the next one. Everyone deserves a second chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recycle but Worth the Read for Die Hard Fans","review":"Is it a rehash? Yes. Is it good? Yes. To create write this book use the following formula:1 part Stand1 part It2 parts Tommyknockers1 part The Body (Stand by Me)Dash of the Dark TowerCombine ingredients. Mix well. Read for a week or until done.The book is good; however, it seems more like of a \\"Best Of\\" and does not really stand on its own. With some much interspec, there is no worry that this one will be a movie/mini-series."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little long, but worth the time...","review":"I'm a huge Stephen King fan, and was anxious to read his first novel written after his accident. I can say that although it was not my favorite, it was very, very good.Some of the critics have slammed King's \\"diarrhea of the typewriter\\" in this book. It was a little long, and dragged in the middle quite a bit, but still was not predictable, and I was quite satisfied by the ending.My husband and I listened to this book at the same time. He became a little more frustrated than I did with the psychological drama in the middle of the book, and was anxious for the action to start up again. I found the \\"mental\\" struggles more interesting, and wasn't as bored by the middle of the book.Jeffrey Demunn is absolutely superb! His Maine accent is perfect for the story, and his characterizations were flawless.King has definitely not lost his touch. Dreamcatcher is a must-read for Stephen King fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"FALLS BELOW EXPECTATIONS","review":"The more time that passes since reading this book, the more disappointed I am. Although a fast and compelling read, I can't shake the feeling that all I've done is read the outline of a much better book.Readers will naturally draw comparisons to \\"IT\\" because of the life long friendship, anchored by a life changing experience in adolescence, of the four main characters. But what King did with such skill and beauty in \\"IT\\", drawing us into the make up of the individuals as well as the group dynamic, he merely pays lip service to in \\"Dreamcatcher\\". King sets us up with the key elements, but fails to deliver. We get only one course of the meal King has taught us to expect.This book made me want to re-read \\"IT\\", which I am currently doing with great pleasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Think About This","review":"There are over 100 reviews already here, so I won't go over the same old stuff. Every true King fan might want to ponder this idea for a moment - doesn't it seem as if King has lost touch with \\"real people\\" as his fame has grown? His early books were great, but as he has grown older and richer, his fame may be causing him to lose touch with reality as the rest of us \\"worker bees\\" see it, and his writing has suffered from it. He's tucked away in a mansion in a small town in Maine, with not much exposure to the outside world. Also, Stephen knows, and so do we, that anything he writes will become a bestseller. So he doesn't have to really worry about pleasing the reader anymore - he knows it will sell a trillion copies and he'll get even richer. I will continue to read his books, but I'll get them from the library - I'm not paying a cent for these crummy stories anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"DREAMCATCHER","review":"DREMACATCHER---2 STARSI couldn't wait to read this one. The first 200 pages were SOOOOO good....I was hooked....then I don't know what the happened...king was all over the place, I was kind of lost at around the 300 page mark. Then I realized why, it's because the story/writing was just falling apart. Like a snow cave melting in the warm summer sun....there was all kind of stuff going on, and in a way where it was easy for the reader to get lost...lost and lost QUICKLY.....its a shame...I read 300 pages of this book, and I had enough....I was falling asleep after 10 pages....I said \\"good bye\\" and benched it....I have recently been reading MISERY and I CANNOT put it down....I have been up the past 2 nites reading it and it will be finished tonite.....STAY AWAY from DREAMCATCHER!!!!!

Reading his books, however, may be an exausting experience, since he frequently writes a lot, I mean a lot, of unecessary pages. BUt, most of the times, he does it showing that he's really a gifted writer.But in DREAMCATCHER things somehow go wrong. It's a hard book to read, even if the chemistry among the four old friends from Derry, more Duddits, was something very enjoyable to follow. But he kept developing unecessary histories to the plot. Case in point: the Russian woman who throwed herself into the water depository. Useless, simply useless stuff to the main plot.This is one King book trhat I kept struggling to reach the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Steven King's Worst Book","review":"Just a very short review but I thought I had to do it.

After hearing what this book was about I thought I would give it a go & was bitterly dissapointed. I found as I should have expected (just like his films) a subject with great potential just wasted. I can see this one being made into a film one day. Try Simon Ings - Headlong. Its not 100% either but it was definatley better than this, although it is not horror but sci-fi."},{"rating":"1","title":"I left it in the hotel...","review":"Stephen King's use of obscenities has become more pronounced with each succeeding novel...the last one I really enjoyed was The Stand. After wading through about a third of Dreamcatcher, I left the book in my hotel room when I checked out; page after page of disgusting obscenities were more than I could take."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!!!!!!","review":"I have been a Stephen King fan for years and loved his earlier books. This one is a disaster. I kept trying to read it but finally gave up. I think he has lost his ability to write great books such as The Stand, Carrie, Pet Sematary, Salem's Lot and other earlier books. Luckily I got this book as part of an introductory offer for membership in a book club. I'm glad I didn't spend much money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"SSDD","review":"I am a big SK fan, but this is just IT meets TOMMYKNOCKERS .. I loved both of those novels, but DREAMCATCHER is kind of tired stuff. I started to lose interest with the first falling tooth - been there, done that.

To be 100% truthful i would say that i did not enjoy this cd for even a second. I can't stand people-critics-whatever, say that this is \\"hip\\" these days and these two artists are trying to \\"bring back the sounds of the past\\" if you ask me this cd is just pure rubbish, it furthermore proves that as time progresses, it takes less and less talent to form a band. This is what you get what you scrape two artists from the bottom of the barrel, teach them a couple chords (just enough to play with modest mouse and incubus) and watch it all crash and burn. Maybe i'm just a tad harsh, it just angers me when music is this bland and a lack of talent is so clear...

But this stuff is on a different level, I am just not sure what level. I have discovered there is real talent as there is its own structure, but for the life of me I don't know what kind of talent. Does this have something to do with living in New Hampshire? Believe me, you'll never hear anything like this again in your life-but the truth is I wouldn't want to be without this album.

The way he ranted and raved, I thought he must be exagerating about it, but when I heard it I had to admit that he hadn't even come close to describing this stuff. I have listened to the songs many times over and am still challenged to follow the drum patterns. Like one of the other reviewers said, whwn you listen to it a lot, it starts to make sense in some wierd kind of way. These girls could only be sisters because you would have to share the same demented genes to be able to understand what they are doing intuitively.

It was a sunburst Gibson copy. I was just 12 years old.I remember picking it up for the first time.

I have met parakeets with a more defined vocabulary.The fact that people have actually purchased this piece of garbage makes me weep for the future. And scarier than that, some of them liked it, and then gave it 5 stars! I have lied awake at night with the song \\"My Pal Foot Foot\\" haunting me like a Stephen King story.I came close to destroying my entire CD collection, and breaking my own ear drums with a knitting needle.

Some lyrics were written by the parents but credited to the sisters to beef up the illusion they were a regular group. You folks getting into the \\"innocent self-expression\\" of the Shaggs should think about all this. At the very least you should feel bad snickering at them ever again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound Clips Will Do","review":"The hipsters can praise this all they want, but they KNOW it's crap and praising it just helps in their desperate desire to feel so smug and superior to mere mortals. I can guarantee you that few of them actually own a Shaggs album and of those that do few ever listen to it. This applied to Zappa too.Sure, it has a sincerity missing in so much of today's music, but sincerity alone does not make music (and I use the term loosely) listenable. Intrigued by this band's story? That's understanding, it is a fascinating one. But if you still feel a need to hear this stuff save yourself a lot of dough and go with the sound clips.

The ring inside the purse is a hazard which could result in your fingers getting hooked by that said ring. I will cut off the stupid ring which does not serve a useful purpose for a small coin purse.

What I got was definitely not what I expected - somewhere between the vocal cacophony in the first part of \\"2001 - A Space Odyssey\\" and a Berg piece - not quite just noise, but definitely atonal.Amazon needs to refine its recommendation list since this one showed up as something I'd like. I enjoy Yo-Yo Ma as one of the finest cellists performing today, and have heard him live with Emmanuel Ax, and I usually go to a movie that has a John Williams score even if the story doesn't look like something I'd enjoy.

The music is a great example of the master orchestrator at his best, where he finds invents some good themes and hangs the orchestra around them It's similar in quality to his other \\"for the concert hall\\" pieces that I know (particularly his Violin Concerto and Bassoon Concerto). The CD leaves me with one question in my mind: Why wasn't a well-known orchestra used? The name of the orchesta (which I've never heard of) leads me to believe that the composer used an pickup orchesta normally used to record by the studios to record film scores."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old Befana","review":"Love the book.

Now it is 25 years later and I re read it and found I didn't like it anymore the second time around. The protagonist describes his early life in Melbourne as a boy and how he became obsessed with masturbation in his early teens.He seems to have a fascination with homosexuality as can be seen by an early incident in this book.As a consequence of his twisted personality he becomes a teacher where he enjoys the attention of a \\"captive audience\\" namely his students.I am very glad that most Australian Writers do not reminisce about their early life if it was sad and pathetic as this author's was.Read this book if you want to be disgusted and appalled by the pathetic life of this loser."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creepy classic","review":"A favorite of author Gore Vidal (see his book, \\"Screening History\\" for details), \\"The Mummy\\" remains one of the most imaginatively creepy classics from the golden age of horror. Karloff is superb in what is perhaps his best role, and Zita Johann is more than beautiful enough to justify Im-Ho-Tep's centuries long obsession with her. The makeup by the great Jack Pierce has never been equalled, and the atmosphere is simply chilling. Far superior to any sequels or remakes."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think Karloff makes a pretty good performance as Imhotep.","review":"This was not one of the best Universal monster flims I have seen. Boris Karloff's mummy is unlike the mummy that we know. The Mummy was one of the earliest Universal classic monster films ever made. It is an interesting film, but you have to watch this film a few times so you could totally understand it. However, Karloff is my favorite actor. I always like to see him star as the Frankenstein monster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Older the Better","review":"The Older the Mummy the better and for sure the older the film the better also.There was always something evocative about watching that Prop plane fly around the planet at the opening of 1930,s Universal Films.A Superb cast that has already been mentioned and of course Directed by the master ..himself Karl Freund.This film has it all and 3700 years of atmosphere"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Loved You Once!","review":"Poor Boris!

A special movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mummy is Classic, but resembles Original Dracula(30)","review":"If you took this film and interchanged it with the charcaters from Browning's Dracula of 1930....well just a thought.Edward Van Sloan is the doctor who again insists that\\"we mus destroy it! David Manners is the romantic lead.Film really does resemble Lugosi Dracula(30). Karloff and Jack Pierce spent hours and hours with make up sessions and we only see the mummified mummy for a quick minute or two!However, the real terror and chills comes from Karloff's performance as the unmummified revived Ardeth Bey who is just as menacing as the \\"mummy\\". I liked the opening scenes best involving the archeologists at the 1920s dig site headquarters.Film tends to prod along at a slow pace, but is still good Universal creaky horror."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real Original","review":"Very well directed and presenting great quality for a 1932 movie, Boris Karloff has confirmed he is the true master of horror. This film draws you in with it's erie music and well produced flashbacks to ancient Egypt, add to that it's historic touch and it is worth renting at your local video store. Forget the 1999 version, it doesn't hold a candle to the original masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE DEFINITIVE MUMMY MOVIE! BRILLIANTLY RESTAINED AND ATMOSPHERIC","review":"Once again Universal has given us a great horror film! Jack Pierce's Mummy make-up still blows away any other interpretation of the creature. This film is slow moving with wonderful sets, but it's Karloff's brilliantly restained performance that holds your attention along with the creepy atmosphere. A one of a kind movie! The DVD transfer is good, but has been done better in the legacy series. Fortunately the 75th anniversay edition was saved from cancelation and we get the best release yet with that edition. Oh, I just know there is a Blu Ray version waiting to be unearthed! :-("},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally overated","review":"I like those classic old horror movies, like Frankenstien, the wolfman, the invisble man,etc.But this moviewas absolutley boring. It had a good opening scene in the start of the movie, when Karloff's mummy first comes to life, but after that he becomes a regular man and than the movie becomes a romance melodarma, not a horror movie. Their is no real suspense.I realize that compared to horror movies today, some the older movies might seem tame, but movies like frankenstien , the wolfman and their sequels haves their moments, but this one does not even have a mummy as we know it. Any body expecting to see a traditional monster will be disapointed. If I want to see a drama I will watch Citizen Kane.Finally, I like Karloff, he did some great horror B movies, this was not one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mummy - 1932 - Karloff","review":"Some of the reviews here suggest this version is not significantly better than the previous releases, which makes me think they may be confusing which version of this film they saw. The video portion of the film was improved slightly here, and it's reasonably clean, but not great. Where they did an astounding job here was with the audio - the previous release (in 2004?) had so much background noise it was like sitting over the engines on a jet plane that didn't have mufflers - really, really bad. This new version is very clean on sound, and the words are very clear and listenable. Overall, my viewing experience was excellent, and I highly recommend this version of the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Boris Karloff movie...period.","review":"As with all the 1930's horror films this one is very atmospheric and even without the special effects of today Karloff in the dual role of Imhotep/Ardeth Bey is masterful. Zita Johann is also quite good as his many times reincarnated love interest Helen Grosvenor. With reference to the classic horror films of the 1930's in my books this one is tied for the #1 spot with the 1931 Dracula. This movie far better showcases the talents of Karloff than Frankenstein."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awaiting Polybius","review":"I can not use Walbank's three volumes until I get the six Loeb Classics volumes of Polybius to read and study. This is forthcoming.I think I should tell you, however, that I have wanted my own copies of Walbank's work for over thirty years and finally made the purchase. I am very interested in the Punic Wars between Rome and Carthage and Polybius is the main historian of these events. The Roman Livy also wrote about this period, but he was a Johnny-come-lately and never had the chance to interview participants in these events like Polybius did. Polybius also accompanied the Roman army during the Third and final Punic War in 146 B.C. and witnessed the destruction of Carthage and the enslavement of its population.I also have the Sather lecture volume by Walbank about Polybius.The Walbank three volumes arrived ahead of the projected date of delivery in even better condition than the vendor said.

Accessible and scintillating, it gives one the necessary knowledge to grasp Godel's proof and understand its mathematical, philosophical, and even technological ramifications."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for a novice","review":"I read Godel's original paper over my winter break (2001) from my second year of medical school at UCSF. It is a fun paper to try to grasp, but unless you are extremely mathematically gifted (like me) or have spent years plodding away studying philosophy or math, then stay away from the original paper. If you are a casual reader and want to read great and important philosophy then stick with Heidigger and Kierkegard and such. Being and Time is a lot more fun if you just want some easy reading. Godel is hard stuff and only accessible to a select few. I loved it.However, if you are new to logic, mathematics or philosophy then you can try to read Nagel's book. I found it too simplistic and way too remedial. If that is your style then buy Nagel. However, if you are more sophisticated like me, then go read the original work. You will be much better off for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"He Dumbs It Down Way Too Much","review":"As the reviewer below, I too am a medical student/mathematican. I consider myself the foremost amature number theorist since Fermat and can read and translate ANY mathematical or philosophical document.Godel's proof is perhaps the most important document since the Declaration of Independence. It is a shame that Nagel treats it so lightly and debases it by trying to make it comprehensible to the common man. Only elite intellectuals like me are able to truly appreciate this document.If you would be into the Reader's Digest version of Being and Time, then read this book, but if you are up to the challenge, pick up the real thing. Be forewarned it will only be comprehensible to logicians and gifted medical students like me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Possibly the briefest and clearest exposition available.","review":"This is an excellent book. No nonsense, no cute metaphors (except one involving supermarkets. But one is excusable!) Douglas Hofstadter's \\"Gödel, Escher, Bach\\", though entertaining, tended to rely on obscure (and interminable) form-content interplay to illustrate its points. \\"Gödel's Proof\\" sticks to the facts and gets you there in a few hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sex book and little else","review":"Okay, I thought this was going to be pretty artwork (books like that exist - though rarely - like Manara's Gullivera). Instead, it's a pretty hum-drum sex book using too many close ups and unimaginatively drawn characters (who are techincally drawn okay but look dull) and quiet gross \\"flying fluids\\" exageration. The stories are the same-ole repressed male fantasy stories you can hear anywhere - although not as original (forbidden fruit gets stale) as some grass-roots stories. Boring. If not stupid. Erotic only to the lame. I own quiet a bit of plain-jane non-erotic mainstream manga and I can only say that there are far better artists with talent both in drawing and layout out there. Indeed, even as far as sex matters go, tamer series get it better. In hopes of swaying, swinging breasted ladies flirting and laughing, I was disappointed in basically raw pornography."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Since the other reviews were so positive, I thought it might be nice to have another perspective. I didn't hate this book, but frankly, I really didn't like it, either. In a word, it was boring. The couple was already together and the major conflict was that the characters had major communication problems. The reason I bought the book was because the amnesia part of the book sounded interesting (not that I haven't seen that plot device before), but it didn't actually happen until about half-way through. Honestly, the plot just wasn't that original, and the characters weren't loveable enough to save it. In fact, the female character was a bit of a door mat and that never changed."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Broadway:The Golden Age\\" is a Must!","review":"Broadway fans, collectors, Drama students and professors, all need to buy a copy of this wonderful documentary. No other film has the amount of star power, personal anecdotes, and archival footage of dramatic productions that this movie has. Wonderfully edited, written, and directed by Rick McKay, this is a treasure chest of information about the Broadway of the 40's, 50's, and 60's.It could not be more timely as so many of the stars have already passed away since Mr. McKay started this film 6 years ago. There is more than one hour of bonus footage that is brilliant. Eva Marie Saint talking about Lilian Gish, Marian Seldes talking about Catherine Cornell. It doesn't get any better than that. Bravo, Rick McKay!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Truely Inspirational","review":"I was fortunate to view this at the NYC premiere. I was in total awe. After shaking hands with Kitty Carlisle Hart and saying Hi to the most recently departed Fay Wray, I was just amazed. It was an experience I will never ever forget. I also saw Miss Celeste Holm, Tommy Tune, Chita Rivera. It was totally wonderful! The film was excellent. I wanted to just sit there for hours and hours listening to what the actors and actresses had to say. Their stories were fascinating. Which is what a Documentary should be. Telling the story about what life was like. Giving the \\"Inside Scoop\\" I hope I will be able to see the sequel to it. Anyone who says this film is Amateurish obviously overlooks the fact that this film will be a classic and should receive an Oscar Nomination, if not the Oscar for best Documentary. Anyone guy who can go and interview over a hundred stars, has to be amazing.Go and buy this DVD!!!! It is worth every Penny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fascinating Look at a Fascinating Time and Place","review":"Rick McKay has a love of Broadway so obvious to anyone who seees this film, that the statement becomes redundant. Is it any wonder that the film recalls the Broadway of yesteryear that so enveloped a nation as to spawn approximately 40 years of pop music, as well as numerous classic movies? These are the stories from the people who were there. These are the people who came to New York with talent and a dream and made that dream come true. These are the actors and actresses who shaped wonderful characters, and brought us the greatest of performances. Those performances led to great stories from off the stage, and a lot of those are shared here. Thank you Rick McKay, for letting them be heard."},{"rating":"2","title":"A groundbreaking film","review":"As a theatre major, I'm constantly looking for new reading/viewing material to supplement the live theatre I see and what I'm learning in class. Rick McKay's film is extraodinary. He has accomplished an enormous task, interviewing a hundred of the most influential and valuable performers/creators of the American Theatre. Every interview is fascinating, and you too will be grateful he got to these legends when he did to capture the first hand accounts of their experiences. McKay's attention to detail is remarkable, as he even went to great lengths to find and display a set of silverware from a restaurant a star fondly remembers.The DVD includes the film, a fantastic audio commentary with filmmaker McKay, and great extra footage-including a nice portion from his next film. Highly highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful record of Broadway","review":"I bought this DVD after seeing segments of it on YouTube. I LOVE IT! I laugh at one of the other reviewers who panned it because they were expecting clips of old Broadway numbers - read the product description! Amazing bits and explanations of things you would never know from reading a few books because the interviewees were there when it happened. Yes - there are clips to punctuate things - even a clip of Laurette Taylor speaking - what a gem! 100s of still photos you've never seen before! And the truth about what happened to Shirley McLaine that fateful performance - from Shirley herself!My only complaint is that track 21 - the section on Brando- SKIPS - no matter what machine I play it on - so my copy has a definite production flaw in it! I recommend this to anyone who loves theatre and loves older Broadway shows and stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't play because it is for another geographical region?","review":"i finally got around to trying to play the DVD and a message pops up that says it is not for my geographical region.

A helpful personelle helped me try on a dozen or so product, this was the last on the list, as it was the most expensive, but as soon as it was on, i knew it was the right product. It is said to only have \\"medium coverage\\", more makeup than concealer- but the liquid from the brush tip went on very smoothly, and blends very well with a regular concealer brush (small tip). I do not use makeup and the look did not require additional foundation. After the product came down (about 30 clicks initially), you only need one click for enough product to cover a half centimeter area. It is easily cleaned by makeup remover and my skin is not breaking out further which is a plus. I like the slightly brightened, natural look, the brush tip is soft and easy to clean. Overall, great for the bang of the buck, would not mess with the cheaper stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"good product container not so much..","review":"The concealer is good..looks nice, works well..however getting the top off it and reclosing it is a huge pain..hands already slippery, it's all but impossible to get the top off it..then you click the opposite end to release the product..then when you put the top back on, you must be very careful so as not to release more product when you try to snap the top back on..I like the concealer..but won't buy again because of the container."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"Not sure what the point of the product is.

It blends in with or without foundation, in fact, you don't have to wear any foundation because it doesn't cover up, it brightens the skin so that any dark circles seem to be gone. I can't say enough about it, you just have to try it, it brightens the skin...I love it, so much so, that I bought two more because I don't ever want to be without it. I am of light/medium complextion so I use #1, but even if you have medium it will still be the right color.It isn't just for the undereyes, put it where ever you want winkles to be less noticeable in appearance, like around the mouth area, puppet lines, or the lines above the lips."},{"rating":"1","title":"Touche e'clat","review":"I've always been a fan.

It is an absolute must-have for me and I've bought a number of these over the years. Was SO psyched to find it at this reduced price vs. the normal $40+. The shipping of the product was fine -- fairly standard. But the product itself seems off -- almost like it's old. It feels more like a product at the end of its lifecycle instead of a brand new one. Bummed. Won't buy from this seller again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gem of a product","review":"People gush about this product, and I never understood what all the hype was about until I finally tried it for myself. I don't think this stuff is the best highlighter on the market, but as a concealer, it is hands-down the best product on the market right now, bar none. My biggest issue is dark under-eye circles, and nothing I've tried even comes close to doing as good of a job at concealing them as this brilliant little pen.

My son never even really played with it. After Christmas morning, we moved it into his bedroom where it quickly fell apart again.

And once we did get it put together in some form, if you moved it the wrong way, it would completely fall apart. They became so frustrated! Bottom line, it was all my children wanted for Christmas and now it is in a pile of dismanteled pieces (MANY pieces) and will probably never be played with again. Do not buy this toy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor instructions and Poorly made","review":"My son got this for christmas and we spent almost 2 hours trying to put it together.

The castle has proven to be impossible for him to play with. It falls apart with the slightest movement, and it is so hard to put back together. However he really likes the firestation and it much more durable. He can actually play with it a while before it comes apart. He has the older version of the FP castle and he has resorted to using the new knights with the older castle. So it hasnt been a total loss. If you have bought this and havent yet opened it return it... ASAP We only wish we could."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish they sold the old version.","review":"I bought the imaginext castle because my chidren (I own a daycare in my home) wanted a castle. Well I went to get the fisher price one and this is what they gave me. I hated it the minute I opened the box. I cant believe they made something that has NO durabilty at all. The poor kids cant even put a knight on it without some side or piece falling off. I have put this thing together more times in the month I have had it! would however recommend the orginal castle that does not fall apart, maybe I just dont get the concept of putting the castle they way you want it if its just going to fall apart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fisher Price should be ashamed!","review":"My 5 year old had gotten this toy as a gift last year and we were very disapointed.The castle falls apart as soon as you touch it.

Boys are rough and this toy definately cant stand any rough play.

But building it is a long task and too difficult for a child! Once built it falls apart durring even the most gentle play ( and as a battle castle is not condusive to gentle play).

Fortunately my husband had the patience to sit down with our son and put this together. While it looks cool once you finally figure out how to get it built, it falls apart very easily. Just by playing with the action figures pieces of the castle kept falling off and one time our family cat walked by and rubbed up against it and the whole thing fell apart. My son doesn't play with it too much as he finds it too frustrating to try to build on his own and once we help him build it, down it goes again just by trying to play with it!! I wouldn't buy this one again. For now it just takes up room in a big rubbermaid container with all million pieces thrown inside.

Once assembled, my 5 yr old loves it, but the only problem is that once he shoots a few cannons or does some other type of battle, the castle crumbles (and this is after we have spent extensive time setting it up in the first place)!

Intended to be 'built', we thought it would encourage our son to use his imagination and be creative. Unfortunately, as soon as we snapped the pieces together, it fell apart before my son had a chance to enjoy it. It is a constant struggle to keep it 'together' and even with the slightest bump, it comes apart and causes frustration. He has totally lost interest because it doesn't stay together long enough for him to become involved in the whole adventure that is supposed to be inspired by such a toy. It has many neat features, and had it stayed together better, I would have given it 5 stars. I wish I had spent the extra money and bought the Playmobil, obviously the better choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best gift this Christmas","review":"My 6 year old son received this for Christmas and hasn't stopped playing with it yet. Every free moment he has is spent in his room \\"imaginexting\\" as he says.

Plus, I just felt better.Some may do the whole work out, but I have found that I don't have time to spend a whole hour so I use heavier weights and do one segment each day.

Thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"gilad the best yet","review":"i started working with gilad when i first viewed him on cable televison. since working with gilad i have been very happy with my results which can be noticed within a 30 day straight workout of about 3 days per week. i started with the fat burning workout which only lasted about 3 months and managed to lose about 8lbs of fat. i then switched to the toning and abs workout which results came within a months time. i have yet to see anyone who can compare with the health and mind management that gilad can provide to my self worth. i would recomend these videos to anyone and hope to see these videos on the market for a very long time. thank you gilad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed!! - The worst.","review":"I'm an aerobics and cardio kickboxing instructor and have a large collection of videos. I was excited to get this video since it had a five star rating, but very disappointed when I watched it. I couldn't believe the poor home video quality for the money. The instructor couldn't stick with the 32 count phasing, if he knows what that is. The music was horrible. I turned the volume off because I couldn't stand him and eventually turned off the video. I don't recommend spending the money on this video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too fast, too sloppy","review":"I bought this video based on the rave reviews it has received. I have the Kathy Smith and Billy Blanks kickboxing videos, and was looking to vary the routine. The first part of the video seemed great, with easy to follow demonstrations, and a killer buns/thighs floor workout. However, the rest of the video was disappointing. After all the talk about \\"go at your own pace,\\" I thought the floor exercises went much too fast. During the standing portion of the workout, Grogran loses count on every section, and the music beats don't match the workout counts. This may not be a big deal for some, but I found it very distracting. I am used to instructors that are conscientious about working both sides of the body evenly. As to the \\"fun\\" factor: Grogan kept telling me to have fun, but I didn't, not even after the fiftieth time he told me to! I can only recommend the buns/thigh drill portion of video at the beginning if you take it at a slower pace."},{"rating":"1","title":"A SLOPPY WASTE OF TIME","review":"If you want a real workout with a quality instructor, where the class is in synch, where the music actually flows with the movements, where the video is of high quality and doesn't look like someone filmed it with their handycam.. DON'T BUY THIS WORK OUT.. Get yourself a taebo tape with Billy Blanks. No matter how many times Grogan told me to have fun, I was too busy wondering why he didn't edit the tape before he put it on the market... Horrible horrible horrible..POOR QUALITY ALL AROUND. Grogan is dorky, corny, and has 2 left feet, no rhythm, and has no business making work out videos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and Easy to follow workout","review":"This video makes exercising enjoyable. Rich adds enjoyment to the workout, he shows different ways of doing the moves, so people like myself, who aren't in the greatest shape can follow along and feel like they are part of the video. I've TRIED Tae Bo, and other kickboxing aerobics videos, but they were way TOO FAST, and I had NO chance of getting a workout because I couldn't keep up with the moves. The people who made those videos must have forgotten about people like me, and the majority of the population that isn't in great shape. But I am happy to say that Rich Grogan and his Kick to Get Fit program remembered us. I actually look forward to doing this video."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Rhythm and No Organization - The WORST","review":"This has to be the worst tape I've purchased and I have at least 300 videos in my library. I would consider myself a cardio boxing enthusiast. I have been doing Taebo for 3 years and LOVE it. I wanted to expand my library since I have every Taebo Advanced tape available. I received Rich Grogan's tape and tried it over the weekend. Not only does he have no rhythm, his crew is out of synch, the music is not in tempo with the moves and the quality of the tape is horrible. Everyone is moving at different times because the beat of the music doesn't match the workout moves. Grogan is a mess in this tape. Either he can't keep up with his crew or the crew can't keep up with him. It looks like he filmed it himself with a camcorder. Save your money. I found it hard to keep my heart rate up at a steady rate.

I have done thousands of situps and leg lifts and ever other thing you can do for your abs, but Kick to get fit, kicked my abs and buns. I think the reason it worked so well was because we didn't do situps or traditional ab work. We did knees and kicks and uppercuts, which seemed to work areas of the abs that I have never worked before. Also, my buns felt like they were going to burn off from all the kicking and kneeing. I really liked this video and I am seeing the benefits, 19 pounds and 3 pants sizes in 4 weeks."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Didnt See A Problem With This Video","review":"I just purchased this video from this site, first of all Kathy thank you for sending this quickly, Now ive been doing kickboxing and boxing for over 6 years,or longer, i love the workout, i must have over 40 kickboxing tapes,came here to see if i can buy more, i read the reviews of Rich Grogan, some good some bad, but for the price i had to see myself, i workout 7 daysa week, on weekends i just do easy and slow ones,so i try this today (Easter), and i really really liked the workout, never did kicking sitting on the floor, and not much jumping, i found doing his working slowpace,was very very good, we dont need to be jumping around all the time, like taebo, and i even bought the tae bo 2004,and its alright even billy blanks screws up his tapes, so no body is perfect, Yes i do recommend this video esp. for beginners,and weekenders like me. Good Luck"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Personality / Great Workout","review":"I have read the reviews from others about the Kick to get fit video, and I agree with most of them. This was a very fun and a very effective workout. I REALLY enjoyed Grogan's personality, he made the workout a lot of fun, and he also explained how to do things in an advanced way to get alittle better workout, if you're at that level. Like Grogan said thoughout the workout, \\"Go at your own pace, this workout is for you!\\" He not only says these things, but he also shows you different ways to accomplish this.I REALLY enjoyed this tape and I personally don't see how anyone who gives this video a try could have anything to complain about. Unless they have no clue about exercise videos, and just need something to complain about.This isn't Tae-Bo or any of those other videos that I have tried in the past, this video is different, this is a video I can do and see results from.Thank you Mr. Grogan, I really enjoy your video!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I really enjoyed this video","review":"I really enjoyed the kick to get fit workout. I found the video to be very enjoyable and very easy to follow along with. The instructor, Rich Grogan, shows you different levels for doing the movements, this has been very helpful, and is one of the reasons why I find this video fun to do. Another reason is the movements are very controlled and are done at a lot slower pace than most videos I've seen. I have found that by doing the movements slower and more controlled, my muscles seem to burn more. It makes me wonder why other videos go so fast! If you're looking for a really fun workout that is easy to do, I recommend kick to get fit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Perfect, Not too long","review":"I read one of the other viewers response about the video being too short. I totally disagree with that viewer. I believe that the video is the perfect length, you get a good workout in with a lot of variety in a fair amount of time. I have done a lot of videos that seem to go on forever and you wonder if they will ever end, and worse than that when you are finished you don't feel like you have accomplished anything. Kick to Get Fit is different, you get a great workout that works all areas of the body, and when you're done with this video you know you have done a workout. Oh, a little tip to anyone buying this video, DO THE COOL DOWN AND MASSAGE PART AT THE END, IT REALLY MAKES YOU FEEL GREAT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Behind the lighted stage","review":"One always wondered what goes on behind the scenes.

They were the first band I went to see live ($6.00 back in the day) I love DVD sets with rare concert footage, and the little tidbits into the past. It's kind of like reliving my childhood as well. Normally I wouldn't buy a full on documentary, but if you are a RUSH fan like me this set is a must have. I couldn't stop watching it, twice in 2 days. This one's a keeper. There is something in this set for all fans of RUSH, even if you aren't a rabid fan like me. I highly recommend this set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"This is a great.

It is different than other music I have been listen to. I will buy more music from Rush."},{"rating":"2","title":"Revealing","review":"Learned more about RUSH than I had known before. While I am more in the vein of \\"just entertain me\\", it was interesting to see their background even to seeing clips of Alex as a teenager with his parents. The Documentary was entertaining as well. Certainly worth it to RUSH fans or those who are just curious about them. Word of caution: (Actually several words) You are likely to want to go to one of their future concerts if you have the chance, after seeing this documentary. May I sugggest Red Rocks Amphitheatre outside of Denver... excellent venue. After which you may be hooked... Not such a bad thing as you will find.

It's a good mix of live footage, interviews, and behind-the-scenes clips of the band's career. What I like, is the way they delve into the ideas behind their epic albums, and how they were inspired.Geddy, Neil, & Alex are pretty funny guys, and you get to see that, as well as the great chemistry they have together.Highly recommended, but, if you're already a Rush fan, it's no-brainer, eh?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rush - Behind the Light Stage.","review":"This is by far the best music documentary/movie I have ever seen!

I haven't listened to them much in many years. Watching this movie filled me with joy, and inspired me to start listening to the music I used to love again. Now I know why I used to like Rush so much...Because they are AWESOME. They are the nicest, most talented, most honest three guys to ever put out a mere 14 platinum and 24 gold albums. And they've still got it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"RUSH is introduced to new fans","review":"I wish RUSH would have come out with documentaries years ago. They are such a private band with a sole focus on the music. Long time fans have a right to feel cheated that nearing the end of their career they release dvd's recapping their career.I am still a huge fan having seen them eight times since mid-1980's. Would love to take my kids to see them but they skipped Indianapolis on this tour.See them while you can, folks. There aren't many more tours on their schedules."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!!!","review":"An intriguing inside look at the most popular cult band of all time. The directors keep the storyline moving forward, with plenty of commentary thrown in by other artists such as Sebastian Bach, Gene Simmons, and Jack Black.An obvious \\"must have\\" for Rush fans, but even the \\"Greatest Hits Only\\" lovers should find this film interesting, if not down right hilarious at times (especially the bonus material on Disc Two)."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!!!","review":"This video is one of the best I have ever seen.

Great Concert Footage as well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great documentary about the super power trio","review":"Very well made documentary about the greatest band ever! Rare footage and in depth interviews with Neil, Alex and Geddy.Be sure to watch the dinner scene included on the extras disc. not only are they top shelf musicians, they are hilarious.It is a great story of how the band was ripped by the idiot music critics and how much Rush appreciates their loyal fans.It is gratifying to see how Rush proved the critics wrong.5 stars are the max, I would give this 10 stars if possible!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Touching Experience","review":"Rush has always been a band near and dear to my heart, but this documentary puts them #1. This film will leave you astonished, touched, and wowed. A perfect year-by-year explanation and description of the band from the beginning. The band's overall good spirits and humor will keep you laughing well after you finish watching. A definite worth-while experience and the extra content adds an extra hour-and-a-half to the film. Overall, this is the best band documentary i've ever seen and it pays tribute to the world's #1 cult band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good and Interesting","review":"Wow! Very good documentary and of Rush to boot. Very riveting, we learned a lot about Rush and like/respect them even more than we did before watching this video.Thanx Rush for the wonderful music in my childhood(late 70's, Farewell to Kings, etc) and for Witchhunt- my W.

There is no hope."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rush: Beyond the Lighted Stage","review":"I got this about a month ago,I have tried in 3 diffent DVD players and my computer and it dosen't work.I want to send it back but couldn't get the paper to d0 it.So if someone could help that would be great.Dave Culp"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Blu-ray documentary for a great band","review":"This is a really good documentary. Finally for those Rush fans of all degrees get to know who they are on this well-made documentary. It should answer most of your questions about them and some you didn't think about. To Me they are a great rock influential band without the arrogance and pretentiousness. They are simply pure, gifted and risk-takers without going overboard. Buy it and you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Testament to Three Legendary Musicians - With Two Major Faults","review":"This was a fantastic, well-written/produced/directed documentary on Rush. This presented a perfect insight into these three extradordinary yet surprisining-earthy musicians, and their amazing journey together, now entering its 36th year and still very much in its prime.The Two Faults? Why are generic Rock/Metal meatheads Gene Simmons and Sebastian Bach in this feature? Every other musician giving praise to Rush was/is of the utmost caliber, but to but two generic-metal boneheads in this video was really unnecessary. Yes, I KNOW Rush opened for KISS and became good friends, but Simmons is still a no-talent arrogant dirtbag. And Sebastian Back should be performing at a county fair somewhere in Ohio, in this video he certainly looks like he's been munching on the funnel cake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pinch me I'm dreaming","review":"The absolute most perfect movie ever made and everything deserving such a flawless band. If you like even just one RUSH song you will love this movie and more of their music. If you are a diehard fan and can find any fault with this movie, I will eat my hat. Which, luckily is made of chocolate. But still, I don't want to eat it, it keeps my head warm. GET THIS MOVIE DARN IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"highly enjoyable film about \\"the boys\\"","review":"I've been a Rush fan since I was 12, I'm 42 now. Watched this on Blu-ray last night and was very pleased. I thought some of Gene Simmon's comments were a scream. The old footage, the interviews with the band, producers, musicians, managers and the fans is all very well done. It made me proud to be a Rush \\"nerd\\". My only wish is that there had been some discussion of Hugh Syme and the band's amazing album covers.

It's gonna deliver."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock n Roll History!","review":"Great documentary on a great band! I was introduced to Rush at a young age when I first heard \\"Spirit of the Radio\\". It blew my mind. Then I basically stole my brother's Exit Stage Left cassette. Then I kind of forgot about Rush for a while. That is until I picked up the Live in Rio DVD. Amazing concert! After that I went back to buy a good portion of their albums. After watching Beyond the Lighted Stage I am officially a huge fan, and now I own all their albums. It's refreshing to see a group of guys that are so down to earth and classy despite all the success. They are so deserving and work so hard on their craft. Never losing focus. It makes me like them more! Aside from all that this DVD is well produced and their story must be told. They are one of the greatest rock bands of all time up there with Led Zepplin and Pink Floyd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rush","review":"This is worth every penny, it tells the story of Rush vary wll, I have been a Rush fan since 1975, they are one of the most talented bands in history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saw it at Tribeca Film Festival","review":"Wow! What a treat! Saw this in the theatre at Tribeca Film Festival with a packed crowd. It was extremely well done -- funny, informative, and all the topics were addressed (from the tragedies to the outrageous clothing styles). I understand that the DVD may include an extra hour long bonus feature that were not in the theatre release.Wall Street Journal gave it a great review and the movie won the festival's 2010 Heineken Audience Award.Lots of great interviews with parents, rock stars, and the band. Quite an enjoyable experience. A MUST buy for any Rush fan, and a fantastic treat for those of you who just appreciate a great rock documentary. Will the ROck and Roll Hall of Fame be next? Enjoy...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Completes the story...","review":"For RUSH fans this film will complete the circle for you. It was very interesting to hear the struggle between the band's vision and what the record company wanted them to produce. We've all heard the music, but never understood the balls the band had for producing the music they wanted to share. I could keep writing, but all you need to know is that if you are a RUSH fan, you will need to see this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great gift for a Rush fanatic","review":"If you love Rush, you will love this. But someone please answer me this: why does Jack Black have to yuck it up and ruin parts of this for me? Even my wife thought he was childish.

The individual histories of the Geddy, Alex & Niel are woven brilliantly into the fabric of history that explain the great band. I almost wonder if the release of this movie was the final push to get these guys into the Rock Hall Of Fame. What a shame that Rush was not celebrated and recognized at this elite level about 20 years ago. They are without peers in all music genre's. Their musical intellect and composition style can intimidate and embarrass most any current musicians alive today. They are the gold standard."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOOKING BEHIND THE CURTAIN","review":"I'd have to say this is must-have for any serious Rush collection.

The band tells the story in their own words with plenty of concert footage and extra photos to accompany it. Very complete up through \\"Moving Pictures\\", then it seems to get a bit thin talking about the following albums up to \\"Counterparts.\\" Read \\"Contents Under Pressure\\" to fill in those gaps. Disk 2 has some great and funny bits on it. I've only had it about 3 weeks and have watched it over and over. It doesn't get tiring to watch. Love them or not so much, you'll have a greater appreciation for them and their work afterwords."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a documentary should be","review":"I'm not going to critique the entire documentary; others have already done so, and very well. What I will offer is my opinion that this is truly a worthwhile documentary. It is comprehensive in scope and draws facts, opinions, and stories from many people, including the band members who seem to be more approachable and reflective than ever seen or heard by the general public. The bonus disc offers fans rarely, if ever, seen performances and outtakes that have good entertainment value. Some true gems in the performances.I'm not thrilled with the disc placement in the case, but overall the packaging is nice and protective.As always, I'm very satisfied with Amazon's product fulfillment processes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done","review":"I have been a fan for years, and was pleasantly surprised by this documentary.To see how many other rock musicians were influenced by Rush was surprising."},{"rating":"2","title":"I too join the 5-star Chorus!","review":"If you are a Rush fun (and I have been so for more than 30 years), this is the must-see DVD.

I have to say that I am very disappointed in the book. The layout and pictures are extremely amateurish and the recipes look like something a child would put together not an experienced book.

Definitely not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was so excited to get this cookbook after reading numerous reviews, but so far I've been disappointed. I made the chocolate muffins. All the chocolate chips sunk to the bottom of the muffins and stuck in the pan. They looked nothing like the picture. Then I tried the Parmesan Zucchini which was bland. I also made the Salmon Pasta Gratin. The directions were very vague. I was to dilute the wine in a glass of hot water. What size of glass? 6 oz, 8 oz? Then I finished the dish and noticed I omitted the parmesan cheese. Parmesan cheese was listed in the ingredients, but never mentioned in the directions. Not sure I'll try another recipe from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Motherboard defect","review":"I have had the vgn-s260p since 2005 and 2 days ago the motherboard went bad.

The first time I scored 207 and the second time 190, very far from the score I needed for my MBA. Seriously, I don't know how could somebody claim to have scored 290 with Kaplan preparation, and even less with this Kaplan TOEFL book that I recently disposed in the garbage.

A bad mistake, one which, in my opinion, keeps this from a 5 star rating. I'm of the opinion that Holiday's Verve (high) years were her best, and, of course, there are two camps in this 'argument' so we'll have to agree to disagree. The Verve years have always been, and always will be, my personal favorite.

There are some good performances but in the main the order of the day is clipped upper class Englishness with warmth and humanity drained away. All very sterile.The writing and dialogue is at times painful, stilted and unreal, with the delivery of lines from the actors forced and almost alien.Some other strange stuff too: the uncle liked little girls (in a sexual way)and this was shrugged off as mild eccentricity. How times have changed since the 1990s !What is good about this series is the historical references and the depiction and sense of the war years.Well worth watching but not the greatest piece of drama."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed.","review":"We were completely disappointed in this DVD.

I am a fan of many of the stars and it was interesting to see them play roles very different from my original introduction (Jennifer Ehle as someone other than Elizabeth Bennett and Felicity Kendall as someone other than Rosemary Boxer). I was a little surprised by the sexual content and nudity but it was nothing offensive.My only problem is the \\"up in the air\\" ending.

In many ways, the original Karloff thriller shines through this re-make, but 1999 has a LOT more to offer the audience in ways the original never dreamed of!The Mummy is entertaining, exciting, and on DVD, it just about captures the entire movie-going experience!

Very beautiful people, (especially Oded Fehr who adroitly delivers the only bearable character). Otherwise, populated by shallow and stereotypic personages. Script hangs by a thread with tongue-in-cheek humor. Oded Fehr admonishes while Brandon Frasier smirks, Rachel Weiss bubbles, John Hannah whines, and Arnold Vosloo up-chucks. Just what you'd expect on a roller-coaster ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indiana Jones Returns!","review":"Okay, so Indiana Jones hasn't returned, but if you're an Indy fan, then this flick is definately for you!The film has all of the elements that the Indy Jones films had: ACTION!

All blended together with some very good animation.I don't recommend this film for young children, due to the graphic special effects, but this is a must have for those future Halloween get togethers!NO, It's nothing like the earlier Karloff versions, but then, the world has changed over the decades! The story stands on it's own!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Two Hours of My Life That I'll Never Have Back!","review":"To call this movie funny or in any way resembling an Indiana Jones movie is a great mistake.

Get this movie for a fun, scary experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't expect Indiana Jones and it will be good","review":"I watched this movie for the first time after a friend told me it was just like Indiana Jones. With that in mind I watched and hated this movie. It took me several more attempts through the years to get that mentality out of my mind and watch this for what it is.This is more akin to Pirates of the Caribbean than it is to any Indian Jones movie. Where Indiana Jones is 90% archaeology and history and 10% Sci-Fi / Occult this is probably the exact reverse. The dialogue, though not great, is decent and funny at times. The protagonists are a motley bunch that stumble into success and find trouble easily. All in all it is a good film to watch.The basic story is that a historian/ librarian with her pocket picking brother and a wayward adventurer manage to unleash a curse that was put away 5000 years ago. Now it is a race against time and supernatural demons to save the Earth."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Mummies, Please","review":"Now that's entertainment, everything you want in an action movie. And what about that next movie, hollywood guys? No, the Scorpion King doesn't count - I want to know what Rick and Evie tackle after the Mummy Returns. By the way, you can double your pleasure from this film (and the second movie) with your family by adding the nifty A&E Egypt double-dvd - Mummies And The Wonders of Ancient Egypt.

Although the increased resolution offers far more detail, defects such as dirt & film weave are now more apparent. The contrast seems to be artificially lifted, clipping details both in the high and low end of the image (The Universal logo at the beginning of the film never looked this ugly), making it look processed and not film-like.Compared to reference HD-DVDs auch as \\"King Kong\\" this is a slightly below average transfer (2/5)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I want my Mummy","review":"Yep, this is one of those other misnamed films like the \\"Godzilla\\" (1998), which could have been called \\"Lissardus\\" has no relationship to \\"Godzilla, King of the Monsters\\". We could call this movie, \\"Mummy Dearest\\" no wait, that title is taken, how about \\"Mr. Sandman\\" which has no relation to, \\"The Mummy\\" (1932). Do not try to tell me that Boris Karloff and Brendan Fraser are doppelgangers.A reviewer once asked why people keep doing dumb things. Part of the fun is saying, \\"stay in the car\\" or in this case \\"don't read that!\\" Just because this is not my favorite type of movie does not mean it was not done well for the type. There is always those that want it scarier, better graphics, and with some sort of script. I swear some one would even have Imhotep change his name to Freddie.I would like to say something negative about this movie. But then why do I keep watching it? I think that once you get past the name thing, this is a fun movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neither here nor there","review":"I'm still not sure whether this film was intended to be a spoof or not. If so, it lacked enough laughs to be considered as such. On the other hand, if it was intended as a serious horror film it also fell short of the mark. There wasn't a single moment of tension. All in all, it was a bit like a carry on film. Not a patch on the Indiana Jones films."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super acting and Great Action and of course very Scary!","review":"My husband and I love scary flicks and we are not easily impressed but this was an edge of your seat movie Beatifully filmed and costuming was excellent. Branden Frazier has never done such a great job didn't know he had the Indiana Jones in him. This was like wathching Indiana Jones with a little more fear and other world experiences. Good little bit of love also. The special effects for this film were a major suprise and I think some awards should be in order. One of the best summer movies for '99 especially if you like horror."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Cheesy","review":"Like the reviews says, if you're looking for a shallow, cheesy movie, this is the movie for you.Cliches? Check. Annoying bad guy lackey? Double check. Predictable plot, mostly a vehicle for special effects? Check.I mean, you've got a guy alone in a tunnel, and you need to grab his body, so you just grab his tongue and eyes? Makes for some icky looking scenes as he tries to talk and wanders around blindly with bandages over his eyes, but I can't even begin to understand why, except for the icky scenes. Plus it gives the lackey a chance to show what an evil double crossing lackey he is. That's the sort of movie this is.It's Indiana Jones without good acting, but on the plus side it has cool special effects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy the full screen version","review":"Be carefully which version buy. Unlike other studios that offers both full and widescreen on the same DVD, Universal is dumb and greedy enough to release two versions. Check the right version before you buy. The full frame version must from the VHS tape master which is less detail and grainy compares to the widescreen version not to mention mutilated the film.The sound is the same for both films, which are good but not great. Wish they had DTS version instead of the full frame.Four stars for the widescreen version on audio and video.Three stars for the content as a decent B movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"For the Mindless Only","review":"The Mummy moves far too fast to be a good horror flick,and it's far too predictable to be a good action movie. Substituting special effects for plot development and real acting, the Mummy will satisfy most viewers looking for mindless escapism. However, anyone looking for anything deeper will walk away disappointed. Save your money and go see the Sixth Sense while it's still in the theaters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I was very disappointed in this movie. Too many typical scenes, an unconvinsing villian, a screwball hero and idiots all around him. It was more like a national lampoon version.

However, five minutes into the movie a feeling of dread fell over me. My girlfriend leaned over to me and asked, \\"Is this a comedy?\\" What happened here, this is supposed to be a horror movie, not a slapstick comedy. I enjoyed Steven Sommer's Deep Rising, but this is ludicrous. Fraser churns out the typical Hollywood tough guy character. Rachel Weisz, is nice to look at, but not to listen to. The special effects are decent enough, but they seem to be more important in the movie than the actual conflict. This came out the same summer as the awful Austin Powers 2, and the even worse Deep Blue Sea, t'was a bleak summer for me.

I also have to equate its script content with an adult-form Barney movie in its diluted attempt at entertainment. It was scary alright.

Filled with numerous Egyptian landscape errors, the sets look contrived and the effects are lackluster, save for the wind storm. What ever happened to using little models anyway?

Buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An adventure; not old-fashioned horror","review":"This is nothing like the original 1930s version; I'd like to make that clear right now. It is adventure, not horror. Brendan Fraser makes a pretty good action hero; he's roguish, a little ignorant, and slightly manipulative. But he has his hands full battling a cursed mummy in an expedition that was idiotically looking to disturb the peace in Egypt (how original). For some reason Imhotep, the mummy who slowly rejuventes his body by sacrificing the living, is immortal and wants to destroy the world, bringing about the seven plagues. The effects are okay but they could have been better; the scarabs didn't move real at all. In fact, is there even any such thing as a flesh-eating scarab?? Hmmm. But it's good, worth your time, certainly; and underrated by critics, like everything seems to be these days. Buy it, but not over the Internet. You can walk, hopefully; go to a store and get it.

Alot of the sets and costumes were Indiana Jones inspired.Not only were the actors as dry as the desert they were in, there were it seemed a series of endless shootout scenes, horses running, guns firing, dust flying. These action sequences are nothing more than time fillers and BOREING to watch. The humour in The Mummy was a total distraction and offset the mood of the entire film. It turned into this hokey comedy of sorts, which truely rings pathetic in my book.The romance and pychological aspects of the older monster movies is missing here. It has been replaced by mindless special effects, and what seemed like an endless array of confusing action sequences. Dull characters, dull storyline plus dazzling special effects equal dumb movie.

Plot holes to drive a truck through. poor acting and some of the worst dialogue I've ever heard were enough to move this into my list of all time worst movies.Of course the inane premise should have been enough to warn me off. Let me sum it up. Egyptian High Priest is screwing around with the Pharoah's mistress. He does this out in the open where Pharoah can walk in. Pharoah comes in and with his bodygaurds right behind him. The kill him.What do they do to punish this high priest?

This is a pale imitation of several different (and better) films made by people who seem to think that special effects make a good substitute for an original story and decent characterisation. The stereotyping of the characters is annoying and offensive. The Egyptians are all dirty and rude, the Americans are gun-crazy rambo's, the English are bumbling idiots (we're not all librarians you know!). Rachel Weisz and John Hannah were painful to watch at times. The most interesting character was Ardeth Bey who only had a small supporting role. Completely disappointing - it could've been so much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Critics were right: This movie blows","review":"OK. Brendon Frasier can't act, so they came up with a supporting cast that wouldn't make him look too bad. Translation: Bad acting across the board There are absolutely no redeeming qualities about this film. The Egyptians portrayed in this film are, to a man, bumbling, shady characters bent on trickery or murder. Pathetic. There was nothing scary about the Mummy himself. Most of the time they use a computer generated character (the kind we see in every \\"horror\\" movie these days) who is about as convincing as Jar Jar Binks. When the Mummy finally becomes a \\"real man\\", they use a bald, smirking goofball that runs around in a silly loincloth and looks like Right Said Fred.

What I got however, was terrible special effects that I could have produced on an Amiga 10 years ago (the beetles floating on top of the ground for example). OK the face in the sand was quite good, but that was it. It has none of the pace or humour of the Indiana Jones series.

The truth is, Brendan Fraser can't carry a movie. The creative team behind the movie knew this, so they tried to jazz it up with lots of hokey special effects. The script was even worse. I do have one question, why didn't they show all of the plagues instead of only like four of them?

I just watched it, and I can't possibly express how disgusted I am with all this wasted time I can never get back. I almost want to cry. To begin with, the special effects are the best thing in the movie, and even they suck. The plot basically consists of a bunch of people dying and no one seeming to care, and a bunch of bugs running around. That this apathetic waste of space would be geared towards kids--or anyone for that matter--makes me physically ill. Never, ever watch this! I can't believe some people like this!

Yeah...\\"purest\\" IF you have DTS equipment. Had I known this beforehand I wouldn't have bought it. Of course, who would even think to check since just about every DVD ever made has had a 5.1 channel. What is especially insulting is that the main menu audio is in 5.1. It would have been nice to have a warning or disclaimer on the box. What's the point of a hi-def format when muddy, bogus 2-channel audio is all that's available for someone with a Dolby Digital setup?

That being said, it is not going to completely change your world, but it is one of the best pulpy action films out there. It has some good cheeky comedy, some cool action, and is about a mummy with magical powers and it doesn't really suck.

I definitely give it a positive review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mummy's the Word","review":"The Special Effects are weak by today's standards, but not particularly bad. This is because they never let the fact that they can do fantastic things in CG distract them from crafting a fun action story with likable characters. The effects are sufficient for their purpose and do not distract.That being said, the real draw here is the character of the movie. Not the characters on their own, though they are fun too. But the character of the movie. It aims to be a fun action adventure and it achieves that very nicely. There are a couple bits (primarily around a couple of the victims of the mummy's attacks and regeneration) that can be a bit disturbing to the very young, so just know that it earns its PG-13 rating. But beyond that, there is very little here that is particularly objectionable.A fun ride that leaves you feeling good at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD FICTION","review":"This movie is great, as long as your not taking it word by word.

With predictable transparent characters and recycled story lines, this movie plays more like a spoof than an actual sci-fi thriller. Some good special effects seem woefully out of place when draped on a sophomoric story line, like icing on stale cake.

I should've waited for it to come out on video. NO! I should've waited for it to premiere on network TV had I known it was going to be this bad. \\"The Mummy\\" is basically an exercise in special effects, and nothing more. At least they could've included something of a plot, but it was nowhere to be found. People said I should see it merely for the effects, although after seeing it, I didn't think they were any better than \\"The Matrix\\". I don't care for the acting, either. It's an example of what poor casting can do to a film. Now for my attack on the MPAA, I felt that the level of violence in this film was too much for a PG-13 rating.

The special effects were good, but that doesn't make a movie good. The storyline was ok, but the persistent comedy was annoying. Not that it wasn't funny, but when I go to see a movie called \\"The Mummy\\", you would think its an indiana jones type thriller. Indiana jones had comical moments, but nothing like in the mummy.

So I watched it, but I haven't seen the end because I was so bored. The first thing I hated was that I thought that this movie was scary, but is was so not !! I think it can better renamed to a comedy or something like that. And those effects were not so great eather. Fake and not very scary. The scenes were not very good to follow. In one scene they were almost caught, the next scene they were already in their hotel. What's that about ?? Well I hope I'm not too negative, but I have a dozen friends who think the same like me.

With it's cheezy villians, hunk-a-love, and some free-wheeling wanna be American cowboys looking for Egyptian plunder - how can you go wrong for a summer hit.

This genera has been lacking for too long. We still love good, old fashioned, swashbuckling, action adventures and the box office numbers prove it.Move over Harrison, there's a new action/adventure star and his name is Brendan Fraser. In this film, he has a persona that is reminiscent of Errol Flynn. For those of you who think he can't act, you probably haven't seen most of his work. (Still Breathing, School Ties, Gods and Monsters, George of the Jungle, Blast from the Past). His acting ability is so divers that most of the time I can't believe he's the same guy.It looks as though Hollywood has finally gotten a clue. Mummy 2 is in the works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie...Especially in HD DVD","review":"Too bad HD-DVD didn't win the battle.This movie is incredible as far as effects and action.The HD is wonderful and is a great way to show off your setup.A must for HD-DVD fans"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly Overrated","review":"For the life of me, I will never understand the craze about this film. The acting ranged from terrible to 2nd rate, the special effects were too heavy, character development was virtually nonexistent. For a film that has been called the next Indiana Jones, everything in this film is lesser than Speilberg's and Lucas' superb adventure trilogy. I mean, what the heck was up with this film anyway? Brendan Fraser's trying to be an action hero, but also a comedian, just did not work as he never neared achieving either goal. The deaths of several of the good characters had no effect, as we never really got to know them. Not once DURING THE ENTIRE MOVIE was I on the edge of my seat, though it was all I could do to not lean comfortably back and fall asleep in it. Okay, perhaps that's an overstatement and a bit harsh, but this film is not as good as the critics say!"},{"rating":"1","title":"MUMMIFIED.","review":"What else does this movie have to offer besides sheesy special effects?

I felt mummified while watching it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could Brendan be the next Indiana Jones?","review":"I am a huge fan of the Indiana Jones series, and this version of the Mummy has all of the elements that made me like Indi. Action, romance, humor, adventure, thrills, and more. Brendan did a great job as the hero. The cast and acting was quite good and the visual effects were supurb, what else would you expect from ILM. I thought it was a fantastic movie plus all of the extra goodies on the DVD are a plus. DVD is an exciting new format and this movie is a great one to own on it. I also highly recommend The Matrix, Alien Legacy, and Nightmare on Elm St. box set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-digitized Hollywood junk","review":"This is another example of how Hollywood is using cheesy computer-generated special effects to substitute for plot.

The special effects are very impressive but it stops there. I found myself using the fast frame advance a lot in this movie and it was the first time I have ever seen it. Pointless dialog and dumb jokes interupted some decent action scenes and had no effect on the movie. I even think the Mummy himself was a little whimpy. Yeah he can make neat faces in the sand and he killed a few people but he never really kicked any butt. Maybe I am just compairing it to the Matrix. Glad I rented it. As far as the DVD I liked all of the extra's it had on it.

But after seeing it again at home, and having a history degree with classes dealing with ancient Egypt, I thought the movies intro was very interesting. The digital special effects were supperb. Brenden's acting and persona were quite similar to Harrison's seriousness and humorous antics as well. All action sequences were both epic and shoot'em up and the same time. However, I thought the ending mummy assault scene was a bit \\"Army of Darkness\\" cliche-ish. I give this movie a MUST see if your interested in archeological-based action flicks, ie. (Indy Jones series)."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL","review":"I'm not really a movie buyer but this is one movie that I had to go out and buy! Fraser and Weisz are a great team.

The \\"Building a Better Mummy\\" documental is very good too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank God I only rented it!","review":"Well for me this movie had only one saving factor to it. And that is the special effects and the cool Mummy. I think the best way for me to describe the acting is it reminded me of a sitcom in it's first few shows. The actors didn't seem to be comfortable with there characters and it just seemed flat. The one liners where pretty cheesy.All I can say is rent it, if you like it buy it. But don't buy it without seeing it first."},{"rating":"2","title":"a loverly little bugger","review":"This movie is a great one, especially for all fans of Elizabeth Peter's Amelia Peabody series. Though not well researched, and a little corny, it contains several great quotable lines, loverly British accents, not to mention the fact that Bredan Frasier is a hottie. So, if you're looking for a great adventure that's ALMOST on par with Indiana Jones, this is your movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"The reviewers don't get the joke!","review":"I saw this movie twice: once in the theatre, and once on video.

It's a great laugh!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Mummy (Widescreen Collector's Edition)","review":"The Mummy (Widescreen Collector's Edition) is a great adventure movie that is a bit like the Indiana Jones movies but with a mummy. Acting and plot are ok but one sees this movie for the action scenes and the special effects. The music is quite good also. This movie is nothing like Mummy with Boris Karloff and if one expects it to be the same then one will be sorely disapointed. However, if one comes in and expects a thin action driven plot with plenty of special effects then this is a dandy of a movie. 4/5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent film!!!","review":"This is one of those cases of original productions, that you must have in your collection.

The casting of the Mummy was was perfect - though bringing key players all back for the sequel The Mummy Returns wasn't enough to save that dog - and the story line captured the \\"gee whiz\\" weird wonder of the great monster movies of the '30's and '40's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty decent action-adventure flick","review":"(3.5/5 stars) This movie brings to mind some action-adventure movies of old, such as \\"Gunga Din\\" or \\"Bengal Brigade.\\" Despite the efforts of its keepers, a mummy is inadvertently awakened. It terrorizes a group of treasure seekers and archaeologists with its rather flamboyant magic. Will he be stopped before enslaving humanity? I prefer T.P. to CGI, but CGI's appeal is understandable, especially on such a large scale as this. There is also too much humor in this film. Sparse amounts, sprinkled intermittently, might suit the adventurous mindset of the movie, but it was carried too far here. Apparently the intent was to distance this from the 1932 horror film as far as possible. The likeable Brendan Fraser fits the action hero role well, and I have given this three star movie an extra star since it also features the beautiful Rachel Weisz. This belongs in the same category as \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\" because both are enjoyable, but not great by any means."},{"rating":"2","title":"The jedichihuahua says OLE'","review":"Excellent movie that combines special effects, adventure, and horror to produce a entertaining picture.

Brendan Fraser (\\"George Of The Jungle\\") is an Indiana Jones-type soldier-turned archeologist when a librarian (Rachel W.), due to her brother's (John Hannah) greed, accidentally stumbles upon a map revealing the location of an ancient city. The trail leads them to Egypt, where...I won't say anymore. The sequel is just as entertaining, as well as the prequel (which Sommers didn't direct, but stayed on as producer). All three films should have been rated PG for action-violence."},{"rating":"1","title":"YEEEEEE awn","review":"Brenda Fraser, please go away! I cannot say this movie was mummy-rific or mummy-tastic, borrowing clever adjectives from some of the other reviewers.

Meeting my two reasons with satisfaction, I thoroughly enjoyed watching the film.

There is a lot of tongue-in-cheek humor and lots of action.If you know anything about Egyptian history (I learned a lot in my art history classes), you may have to roll your eyes through some of the plot, but you will still find this entertaining.Startling in several scenes and just a good action film. New special effects and techniques were created for this film that never existed before... it's worth watching just for that alone. This is really a 3.5 star movie, but I rounded it up. This is highly entertaining, but way too intense for little kids. I enjoyed it, but I'm not sure if I could watch it over and over again due to the fact you really do have to put your brain and common sense on hold in a number of scenes. The DVD delivers great sound and never-before-seen footage, so this will be a great addtion to the DVD library of a sci-fi nut."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasant surprise","review":"We were standing in the video aisle at the grocery store. It was 7:45 PM on a Friday night. All the new releases were checked out. My 12-year old and 9-year old were debating the merits of viewing The Nutty Professor for the umpteenth time.Then we saw the DVD version of The Mummy. Very low expectations and lack of anything better led us to rent the DVD.WHAT A SURPRISE! This movie reminded me of an old-time Saturday matinee flick. Just gross enough without being gory. Just enough funny and in-cheek humor that didn't descend into 3 Stooges.The most telling sign was in the 'Making of the Mummy\\" featurette. All the memebers of the production team spoke about how they didn't want to make the effects too gory. Wow! Thinking of the probable adolescent audience! What a concept.Universal Films should be commended for such a fun movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"nice but nothing to get excited about","review":"well, it is a kind of fun movie, i even bought the dvd and now i am looking for somebody dumb enough to buy it from me. sorry, but i can not understand what folks like about hollywood mass products, full of stupid action, stupid dialogues, and stupid plots, like a jump and run adventure game - a very easy way to spend your way after your successful lobotomy, but no real value. there is just no touch, no really interesting or dramatic moment where the movie gets a hold of you and just knocks you off your feet. please do not buy. watch, if thou wilt, but don't thou buy this piece of brainlessness."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Goodbye Benni!\\"","review":"Whoever thought a remake of one of the best movies of all time would be better than the original?!!!!! This is WAY better than the 1932 version, and I loved the old one! This is Brendan Frasers best role (aren't too many of those.) The cast fits in perfect with the story and dialogue. This has GREAT effects, TOP NOTCH acting, and a WONDERFUL story line. It's cool how the film makers decided to change the Mummy's appearence from bandages to a walking corpse. It was a change for the best! This movie mixes Horror, Romance, Suspense, and a touch, I mean a small touch, of Comedy. No matter what kind of movies you like, SEE THIS, you'll like it. Also features: Rachael Weisz, John Hannah, Arnold Vosloo, and Kevin J. O'Conor. \\"Death is only the beginning...\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Spooky Fun!","review":"The commercials intrigued me so when The Mummy came out on rental I scooped it up immediately and was glad I did. The Mummy is a light-hearted, humourous horror movie which is very reminiscent of Indiana Jones. This movie needs to be taken for exactly what it is...a comedy, drama. If you analyse it too much you lose the fun. I thought the cast was good, the special effects were great, and I enjoyed the bits of humour throughout the movie. If you're an Indiana Jones fan like me, you'll enjoy this movie too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A really funny and adventerous romp!","review":"I expected \\"The Mummy\\" to be another greasy, melo dramatic action flick. When my sister FINALLY convinced me to watch the movie, I found it to be really funny, visually pleasing and well acted! I was pleasantly surprised to find John Hannah, from \\"Four Weddings and a Funeral\\" and \\"Sliding Doors\\", as Evie's brother, Jonathon. His part as well as Brendan Frasier's part was hilarious and well written. The Egyptian setting and subject matter gave the movie a sense of mystery and antiquity you don't usually get in action movies. Watch this movie for the humor and you will not be disappointed! For all of those who like action this is also a great pick. The special effects are really stunning and, while this is a period piece, the action sequences are exciting. Personally, not being a fan of action, I enjoyed this movie more because of the plot (which isn't as cheesy as it could've been,) the setting, the actors and the humor!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Most enjoyable, this is a video for fun!","review":"Good action, great special effects, I got it for the fun, and it delivered. I also got it because it was Brendan Fraser, and I like what he does to the roles he has played. So it didn't live up to some peoples idea of horror, it scared me!, there were some scenes were I was looking at the screen through my shielding hands, because I was quite a bit shook up. That was some neat monster, he certainly was scarier than any other MUMMY in filmdom. I thought the special effects were pretty darn good, there was a lot of energy that the real actors had to put into those scenes, to make them really click. Actually, I liked the story, too, kind of gave it a nice romantic touch, especially in the scenes with the Pharoh, who's to say that this sad tale didn't happened, or not! Still, this movie did what it was supposed to do, it entertained!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Reminds me of \\"Raiders\\"","review":"I found the 1999 movie \\"The Mummy\\" to be a suprise. The suprise was how enjoyable it was as a movie-going experience. These days, the movie-going experience leaves much to be desired, with most movies way overblown(\\"Phantom Menace\\"!) or just plain stupid(\\"Phantom Menace\\") I single out the latest \\"Star Wars\\" movie because that was the film I saw just before seeing \\"The Mummy\\". I can honestly say \\"The Mummy\\" was hundreds of times better. It has action, witty characters, and a plot that can be easily understood and enjoyed. In this way, it reminded me of perhaps the greatest adventure movie of my era, \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\". I'm not saying I need all my movies to be so simple in their design, but now and again, it is essential for our \\"swashbuckler\\" side to enjoy a fun adventure. \\"The Mummy\\" is that and them some.

How dare you give his name to this character, an adultorus muumy. How would you like it if Ben Franklin, Thomas Edison, and Albert Einstein were put in such degenerate light? The movie may be funny but is not a comedy, therefore the intention was to smear the name of Imhotep. This makers of this movie should be tried and convicted for psychological warfare."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb","review":"Another case where they rely on special effects to make a story scary. Perhaps, they should have invested in a story that would scare someone. Great effects, but the script mixes buffoonish humour with state of the art effects. It doesn't work. Questionable casting as well. this one is a dog, and its mummy's a dog as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly, silly film","review":"This movie was a fleeting diversion, nothing more. And that's about the only positive thing I can say about it. The story took forever to get started and wasn't even worth waiting for and the characters were insufferable, especially that annoying guy who was in \\"Deep Rising\\" and the brother of that Frasier's love interest. The movie would've been better if the Mummy had offed him. The special effects are decent, I suppose but they're not enough to make me want to watch this turkey again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incompatible with Some Blu-Ray Players","review":"This dvd does not play on my Pioneer Elite BDP-95FD. The machine loads the menus but none of the movie will play. The player has up-to-date firmware and is less than a year old.Might be a great transfer but more care should have been put into seeing that the DVD functioned on all blu-ray players or a warning should have been given about what was needed.Based on other reviews, this problem does not appear to be limited to Pioneer machines."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun SFX, but paper thin","review":"Although this movie is a fun ride with tongue-in-cheek dialogue, it didn't bother to get anything about ancient Egypt right. Considering it wouldn't have been that hard to get at least a few details correct, this lack of ANY historic accuracy ruined the movie for me. By the time the characters started talking about \\"five canopic jars,\\" I couldn't stand it anymore, I had to turn to my date to say \\"FOUR canopic jars!\\" And, what's \\"mummifying people alive?\\" Since step 1 of mummification is draining the body of blood, you wouldn't actually live through more than a few minutes of the process. The complete ignorance of Egypt, obstensibly the setting and motivation for the entire film, is extremely grating and offensive. Cute dialogue is nice, cool SFX is nice, but they aren't enough to get me to watch this one twice."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Mummy review.","review":"I wanted to order the physical DVD sent to me and I went into the wrong place.

I would encourage renting this movie for the special effects, but thats about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"OLD FASHIONED FUN","review":"Though lacking the subtlety that made the original 1932 classic so great, this remake manages to combine the thrills of \\"Indiana Jones\\", the awe of a Ray Harryhausen stop motion flick and the spooky fun of Universal's 1940's \\"B\\" Mummy series. Brendan Fraser is very cheerful and likeable, and Rachel Weisz is pleasing to the eye, and a good actress to boot. The DVD picture and sound are first rate; the extras are almost as fun to watch as the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and from the Boris Karloff era","review":"This movie brings back the scarry movie themes from the past.

I experienced almost all the same bugs as some of the other reviewers mentioned.In fact, when holding all the Law & Order games up in comparision to the CSI games, they are seriously lacking in both enjoyment and graphics. I would recommend all the CSI's to anyone who even remotely liked these Law & Order games. I don't watch the show, but I love the games. Can't wait until they come out with more!

While Law & Order does a good job of trying to distinguish itself from CSI - one way it does this is by requiring the player to choose a \\"tone\\" in which to interview suspects (sympathetic, interogation, straightforward, etc.) thereby varying the level of information you get out of the suspects. Even this, however, becomes tiresome after a few suspects and a few questions.This game is so filled with bugs that it is too frustrating to even play. One bug is that when directing Detective Goren on where to walk, he often gets \\"stuck\\" and will jog in place or worse, jog into a wall repeatedly rather than go where you are directing him to go.All in all this game is too frustrating.

Sometimes the people disappear all together. Where do they go? Not to mention locking up frequently (and yes, my system does meet the requirements!)

Just my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not even close, Fushion is Gillette's best by far...","review":"After one shave, it is immediately apparent, the five smaller blades beat the 3 or 2 blade models, hands down. A move comfortable, smoother shave for me. I could hardly feel the silky way it removes hair. I had to check some of the strokes to see if anything was happening. I was a recent upgrade to Mach 3 and liked it a great deal. Fushion is quite a bit better. I was surprised. I like the reverse side feature of one blade for under the nose. All Gillette razors give you a shave, but if you are going to shave every day, this is the most comfortable and nicest feeling one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gillette Fusion Power Replacement Blades","review":"This is the best price I could find anywhere.

The single blade on the back that is for sideburns and under the nose area does not seem to work at all. They may advertise the Fusion as having the closest shave you can get, but this was certainly not the case for me and I don't think its the case for most people.

I realise that you have to be skeptical when buying on the internet, but I trusted Amazon to have checked their vendors out. What is most aggravating is there was no deal in the price.

I believe I could've benefited more from the class had he put students' interest first by choosing a better textbook.I don't know why he put so much empathsis on ML. Had he put some decent effort in helping people actually understand ML, maybe it won't have been so frustrating (back then it was pre-2000, so there weren't many ML material available online - and you haven't heard of Google yet:-). For functional language, wouldn't Lisp be a better example for instructive purposes?Someone in the class at that time suggested him talk about scripting languages such as Perl (Python is now getting interesting).

However, they would only spin once or twice and stop. He would push the bowl around and listen to the ocean sound for a bit but it was too heavy for him to get it to make the splashing sound. I had to jiggle the bowl in order for him to hear that. He never quite got the \\"dropping the balls in the bowl\\" part.

Our baby loves to bop to the music.The fish/shell balls are so-so. Our baby puts any old thing in, but likes to roll the balls. The fish and shell inside the balls spin when you roll them, which is kind of neat.

It was great for tummy or back time, since whenever he would poke or kick it he was rewarded with music and lights and swimming glittery fish. He would lie on his back and bonk the flutterballs together or wave them in the air to make the fish inside spin. When he started sitting, he loved to take the balls out and roll them around. He is now 10 months old. He still loves the toy. He takes the balls out, puts them back in, takes them out again and tosses them. He played with it even when the batteries wore out. Now he looks inside to see where the music is coming from. He turns the whole bowl upside down and whacks the bottom. It's been very durable and a lot of fun.

She was just learning to sit-up without falling over. This toy really helped. In just a few days she was sitting with no problem. She loved to hold on to the fishbowl and pull the balls out. Her 2 1/2 old brother also loves to take it away from her. He has learned to turn it on and play with it. They both love the sounds, lights and look at the fish floatting. Would recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for babys under 6 months","review":"i went and bought this for my 21 week old son today and he loves it. he is a baby who does not like tummy time and this toy has helped to get him to lay on his tummy for longer periods of time. he just lays and watchs the balls move and the bowls lights and music. this was well worth the money in my book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful toy","review":"This toy is gorgeous - a toy that makes noise but isn't annoying! The sounds of the ocean and the noise the water makes splashing around inside the bowl walls is really pleasant on the ears for parents and our baby loves it too. Putting the balls into the bowl makes different water and ocean sounds. It was an instant hit in our house this Christmas with all 3 of our children even though it was given to the youngest ... maybe because they love the beach. I also like the softer gentle colours of this range of toys from Fisher Price - makes a nice change from the bright red, blue, yellow, green and orange most of their toys are.Recommended - educational and durable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Neato","review":"My 5 month old baby loved this toy and still does and hes 8 months. It taught him to put in the balls and take them out. The lights, fish colors and motion, and water make the bowl very delightful for the babies. Each ball is interesting b/c of the spinning toys inside. My baby likes to put them in his mouth and move the bowl around the carpet. Very cute toy!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and Pleasant","review":"This toy stimulates the little ones with the music, water and sound effects as well as the fun balls with the sea creatures inside.

One main reason is this little device that allows you to carry both at once! The software is extremely easy to use. In part because there are no settings to change; you can only ever scan at 300 dpi (most flatbeds have much higher resolution, thus my rating of 4 stars).However, the image is crisp, color is good, and the unit snaps in very easily. I only wish they included a hard case like the one for the ink cartridge which came with the printer instead of a flimsy plastic \\"storage\\" bag. It is so tiny, this is probably the only scanner you'll ever worry about losing :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Portable Canon Scanner Cartridge","review":"This item has been the most durable piece to the little portable printer.

Anyway enough of my ramblings, \\"A Live Dead One\\" is an excellent companion to any Maiden album, and enriches both your knowledge, and respect for one of the greatest bands in the history of metal. This book chronicles the band's humble beginings in rural Englad, as well as their triumphant rise to metal masters. If you consider yourself a fan of great music first, buy either \\"Live After Death\\", or \\"Piece of Mind\\", along with this book and you will not be dissapointed.

The first 6 cuts of CD one are so unbelievably diverse, I can hardly believe one individual could possess such an ecclectic compositional palette. CD two is equally powerful with its treatment of some of his older compositions, and with an unbelievably moving arrangement of the Doxology.Great stuff....buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Six String Soul","review":"Herb Ellis is yet another unsung jazz guitarist. His sides with Oscar Peterson's legendary group added nuance and a subtle shade of soul to already perfect performances. Unfortunately, his often-times subdued playing meant you almost never really heard him play. This exceptional 1958 date, his \\"first\\" for a major label, is filled with brilliant playing. And though he doesn't aim for pyrotechnics, the album contains soft-hued pieces brimming with quiet soul and just a hint of his Texas swing roots. The remastering on this reissue is first-rate and brings the recording's nuances right to the fore. And for those of you who (like me) fell in love with his style, there's loads more out there... Ellis deserves a place of honour along with Grant Green, George Benson, Wes Montgomery, Charlie Christian, Barney Kessel and Joe Pass as a genuine genius of jazz guitar. Very easy on the ears, very relaxed riffing, very eye-opening performances. A perfect introduction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guitarists Worldwide...Just Own This!","review":"What a sad day when a CD of this caliber is over 46,000 on the Amazon sales list.And how sad it is that I've spent most of the night already writing reviews for another website that I cannot give it the credit it is lengthily due.Let me say this:If you own any Leo Kottke, Robert Johnson, John Fahey etc. etc. and you don't own this... shame, shame, shame!This recording is one of the greatest LIVE fingerstyle acoustic blues CD's EVER recorded.

I have appreciated this tribute to Italian singers such as Claudio Baglioni, Francesco De Gregori, Lucio Dalla, Modugno, Mina, Lucio Battisti, Fabio Concato and Gino Paoli. Ana's voice is both powerful and joyful and it's been able to touch my soul. I like the way she plays these songs. I hope that she means to record a \\"Viva l'Italia Vol.2\\" because Italy is full of beautiful songs. Hearing them in Spanish is charming for me because Italian and Spanish are somehow similiar.

This interactive video course is good but it needs updating to the newest exams.Installing and running was simple and there were no hitches with 95 and 98. It uses quicktime video so you have to have that in order to run. If you have the Moulton's A+ book this makes and excellent companion.Topics like components, buses, hard drives, logicboards, cpus, memory, printers, networking, communications, DOS, Windows, 95 and 98, troubleshooting are a few of the areas you'll find information for. Again this course covers the old exams and although it does have great information, you'll need other material.Each section of the course does have questions you have to answer before moving on.

His sucess is due to his amazing band and great songwriters who have been able to compensate for his short comings as a singer. I'm not saying he is completely horrible, I admit I own his greatest hits album. However, he cannot be mentioned in the same league with the all time greats of salsa, such as Frankie Ruiz. Someone of his caliber should stick to what made him famous, catchy love songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"A well-intentioned but disastrous project.","review":"Unfortunately, Jerry Rivera does not posess the soul or voice of the late Frankie Ruiz so this tribute CD (while well-intentioned) is disastrous. His cover versions of Frankie's classics \\"Desnudate Mujer\\",\\"Tu Eres\\", \\"El Camionero\\" and \\"Separemos Nuestras Vidas\\" are ludicrous at best. Frankie was one of the 1980's and '90s best salsa soneros and Jerry Rivera is quite simply NOT in his league."},{"rating":"2","title":"New to Jerry Rivera","review":"This CD made me want to hear more from Jerry - my boyfriend is a BIG Frankie Ruiz fan and he agrees that Jerry does a good job at interpreting his songs.

My 3 year old has never shown any interest in this toy. My five year old has played with it briefly about 2 times. Kasey sits and collects dust in our toy room. I feel bad that Grandma paid so much money for a toy that has not been used by either of my boys.

To be honest, I found him a little boring compared to the educational software that we have as well!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kasey has been shelved..","review":"I gave this toy a 1 star for fun because no one in my house and neighbors has played with it for more than a couple of minutes, Except my 4 year old son battles Kasey and the Fisher Price Resuce Hero robot URV. My 3 year old daughter was fasinated with the display at the store. Trying to avoid buying her more Barbie products, I thought this would be a good choice. It turns out, she is not that interested in its wonderful capabilities. Santa even velcroed a pink bow to his head to feminize it. Oh well, mom enjoys Kasey's humor, but my childrendo not."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like loud commercials you will like this toy.","review":"My 3 year old son received one of these for his birthday. We were excited to try it out but right away there was a problem. When Kasey spoke the \\"learning\\" part was quiet but all of a sudden it made these weird sound effects that were extremely loud. The sound effects are so loud that they make you not even want to play with it and the educational parts you practically have to lean in to here. And if that wasn't bad enough when you don't push a button fast enough it gives you attitude. I honestly don't know what they were thinking when they made this one.

This isn't a great toy.","review":"If you already have a Pixter or a LeapPad, this toy won't win your child's preference. If you don't have a Pixter or LeapPad, get one of those instead.To begin with, the thing is ergonomically ridiculous. This toy stands on the floor and has four buttons on the front that your child is supposed to push to make things happen based on what's on the screen. The screen is a cheap, dim LCD that's hard to read unless your child lays tummy down. In which case pushing the buttons is awkward and tends to knock the toy over (or at least make it slide backward). That gets tiring, so they won't play long.Our kids quickly decided that the best fun they could have was randomly pushing the buttons. For a while. Pixter and LeapPad, meanwhile, are still being used...."},{"rating":"2","title":"NMA's Worst Album - But still pretty good.","review":"I was disappointed greatly by this record when it was released in 2000, but it has grown on me. It's kind of meandering, mellowed and directionless (by NMA standards), with borderline junky production (sub-par drum sound and thin overall tone). Of course, even the worst New Model Army records are better than most albums out there. I of course highly recommend this thing -- Justin Sullivan is still one of the best songwriters on the planet, but on Eight, his first effort without longtime drummer Robert Heaton, he flounders a touch. Buy this album, but if you're new to the band buy a couple other ones first - namely Thunder and Consolation, The Ghost of Cain, or even Carnival. Only essential track is You Weren't There."},{"rating":"1","title":"could definatly be better......","review":"My 8yr old daughter LOVES legos. She was so excited to find a girls lego watch.

In particular, I like the pace of the film and the interplay between the Hackman and Baryshnikov characters. Also, the \\"confetti\\" jacket that Géraldine Danon wears when she meets Hackman at the restaurant deserves a look-see on its own. Finally, I was in the military on active duty stationed in Heidelberg, Germany during the time the movie was being filmed. Between 1990 and 1993, I also visited Berlin (both the former East and West), Paris (Le Tour Eiffel - but of course!), and flew in and out of BWI airport frequently. Every time I see this film I am transported back in time to those locations to recall exactly how they appeared back when. When this movie is on the air, I can't look away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ug!","review":"On late nite TV on a B channel where it deserved to be. No recognizable plot. while the premise is two opposing spies involved in a joint prisoner trade who get double crossed, it is not an action movie, it is barely a buddie movie, and it is certainly not a suspense movie. The double cross is explained weakly. Some of the scene set ups were just stupid. It just repeated the same shtick over and over - spy buddies move from one location to another, bad spies chase them, spy buddies escape in a not really exciting way--- next scene."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baryshnikov and Hackman save the day","review":"I watched this despite bad reviews because I really wanted to see Baryshnikov in a feature film like this. And he does a great job. I'm wondering why Hollywood never offered him more roles like this over the years, since he's really quite good at it. Despite the chemistry of the actors, the movie is just very hokey and pointless. They try to make the story interesting by alluding to the extent of corruption within the U.S. government, but I think that's all common knowledge these days and not really that shocking anymore. I was amused throughout the movie that the CIA and Russia were upset about losing 2 million dollars, because I kept thinking of scenes in Austin Powers when everyone is laughing at Dr. Evil for thinking 1 million dollars was a lot of money... In short, this movie was just kind of juvenile and nothing extraordinary. Baryshnikov fans should be pleased though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book on battles and campaigns","review":"If you are in the market for a good book on the major battles and campaigns of the Revolutionary Army then this is the book for you. The author does an excellent job in describing each event without going to exacting detail and boring the reader.

While it is not an all encompassing history of every battle, the author takes the chosen battles and does a fantastic job of putting the reader in the midst of the chaos.

I do not buy pocket size book for my home library cause I do not enjoy using them for reading or research work. The book would have been much more helpful if it had more table information and list as well as biographical information for the leaders of the battles.

It is the only revolutionary war battle fought within the State of Vermont. To me, such an obvious mistake puts the rest of the book's accuracy in question. Based on that alone, I won't buy it.P.S.

Imagine a Neil Simon play without a single laugh, without a semblance of wit, without a glimmer of insight into the human condition. And you have London Suite. Why go into the details of the story? It isn't Plaza Suite or California Suite. If you think the agonies of a man with a bad back are funny, this is made for you. Poor Madeline Kahn, being reduced in her mortal illness to taking a part in this disaster."},{"rating":"2","title":"ready for different?","review":"this cd is an amzing piece of art. its nothing in comparison to later works such as the postal service.. or other dntel cds. but its still non the less interesting. i think this is when jimmy was still expirementing, and its wierd. beware.. this is strictly music and no vocals.. you can get it from the phthalo reords site."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top to Bottom","review":"This CD is pleasant from beginning to end. Much like \\"Life is full of Possibilities\\", I believe the 1st track is the class of the CD. However, the rest of it will not dissapoint. Dntel has a sound VERY much different than The Postal Service.. and I don't just mean the lack of vocals. Dntel sounds much more analog.. natural, than the poppy, digitized sound of The Postal Service. It is a very soothing set of tracks. I only wish he stuck to this style. If you can find this CD, get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smooth rhythms by real Jazz Masters!","review":"Lionel Hampton (1909) belongs to the select group of great bandleaders and is one of the pioneers on the vibraphone. Typical is Hamptons rhythmical variation is his melodies, which in my opinion is a bit bebop-like.Oscar Peterson (1925) is a solid but smooth pianist, with experience in almost any period in Jazz. His style is complex and subtily smoooth ... He played with some of the great names in Jazz, which speaks for itself.Those two together make a great album, with beautiful melodies and offer an almost tender approach which can only be done by the great. The quality is fine, the music very relaxing. You could run it on the background all day, but its really too good for that! Listen and enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incorrect construction","review":"I have bought almost 8 shirts from this manufacturer. This particular model has problems.

You don't learn your children this way the Bible. Their was one play about how Santa Claus came to earth.

He was miserable and disappointed that he never wrote a best-selling novel. What he didn't realize is how important he was to boys that religiously read every Hardy Boys book. \\"The Secret Panel\\" is possibly Dixon's best story in the series. The Hardy Boys almost have a car accident with a mysterious man named John Meade and Joe finds a unique key with a weird symbol after he leaves. Later, they discover Mead owned a mansion in Bayport and he has been dead for five years. Things get even stranger when Chet Morton's beat up boat sinks for no apparent reason."},{"rating":"2","title":"For a Mortal kombat game, this was disapointing","review":"All the games of mortal kombat are five stars but this one went down. its a good game, not worth buying, rent it first, if you love it then you should buy.

They tend to be exciting, have some snappy dialogue, and often have great villains (Henry Silva, Basil Wallace).But let me digress for a moment. In the 1970s, there was a film, The Green Berets, that was called \\"the worst film of all time.\\" I watched it recently and it wasn't half bad. After all, it had The Duke and Aldo Ray in it. No, this Seagal excuse for an environmental diatribe is insulting to environmentalists, to oil companies, to Alaskan natives, and to horses!It portrays the Alaskans as so dumb that they claim horses came from the western hemisphere (they were introduced by the Spaniards).I tried watching it recently, and could not finish it. It was just too dumb.My recommendation: stay away. Watch Fire Down Below instead: good story, GREAT music, and good red-necky villains."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read for Children of All Ages","review":"This book is destined to become a family treasure, a favorite for children of all ages.

I have to say that I am thankful I didn't pay the premium cost they are asking for this product. It was the most uncomfortable shave I've ever had next to dry-shaving. The idea of the single blade on the reverse side for \\"precision\\" is only useful because the five blade side is so bulky it can't be manipulated well enough to give a clean line for sideburns or under the nose.Immediately after my shave I had a five o'clock shadow, which was promptly cleaned up by shaving AGAIN with my Mach 3.What's next from Gillette? 20 blades to remove the first layer of skin and gouge out the hair folicle?

The 6th single blade is gimmicky but good for what it is for...under the nose and sideburns.I cringed when I saw the cost of replacement blades but buy your blades on EBAY and save lots of money.

I fought battle after battle just trying to get it to adhere to the fixture. Finally, I got it to stick by using some glue as a catalyst. In addition the tape itself was difficult to peel away, and I couldn't get the film itself to shrink by blowing hot air on to it.

The plastic sheets were slightly smaller and had a different feel to them, and the roll of tape was plain white and not marked with the Frost King logo like last year's batch was.Last year, the tape stuck tightly to the plastic. This year, it would barely stick. and I had to press it very hard before it would stay. Then, during the shrink-wrap phase, the hair dryer caused the plastic to break almost immediately. It's the same dryer I used on the previous year's batch, and I was careful not to get it too close to the plastic or hold it too long in one spot.Junk.

So we were at Home Depot and thought we'd buy a kit for the patio door, we saw the Frost King, figured it would be just like the Duck brand we used and so we bought it. After hours of frustration this morning, I have finally ripped it down and threw it in the garbage. What a waste of money, now I will be heading back to Wal-mart to buy a Duck brand kit for the patio door. I hate Wal-mart but it is worth it to use a product that actually works. There tape is much more durable and thicker than the thin stuff you get with Frost King.

Unfortunately, the tape is WORTHLESS. It's less than half an inch wide, which absolutely won't provide enough surface area to support a sheet of plastic 84\\" x 110\\", especially if there's a draft coming through the window.Here's the logical issue: If I'm buying an insulation sheet for my window, it's probably because the window isn't sealed very well, which means there's a draft coming through, which means that the insulation sheet I buy needs to come with tape that is sticky enough to be DRAFT RESISTANT.

They do breath really well so if you're sweating you'll stay dry. Great idea in a cooler. So as you move around the breeze from moving passes right through it and evaporates the sweat on you making you even colder. They don't even fit as they should. The bottom is loose and the sleeves are loose and they are tight in the top. I have other thermals that fit very well but these do not. I even went two sizes smaller then the suggested sizing because I new I did not wear an XL as their sizing said I would based on my measurements.Maybe I received something wrong because what I have is a very thin all nylon looking shirt that is about as thick as spandex and has the same slick feel.

Definitely an excellent choice for the lover of classic mystery fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"The first Wolfe stands up with the best of them.","review":"Having recently made the acquaintance of Rex Stout's eccentric sleuth, Nero Wolfe, I have been devouring the (thankfully numerous)items in the canon as I find them. One of the endearing things about Nero Wolfe's world is its consistency and solidity. The characters are clearly drawn and clearly themselves. I must admit, however, that I was surprised to discover, when I ran into FER DE LANCE in the course of my explorations, that this is actually the first Wolfe novel. Archie and Wolfe, Theodore and Fritz, and the brownstone on 35th are as notably themselves in this, the first of the series, as they are anywhere in the series. If you read attentively, you may pick up a few clues here and there that show that the author was not completely polished, not totally settled into the world of Nero Wolfe yet - but there's nothing obvious, and that is quite an achievement. This is one strong first book, and an original twist on the murder mystery to boot!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgraceful","review":"Bantam was in a hurry to monetize their Nero Wolfe license and did not even bother with a basic proofread. The printing is littered with mistakes. Some are just annoying; others completely confuse and alter the meanings of important sentences. Since the writing is from another time, phrases and phrasings are different; thus it becomes difficult to tell whether a sentence is strange because language has changed or because some idiot at Bantam couldn't be bothered to pull her finger out of her nose long enough to do a classic justice. Possibly the worst offense is that the back cover blurb needlessly reveals a major plot point that happens towards the end of the book. I will NEVER buy another Bantam book again. You shouldn't either. These illiterates shouldn't be printing PennySavers let alone a classic of detective fiction that still sells robustly and enjoys a healthy popularity. Disgraceful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stout is great, his reader is abominable","review":"Saul Rubinek, who reads many of Rex Stout's books on tape, is excellent. For my money, he's the best in the business. For that reason, it was with some reservation that I purchased Fer-De-Lance read by Michael Prichard. Would that I had listened to my reservations. Prichard can't read. He has a voice that could sell a lot of Buicks on tv ads between innings on a Sunday afternoon. He should be kept well away from actual prose. Long pauses in the middle of clauses, no awareness of the meaning of the words that come stumbling out of his mouth. My best guess is that Prichard is the result of a bizzare experiment in which he learned perfect English pronunciation but has absolutely no understanding of the meaning of any of the words in the English language, and he sees punctuation as unnecessary decoration."},{"rating":"2","title":"First sighting of Wolfe","review":"Of course, a must read for Wolfe fans. Archie has yet to find his true voice, and there's no Cramer yet, but Wolfe starts as he means to go on. Stands the test of time better than any of the other early books before Some Buried Caesar. A good and original plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Detective","review":"I remember reading Rex Stout in High School and not really getting the humour. I'm so glad I read this again. This is really a classic detective story, a good plot and no obvious murderer. 12 years on and the odd bits of humour, Archie's obvious confusion on what Nero Wolfe is planning and the great mysterious Nero Wolfe is very enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stout is a master","review":"Rex Stout is one of my favorite authors of all time. If you're new to his works, beware, you'll become addicted. But that isn't such a bad thing, he was a prolific writer and you'll not soon run out of material. Fer-De-Lance is the first Stout published about the now famous team of inspiring, albeit grumpy and slighly neurotic, genius detective Nero Wolfe and charming legman Archie Goodwin, who frequently purposely ruffles Nero's feathers. This book is definitely worth reading. Highly entertaining, with one caveat: if you have never read Wolfe before, begin with a different one as your very first. Try Some buried Caesar, or The Silent Speaker first to help you develop a feel for this incredible duo....then I think you'll appreciate Fer-De-Lance more. (You can also find Nero Wolfe on cable TV... a serious treat for any Wolfe fan) Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic period writing and unmatched Stout charm","review":"Fer-de-lance remains the source one of Stout's greatest creations: Nero Wolfe. Not so much becuase Wolfe himself is such a great character but rather he provides so much for Archie to talk about. For anyone who missed out on the unmitigated energy, charm and social manipulations of depression era New York will enjoy the book merely as a period peice. THe dialog remains some of the best in mystery writing and those stuck in British cozies have something to move on to."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic, still","review":"I read this 40 years ago and again this month. It's a simple good vs bad classic with excellent writing and legendary characters. I intend to re-read the entire series."},{"rating":"2","title":"We meet Nero and Archie","review":"The first in a genius series, but it doesn't matter whether you read this series in order or not, Rex Stout masterfully makes each new book stand on it's own. You come to love these characters and can follow the series wherever you pick it up. I have read every Nero Wolfe more than once over the years, I now happily am re-reading them. This one is superb."},{"rating":"1","title":"The starting point for all critics of Marx","review":"This book has some virtues, in terms of clarity of exposition, but as a reading of Marx it leaves a lot to be desired. Like Jon Elster's attempts of making (non)sense of Marx that followed it, this text reads into Marx a set of assumptions taken for granted within neoclassical economics but entirely foreign to Marx's work. If you want to see how Marx and Marxism measure up to the unquestionable and seemingly unthinkable criteria of bourgeois thought, read this. But if you want to understand Marx, read Althusser. 'For Marx' is a good place to start, but be sure to read the essays collected in 'The Humanist Controversy' and 'Philosophy and the Spontaneous Philosophy of the Scientists' too, not to mention 'Reading Capital' and 'Machiavelli and Us' ... Cohen may be easier to read, but only because Cohen doesn't challenge any of the ideology of capitalism that is as invisible to most people as water is to the fish that swim in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A valuable and very practical book by a leading RF designer.","review":"This is an excellent book which introduces all the concepts in an easily understood form and which has proven very valuable in day to day design of RF oscillators. If you need to begin designing oscillators then you should seriously consider adding this to your collection.If you want to deal with some of the more advanced topics then consider getting a copy of Microwave and Wireless RF synthesizer theory and design by Ulrich Rohde which has excellent chapters on oscillator design.Now if we could just persuade Ulrich and Randy to write a book together........."},{"rating":"1","title":"a sleeping pill","review":"Like other Rhea's books, this one put me to sleep after a few pages.

It gets damp - I want to wash it after each wearing. And my glasses fog up - guess that goes with balaclava territory if you are a grandma.Kinda fun - I look like Miss Darling Sweetie Pie from Jacob Two-Two (the old lady who was a secret ninja).I'm buying two more, so that I have a clean one every day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Small","review":"Very small product.

I wear a large helmet but this is really snug fit. I lost my old one which i believe was cotton and fit better. It fit more like a sock. This one fits like a wetsuit. tight. It smashed my nose down when i ride. Before you buy make sure you want a snug fit balaclava."},{"rating":"1","title":"is not ONE size fits all","review":"I purchased this after losing my Under Armour Tactical Hood, which fit with plenty of room to spare and was perfect for eating or drinking without needing to remove the whole thing off. When I first pulled the package out I noticed right away that it said \\"fits most sizes\\" and knew I would have a problem. I tried putting it on and my head had trouble fitting thru the neck area. I finally got it on I noticed the stitching goes right down the middle of your face and the stitching rubbed against my lips and figured it would irritate my lips if worn for a long period of time.If you wear a 7 1/2 or larger fitted hat or have a 22 1/2 inch or larger head I strongly suggest you find another Balaclava as this will most likely not fit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too impressed","review":"This balaclava was purchased to use on my 30-40 degree bike rides. It was too tight on my jaw and made breathing distracting. I have a smaller head too. It was not very warm. There is stiching down the center of the chin and is chaffs a bit. Disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Balaclava way too SMALL","review":"Like other reviewers, I find this balaclava to be way too small. It is definitely not one-size-fits-most. I have a normal sized head and nose, and it fits way too tight on both. One would think they can make a nylon material that conforms to the shape of one's head without being too tight (like Under Armour's products).Oh well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fit, warm, flexible.","review":"I bought this to wear under my helmet while riding my bike in the winter months. It fits great (snug without being tight), is long enough in the neck to tuck into my shirt, and is flexible so that i can easily pull it down under my chin when i didn't want it up over my nose/mouth. The material is nice and soft and relatively thin so it's not at all annoying. Very happy with this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"under helmet","review":"Made in china,it is very thin and poor quality.

False advertisement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks like the picture, but it is paper thin","review":"For the price, what do you expect (I suppose), but there is NO WARMTH in this thing. It is just a CAMO cover for you head while playing in the woods, but that is all it is. It is wafer thin (but decently made), and will provide no environmental protection of ANY kind... so don't be fooled. It is not for Skiing or cold weather protection, just for decoration."},{"rating":"2","title":"No problems","review":"This item is worth the few dollars it costs. Should last for a few months. Is very thin and runs tight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Product delivered on time.","review":"Theres not much you can say about balaclavas, however it's labeled as ONE SIZE, if you're a larger man it will initially be tight on your face but will form over time.

The product was delivered on time and reasonably packaged."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY tight fit, but cheap and serves its purpose","review":"I bought mine from powersport superstore, and it fulfilled the purposed I bought it for.Living in the cold midwest weather takes a toll on you whenever it gets below 0* F, and that is not even counting the wind chill and it blowing in your face.Luckily I haven't had a chance to try it against a blizzard, but I do beware about how it is a VERY tight fit, even me being 6 foot tall, weighing around 130 (you can tell, not much fat on me), it is very much a \\"fit as is\\" type of item.It does not stretch, and will most likely make your nose feel uncomfortable, if first buy on this kind of item beware.It covers my face very nicely, but if talking or needing to breathe heavily might be uncomfortable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Value","review":"It's hard for me to find one of these that is'nt made from too heavy of a material and thus too hot when I use it on my bike in the winter.

The graphics are nearly equivelant to Diablo II. However, the storyline is so on par with games like Elder Scrolls. It's a game from back in the day when games were about more than just who could create the best looking guts or explosion, or the most real looking fire or water. It's back when the story and hook and catch mattered. Back when games were truly addictive. You wanna play a game that will captivate you? Truly keep you coming back for more? Just get through the first two levels, then you're into the game too deep to let go... Personally, the game deserves 5 stars for story and plot and playability alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying, and no re-play value","review":"Like many players, I found the disk changing aspect quite annoying. Also, the graphics, for requiring as much hardware as they do, were rather poor. The LoL:GoD graphics were better, and that's sad, since it came out years earlier, and they were worse than the ones in the first game! Also, I don't think the game setup is all that fun; the guild idea would be cooler if you couldn't join every one. Like, if you had to give something up to play the game through, thereby creating re-play value. As it stands, LoL3 should have gone through more review sessions before being published. Westwood, have you ever heard of beta testers?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that good","review":"Just the top part vibrates; the bottom part of the brush does nothing.

I had to check the size to see if I received the correct one.

This bra keeps that from happening. I no longer feel pain when playing sports or running.I also don't feel as self-conscious when working out which is another added bonus.The bra is comfortable and supports my chest well. There is a hook-and-eye closure with a tab cover up that snaps in the back; which is part of the reason this bra can be so comfortable, look good, and have great support.I will continue to buy this product, as needed, in the future to keep me in my high impact sports."},{"rating":"2","title":"good support but awkward to put on","review":"I have taken up running and needed a supportive sports bra for my C's!

If you like music, you must buy this CD, then wear it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly stunning masterpiece","review":"The Pat Metheny Group achieved their grand apex with this 1985 release. This is one of those rare albums of such stunning beauty that you are almost overwhelmed...speechless. I agree with another reviewer that the title track is one of the greatest songs of our time -- a cinematic epic full of optimism and performed with breathtaking finesse. \\"If I Could\\" is one of the most exquisitely gentle acoustic guitar tracks I've ever heard, and \\"Mas Alla (Beyond)\\" is tear-jerking rush of emotion fueled by Pedro Aznar's incomparable voice. DO NOT be fooled by the \\"Forward March\\" introduction, which is a jokey sketch deliberately played off-key like a poorly rehearsed high school marching band -- as if to disguise the rush of musical perfection that follows.I can't say enough good things about this album, suffice to say that this a bona fide \\"desert island disc\\" that will change your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Money can't buy cds like this.....","review":"As I write this review I am listening to the title track, First Circle. I became infatuated with Pat Metheny within the last couple of months and stumbled upon this cd through research of this wonderful musician. I bought the cd used for a less than average price. The title track alone actually makes me feel guilty that I didn't pay hundreds of dollars for the cd. Just as others have said, you cannot put into words what this song DOES to you. It Inspires you, which I believe is the best compliment you could possibly give to a piece of music. Please purchase this cd and play the title track as loud as feesibly possible, and if it doesn't truly change your outlook on life then you must not be living, and you surely don't know what music MEANS.I know these must seem like strong words, but do yourself a favor and see for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"This album is pure garbage, none of the tracks are credited to Bronze Nazareth. These appear to be tracks by Bronze before he got with the Wu. The beats are terrible, the rhymes are lackluster. I'd suggest if you're really in to Bronze get his solo album, the great migration, and his group effort The Wiseman. Those are the official albums you want to get. Don't get souped in to this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is Ware?","review":"I had hoped this book would have more about Chris Ware, but most of it is the author's boring observations about comic art and his theories about what Ware is drawing. I would much rather read about the subject's childhood, and especially the details of his time in art school and in Austin. Instead there's endless verbiage in the Scott McCloud vein. A few interesting reproductions of Ware creations I hadn't seen before are included, but not much else is worth recommending."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best $350 espresso maker you can buy","review":"The best $350 espressomaker you can buy (don't spend more than $350!).

Way more fun than just clicking on targets with a mouse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suprised by the high quality.","review":"I bought this just because it was cheap and was not expecting much. This is a very WELL-MADE mouse. Getting used to it was not hard at all, despite what others say. Just make sure you calibrate the Pistol Mouse in windows, to move 'slower' than a normal mouse and it offers fine control. Nothing beats this and the Nostromo N52 for first person shooters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Corrupt U. S.

But I had assumed that Emma Tennant would have at least STUCK TO Charlotte Bronte's story!You start to read it and begin to note the creative liberties and changes that the author made; they start small only startling you a little, making you wonder where the author's twists intend to take you. Then it just becomes ridiculously laughable. LAUGH OUT LOUD laughable!It is a very 'creative' story and an easy read (if your stomach can take it). I only recommend this people who read Jane Eyre a loooooong loooong time ago, and only vaguely recollect events and names....it will put the reader in the same frame of mind that the author was in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why does author bother?","review":"I picked this book up because I love Jane Eyre and had a renewed interest after seeing the excellent Masterpiece Theatre version last month. Emma Tennant has written a few sequels to Pride and Prejudice which were terrible, but I thought I'd give her yet another chance. This book was so bad, I didn't even finish it. Too many narrators, characters inconsistent with the source material, idiotic storylines, etc., etc.Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointing","review":"The first half of the novel is well done, and enchanting in places. However, plot twists often become confusing, and by the last chapter, we are led to the most implausible surprise-- that Mrs. Fairfax was somehow the evil queen in all this. Nothing in the entire novel prepared us for this, and thus, it felt completely contrived. Perhaps the author was trying to be gothic, but she failed utterly to convince this reader. I felt cheated of the true richness and emotional depth that is \\"Jane Eyre.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"huh?","review":"While I liked following the new perspectives of an old favorite, it seemed like Tennant was trying too hard to write as a classic. I was often confused by what she was writing. The wording/descriptions were awkward, difficult to follow, and not completely confident (or competent)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A total waste of time...","review":"Not only is this book horribly written, but it is hard to follow. The author skips around, while changing the original premise of the book, so you are often at a loss about what is going on. It's as if she's trying to tell the \\"real\\" story of what happened in the original book. She throws in various hints at sadism and lesbianism, and I wonder if this was just to create a buzz about a book she herself knew wouldn't make much sense. The characters come off as disgusting, even making Jane a jello-headed twit. Adele is compared to Rochesters insane wife, and you will find it hard to find one sympathetic character. I wasn't expecting much from this book, but it was much much worse than I would have thought. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"very poor writing, poor storyline","review":"I read this w/ high anticipation but both the outlandish storyline and the unusually poor authorship made it a vast disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good.","review":"I remember reading a portion of this novel in a class in which I read Jane Eyre. That excerpt sparked my interest but, when I started reading this novel, that interest was quickly sullied by the bad prose, inattention to detail, and the stupidity of the plot (especially toward the end). This book is not worth your time or money. For a much better \\"rewrite\\" of Jane Eyre, read Jean Rhyss' Wide Sargasso Sea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did she read Jane Eyre?","review":"It's an interesting concept, but if you love Jane Eyre, don't read this book. The plot is slightly confusing, but besides that, there are many small details from Jane Eyre that the author has either changed or seemed to miss entirely. I expected a romance, but instead, I found something that trashed the story of Jane and Edward Rochester."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wouldn't bother reading it if I were you!","review":"I purchased and read this book after reading several other negative reviews because I'm stubborn. I wish I'd saved my money. The story is (I'm not sure I have the words to describe it)vague, disjointed. Even than doesn't seem like an adequate description. It's almost as if the author were hallucinating. . .it just doesn't make much sense a lot of the time. I'm currently reading \\"Jane Eyre's Daughter\\" and enjoying it much more.

Though it wasn't her first film, and it was a very small role, she got a lot of exposure. But aside from that, the movie is excellent. A really great gangster flick that has suspense and violence, but not graphic enough for the family not to enjoy together.Basically a motley crew is assembled to take out a department store. It will be the biggest jewel heist in the Mid-west. Doc is the aging mastermind, Dix is the heavy, and also a sleazy, two bit financer, a crooked lawyer, a safe cracker, and a driver.Marilyn's part is that of the old lawyer's young lover, who finally confesses and blows the lawyer's alibi out of the water. I bought the movie because Marilyn was in it. But I would still like it without her. This is probably the best movie she appeared in when she wasn't the star. Some would say 'All About Eve' was, but I didn't care for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Far Far Beyond \\"A Classic Movie\\" (An Example Of Karma)","review":"Someone here wrote that this movie is showing its age. Nothing is further from the truth. A movie like \\"Pulp Fiction\\" doesn't come close to this serious movie. This movie has \\"Pulp Fiction\\" beat all to hell because the plot is more real. The acting is at a MUCH higher level. It's the strong characterization developed by superbly executed acting in this movie that sets \\"The Asphalt Jungle\\" above movies like \\"Pulp Fiction\\". Every character in this movie was 'done in' by his/her own foibles. This, is an example of karma, an Eastern concept that was used in pulp crime movies of that era. John Huston conciously emphasized that concept, karma, in \\"The Asphalt Jungle\\". You will not finde a better \\"Crime Genre\\" film than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oldie but goodie (still)","review":"Worth watching!Easily caught up in the great robbery plot,the viewer finds the villains likeable and the police the evildoers.

From the sterling acting (no pun intended) of Sterling Hayden, Louis Calhern, Jean Hagen, James Whitmore, Sam Jaffe and the rest of the cast to the superb direction of John Huston, THE ASPHALT JUNGLE is a film noir that portrays criminals who commit a heist as human beings with motivations and flaws, and it is this that gives the film its true sense of tragedy when the final reel finishes rolling.A terrific movie that provides the audience an early look at one Marilyn Monroe, this film noir about a criminal heist gone wrong is 1950 film noir at its best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense crime movie!","review":"I have seen this flick twice now. I loved it both times. \\"It is an on-the-edge-of your seat\\" sort of movie with a good crime story and will actually have you rooting for the bad guys!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy birds, Sad squirrels","review":"We were looking for a bird feeder that would keep the squirrels from eating all the food. We had tried others, but the squirrels out here seemed to enjoy eating through the wire / plastic / wood. This one is perfect because of the design - the squirrels try to get at it, but it spins and tilts, knocking them off (we have it hung on a hook that projects a good 12\\" from the post on our deck). Also, the way the panels are designed keeps the food in instead of dumping it on the ground when the squirrels spin and tilt it. Another plus is that the bigger birds (blue jays, crows, and yes, TURKEYS - they get on the deck railing to eat, but can't get to this one) can't use this one comfortably at all. We are very pleased with this bird feeder and plan on buying another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing product","review":"This birdfeeder has enough going against it that I wouldn't purchase it if given another chance. The central wire makes it swing much more in the wind, making it difficult for birds to feed on a windy day. Although the cover has a button to hold the lid in place, on windy days, the button doesn't hold well and the bird food dumps all over the ground. Also, the plastic windows aren't big enough and are barely held in place by the 2 metal clips that line the side of each edge. The plastic fell out when the wind blew my feeder off a really secure branch. However, at least it didn't break. So, overall, I'm not happy with this feeder and wouldn't recommend it to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bird feeder","review":"This is a great bird feeder. It is large enough to hold 5lbs. of feed, but not so big it bends the tree branch down. It is a very nice feeder and is made of high quality material. I am very happy with this feeder and so are the birds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very happy","review":"I'm disappointed with this product. I agree with the reviewer who said that the wire with the plastic button doesn't hold the cover firmly in place. This makes the food spill all over the ground. The holes are too big, too. I put tape on the inside over the openings to make them smaller so if the feeder tips less spills out. Also, when you fill it, it's too easy for the plastic sides to get dislodged--then the food really pours out. On top of all this, the birds seem to prefer my $7.99 feeder from the hardware store. I'm not going to toss this, but I wouldn't buy it again. More trouble than it's worth, and wasteful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip This One","review":"Birdfeeder has a couple of design flaws that make it unuseable as far as our yard goes. The top does not fit secure on top (slips off with the slightest bump) and the press clip slide on the wire that releases the top to move up and down does not hold securely. Therefore... top is easily set askew when a squirrel jumps causing the feeder to lean to one side and stay there and spilling seed. I don't know how the reviewer can say that the seed doesn't spill. I lose about a cup of seed everytime the squirrel jumps on it. Cute feeder - bad design. Going to my auction box. Waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely NOT Squirrel Proof!","review":"I only had this up for a couple of days, and the squirrels quickly learned how to \\"jump\\" on it to make it swing wildly which causes the lid to come off (despite being secured) and seeds dropping to the ground. The squirrels then drop to the deck and eat the seeds, along with birds and chipmunks. Blasted squirrels!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tulip Garden Lantern Bird Feeder","review":"Basically, this bird feeder is fairly priced, but its plastic construction, especially the clear plastic side panels, is likely to break easily. Small birds sit comfortably on the 4 small perches while feeding. However, large gray squirrels still manage to feed by hanging upside down from the dome. The small Douglas squirrels sit on one small perch and reach around around a corner to feed from another side opening. We will still need to invest in a squirrel baffle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smaller Than Expected","review":"Claims to hold 5 pounds, but holds maybe 2 pounds or less of sunflower seeds. I don't see how it could hold 5 pounds of anything. Plus, design allows birds to scatter a significant number of seeds on the ground. I'm also concerned about rain getting in through the large openings. I may try to block them partially. It looks nice, but I wouldn't order another because of the design."},{"rating":"2","title":"off balance","review":"Excellent quality. Attractive product. However when lifting the top to fill with seed the body of the feeder tips a spills seed."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far, it's good.","review":"At first the birds wouldn't come. It took a long time to discover the feeder. The squirrels do seem to stay away from it. We also have a squirrel guard, but that never stopped them before. So, maybe it's doing the job. It's very attractive, and we get many birds now."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty, simple, working just fine","review":"These simple but strong feeders do hold a nice amount. They seem like they will last for years. Especially nice when full of food."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tilts and empties all seed.","review":"A design flaw in this feeder. There is no center bar to keep the wire from sliding into the corner. This effectively dumps the seed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spills A Lot","review":"The squirrels have not managed to get into this bird feeder, but they don't need to. It spills so much seed that there is plenty for them on the ground. It spills when I try to fill it. It spills when larger birds try to eat. It spills when little birds eat. It spills in the wind. If the seed lands on my deck, the squirrels get it after all. If it lands in a flower pot, it sprouts and I have millet along with flowers.It looks OK and might work if you have squirrels and have a place to hang the feeder where a lot of seed on the ground is not a problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful!","review":"I have a problem with squirrels.

However, for those who commonly grate hard cheese, I'd recommend a rotary cheese grater or microplane. However, it does not look nearly as delightful sitting on a counter or table.The rubber rim around the bottom is loose and has since been lost on mine, this doesn't detract from it visually, nor did it help much functionally, so it didn't matter.People frequently comment on it's attractiveness, and I have since gotten it for someone as a gift.

At the pool, I just put a beach towel in there for my little one to lay on, no need to weigh it down with anything else unless it is a very windy day. I love that is has mesh on three sides so that the baby gets air and you can see them easily from any angle, but the sun is not getting them.

We use it by the water at our lakehouse so the baby doesn't get too much sun. Works perfect, and it has lots of room too. Can even withstand wind when weighted down - this is exactly what we wanted!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute! Easy to Assemble","review":"Its cute, great for outdoors and inside...I have it set up inside my daughters room and she loves to crawl in and out of it. But...it doesnt have stakes or anywhere to use stakes...so cant use it on a windy day without something weighing it down...besides that its great."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"For our first child we had the quick cabana we loved it!! It however only survived two years with an active toddler, two dogs and a cat. This time we opted for a cheaper version intended for the beach. It is awkward to put up especially on a windy beach. You have to watch the direction of the sun because sun gets through all sides. The vecro closure is a pain. To weigh the tent down we had to put our beach bag in it not leaving much room for our nine month old. If you are looking for a tent for little ones to play inside and intend to keep it up this is the tent for you. If you want a tent for the beach or just to be outside. Go for the quick cabana. We loved that tent and wish we would have spent the extra money. This tent for us has become a playroom tent. You get what you pay for. Wish we would have gone with the quick cabana"},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke on 3rd usage","review":"This tent was actually great for the time that it lasted. Problem is that that was only 2 days. One piece of the flexing plastic poles that form its frame broke, rendering the whole tent unusable. Would recommend paying more for something more robust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for my child","review":"My son was 10 months old when I purchased this for outdoors. He kept trying to get out of it by trying to get through the sides, so it would end up tipping over with him in it. Maybe this is good if you have a passive baby, but not so active.I didn't give it 2 stars for durability or educational either. I give it 1 all around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Portable Play Tent","review":"It was pretty easy to assemble, but we tried to use it for the beach with our 4 month old and it wasn't a success. It kept blowing away, wasn't 100% sun protection and it was hot inside. When it blew away we got sand all over the little guy - which was a BUMMER! It would be nice if it had little pockets on the side so you could shovel sand into it. For an infant and beach use, not the best purchse for us. Probably good for parks and when it is a bit cooler."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Shelter and Play tent","review":"We bought this as a last- moment decision before a trip to Hawaii - I was concerned my 6 month old would get too much sun and sand or I would have to hold him too much while he is so wiggly. This did the trick! He stayed in with his toys, and now my 3 yr old has it up in a play space for privacy. Good purchase for us."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good, except in the wind","review":"I just got back from the beach where I attempted to use this baby tent. The first two days, which were pretty calm, I thought it was great. The remainder of the week I found that it was too windy to use. It never blew away (probably because I had a heavy beach towel on the bottom) but it would kind of get blown around violently. I don't think that another similar product would have been better but I just had unrealistic hopes for what kind of conditions it could be used in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice for the price.","review":"I purchased this tent to take to the beach this summer for my 15 month old son to nap in. Although, we have not gone to the beach yet, I have set the tent up for him to play in and get familiar with so he won't be afraid of it at the beach. He was skiddish of it at first and I had to sit in it with him. He is used to it now and plays in it on our back porch almost every day! It seems as though it will be good shade on the beach and it was worth the money just for him to play in it at our house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It!","review":"Putting it together is a snap! I bought this item purposely to take my 5 month old to the beach. It was a great investment. He played and napped in the tent without any problems.

I have since seen tents that are easier to put together with one pull of a string. This is easy to store in the bag they give you. But I wouldn't recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tough to put together","review":"Once put together, this tent is exactly what we wanted. The issue is actually getting it assembled. It took two people to get the poles into their holders. We were hoping to bring this to the beach with us but I can't imagine trying to get it set up while our little one is sitting in the sun. I think it's worth it to pay slightly more money and get a pop-up tent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tested positive for lead","review":"We were very pleased with the item until my husband saw my daughter chewing on one of the frame pieces and decided to use an at-home lead test to test it. Sure enough, it tested positive for lead!

But the truth is, there is no way to secure it in the sand or prevent your little guy or girl from tipping it over again and again.The tent itself seems very strong and well-made. However, the poles don't dig down into the sand, and there are no pouches on it to fill with sand to weight it down. From what I hear, the Infant Cabana from One Step Ahead (although more costly) is a much better way to go. I guess you get what you pay for.My son was able to play with his toys in this tent, but once he saw people outside, he was pushing on the mesh screens to try and get to us, and the tent just kept tipping over. Very frustrating and NOT relaxing at all. We spent a week at the beach and used it only once before we realized it was pretty much useless.If I had it to do over again...I'd try One Step Ahead. I've never been disappointed by them. Should've known better."},{"rating":"1","title":"tips over way too easy","review":"The Description Says It is for kids up to two years old, but my child easily tips this over at sixteen months by pushing on the walls, not safe at all. If the tent had not been sitting partially under my kitchen table, my kid would have slapped his face right into the tile floor. Reading one of the other posts about this product containing lead, it's going back for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets the job done","review":"I bought this for my daughter when we went on vacation to the beach. Its quick and easy set up. The only negative side is that it is very lightweight and could easily blow away while at the beach so we put all of her toys in there and it was wonderful. It covered her from the sun and gave her her own little play area and i recommend it to anyone going away to a sunny place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very portable!","review":"Went to Fort Lauderdale, FL for a week and brought this playtent to the beach with us everyday.First of all, it's very portable as it is lightweight and easily packs in a small bag...so no issuesfor fitting this in our luggage.Setting it up was quite simple, I had it set up in less than 5 minutes and added a towel inside for added comfort.My 11 month old baby boy would stay and play in it a bit (which was great because atleast I didn't have to worry about him putting sand in his mouth that sometimes has little pieces of broken seashells) but mostly it was useful because he did his morning nap in the tent. As for my 3.5 year old boy, it wasn't really appropriate for him.When the baby wasn't inside, because the tent was so lightweight, he would just hit it and move it around.So for this price I think it's worth it for the babies and young toddlers (under 2?)!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I bought this tent for my 4 1/2 month old because it stated on the description that it offered UV protection. We were going on a family vacation and I needed something to protect the baby while on the beach. This product is a waste of money if you need it for the outdoors:1. It does not say UV protected anywhere on the packing - this is a lie. I contacted the company twice about this and they cannot provide me with an answer. They will not confirm or deny it, which is false advertising.2. There is no way to anchor the tent. The tent was blowing all over the place. I had to put bags inside to weigh it down. I didn't even put my baby in there for fear she would blow away. I brought it to the beach the first day and didn't even bother bringing it back.If you want the tent for play indoors it should be fine but do not expect to use it outdoors especially if it is windy or sunny."},{"rating":"1","title":"it was just okay","review":"we bought this nursery tent to take to the beach with us to protect our 9 month old son from the sun. we liked the mesh netting which allowed air to flow through the tent. however, one day was pretty windy and the anchors provided are not sturdy enough to secure it. the wind toppled it over with our son lying inside. it didn't blow away or very far since we were sitting right next to it, but it still toppled over. i wouldn't recommend it for a trip to the beach!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for the beach!!!!","review":"This product is inexpensive, light to carry, easy to assemble and disassemble, and my 7 month old just loves being in it! When we are at the beach, my daughter never missed a nap because I would lay her in the tent and she would sleep happily. The mesh allowed the breeze to come through but not the flies. I definitely recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Provides sun protection--but it gets HOT inside!","review":"This tent is easy to assemble and folds up neatly into the sachel provided. The tent provides adequate sun protection. Great for the beach as it rinses clean from sand and spills. It does, however, get quite hot inside. The ocean breeze could not penetrate the sides of the tent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful","review":"This tent was very useful and easy to put together. I used it at my home and even my 5 year old liked to hang out in it. We used it for my infant at the beach one afternoon and it was perfect for blocking the sun and having time in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"Avid music fans, my parents got this for our 6-month-old daughter for Christmas. We sat her on it at 7 months, and now at 8 1/2 mo. she wants to play it almost every day. She pulls her self up to standing using the handles, rocks it back and forth, and bangs on the keys to keep the music coming. It plays a full c-scale on the self-play mode and even allows for three-finger chords. The keys light up when they are pressed. Very cool starter piano for little ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"not sturdy","review":"I got this for my 15 mt old daughter for Christmas. I am most disappointed with the lack of sturdiness of the plastic base pieces. Also, there are levers that you can flip down under the piano part that is supposed to keep the piano steady instead of letting it rock. My piano levers did not work and the piano always rocks. The long piece that runs from the piano base out to hold the seat part is very flimsy and bends quite easily. The seat itself does not fit properly onto the long plastic piece that is supposed to hold it. The screws to attach the long piece to the piano and the screws to attach the seat were very difficult to work with and they never did go in right. My daughter does love to play the keys on the piano and the music is quite nice but the design of the seating section needs some improvement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and entertaining","review":"I bought this piano for my granddaughter as she was so fascinated with it in the store. Her mom has a piano and keyboard at their house and reminded me of this. I said I did not have one at my house so that is where we put it. My granddaughter is 13 months old and loves it. She likes to flip the page to change the tune. She especially loves banging on the keyboard to make the music play.I counted 8 tunes: 4 classical and 4 folk/nursery tunes.She really enjoys dancing along with the music.And I have fun making my own tunes and chords with the 8 note keyboard.It is easy to assemble (I did it myself).The only concern is the seat: I think it should be a little wider with a backrest for the baby. Otherwise it is a great instrument."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fun","review":"I puchased this for my 10-month old daughter. She loves to play it in it's steady setting. She did not like the rocking as she would rock it all the way over. So far she likes it a lot and it keeps her interested for blocks of time which is very good. I work at home and need her distracted while I work on the computer. It works great to put it in a pack-n-play and she sits on the seat and just plays away. She likes that because it gives her sometime to put her back against. Without it, it tends to want to tip over. This is the only main complaint tha I have, but the music sounds good and is very entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"A LOT OF FUN, BUT THE SEAT?","review":"I RECEIVED THIS TOY AS A GIFT & MY 11 MONTH OLD SON LOVES THE LIGHTS & MUSIC. IT HAS DIFFERENT INSTRUMENT SETTINGS AND THE MUSIC SELECTIONS ARE GREAT. THE ONLY COMPLAINT I HAVE IS THAT THE SEAT IS PRETTY MUCH JUST A SQUARE BLOCK. NOT THE BEST FOR A BABY THAT TENDS TO LEAN OVER. THEY SHOULD HAVE MADE THIS WITH A NICE BUCKET TYPE SEAT OR AT LEAST WITH A BACK OF SOME SORT. ALL IN ALL I AM HAPPY WITH IT BECAUSE IT HOLDS MY SON'S ATTENTION AND IT IS REALLY A CUTE TOY. I WOULD RECOMMEND BUYING IT."},{"rating":"2","title":"A big hit!","review":"This toy has been a big hit with my 14 month old son. He received it for his birthday and I'd have to agree with most of the reviews I've read. It's a great toy for a child who loves music. My son loves shaking it so that the music plays, or hitting the keys. He especially enjoys lifting up the whole toy (it's quite light) and carrying it around the room. But he goes crazy dancing and shaking his head with the music. This is one of a few toys which he seeks out everyday and will entertain himself with for awhile (he loves musical toys).I only wish the piano played a few more tunes! And I completely agree about the seat bottom, it's TINY. I mean, it fits my son perfectly, but it just looks like the seat should be twice the size that it actually is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"We got this for our two toddlers and it was an instant hit.

I had the video games MK, MKII, MK3 & UMK, so I had to get this movie.The storyline of the movie is not very faithful to the game storyline. However, the look and feel of the movie is very much as I had imagined. The sound and music are also cool (that opening theme has the beat; I would like to hear it in any of the upcoming MK games).If you are looking for a movie based in a video game, this is the best I've ever seen.I wouldn't recommend the second part (MK Annihilation) though, because besides the writers tried to bring the UMK3 to live, the movie doesn't follow the videogames storyline at all, it misses the whole point of MK.At the end, you should stick to this movie because it's awesome (rent the second part to see what is it about)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mortal Kombat is a great movie.","review":"This action and special effects packed movie is a good one.

Back when this film was released, I admired the film for its awesome fight scenes and special effects. It was a bit of mindless entertainment that kept me interested. Now, I go back to this film because it brings back a lot of memories. The soundtrack, for instance, still sounds good even after twelve years (\\"Halcyon + On + On + On\\" by Orbital is one of my favorite techno songs of all). The fights scenes are still spectacular, even if they are a bit too unrealistic sometimes. Even the humor is still effective: perfect timing on Raiden's \\"apology.\\" Not a great film in general, but I did like it when I was a kid."},{"rating":"2","title":"No way this movie will ever get old","review":"Gripped by the same wave excitement that hit me when I first heard the theme music playing as the MK logo came up on screen. The film is pure action entertainment, closer to Whasango (Volcano High) than Fist of Legend in terms of fight value. One of those movies where you can't take it just for the action, nor just for the cheesy story line, nor the nerd-thrilling presentation. Gotta take it as a whole package while you're chilling with your buddies coz it can do nothing but ROCK YOUR WORLD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow and predictable","review":"When you take a video game where the whole game is simply one-on-one fighting, there is not much story to go with. Apparently the makers of this movie simply accepted that fact and said \\"so what?\\"The action scenes are at times enjoyable, at times laughable, and at times boring. But more importantly, there are other ways they could have worked the use of fight scenes into this movie. That's one of the (few) things that they did better in the second film. Simply saying \\"we're here for a Mortal Kombat tournament\\" is easy but uninteresting.That said, it is interesting the ways they worked in some of the elements of the games. Those would only really matter to fans of the plotless video game series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not THE best.

Now there making another one! It's going to have Kintaro, Goro, Shao Kahn, and Shang Tsung. Goro's going to be missing (as you saw in the 1st one) for a little while then he'll return.

The character development isn't that great, and most of the action sequences aren't very well choreographed. The only real great fight scenes were with Lou Kang vs. Reptile and the fight with Johnny Cage vs. Scorpion, so it's kind of a let down considering this film is based on a fighting game. The special effects in this movie aren't that impressive because you can tell it's not real. The only great acting performance in this film was by Christopher Lambert as Raiden, but everyone else wasn't really convincing in their roles. Overall, if you're a die hard fan of the video game series then you might enjoy this, but I think you want see a better sci-fi action film, then see the Terminator series or the original Star Wars trilogy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull Wombat","review":"I was dragged against my will to the local suburban theater to watch this tepidly dull and overtly violent film. Suffice it to say I left the theater about half way through this tedious exercise in patience. This is plainly J-U-N-K. It concerns the wildly popular video game and brings the characters to 'life' or should I say, 'to death'? The fighting scenes are horrible, and there are too many of them and they are so violent that one becomes sickened by it all. There is also excessively loud techno music to add to the disaster.

Although obviously a remake of Enter the Dragon starring Bruce Lee, Mortal Kombat is more about pleasing teens than adults. Magic duels, psychic fights, and superhuman Karate are what Mortal Kombat is about. If you like this, try Invincible starring Billy Zane which can be found here at Amazon.com(I bought both here). Invincible is like this but more aimed at an older audience. If it gets you pumped(the opening theme song does!) and/or you simply like Karate movies, this is not the best but is far,far,far from the worst. Buy it if it is cheap but not if it costs over $10.

But, When I fist saw this movie in theaters it blew me away, the acting was good but the kung fu fightin' was better. The charaters in the film are all cool, I like Raiden (or is it Rayden?) the best along with Scorpion. The second film New Line produced wasnt as great as the original but still had its moments.

It stays (mostly) true to the story of the first Mortal Kombat game -- I bet you didn't know they have a story! -- and is still an enjoyable movie. Probably its biggest departure from the games is the utter absence of blood and gore, and it never feels the worse for it.Word to the wise: even if you like this movie and all the video games, STAY FAR, FAR AWAY FROM THE SEQUEL!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mortal Kombat is the koolest movie!!","review":"This movie is the best game-based movie that has EVER been created.

It's just that this one is so weak and uninspired, It'll leave even Mortal Kombat fans disappointed (unless they're easily pleased and have short attention spans). The plot is very weak and contrived, the characters are 1-dimmensional and made of plastic, and the fight scenes are often ludicrous (escpecailly the \\"double kicking\\" move Lui Kang does to Reptile, which is quite laughable). The fight scenes had to be toned down for the movies rating (it still bothers me when they'll try and make a PG-13 movie from an R rated game).The visiual effects (particularly the netherworld) are interesting but only mediocre at best.

After three years of fighting and flying, due to the severe head injuries he had received when his Gladiator crashed in the Western Desert, he must on no account fly a fighter plane again and so went back home. I do not enjoy the story because I do not like wars. Wars are terrible and Roald Dahl described how he helped the others fight and how the others were shot and died. I felt upset when I read this book. I think this book is thick. The plot goes slowly and it makes the story boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"After purchase","review":"I am initially pleased with the Antec Power supply, however after my first installation of this product, I have some suggestions for the manufacturer.The cable management idea is great but the supplied cable sets for hard drive power only come with three (3) plugs per cable, requiring an exrea 2 un-used plugs for a single drive system or 1 unused plug for a 2 drive system, etc.It would be much more effecient if the cable sets supplied were 1 singlr, 1 dual (2) plugs, and 1 with 3 plugs, thus allowing the installer MUCH more flexibility in reducing cable clutter and still have the current 6 plug totalAntec Neo-HE-500 500-Watt High Efficiency Power Supply UnitAntec Neo-HE-500 500-Watt High Efficiency Power Supply Unit"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Psu cant run in asus and intel 965wh boards!!!","review":"This Power Supply cant run in a asus boards, and many intel 965 boards ...and in other because the anemic +5v and +3.3v 17A and 23A, and today the power needed is minimun 25A and 35 A in this rails.

The shave was very close with much less irritation and i wasn't even using my favorite shaving cream (Kiss my Face), i was VERY impressed to say the least.

Not great but not horrible. When it works the way I want to, the blades cut pretty well, and close. However, the main and largest problem is the 5-blade design. With the blades so close together, hair easily gets clogged between them, requiring more work to take out and clean. And clean you must, since it's hard to continue shaving when there's hair worsening the blades' gliding/cutting performance. As for the other users who love this razor, maybe its for some people and not for others (like me), or maybe my hair is too thick. Whatever the case, I recommend you to try this 5-blade razor out before you commit to buying the extra blades."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beats out my Mach 3 Turbo hands down","review":"I went from disposables to the Mach 3 Turbo when they sent me one in the mail, and i loved it, got so much closer.

Same deal.I wondered if maybe I was doing something different so after trying it once and finding it unsuitable, I used a one week old, used several times, two blade generic disposable razor. It was far and away much better, much smoother shaving and less painful than this razor.I have tried this razor using gel, foam and shaving in the shower. Nothing can redeem it.

I have very sensitive skin with a tough beard that sems not to grow in any particular grain. OK, so it has 5 blades; truth is it doesn't shave any better than the model with 3 but the blades are hideously expensive. I also have the 3 blade power model which is another bad joke unto itself. I still have to go over and over the same area, shave from different angles over the same space and it takes just as long and gives no better shave. True it was a nice touch to add the precision trimmer blade to the top side but I'm not sure that justifies the cost either. I will probably use the 2 blades that came with it and then put it in the goodwill bag. Oh yes, by the way, it is very pretty, if that makes a difference when you are shaving."},{"rating":"1","title":"all is not well in Fusion land","review":"Gillette has a quality control problem with the blades.

I'm not entirely happy with either of them. Electric sometimes doesn't cut sufficiently or else chafes off skin as well, leaving it flaky and the Mach 3 occasionally cuts me. Bought this Fusion a while ago and just got around to trying it. First impressions is that it's terrible. I'm glad I didn't buy any replacement cartridges. Cut my face all over the place. If manuals have a tendency to snag on your hairs at all, it's five time worse with this (since there's five blades to snag). Additionally, there's more space between the blade guards so it's easier to cut yourself - that is, I found it hard to shave along the curve of my face/neck etc.. It kept snagging and cutting me, despite the fancy vibration. I may give it another try without the battery on to see if it works any better, but so far less than impressed. The only positive feature is that the vibration makes it easier to rinse out hair than the Mach 3."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond awesome!","review":"When I started using Mach3, I thought this was the best shaving experience I'd ever get.

Razor burn and acne like i was in high school again was what this razor did for me. It also hurt, and a clean shave looked 8 hrs old. 5 blades cutting at my face was just to much for me. I've actually reverted back 60 years to a 1950s model Gillette Safety Razor, Badger brush, and mug of shaving cream. The shave is 10x better. It's closer, non irritating, and is an enjoyable experience.

I'm done with this razor and already went back to the M3 Turbo, which in my opinion is the best of all of the gimmicky razors.Two main problems with this razor, it does not feel sharp and just drags along your skin and hair almost pulling them out making it pretty painful to shave. Secondly it does not even shave that close meaning you have to endure that torture more often.I can also add that this thing is way too big to be able to actually shave any contours or other \\"detail\\" parts of your face comfortably, even with the little mini razor on the front. It just doesn't work.Also of worthy note is that the blades do not last nearly as long as the previous blades on the M3, in my opinion these are almost single use blades as it gets increasingly more uncomfortable to use after even the first use."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst I have ever used","review":"This is an upgrade?

This razor irritated my skin to the point of bumps. The is probably because even after five or six strokes, the fusion would miss spots that the sensor got in one stroke. So with 5 strokes at 5 blades vs. 1 stroke with 2 blades, it's no wonder the fusion was more irritating. The blade is also much too big to shave very well beneath the nose. The thing that made me want to try the fusion was the precision trimmer, which looks like it would make sideburns a breeze. Alas, it was worthless. I now believe shaving technology peaked with two-blade designs and I shudder to think what 6-blade nightmare Gillette might be announcing in June. Hopefully it doesn't bump sensors off the shelves. Just in case, I'm going to calculate the number of shaves I'll need for my predicted lifespan and buy enough sensor excel cartridges to last me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy It","review":"I have to shave every day.

These two CD's showcases this style from the mid 60's. It's a combination of pop, latin and jazz all rolled into one. A couple of the cuts are classics (Spanish Grease, and Fried Neck Bones). Spanish Grease is the inspiration for No-one To Depend On by Santana, almost note for note.

I read James' \\"Turn of the Screw,\\" and \\"Daisy Miller\\" in high school, and I remember liking the former and thinking the latter was just okay. (I know, I know, it's a major classic by one of America's most celebrated writers, but just because something has merit doesn't mean I like it better.)

I have been assigned to read this for an english class as an undergrad and I have tolerated many a badly executed idea...but never like this. Boring, boring, and more boring.

I'm quite sure he read it too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Murky and weird","review":"I don't regret having read this book, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who isn't already into Henry James. The style is hard to understand, apparently because it was dictated, and the subject matter is even more obscure. I don't think Henry James had much experience with children: even assuming that Maisie is twisted by her strange situation, she doesn't talk like any child I know or can imagine. Weird moral undercurrents and jealousy take up most, if not all, of the novel. I wouldn't take claims of this book's modernity too seriously - it's more on the byzantine side. Read The Europeans instead: so much more fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Modern James' Story","review":"I think this is the most modern of Henry James' stories. Young Maisie's parents divorce and then seem to spend their lives using her to get a teach other, until they develop other interests. Sadly, the story resonates today - immature, self-centered parents and the children that they create. Henry James' insight into the life of such a child is brilliant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do not buy this cd from these people","review":"Listen this cd is one of the best cd's of all time...NO LIE..but these guy's are ripping you off...It is people like them that make this country crap...It is sick"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great challenge","review":"The challenge is getting through all the detail, but the research and historical facts are so supportive of the truth that you will be fully equiped to support that God exists and the Bible is completely trustly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great way to learn and have fun","review":"I bought this Yamaha with a hope of renewing and refreshing my piano skills.

The piano itself has great sound, and almost more options than I know what to do with (although it's been fun to play around with it).

NEVER pay more than $8/bolt, which is about what Barnett charges on their site, and other sites online $6 - 7/bolt. I like the Headhunter, but if you're target-shooting, don't go for tight groups, because you'll destroy your bolts. Also, with the Rinehart dense foam targets, you have to use some kind of arrow lube (even soap), or the heat generated by the friction will bond the foam to the shaft of the bolt. Makes it very difficult to remove bolt from target, and then you have to scrape little pieces of the target off the shaft. Even with the lube, I still have to use a rubber grip, and sometimes my feet, to remove bolt from target."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"worked out well ease to find if lost strong not ease to brake shoots great got my frist deer with one of these bolts"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Understanding of Applied Major Psychology Paradigms","review":"George Gothals was my mentor when I was at Harvard and I worked with him as my thesis director, for my master's degree.

While that may be a nice thought, the realities are that the writers of the Rules (The USGA and The R&A) put enormous thought into the way the rules are written so that Officials in the field can uniformly interpret the rules. The Officials have no room for error in ensuring that all players are playing by the same rules and playing on a level playing field.

This despite the very low power demand rating on the laptop.Recently on a long trip it just wouldn't work any more. We looked it over, tried a different cord on it, and it wouldn't respond. Forgetting it had a one year warranty and having no room for dysfunctional stuff, we tossed it in the trash. Rats!We are shopping for a 400 or 500 watt inverter now.

No matter what we do, we can't push them in so that they stay on, even when we hear them \\"click\\" into place. Also, when we try to put the sides together to let him ride on it, the latch that keeps it open is so tight that it takes two of us to switch it.

It would be alot better if she could push it instead of it dragging her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Design, Limits Walking...","review":"We bought this for our 1 year old. He loves the music but there are 2 design flaws that prevent it from being used more. First, when closed for a ride-one toy, his feet drag. There are little returns spouts for the balls, but the are not big enough to put his feet in for rolling. They also limit his ability to walk/pedal it. Second, when the seat is open, the wheels are not open far enough apart. Therefore each step forward is kicked directly into the wheels. This is cute, but if your kid has legs, you should keep shopping."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst toy we ever bought","review":"We bought this for our 9 month old so it could help him to give his first steps.

He also can't change directions, so basically he goes until he runs into something. Also, it does flip forward from time to time when he leans on it as well. When he falls or it flips, he sometimes bumps his chin on the handle which is too rough for that reason--probably needs to be made of rubber. Sometimes his feet bang against the legs of the walker as he's moving and causes him to fall. He does enjoy the balls and putting them in the basket. The music is quite entertaining. It is a durable product, but not as safe as I would have liked.

I was hoping it would encourage them to walk more. At first they weren't too interested in using it as a walker, but once I put the legs together and sat them on it, that was it! It only took a couple of days for them to figure out how to climb on the seat and start pushing themselves, or whinning until someone did it for them. They both LOVE to ride around on it. And 10 year old big brother loves pushing them around the house. My boy twin will even push my girl twin on his knees. The balls and basket didn't do much for them, I think we lost the balls within a week. And the song is sort of annoying. If you walk too hard anywhere near it, it starts playing. But the kids really seem to enjoy the music, as they're flying all over the house! I bought mine at Walmart, for much less money, and for us, it was a great buy. They are now almost a year old and it's still one of their favorite play things."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helped Teach My Son to Walk","review":"This toy definitely helped my son to walk.

He can push to go backwards but hasn't figured out going forward yet. The ball in the hoop hasn't clicked on to him either.

He kept falling through the legs and I was afraid he'd get hurt so I called FP and sent it back. After a big long inspection over the phone, I was told that it sounded like it was put together wrong (even though it's assembled at the factory!) because a code number was on the opposite side from where it should be. So beware of latching the legs closed if your walker has the code number under the left rear wheel. It's supposed to be on the right wheel.

I would purchase another walker instead if I were you ( one that's returnable)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby Loves it, I think it's CRAP.","review":"My baby boy loves this toy. I think the toy is unsafe without perental supervision. First of all, there is nothing to slow it down. My child starts walking with the toy, and then Zooooom, it's speeding away and my baby is falling down on his face and chest. Bottom line is that something need to be included that will slow the wheels down for baby's learning to walk. Second of all, if my child runs into something with the toy. . . say the chair, and keeps pushing, the toy will flip forward. This causes my child to fall forward, onto the toy, hurting himself. If your unable to totally supervise the baby while he/she is playing with this toy, don't buy it.... Really."},{"rating":"2","title":"My boys love it!","review":"This is a great toy! Not only did it help my twin babies learn to walk but it also is a lot of fun to ride on as a bike, after they have the walking thing down. I bought one to try it out and then had to go out and get another one it was such a big hit."},{"rating":"2","title":"MY son loves this!!!","review":"I love this toy! My son got this for Christmas. He was 9months old. Since the time we opened it he loved it. It gave him the confidence to walk, and he loves the music. The balls he doesn't play with cause he's to busy putting everything else in the basket.(i.e remote controls, his stuffed animals , his socks). I recommend this to everyone! It's a great toy for learning how to walk. And yes my son was walking before he was a year old. And today was his 1st bday!!! Great product!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My son never took to this toy.","review":"My son never took to this toy. The \\"ball game\\" portion of this scooter/push toy was the highlight of the whole toy and that kept his interest only a few minutes, then it could have been just any old ball. He is in the 90% for size and it was too awkward to be a push-toy (he tripped over the wheel walls) & there is very little room for legs and feet if you want to use it as a scooter.Sorry, but for us... this toy was a big thumbs down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, Fun, Fun toy!!","review":"This toy is great! It's sturdy, it's bright, the music isn't too annoying (there's two volume levels and on/off switch), and best of all the kids love it! Our one year old (who be bought it for) loves to push the clown's nose and make the music play.We did have some trouble changing the toy from the riding mode back to the walker mode, because the instructions skip one of the steps - pushing a button on the top - but, this wasn't a big deal as we figured it out on our own. We ended just leaving it in the riding mode, since that's what the kids liked best.This is a great toy - you won't be disappointed - it's as fun as it looks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"fun face and music","review":"I was really wanting the sing along puppy. I looked at every possible store, but it is only available online. So I got the Baby PlayZone. My nine month old daughter loves the sun face, the sounds and the balls. I love it, it is low enough, her short legs can reach the floor so she can push it. The only complaint is I needed something a little harder to push. When she pushed it for the first time, she almost fell face forward. Overall I think it is great toy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great in theory, poor in actual use","review":"We purchased this toy for our 10 month old son who was already happily cruising on the furniture. We thought this would help him 'cruise' around the house. Instead he wound up on his face more often than not. The wheels go WAY too fast, and it was only safe to use when we were walking behind him and holding on to the handle so it didn't run away. The basketball feature was promising until we realized the balls come out the back end. What a dumb idea! It's as if the balls were there.... and now they're gone forever.Ours is taking a trip back to the store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful with this toy!","review":"I bought this for my 10-month old daughter who was just starting to pull up on everything in the house. I thought this toy would be great to help her walk. But the wheels are extremely slick and have no traction (do NOT use on tile or wood floors) and have absolutely no resistence to them. Every time my daughter would try and pull herself up using this toy it would start rolling backwards and if I helped her stand and hold onto it the wheels rolled so quickly when she tried to walk forward that the toy would get away from her. That really frightened her! Also, the music is annoying and LOUD, without a volume control and the slightest little thing sets this toy off.Overall, the concept is OK, but if you do get this toy (which I do not recommend) make sure you hold onto it at ALL times when your child is playing with it if they are standing or else they are going to fall on their face when the toy rolls away from them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good. Doesn't Turn. Goes too fast.","review":"Bought this for my daughter when she was starting to cruiseShe was never able to use it to walk bc it goes too fast. She did enjoy sitting on it, but it was pretty useless since it can only go straight and a 1+ yr old isn't really capable of figuring out how to get up and turn it around manually. She would end up riding on it until she could go no further and then just getting up and walking away. It has been a thoroughly diappointing purchase. . I have only one positive comment: the two tunes it plays are cute --but annoying-- and they can be turned off. But that is not a reason to buy this one. I recommend either buying one with steering control, or a walker that doesn't go as fast. I'm sorry that I can't recommend another option, but at least I can warn you not to waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Walker","review":"I bought this for my neice for her first birthday. She loves it!! It plays great music and really motivates her to walk. She had another walker that went way to fast and she would end up on her knees. This walker is great because the sides go out to an angle and when she walks and her legs start to go further apart the sides stops her from falling and she then straightens them out!!!! Also I love how this one has big wheels. It seems to keep it from going too fast. I would highly recommend!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a Toy to grow with.","review":"I bought this toy for my daughter when she was about 10 months old. She is now 19 months old and still rides it around the house. It's very durable but once they learn to put the ball in the hoop and it comes out down the back the fun really isnt there much more. She plays the music sometimes now but you have to shut it off to get it to quit. Any little thing will set off the music. It's enjoyable at first but wears on you after 10 or so minutes. The duration the toy is used for is definetley worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"My baby loves this thing!","review":"I bought it with the hopes that it would help my 9 mth. old develop his walking skills. Well, it does move a little too fast for him and it makes me awfully nervous. But, he just loves playing with the little face on this toy and pushing the nose to make the play music, he also loves \\"playing basketball\\" with it, and sitting on it and \\"driving\\" while mommy or daddy push him around. This is a great toy! I know he's got something to grow into, once his walking skills get a bit better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible walker","review":"As a mother of 4, this was our worst walker. Too small for them to actually use as a stabilizer when learning to walk. Then, too small to use as a ride on. The legs open to walk, close to ride. When open there wasn't enought room to step. While the music & lights were entertaining, all of our other toys are too! The worst part is that when put the ball in the front, it comes out underneath in the back. Our kids always cried wondering where the ball went. We highly recommend the very simple little tykes car as a very strudy ride-on/walker. It comes in pink or blue with the right hight handles on the back for pushing, it won't tip over, & is big enough to use a ride-on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"flopped","review":"We bought this toy as a walker for our son to aid him. The wheels have no way of slowing down the walker so it didn't help him at all. If he leaned on it, it just moved out from under him while he was trying to hold on for support. Also with the seat in the \\"apart\\" position, it's impossible for the child to stand close to the handle bar so his hands are way out in front of him trying to hold on. And then it just zips out from under him. I'd say if you want a ride-on toy, then it's fine. If you want assistance for learning to walk well, pick a different toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great ride on","review":"honestly, I thought this was awful as a walker. with hardwood floors, this moves much too fast to be stable. as a ride on, however, it is two thumbs way up. My 2 year old is unusually big and tall, but he has loved this so much as a little ride on scooter. it plays a very cute little tune and is quite durable. we have had it nearly two years and have only replaced the batteries once. a great buy as a ride on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy for motivated babies.","review":"I purchased this for my nine month old son about a month ago and he is yet to get bored..unlike most of his toys.He loves the catchy-tunes and the walker is durable enough for both outdoor and indoor use.My only advise is wait until your child is steady on thier feet and confident enough to let go of the couch!This toys wheels are fast and a child with less confidence could quickly lose balance and crash to the floor. But with the right amount of confidence this toy is great and gives your child the independece they desire...until they can walk unassisted! And get ready to be picking up the balls all day long!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't waste your money on it","review":"I do admit that this is a fun toy, it has a catchy tune, and it is fun for my son to push it's nose and play with the colorful balls.But this is definitely not a walker specially on hard wood floors, the walker moves faster than my son, and the handles are a bit far away to reach. To close the seat and make it a ride is semi easy, but good luck opening it back up.As a ride on toy, it is also not that good, the wheels only go straight and my son slides of the seat easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great basketball hoop - but too fast for a learning walker","review":"My son loves this toy. He got it as a present when he was 10 months old. He plays with the balls all the time, but as a walker it goes to fast for him. We have the other Fisher Price activity walker... that he uses as a walker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult and annoying","review":"The music sensor is TOO sensitive. You walk on the floor a little too hard the annoying music goes off! I don't mind the musical toys at all but this one is ANNOYING. The balls should go toward the front once they roll into the basket. My almost 12 month old couldn't find them. He looked in the front. It is not easy to walk with or ride on. It is VERY DIFFICULT to move the blue seat apart to become a ride on or a walker. It is most difficult to pry the legs apart to make it a walker. My strong husband had a difficult time. He's an engineer and said it is not designed well at all. This also tips over easily. My son was behind it and the music went off, he bent forward to find the music and he went head over heals with the toy on top of him. I gave it 3 stars for durability because we haven't had a problem with it falling apart but it tips easily to me that's not durable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls over easily","review":"My 10 month old got this walker as a gift. She loves it, but I stopped letting her use it because I think it is dangerous. It has fallen on top of her a few times. The last time she fell, her legs got entangled in the sides of the walker and she hit her head on the floor. That was the last time she will ever use it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Item should be redesigned or recalled","review":"I got this when our baby was 5-6 months old. He enjoyed sitting on it and pushing it around. Unfortunately as other parents have reviewed this item, you cannot leave you kid alone when he/she is riding on this since he can easily topple over. It is light in a sense that my baby just lifted the whole thing with one hand! Also, the wheels have nothing to slow it down that it moves faster than your baby can walk. He/she will end up squat on his face if he/she lets go. If the front wheel hits a snag, it becomes a pivoting point then the whole body acts like a trebuchet toppling your baby forward.If you can fully supervise your baby, this is a good one otherwise I would not recommend it. We had to return ours for the sake of safety of our baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"do yourself a favor and don't order","review":"This toy has the most obnoxious song.

She learned how to ride it first and then walk with it. I must agree with the other reviewers that you should be with baby when they are playing it as when they are walking there is no way to stop this walker. I have also seen it \\"get away\\" from her as well, causing her to trip by trying to keep up with it. The only other complaint is that it takes some gumption to change it from walker to rider. It's a little tricky but doable once you get the hang of it.Caution: They will try to put their pacifiers down the chutes. So if you can't find baby's binky, look there first! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful developmental toy","review":"Our 9 month old son got this toy for Christmas. He first crawled behind it with one hand on each leg of the toy. Then he started to try to stand up, but it only worked very good on the carpeting. We parents were supervising closely to teach him to stand more upright when pushing the toy, which helps to control the speed. We spent many hours going back and forth with him crawling, then walking behind this before he got the hang of it. Now that he is almost a year old, he will stop when he runs into so mething, crawl over one of the legs and push the toy backwards, then re-mount and keep going. He can handle the speed, even on slick floors. He also likes to play with the balls, and can find them when they go into the basket. The jazzy music is pretty cool, but definitely motion sensitive!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk!","review":"I got this walker for my daughter because I thought it was cute. The walker is horrible!

Fixed lens with this focal length may not always be the most practical, but most of us are able to move ourselves around, hence also the camera.If i have to complain about something: the lens hood/cap is quite difficult to take on and of, certainly not for fast operations.

At $0.99, it's a must-read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Way To Spend An Evening","review":"**spoiler alert** Pros: The Native American shifter, and the mythos woven into the story, is amazing. The flow of words, the narrative itself, the imagery -- all beautiful and engaging. The characters are lovely, believable, and you really are swept up in their story. I like being swept up.Cons: I have an issue when irreversible changes are done to a character without all the consequences adequately explained outside of a sexual situation. It reeks of dubious consent. And the fact that Conner isn't as angry at having choice ripped away from him as one would expect leaves me with that 'WTF' feeling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great thanks!","review":"Quick, professional, and efficient service. thanks. loved this movie and been wanting to buy it for ages...thanks again for making it so easy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flesh+Blood","review":"I read all the reviews of this movie and even though some said it was violent, brutal...I still ordered it. I've been enthralled with HBO's \\"Game of Thrones\\" and was searching for a movie that captured the rawness of that time. From the reviews I thought I had found it, but Oh No. From the opening scenes of the prince with the 80's feathered hair perfectly hairsprayed, to the silly dialogue - it was so dated and just bad. And although I have a strong crush on Rutger Hauer (loved Lady Hawke) it's as if he lip-synced the entire movie. It was amusing enough but better as a find on Saturday afternoon FX channel than actually buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected","review":"There is just too much focus on sex in this film. The adherance to historical accuracy is viseral at best. I watched it once but won't be watching it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Although Paul Verhoeven...","review":"...has made more than a few fine movies, I couldn't bear more than 10 minutes of this one. The first thing I did loathe was that, during this time I didn't hear one single sentence that could have been uttered in 1501. And the feeling I got is everything said was recorded in some gutter in 1984 by some low-life creeps disgracing what is supposed to be \\"Mankind\\". I don't suppose either that he tried to make some sort of spoof, since spoofs are usually funny, and the best are even very accurate in the details. To qualify this crap as disapointing would be more than an understatement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pornagraphic garbage!","review":"My wife and I watched about 40 minutes of this garbage. Since we are Rutger Hauer fans we kept hoping it would get better. It kept getting worse and worse. Rutger should be embarased by his involvement in such a cheap movie. Corny acting. bad plot, cheesy fight scenes. Then they also had a bunch of useless nudity scenes. Example: a nun was ill from being struck in the head with a sword. Then, it goes to her lying on a bed in a room rolling around in pain. They decide to give you a long graphic view of her nude body. IT WAS VERY GRAPHIC AND POINTLESS NUDITY. It was vulger pornography."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't know much about history","review":"This movie is about as historically accurate as your basic Renfest, complete with Eighties hair, Halloween costumes, and anachronistic dialogue and philosophies. A man taking his raped fiancee back in sixteenth-century Italy? Are you kidding?The dialogue is awful, the script is worse, and the cast is to be pitied. The costumer designer should be shot. Verhoeven should just switch over to porn or maybe create a new genre: the action movie with actual porn, because that's apparently waht he wants. For all that, us ladies are stuck seeing yet another naked female body, while the male goodies get treated like sacred relics that must be kept shrouded in mystery.I can hardly wait till my historian buddy sees this."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a Really Bad Movie!","review":"You'd think on the strength of some of the actors and the director that this should be a pretty good movie. But, it isn't. It's sheer trash and I mean trash too. I haven't figured out yet why so many people are shown naked or with half their clothes off. One can only assume it's the director's idea. Why does Jennifer Jason Leigh go nude for half the picture? It makes no sense and neither does most of the film. There are just some disturbing images like a horrible pregnant woman running around acting crude and people writhing (of course) naked after being sliced in the head, dogs cut up and catipulted into a castle! It's just a pretty stupid movie. I'm just sorry it isn't a \\"lost\\" film where all copies known to exist just evaporated into thin air. A better movie that takes place a few decades before this one which takes place in 1501 isThe Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc."},{"rating":"1","title":"SUCKS.","review":"The only reason I purchased this movie was because I heard Jenifer Jason Leigh was nude in it. I read some of the reviews for this before buying it and it sounded half way decent. But after watching it I came to realize that whoever wrote most of those reviews had to be huge Rutger Hauer fans because this movie sucks. The acting sucks, the direction sucks, the writing sucks. The only good content is Jenifer Jason Leigh's nude scenes, and there are quite a few. This is a great movie to watch on mute."},{"rating":"1","title":"HUH?????","review":"Can SOMEone PLEASE explain why the \\"free preview\\" is NOTHING but opening credits??????

I mean, The Partridge Family? Yes, the Persuasions sing The Partridge Family's \\"I Woke Up In Love This Morning,\\" and make it a heavyweight tune.

Don't know what changed, but the handles do not stay in the holes. I am unhappy with the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic recording","review":"This recording has been cited by Fionna Richie (the long time host of NPR's Thistle and Shamrock radio show) as one of the reasons she got into Traditional music, at a time when rock and pop was pushing out other music forms. Very few rock songs or tunes will be remembered 100 years from now, but there is always going to be an interest in Traditional music- because it transcends time and speaks to the next generation. From there it is tweaked with the influences of the day and continues on. This is one of those tunes.The recording does not appear to be remastered, and shows the limitations of the studio of 1971. Not that I'm complaining- it's a genuine clean copy of the original, and hasn't been artistically changed in any way. Which is a good thing, as the orginal was a masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Has the media bought our soul?","review":"Punk rockers and hippies were both trend setters - perhaps she is speaking of the best of both times -- \\"in '77 and '69 revolution was in the air...\\" as in : Punk rocker in '77, and flowers in my hair (hippie)- in '69...?Anyway, - very catchy song. This girl is an excellent vocalist no matter if you like the song or not. At 43 years of age new artists don't usually catch my attention, but I found myself really listening to this song and even becoming curious about the artist. Maybe because I could understand the words."},{"rating":"1","title":"isn't it ironic","review":"that the song lyrics espouse a return to more real values but the misleading hype about an internet webcast is anything but revolutionary or based on being realonly in this cynical marketing age... pity!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo Mandy","review":"I have to applaud Mandy Moore for trying something new. She takes a bunch of old classic songs from thr 70's and 80's and actually does them justice. While she has never had the powerful voice of Christina Aguilera or Kelly Clarkson, she has always had one of the more sweetest and prettiest voices. On Coverage, she has never sounded better. Using her voice to it's full potential, and it sounds wonderful, especially on the opening number Senses Working Overtime and the final track, first single Have a Little Faith in Me. Other highlights include her fun version of I Feel the Earth Move, and her sexy turn on One Way or Another.A few songs drag, but for the most part Mandy takes these classic songs and makes them her own while still staying true to the original versions as much as possible. A wonderful album worthy of becoming a classic in it's own right."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album separates Mandy from the other pop princesses...","review":"I have to agree with the other reviewers who have raved about this album. It is really a beautifully orchestrated collection of songs and can in no way be considered \\"cotton-candy style pop.\\" Mandy's voice reveres each song and so do the others who put this album together, maintaining much of the original sound to each song and not trying too hard to make it sound like a lot of the modern garbage on the radio. (Thank God.) I really believe this album separates Mandy Moore from the other pop princesses she is lumped together with. I've always thought she was different, but this time it's not just my personal opinion that says so. Her work on this album proves that she is on a higher level with her ability and her taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coverage","review":"I admit, I'm not a huge fan of covers. For the most part, they just irritate me because they're nowhere near as good as the original version. But I listened to a few sample songs and decided to buy it, and I am for the most part pleasantly surprised. I've heard most of the original versions of these songs, and while Moore does add some modern twists to them, she manages to meld the twists into the song to enhance, not take away from the originality. There are a few songs that I'm not fond of, but for the most part, if you enjoy older music but aren't too much of a purist about it, you might find this CD worth listening to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing against Mandy Moore but...","review":"Do humanity a favor and listen to the orginal versions of these songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs Something Moore","review":"I am a fan of Mandy Moore and was excited to purchase her Coverage album. I love cover songs and adored the first single Have A Little Faith In Me so I went ahead and bought the album. It is so disappointing! I find myself bored by Mandy's vocals and cannot sit through the whole album. She chose some amazing songs but did not do many of them justice. They lack their original charm and energy. While I do understand that cover songs are often not as good as the original, Coverage is a wispy, dull attempt at reviving an era of energetic and exciting songwriting. I admire Mandy for doing an album so different than her peers, but I just wish she had put a little more energy and charisma into the album. The songs have powerful messages lost on less than powerful expression."},{"rating":"1","title":"unfortunate","review":"this cd in a whole was quite awful. although i give her props for trying to expose her young fan base to the greats of time past, i feel that she'd have done them all more justice if she just mentioned it in a interview."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not That Great","review":"Nothing stands out about these songs. They are all bland and sound similar. \\"Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters\\" is the only one I liked. This is her worst album."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Coverage and Media Hype Is To Be Believed","review":"This is actually a terrific album. I listen to most of the songs at least every day. Of course there are a couple of duds (\\"Moonshadow\\", \\"One Way or Another\\") but then again I never liked the originals of those two. This is wonderfully compiled, and without another cheesy Beatles cover in sight. Tastefully recorded with a fresh song, this album is a staple for any true music fan. VERY different from her usual vibe, and hopefully a sound and direction that she will continue with. The only reason I give it less than a perfect rating is because they are recorded exactly like the originals, only it's Mandy Moore singing. In other words, she uses the same \\"Oohs\\" and \\"Yeahs!\\" as the original artists. If she had explored her own voice more and given the songs a more personal twist, it would be perfect. But it's pretty darn close as it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"70's stuff, done well.","review":"Mandy Moore singing songs she likes from the 70's era. She does a great job on most of them, and especially a really great job on Elton Johns, Mono Lisas and Mad Hatters. Also excellent are Drop the Pilot, The Whole Of the Moon, Breaking us in Two. Being older, I am well tired of hearing the original versions of, Help Me, Anticipation, Moonshadow, Senses Working Overtime, One Way or Another, but if you are younger, she does these as good as anyone ever did.

After all, it's a hit-or-miss type of thing.Fortunately, Mandy Moore hits the nail right on the head. I had only heard John Hiatt's song \\"Have a Little Faith in Me\\" before buying \\"Coverage\\", and heard Moore's cover on the radio.

This album is so so great. Not only does it introduce me to a wonderful past era of music, it adds a modern twist to it. Mandy has been maturing with each album.. did you know that she spent her own money on making this album without giving Sony a heads up until she finished it?

I understand she wants a more adult image and I want her to have that. But you do not achieve an ADULT image by dressing sleezy. I know she would never dress like Christina Agulara but it hurts to see her change. I have also noticed a change in her personality, she is not acting like herself.

That pisses me off, because your first CD is the one that starts you in the business and what makes you a star.

What you do not hear in the clips is the innovative and whimisicle production by John Fields. There is such a wide use of instruments and the beats work well to add a funk to these otherwise old songs. The production is just brilliant, which does well to compliment Mandy's voice and add a different sound to these songs. I am amazed at how Mandy's voice constantly improves with each album! In this album, Mandy has garnered such strength and she has learned to improve herself and prevent from becoming too nasal. Mandy uses her voice in so many flexible ways and has such agility; it's beautiful.

If I wanted to listen to Blondie's \\"One Way Or Another\\" sung in Blondie's fashion, I would purchase a Blondie album. Mandy needs to take these classics and make them her own in a sense. For example, take a lesson from Britney Spears on her versions of \\"The Beat Goes On\\", \\"Satisfaction\\", \\"You Got It All\\" and \\"I Love Rock 'n Roll\\". You'll notice how she adds a little extra life into the songs and makes them new again. To me, that right there is the purpose of remakes. And unfortunately, the \\"newness\\" aspect of these covers is what is missing here."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Collection","review":"This album is great! You really have to listen to the lyrics and such to understand why she chose these songs. If you are a true lover of music, you will think that what Mandy Moore has done here is magnificent. To take music that probably influenced today's music and releasing it out in today's society was genius. These are songs that everyone should here, and Mandy Moore recreated them while staying true to their essence. Über kudos to Mandy Moore! I loved her before, but I love her even more now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"absolutely amazing","review":"I am endlessly amazed by the artistry and work of Mandy Moore, but this album is more than I could have imagined. Mandy's voice is constantly improving and she shows it well in this album. She has learned to control her pitch, and uses her voice in many tones, showing so much emotion and variety in each song. She sounds absolutely beautiful. The production in this album is spectacular. John Fields uses such a variety of instruments and knows exactly how to rejuvenate these songs of the past. I would have really liked to hear new material from Mandy, but nevertheless she has done a brilliant job on this album. And I truly appreciate the fact that she recorded this independently, on her own terms, and did simply what she wanted. Unlike her counterparts who are in the business mainly for money, this is a work of passion and love to Mandy, and that is something anyone can admire. I look forward to hearing more from her, but for now, I will keep listening to this amazing album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Im having a little faith in Mandy","review":"I've just listend to the snippets of this CD but \\"Have A Little Faith In Me\\" is the only good song on this CD in my opinion, not a good idea to make a whole cover CD (hence Coverage), I love Mandy's voice but she sounds awful compared to the original artists, if only one or two songs were covered along with original work it would've been way better, hopefully Mandy's next CD will make up for this one, \\"I Wanna Be With You\\" is Mandy's best CD to date."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not 'So Real'","review":"I don't need a perfect score on my SATs to realize that Moore likely had no idea where 3/4s of these song selects resurrected from, but cut the almost-teen idol some slack for attempting to turn a generation not listening onto something more than the affected likes of the appalling Jessica Simpson and Britney Spears. Her aw-shucks style of pop negates the effectiveness [and irony at times] of the originals, but you want to embrace Moore for the deadpan, obvious passion she exudes while delivering it. My grade: B-"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Many Remakes!","review":"Her remakes were ok but I didn't like the songs that she chose. I think she should have written more songs.Was this review helpful to you?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this a joke?","review":"Who's responsible for this travesty? The only one who should be singing Blondie songs is Blondie. Same thing goes for XTC. Mandy Moore would botch up a Britney Spears tune without hand-written instructions. Cover songs are for non-creative people who just want to earn a little cash. There's nothing wrong with earning a little cash, but one should at least do it honestly! Right?For true classics, stick with Madonna, Spice Girls, Lillith Fair, Cindy Lauper, Tina Turner, Britney Spears and Pebbles. This chick couldn't sing and act her way out of a parking ticket.THANKS FOR LETTING ME POST MY REVIEW ON MANDY MOORE!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Like Her Previous Music Better","review":"Well MM is great. I loved her previous albums and it's nothing personal against her but i feel like she should have just done her regular stuff and not \\"Cover\\" other peoples music. Even though she feels people will get to know the artist a little well even though people hardly know who they are(Only one i know is Elton John). But i did hear samples of it and must say her vocals for the album are great and i'm glad she dished out another album i just wish she would have made a normal her own kind of music album not cover other peoples music. I might get the album or i might not depending how i feel. If i do get it it's only cause it's from Mandy Moore"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a fan, but this is good..","review":"Aside from Mandy acting in \\"A Walk To Remember,\\" I'm not a big fan of hers. However, a friend emailed me a link to Mandy's website where clips from this CD could be heard. I really liked what I heard, so I picked up the CD. I think it's great that Mandy decided to do something different. Definetly worth buying if you've got an open mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"She is AWESOME!!!","review":"She is already awesome, but this collection is by far her best. This CD shows her strong vocal ability and she covers the original songs very well. Not taking them to the extremes of where they sound fake or phony like other covers have been covered in the past by other artists. Out of all her music previously, she showed much more maturity for a CD that Sony refused to promote or have anything to do with. Mandy did her style of music, and did it well. Sony should be ashamed of themselves for not promoting such a wonderful CD to its fullest potential. Mandy Moore is very talented, and this CD shows just how talented she truly is. The DVD is an awesome added bonus where she talks about each song, shows off her recording studio, and other cool things. Mandy Moore is amazing and this CD tops her talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Say Goodbye to Childhood","review":"I have been anticipating the release of this CD for many months, ever since I heard that it would include a cover of one of my favorite songs of all time, \\"Drop the Pilot,\\" composed by Joan Armatrading. The CD is an interesting collection of cover songs, several of which were 80s MTV staples. I have never purchased a Mandy Moore CD before. Quite frankly, I always bunched her with the Brittney, Christina, Jessica group, but this CD left me suitably surprised and impressed. In addition to \\"Drop the Pilot,\\" I also love Ms. Moore's interpretation of \\"Moonshadow,\\" Cat Stevens's classic. It's nice to see a singer say goodbye to childhood and hello to an entirely new audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stupendous","review":"Mandy Moore has always been considered second best to the likes of reigning pop superstar Britney Spears and archrival Christina Aguilera, even Jessica Simpson these days (because of her infamous Newlyweds moments that brought her to the public's attention for an additional 15 minutes). But in late 2003, four years after her semi-sweet So Real release in 1999, Moore hit us with an incredible album of covers appropriately entitled Coverage. Not only did its first smash \\"Have a Little Faith in Me\\" become a surprising chart hit, it showcased that Miss Moore had not only grown up as a person, but as a vocalist too. Her amazing vocals are put forefront on Coverage, from \\"The Whole of the Moon\\" to \\"Drop the Pilot.\\" Though it did not receive as much commercial success as Britney's 2003 super-smash In the Zone, Moore's Coverage did receive critical acclaim, something not many pop teensters can achieve these days. Congrats Mandy: you did great on growing up and this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this album","review":"I can listen to this over and over for hours. I've always been into cheesy pop stuff (I probably have the biggest Debbie Gibson collection of anyone (well, anyone who would admit it)). So getting into Mandy Moore wasn't too big a stretch. I actually saw the 2 of them together at a radio station promo back in 99. They both sang to pre-recorded tracks, but it was still cool.Anyway - this album is way cool. You'd have to be a freak to be disappointed. All great songs, all great arrangements. It isn't often you get to hear vibes in pop music today."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS CD IS GREAT!!!","review":"This CD is great!!! Words can't explain how good this album is with a lot of songs that are remade by Mandy Moore. Her first two previous albums were good, but this one is fantastic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Jazz Time Capsule","review":"Over a dozen years after receiving \\"The Jazz Scene\\" as a Christmas present, I'm still delighted by it and recommending it to others. Want to talk about a great gift for a Jazz fan that keeps on giving, this is it; recorded music to listen to, fine B&W photographs to look at, and an interesting text to read. It's a Jazz time capsule from 1950 and may be one of Norman Granz's most underrated achievements."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece","review":"The Jazz Scene is definitive and sublime in every aspect -- the packaging, the liner notes, and most of all the music. You will understand and enjoy jazz better once you have experienced this CD set. If you have friends or family who enjoy jazz and who are not familiar with the Jazz Scene, do them (and yourself) a favor and order a couple of these at the outset to share with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Waited a long time for this","review":"I waited about thirty five years to finally own this album. Love the violins with Barretto's conga."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece Indeed!","review":"This album is probably one of the most unique and excellent soundtracks/compilations I've ever heard. It's nice to get a mixture of lesser known Icelandic artists and well known Icelandic artists. Listening to this album makes you feel like you're getting into a one of a kind Icelandic experience. Definitely worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed by the selection","review":"As with so many soundtracks these days, the best is left out. Despite the fact the majority of the selections were not of my taste, I was willing to buy it for \\"Hrafnagaldur\\" and its truly deep and haunting sound; however, those parts are omitted.The sound quality of the album is great, but that's of little value when one doesn't like what's on the CD. I have absolutely no desire to hear it again, and shall donate it to the local \\"Friends of the Library\\" Book sale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hours of fun","review":"12 yr old son bought these - great purchase for him.

The illustrations, while fun and bright, date the book. Of course, young kids probably won't care about that.The illustrations add to the text, but it's the text itself that really stands out. The dialogue is realistic and feels very comfortable--almost like a family member recounting a story we all know. The young first-person narrative adds to that effect, and the asides make me grin. The topic (wheedling Mom into keeping a cat) is appealing to many kids--so beware if you're a parent who doesn't want a pet!This is definitely a \\"read to\\" book rather than a book for a young child to read themselves, with three short paragraphs per page being typical. This is an excellent book to read together; you might check your local library to see if they have a copy, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only an idiot would buy this game","review":"Totally horrible game design, play, and graphics.

Gosh I'm sure happy this embarrassing MK game didn't ruin Subzero's career. It is a side scroller in which you are faced with many evil monks (oh, and they're all twins for some reason)..Subzero has many power-ups that prove useless. The mega-sized bosses are boring to fight (oh, and they never die for some reason). Due to the fact that the game supplies no level maps (how generic) a strategy guide would be a must, that is if you cared to bother with the game in the first place. Two good things did come about from this MK disaster.. Quan Chi & Shinnok. For Mortal Kombat that is a must see \\"MK4\\" or the new \\"MK Deadly Alliance\\".

This game is exactly the same to the ps version but lacks better music and the loss of FMV due to N64 memory. Besides the story in this is quite messed up with sub zero if you compared his story in mk 1. Sub zero also is toned down and pathetic from jumping in not so high places to the ground.

I did not find this book ingenious; I found it ponderous and laboured. The idea behind the story is intriguing, but the potential is never realized.

In my case, the story and the protagonist were not sufficiently interesting to warrant such effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"a very dissappointing book that repeated itself endlessly","review":"my whole reading group found this book extreamely dissappointing. It was the first time in years that most of us did not finish a book we were going to discuss. While Saramago's idea of imagining what would happen if the iberian penninsula were to break off from the rest of Europe is mildly amusing, after twenty pages, he runs out of ideas and keeps repeating himself over and over, in long complex sentances that take quite an effort to read. he does not develope interesting caracters - he creates a series of stick figures. there is no real plot to speak of, just a series of random travels. maybe the magic of this book is completely lost in translation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful","review":"After reading The year of the death of Ricardo Reis a book I thought was one of the best ever written and Blindness (not quite the best book ever written) I thought by buying this I was in for a good read...wrong!Jose Saramago continues his bizarre obsession with young women being attracted to decrepid old men (as he does in all his books) The story is thin, uninteresting and leads nowhere and the siege (read massacre) of the Muslims of Lisbon by the 'brave' crusader knights seems to have little to do with the plot apart from add a little sexual sleeze (the gang rape of a Arab woman by crusader knights) and some ill placed Portuguese nationalism."},{"rating":"1","title":"A perfect Bookend","review":"The one line summary says it all.

I read it in 2000, and I am still amazed by it. once you get pass the first few pages you'll get a feeling for the style of the book and you'll start enjoying it.The story reminded me of something obvious about history: history, as we know it, is written by the winners. Losers do not have much to say when looking back to recollect what happened. The winner's biases are all over history books and the loser's perspective is lost in the way.

Once you adapt to the idea that a sentence may contain dialogue from more than one person,take place at widely separated times and contain little or no punctuation, it is a wonderful book to read.The book moves between the present and the past.

Wonderful gift!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute crib toy","review":"Its cute because it has lots of options like buubles, sounds and lights. My complaint is the the lowest volume is still to loud. Other than that I like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good product","review":"My son loved playing with his aquarium. He liked to look at it for a while after he woke up every morning, and he looked so proud every time he would cut it on or off.It didn't really help him sleep, but he really enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have","review":"We got this for my daughter before she was born mainly because it matched the theme of her room. It's been attached to her crib from the time she was 1 1/2 months old until now (she's 19 mos old) and it has been a LIFESAVER. When she was a baby and just learning to fall asleep on her own, we'd lay her down in her crib, start it and the soft music, lights and swimming fish would lull her to sleep. When she got a little older, she learned how to kick the button to start it and would lull herself back to sleep if she woke up in the middle of the night. Now, as a toddler, she plays with it if she wakes up in the middle of the night or from a nap instead of crying. I really don't know what we would have done without it. It's a definite MUST HAVE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy if you like buying batteries","review":"My son loves this toy, however the only complaint I have is that it eats batteries. Faster than his swing, and faster then his other toys, He loves it though so I keep replacing them. I should probably get some rechargable ones but cant seem to find them in size D."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't live without it!","review":"My daughter absolutely LOVES her aquarium. She is now 9 months old and she has loved this aquarium all along. When she was younger, she loved to just watch it, especially the bubbles. Now that she is older, I can put her in her crib and she will play with the aquarium until she falls asleep. It's great!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a MUST HAVE!!!! Couldn't live without","review":"This is one of the best things I ever bought for our daughter. It is very soothing and she definitely uses it to help her fall asleep. When we lay her down in her crib, she may fuss at first, but then when we turn the aquarium on she loves it! If you put it on music and lights only it will play for 10 minutes. Once our daughter learned to turn it back on she loved it even more! One night not too long ago she played it for 2 hours straight in the middle of the night until she fell back asleep. I cannot praise this product enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great soothing crib toy","review":"I bought this for my 6 month old baby boy. It is very soothing and provides a mild light when he wakes at night. I go to his crib, turn on the Ocean Wonders Aquarium, and can see to find his pacifier. He goes back to sleep with the soothing music and light shuts off soon. He is now 8 months old and can turn it on by himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good thing","review":"I think this is an awesome toy for any age. My son is only 2 weeks old, and he enjoys looking at the fish and lights. I think the music is very relaxing also. Anytime he is fussy all I have to do is lay him down and turn on his aquarium and it helps him calm down. I would make this a must have for any baby!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best attachment you can put on a crib","review":"I received this as a gift at my baby shower. It's the best thing I could've received. My 2 month old falls asleep with the music and bubble effects. I would've given this product 5 stars but the only problem I had with this toy and it's very minor is that the music doesn't last very long. I have to keep on turning it on about 3 or 4 or even more times before my baby falls asleep. He enjoys it so much that when it stops he cries for more. But besides this it's something that everyone should buy and put on the crib."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining for my baby!","review":"My baby loves this aquarium! He didn't really start noticing it until he was about 3 months, but now it keeps him entertained in his crib so I can get things done! The only drawback is it takes 4-\\"D\\" batteries and it goes through them quick!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Toy","review":"I have this in my son's crib. He loves it. I put it in when he was 3 months, i would turn it on for him and he would lay there and just watch the fish and bubbles & listen to the music. now that he can roll over i keep the button turned on and he can start it up on his own. the first time i heard it was in the middle of the night he woke up and rolled over and his hand must have hit the button. when i went in there he was just laying there listning to the music it was cute. I will be giving my best friend one for her little one on the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!","review":"We started using this toy when we moved our 4 month old daughter into her crib. The soothing music and lights put her right to sleep! She's now 18 months old, and we still have it in her crib. She turns the music on if she wakes up in the middle of the night, then she goes right back to sleep. And she plays with it when she wakes up in the morning. We are expecting another child, and I'm definitely picking this up for his crib, too. We highly recommend this crib toy!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ocean Wonders Aquarium","review":"This is a great addition to any crib. My 6 week old daughter loves it and just sits and watches the fish swim around before she falls asleep. My only problem with it is that the music doesn't play long enough and she's too young to push the button herself so I find that I'm going back in a few times to have the music play again."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's quite noisy but the humming seem to soothe","review":"I bought this for my 2 month old. I was convinced it was broken because it has such a loud humming sound I had to turn the music up to drown out the hum. However, as it turns out, the humming is the hypnotic attribute. It's very similar to the \\"car\\" and \\"clothes dryer\\" effect. I can rely on it to put baby to sleep and that's good enough for me ( not to mention the rest of the famly)!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the first FP aquarium!","review":"We bought the Ocean Wonders Aquarium for our second child, because our first born still used his Peaceful Planet Aquarium to sleep at night. The original Peaceful Planet Aquarium is much nicer! The Ocean Wonders plays &quot;yanni style&quot; music and the bubbles/moving fish are so noisy that you can barely hear the music. I wish they still made the Peaceful Planet Aquarium!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This version is horrible!!!!","review":"I cannot believe so many people actually like this version!!! The music is more suited to a funeral, then to soothing a baby!!!! The motor is so loud, I can hear it in my bedroom!!! Even my 19 year old son said, that it was terrible compared to the first aquarium!!! My 18 month old son doesn't find it nearly as interesting as the old one. Sometimes it pays to NOT improve a product!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"big dissapointment","review":"this product is not available at the store and must be purchased online so you pay extra for shipping and don't get to inspect before you buy. Apparently Fisher Price doesn't know that Bumpers on an infant crip don't leave room for the verticle straps this product requires. I was able to return the toy to the store but I was still out the cost of shipping. I suppose I could have waited until my baby was old enough to lover the mattress, but she's got sleeping issues now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok - But too Loud...","review":"I went out a specifically bought this for may daughter because I didn't get it as a shower gift. We have fish tanks in the house and I thought it would be fun for her to have her 'own'. But the bubble are so loud that I only use the music part of it. A bit disappointing because I though the bubble would be the best part! But the music is nice. The natural sounds are so soothing. Luckily there are options to turn the bubbles off."},{"rating":"1","title":"So cute","review":"We love this toy, it has been in my son's crib since he is a few weeks, and at almost 2 he still loves it. Cute, entertaining, and interactive. I think it is a must have."},{"rating":"1","title":"The old one was better!!!","review":"I had the original Peaceful Planet Aquarium when my 4 1/2 yr. old daughter was an infant and it was a lifesaver. I saved it for my next baby but received the new Ocean Wonders Aquarium as a shower gift. I hate it! The music is creepy and when you run the bubble feature it is so LOUD and makes a clunking sound. Instead of calming my son he gets agitated. I kept it in his crib just to give him something to look at until one night I woke up to his screams and found him with his head trapped between his mattress and the bottom of this thing. Out with the new and in with the old. If you're interested in this item I would recommend finding the old version in a resale shop or at a garage sale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have!","review":"A friend of ours gave this to us for our baby shower and we're so glad that they did. Our daughter who is 7 months old loves this toy (it's been in her crib since she was a month old). It has helped calm her when she was fussy and also helped her go to sleep. As soon as we press the button and the sound of the ocean is playing, she always focuses her attention to the toy. We definitely recommend this for anyone looking for a crib toy for their baby. It's a must have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still using it at 2","review":"My son spent his first night in his crib with this at 6 weeks old, and is still using it at 2 years old in his bed. Initially the sound put him to sleep as the moving fish were too loud. Now it is the moving fish that lull him to sleep and he can live without the music. A great buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything and more!","review":"I love, love, love this aquarium and wish they made one for adults. My baby has been soothed from the moment it was placed in her bassinet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun but expensive to keep running.","review":"The aquarium is great to look at and listen too, but I have found that I am constantly having to replace the batteries. My daughter isn't even in her crib that often and yet the few times I use the aquarium, I am always replacing the batteries. It seems like so many baby items require batteries now, what happened to wind up items? It is lots of fun, but I find it somewhat inconvenient to keep it in working order. They should have had a wind up version maybe with a solar powered light."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it!","review":"We were intially looking for something like the peaceful planet fish tank we had with our oldest. Couldn't find it so we got this thinking it would be as soothing. The motor is too loud to hear the music if you choose to have the lights and movement on. The lights don't give out enough light to show the fish moving and the fish don't move the way you would think."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best!!","review":"This is probably one of the best things I have received for my 7 month old daughter! We got it at the baby shower before she was born, and let me just say THANK YOU!! Every night when we put her to bed, we turn it on, and she just stares at it. She loves watching the lights and the bubbles, and the music is great. We can pick water sounds or lullabyes and w/ in 10 minutes she is out like a light! I have a few dislikes about it though. The thing inside that makes the bubbles is kinda loud, and if you turn the music down too much, that's all you hear. And the lights get dull after a few times. I think it would look nicer if they would've used soft blue or green lights, but it does make good use for a nite light to peek in on them at night. She will wake up and hit it with her hand and turn it on, but she's still too young to push the lever down and I think that they kinda goofed there. All in all, it is a great thing to own, and I highly recommend it to new moms and dads."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have","review":"This is a \\"must have\\" in my opinion. The Ocean Wonders Aquarium was a shower gift. My daughter is almost 4 months old, and she has slept in her crib since she got home from the hospital. Because of the soft, soothing sounds of the Aquarium, she has never been fussy when it is bedtime, and we have been able to establish a ritual very easily. She watches it every night as she drifts off to sleep. My husband and I love watching her look at it as she tries to keep her eyes open. I think that every baby should have this little gadget!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BABY LOVES THIS....","review":"WOW...I received this as a shower gift. A friend had told me this was one of those can't live without baby items. I got it home after the shower and decided I didn't like it. To make a long story short, we went back to the store after our baby was born, since winding up her toys in her crib to get her to sleep became to time consuming. She loves her fish... We turn them on for our baby every night. She likes the music and it has the perfect amount of light to see her and not to keep her awake. I tried switching it with a musical mobile and she keep looking to the side of the crib where the fish were... A total must have for baby!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best!!","review":"My son has this in his crib. When he was just a little guy, I would turn on the music and lights when he went to sleep. Now, I put him in his bed at bedtime and he turns it on himself. In fact, he has figured out how to reach on the back and change the music and sounds!!! It is the greatest thing!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"We love the \\"fishies\\"!!","review":"My 6 mo. old son absolutely loves his \\"fishies\\". He lies in bed staring at them in the morning when he wakes up, (mind you the fishies are off). He's so intrigued by them he starts talking to them in baby language for about an hour! At night I turn it on for him to watch as he's falling asleep, and the \\"fishies\\" work instantly. One thing that could make it better is selling it with a remote control to turn it back on when it turns off so baby doesn't see you turn it back on. It stays on for about 3 or 4 minutes, wish it was longer! I think this product was a great invention, & I recommend it to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful and soothing","review":"This product is just wonderful. We were very happy when we brought it home and started it up. We jokingly said that if our son didn't like it, we would take it for our room, it was so soothing.My son loves the different songs and sounds from this. It is one of the few things that I can have playing while getting him down to sleep. He loves the sound of it. When he wakes up in the middle of the night, he can start it up himself and it helps him fall back to sleep.There are two buttons to \\"play\\" with but they really do not do that much but that is okay to me. I do not want this to be so busy that instead of going to sleep he would want to play with it all the time, which is what happened with our other mobile which we had to take down once he started standing.Our son is 9 months old now and we have really enjoyed this product since we got it for him at 5 months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for bedtime or waking up","review":"My mother-in-law gave the aquarium to my younger son for his first Christmas (he was 6 months old then). He's almost 1 1/2 and still loves the sounds, especially the ocean waves with the lights.Kevin's first few months were difficult as we thought he had colic, and then was diagnosed with reflux (making him uncomfortable laying down). I didn't think the aquarium would work, but it put him to sleep every time I used it. And he loves to play with the buttons in the morning when he wakes up, so he can entertain himself for quite a while.The only drawback is the setting with the bubbles, lights, and sound. The mechanism that generates the bubbles is a little loud and you have to turn the sound up to counteract that, which defeats its purpose at bedtime. But to me that is just a minor glitch. I just leave it set on music and lights at night."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hottest ticket in town","review":"WE have a 10 month old who has had this attached to his crib from day one. The music tells him that it is bedtime, after the bottle and cd playing through. Now that he can sit and stand in the bed, he keeps hitting his head on the start button. We travel often back to Bethlehem, PA to visit and this is almost the first item packed. Very cool and truly a lifesaver."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mesmerizing","review":"This is intriguing even for a two-month-old. We have a very interesting mobile over my daughter's crib and she ignores it -- she'd rather watch her fascinating aquarium. This would be a great baby shower gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't Live Without It","review":"I have 18 month old twins who are very good sleepers. However, I'm quite sure that this product has a lot to do with that. They'vehad them in their cribs since they came home from the hospital and go right to sleep. Now that they're older they'll even hit the button themselves if they happen to wake up during the night. The music lasts for about 10 minutes and is very soothing.I HIGHLY recommend this product!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was so excited to receive this for my shower but was extremely disappointed when I could not use it because it did not mount to the sleigh bed style crib we have for our daughter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ocean Wonders....Safety Blunders!","review":"This toy has been a safety hazard for us. My son's head got trapped between the toy and his mattress."},{"rating":"1","title":"i dont like this at all","review":"My friend daughters loves this and she said i had to have it when i was pregnanat with my daughter.i really do not like it. its not an intresting toy. she never paid an attention to it. also it eats batteries which i hated too. but i really hated the most that it had no remote system at all. the music only plays for ten minutes and it has no remote so just as she was starting to quiet down it would go turn off and you have to go in there and turn it back on which would make her cry again. i stopped turning at all. nows she is 21 months and she turns it on by her self but the batteries go so fast i had to take it out and i dont use it any more. glo worm has same type of product but it plays up to 20 mins and she likes that one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated the bouncer","review":"We had the Fisher Price Kick and Play bouncer and thought we would try the Aquarium. Big mistake. First the bouncer was so high up we thought he might fall. Also the Aquarium was so large and did not fit properly in the bouncer we were scared it would fall and hurt our child. We returned it immediately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after 9 days","review":"I bought this toy because I heard that babies love it. I had it for 9 days before the fish stopped swimming. The music is also really weird. This product was definately a waste of money. I don't think I will buy anything from fisher price again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money!!","review":"I thought that this toy was cute but that is it. I think that this was the stupidest toy ever, It did nothing. My baby didn't even look at it. It is so heavy that if it were to fall of the crib while it was attached, the baby would be serioulsy injured. I would not reccomend this toy to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"marketing gimmick","review":"This was a gift from grandma because her sister had given the same gift to her grandchildren. To us, it was just another way to spend money on plactic, cheap junk for kids. There are a few short and tinny tunes that it plays. It is very durable and safe. I hope that parents can pay more attention to their children and show a bit more creativity in their development and entertaining than by purchasing this toy. Maybe this is a toy for parents who are too busy and over-committed to spend sufficient time with their child and shove things in front of them just to keep them quiet. I told my mother what I thought and she was wondering herself, and we concluded that her sister's daoghter-in-laws lied that they liked the gift. My mother returned it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice Overall","review":"I think the version I have is a newer version than the one in the picture online. My version plays different types of music and it has several other sounds, such as raindrops, ocean sounds, etc. The music it does play is very pretty. The lights come and go and move throughout the toy very gently. I don't like to leave a night light on for my baby, so I just turn this on, and by the time the lights go off, my baby is asleep and I don't have to go back ant turn off lights. She's only 4 months old, so she doesn't play with it yet, so I can't comment on that. She does sometimes kick the button to make it go on, and it's very easy for her to do. I'd have given it 5 stars if it had the option of having just the lights with no music, so I could just turn on a CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't fit newer style cribs","review":"My son loves the ocean wonders aquarium bouncer seat so I thought he would also like the crib aquarium but once we got it home it didn't fit on our crib. The plastic straps on the back are not long enough to fit our crib. Actually they are really only long enough to fit on the older style thin rail crib not the newer style cribs. I actually called fisher price to see if they make an extension piece but they said no, they said it is only designed for cribs that have a thin back rail. They had no solution for me so I have to return the aqarium. I'm going to try the leapfrog crib toy, hopefully that will fit."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Bubbles","review":"I put the ocean wonder aquarium on my registry and received it at my shower because I had gotten another ocean wonders toy and liked the theme. I put the aquarium on my daughters crib and everything was fine for a few hours until the bubbles stopped. Now for a 1 month old that was her favorite part. I tried replacing the batteries and still after a couple of hours no more bubbles. It would make the sound for the bubbles to come out but no bubbles. I find it very noisy and it was very disapointing that the bubbles would not work. My daughter still likes the aquarium and we use it every night with the music and lights. If I would have known that it was going to work like this I would have returned it for another crib toy, or not have put it on my regristy at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is a Wonder","review":"We LOVE this toy!!! I buy it for everyone of my friends whether they have registered for it or not. It is so soothing to my son in his crib. He is now able to kick it on and off with his feet and I find it sweet when I hear it playing on the monitor. The dim lights and soft music are very calming. I like the fact that you can choose from many different tunes and none are annoying. It is so cute how the fish swim around and it has caught my sons attention from day one. He is now 7 months old and still loves to turn it on by himself.The only bad thing is it goes through batteries very quickly and takes a bundle of them. Still I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Great!!!!!!!","review":"This is the best!!

We had to find this out the hard way, as we forgot our PP aquarium on a week-long visit with Grandma. I quickly went out and bought an OW aquarium, and it was a FLOP with my son. The PP aquarium soothed my son to sleep for both naps and bed time, while the OW aquarium seemed to gear up my son. While the PP aquarium has soothing sounds, music, and ceiling lights, the OW strikes out on all three. And why the clam and starfish toys??? Fisher-Price ought to know that the aquarium is really a parents' tool for helping a little one drift off into la-la land, not a tool for play... Wonder if Fisher-Price consulted any parents in their product development and research... Maybe FP will bring back the Peaceful Planet aquarium."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the 1st version: Peaceful Planet Aquarium!!","review":"I was recommended this toy by all my friends & family members.Although they had the 1st version & did complain about the older model eating through the batteries. I tried finding the older version as I really wanted the feature of having the projection picture on the ceiling but had no luck. But, now I realize that this version is much better!! It doesn't eat through the batteries, and it has so many different musical sounds & options to choose from! A sure hit for my 5 month old!! She loves to turn it on & off herself. This is a must have!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not as good as the Peaceful Planet Aquarium","review":"After our P.P.A. died, I ran out to get this one to replace it. I was immediately struck by the fact that the \\"fit and finish\\" were not as good. This one feels cheaper. The fish are not as nice --and horror of all horrors, instead of soothing my 15 month old son to sleep as the old one had done this one stimulates him. It is so loud, it sounds like there is a locomotive coming through his crib, the bubble sound isn't as good (though the music quality is much better), and the lights are not adjustable like the P.P.A.I am preggo with my second child and will now search ebay and any other site to find a new P.P.A. for my baby. I gave this new one to a friend. I just had no use for it. The Peaceful Planet Aquarium was just a much better quality machine. In my mind this new one as cheaply made as a Yugo. I miss the Mercedes-like quality of the other."},{"rating":"1","title":"Updated aquarium a disappointment...","review":"My daughter is 1 1/2 years old and LOVES her F.P. Aquarium. Unfortunately, it malfunctioned and I had to get a new one. The original \\"round\\" aquarium is no longer available. F.P. is now making the updated version as displayed here. It doesn't compare to the original! It doesn't show the waves on the ceiling, the fish don't move in circles and the music is terrible - it doesn't even sound clear. You can even hear this annoying noise it makes while blowing the bubbles - you couldn't hear that before. Why ruin a good thing??? Don't waste your time or money on this. I would suggest finding a used original on an online auction!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Falling Asleep Fast","review":"My son loves his aquarium.

It is attached to the side of my daughters crib and has been since she was born. At 9 months she really enjoys this item.. We put it on every night at bed time, if she does not fall asleep right away she plays with this toy. Pretty fish \\"swim around\\" there are bubbles and lights and quite a few songs. Has different modes i.e music only, fish only. But not only fish to watch , there are two little activities, a star fish that spins by baby pressing a tab, and a clam that opens his mouth by baby rolling a ball. Great soother, great all-around, truly a MUST HAVE!Warning: When my baby was just a little baby and could not turn over or crawl or anything I put this on the floor next to her too look at and it fell over on her head, she cried, we felt bad. But....no fault of the toy, that is just not how it is to be used.

He used to turn it on and off with his feet when he was in his crib at night and it did help put him to sleep. However, as he got older and was able to pull himself up, he was able to pull off the straps. One night I came in and the toy was dangling dangerously close to his head--and the toy IS heavy. So I took it out of his crib. He still loves playing with it on the ground and he's now 14 months old. It's definitely a great toy but I would just be careful of the straps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loving Ocean Wonders!","review":"This has been so much help in getting my baby to go to sleep on her own.

I recommend it to all of my pregnant friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"dangerous crib toy","review":"i tried setting this up on my daughters crib.the way this is tied on w/ a rope at the bottom and two straps on top is very dangerous itried pushing it a little and the straps undid and the toy was hanging from the bottom tied on by a piece of rope.it also takes four d batteries making it extremely heavy so if it hit my 5 month old it probably would knock her out.i am very surprised that fischer price for making such an unsafe toy and will report it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Question for owners","review":"I am very interested in purchasing this for my 3month old.

DRIVING ME CRAZY!!","review":"My son loves to watch the fish and bubbles but when the bubbles are on it is so noisy. There is a knocking noise in the background. He sleeps in my room and I cannot stand it so we are replacing it with another toy ASAP. I would expect more from Fisher Price."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOISEY!","review":"I WAS SO EXCITED TO SEE THAT SOMEONE HAD BOUGHT THE OCEAN WONDERS AQUARIUM FROM MY REGISTRY, LITTLE DID I KNOW HOW MUCH NOISE IT COULD MAKE. THE MUSIC WAS FINE, BUT WHEN THE FISH MOVE AROUND YOU CAN HEAR THE MOTOR. I HAD NO IDEA THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE AS LOUD AS IT WAS. I RETURNED IT EVEN BEFORE MY BABY WAS BORN. I JUST COULD NOT SEE ANYWAY THAT IT COULD SOOTHE MY BABY."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK but.... How Do I Extend the Timer??","review":"Great toy.. Calms our little girl down before bed. Great White noise for young babies. Only have a young baby, so not sure only value of it as she approaches 6+ months. I wish it stayed on for more than 3 pr 4 minutes though.. Anyway to override this? Our baby is lulled and then will jump at the noise because I need to turn it back on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Just For Babies","review":"When my first son was born a friend gave us the predecessor to this aquarium. She said it was a \\"MUST HAVE\\" and she was right. He slept with it and played with it for over two years. Then we passed it on to our 2nd son (now 28 months). It is finally dying - from 4 yrs of constant use. My younger son still turns it on every night and falls asleep to it. We aren't ready to give up the peace this toy has given us. So we are now buying the new \\"Ocean WOnders Aquarium\\". This product is NOT just for infants."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice crib toy!","review":"I got this for my daughter when she was about 4 months old, she's 6 months old now. She loves it. I play the music for her when I put her down for a nap and when she goes to bed at night! She enjoys watching it! I think it's nice that it has 3 different setting. You can just play the music, or it plays music and lights up, or it plays music, lights up and blows bubbles! Although the setting with the bubbles it kind of loud especially when you're trying to get the baby to sleep and they are WAY too young to figure out how to set it. My daughter can push the button to play the music and make the clam open it's mouth (even though she has NO idea what she did). It's very durable, she turns herself around so her feet can kick it so the music is always going on and off!! But she LOVES IT!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best crib toy ever","review":"I don't think there is a crib toy out there that is as wonderful as this. The music is peaceful, many sounds to choose from, all are great. There is volume control, when turned up all the way yes its loud but I keep it turned down of course. When it comes to batteries in 2 and a half years of everyday use, I may have changed then 4 times. My son is now going into a toddler bed and has asked me to put the aquarium on there too. He absolutly loves it. I am due with my second child in May and plan to buy another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"dull and boring","review":"I had heard wonderful things about the peaceful planet so when I looked for one this was what I found. It barely interests my baby who might glace at it. The music lasts such a short period and if you want lights and bubbles the pump is so loud it drowns out the music or water sounds. The lights are very dim and the fish barely move. I would not recommend this product at all. If you have any interest try to get a chance to see it working in person first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than 'New Coke'","review":"I had always assumed that the [person] who suggested producing' New Coke' had enough sense to go into retirement but unfortunatelly I was mistaken. This new product [stinks]!!! The lights are barely visible, and can not be controlled in any way similar to the previous Fisher Price Peaceful Planet . If you have no experience with the previous version you may like that this has nice sounds, but the visuals, which are what ALL the children loved, have been removed. This is a sad day for all parents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really dissapointed","review":"I really can't comment on durability because I haven't had it long enough to really judge. We had the Peaceful Planet aquarium but it broke so Fisher Price sent us this on as a replacement. I've found the music is really wierd; the motor that makes the bubbles is loud and drowns out the musi;, it has three buttons on the front: two of them let the baby operate fish inside the aquarium, the third turns the thing off! So baby turns it off then cries because it quit. Also, it doesn't put the waves on the wall, which was something she really liked about PP, and it doesn't sit on the dresser like the PP did. I found a PP on ebay and am going to hope that it doesn't stick like the old one did. Fisher Price should really have just fixed the one problem with the PP. If you didn't have the PP to begin with, you'd probably be happy with the Ocean Wonders. Otherwise, save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Toy!","review":"My son got this toy for a Christmas present and it kept him busy on the 16 hour drive home. Now that it is in his crib, he loves to kick it on and off a million times. He loves the buttons and it keeps him busy. It makes him feel powerful to be able to control it. If he wakes at night, he just plays a bit and goes back to sleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST HAVE!","review":"We received this as a gift the day we brought home our baby boy and he loved it from the start and now at 8 months he still loves it. We can put him down and turn it on and he falls asleep within minutes. Then when he wakes up he plays with it and sometimes falls back to sleep. I would highly recommend this toy to anyone. The best part is the music stays on for a long time, much longer than his mobile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our Baby loves this toy","review":"This works wonders. We play it for her when she goes to sleep and if she wakes up she turns it on herself and falls back to sleep after a short time. This is much better than an over the head mobil."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have","review":"My grandson has been enthralled with this since he was a newborn. If he would start to fuss, my daughter would push the button for the music and back off to sleep he would go. Even now, at five months, if he wakes up in the middle of the night, she just pushes the button to turn on the music and lights, and he goes right back to sleep. She call it her \\"Miracle Toy\\"! I loved it so much I got him the swing and boucer, which he likes just as much."},{"rating":"2","title":"An utter necessity","review":"We bought this for our baby around 6 mos. old when she was having trouble going back to sleep in the middle of the night. INSTANT TURNAROUND! Ever since then, she uses it as sort of a \\"reverse snooze alarm\\" and turns it on to soothe herself back to sleep. We've since bought one to keep at my parents' house when we go to stay for weekends, because we got tired of unhooking it and toting it across the state. We're now expecting another baby and have already bought one for her. This product has made bedtime/naptime SO MUCH easier. I will buy one for every future baby shower I'm ever invited to."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the BEST gifts we received!!","review":"This was given as a shower gift and highly recommended by several friends. While we didn't use it much at first due to the limited playing time (I didn't wish this to become a nighttime dependency), it has certainly gotten good use since he was able to turn it on himself. Our son is now 2 and he still will turn this on at night and in the morning which is his cue for us to get him up. We have not had any problems with attaching it to his crib even after removing it for battery replacements. This is a great gift to give or get!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for baby and parent","review":"This is a great crib toy and plays either soothing music or ocean sounds. Parents will like that it has a volume control and that you can leave light off or on. As a parent, I love the fact that it gives off enough light to use as a night light should one have to check on their baby at night time.My son has had this since he's been 3 years old and it seems to help him drift off to sleep again should he waken in the middle of the night.The only draw back is that it seems to go through the batteries rather quickly. I wish they would last longer. Either that, or ours just gets over used."},{"rating":"2","title":"christy","review":"My son loves this aquarium. I am going to purchase one for my in-laws who just had a baby and one for my brother and his wife due in June. When he was younger (9 months now) I would turn it on and it would amuse him and he would fall asleep. As he got older, he pretty much slept through the night but would sometimes wake up. He would turn this aquarium on with his feet and watch it and fall back to sleep. He is 9 months now and still loves it. When it is time for bed, I put him in his crib and turn this on and it distracts him so I can exit the room with no tears! I only wish it played a little longer (5 min. now). We have had great time with this toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish they still made Peaceful Planet","review":"I recently bought my daughter this toy after her peaceful planet died, and what a waste of money. The PP was calming and had wonderful soothing bubbles, and the lights on the ceiling were great even for older children. This new version is too loud for anyone to fall asleep to and the motor over powers the sound of the bubbles. There is no lights for the ceiling and the \\"interactive\\" toys are boring for a child over six months. Fisher Price should have never discontinued the original !!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"My husband and I bought this for our 6 month old daughter because she was having trouble falling asleep alone in her crib. The first night we had it, she didn't cry at all - just looked at the aquarium and listened to the music until she fell asleep. We don't use the bubbles, just the lights and music, which last for 10 minutes. That is usually enough time for her to fall asleep. The big button on the front makes it easy for her to hit and she is able to turn it on herself sometimes. When we went to stay at a friends house overnight, I brought it with us and propped it up next to the playpen that she slept in - it worked like a charm!All in all, I think this is great and is going to be my shower gift to all of my friends who are expecting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unhappy Customer","review":"I do not recommend this toy for a child of any age.

I was wrong. My son has been falling asleep to the Peaceful Planet Aquarium for two years. Sometimes the PP Aquarium would get stuck, so I bought the Ocean Wonders Aquarium to replace it. I had to return it because my son does not like it one bit. The motor is too loud and the music is strange. I also think the aquarium is too large. My son and I hope Fisher Price comes out with a new aquarium that is similar to the first one."},{"rating":"2","title":"This product saved my sanity!","review":"I would recommend this to anyone! I bought it for my daughter who is a little freaked out by mobiles. I figured it was less intimidating. She's 5 months and can't turn it on with her hand yet - but she has taught herself to turn it on with her feet in the middle of the night and during naps. When she wakes up - she turns it on - watches it for a while - and drifts right back to sleep. It's so quiet that my husband and I never know it's turned on unless we get up for some reason and see a little light shining from her room. I've also heard it come on while she's napping through her monitor - and then it stops and she never makes a peep and goes back to sleep. This is an A+++ product for those of you with a sprited child who wakes up from naps and won't go back to sleep. My daughter LOVES THIS AQUARIUM! Thank you Fisher Price!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Such a disappointment from the original....","review":"Our son LOVES his Peaceful Aquarium - so much that we bought a 'backup' in case something happened to one of them. It did, in fact, and Fisher Price sent me a 'replacement' - the new Ocean Wonders Aquarium. My husband and I were extremely disappointed with the newer model. The lights and bubbles are nowhere near as bright or entertaining as the old model - our son just does not like it at all. If you can get your hands on the old one - I highly recommend that one over the new one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the original!","review":"As pointed out by many other consumers of this item, the motor is way to loud, it takes larger batteries(uses them just as fast) and is missing the water/light effect, in comparison to its older sibling model, the peaceful planet aquarium. Im not sure if they still make it, but My old one still works, and my 2 1/2 yr old wont give it up for her newborn sister. I m now on the hunt for a PP Aquarium. I will be returning this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"The straps are too short!!!","review":"I registered for this Ocean Wonders Aquarium after reading all the reviews for this item. It is very soothing for the baby, but it has some flaws. First of all, the straps are too short for my baby's bed. I and my husband tried to think of a way to fix the problem, but there is no way that we can install it. So, I don't know what to do with it :("},{"rating":"2","title":"I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS AQUARIUM!","review":"This was a great purchase! It is amazing... soothing and relaxing. As soon as we turned it on, my husband and I fell in love with it. It is beautiful and it gives the sensation of being surrounded by nature and by the ocean's beauty. It has various settings, so you can listen to lullaby, or to nature's sounds... my 3 month old baby loves it, and stares at it for a long time and falls asleep easily. I recommend it very much, especially if you love the ocean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed, prefer the original version.","review":"My 4 1/2 yr. old daughter had the original Peaceful Planet Aquarium as an infant and it was a lifesaver. I saved it for baby #2 but received the Ocean Wonders Aquarium as a gift. I hate it! The music is creepy and the bubble feature is so LOUD and makes a clunking noise. Instead of soothing my son he gets agitiated. I kept it in his crib to give him something to look at until I woke up to his screams one night. His head was trapped between the mattress and this toy. Out with the new and in with the old. If you're interested in this toy I recommend finding the original one in a resale shop or at a garage sale. They go through batteries and don't run long enough however. You'll find yourself getting up several times to start it over if your baby isn't asleep before it stops."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disapointed","review":"I was very disapointed with this mobile. My daughters crib is 1 of the convertible cribs with a bigger head board & we had a really hard time even getting the mobile attached to the crib.

We ended up returning it for another mobile."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product!","review":"I bought this for my 3 month old and she loves it.

It is definitely worth the money and I would purchase it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for your kids!","review":"We bought our ocean wonders aquarium when my son was just a few months old, and he loved it. Every night when we put him to sleep he would \\"start\\" his music and listen to it until he nodded off. When he woke up in the middle of the night, he would push the button for the lights and music and he would be soothed back to sleep. Sometimes we wouldn't even have to get up to resettle him, which was wonderful! He wore his aquarium out, so when his little sister was born, she got her own. She's going to be two years old this month and she still plays with it at every nap and bedtime. The music playing becomes almost \\"ritualistic\\", so don't let it run out of batteries!We've never regretted this purchase, and haven't had any problems with its' durability, although after about a year the motion part of the toy stopped working for some reason. It doesn't seem to bother my daughter, so we just left it alone because the music and the 'bubbling' still work.I highly recommend this toy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"This has entertained and entertained our little boy for 6 months - he just loves watching, listening and pushing the buttons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"Absolutely love this aquarium!

He goes to sleep with it every night(and day) for 4 mos straight!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not as good as the PPA","review":"I'm so dissapointed in this new model. When the bubbles are turned on the motor sounds like an running car. It is not at all soothing the way the PPA was with my first son. The music is better but even the fish don't appear to swim as well with this model. It's a shame they didn't perfect the old model. I reccomended it to everyone. Newer is not better in this case. Save your money and hunt down the old model if you can. It's Much Better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"piece of JUNK","review":"The motor in this thing is loud when the bubbles are turned on. In addition, the water leaked, causing the batteries to leak acid. I was horrified to find battery acid on the toy and crib sheet.

The music on this new one is terrible! It sounds like funeral music! The water feature is so loud, and isn't very soothing. He cries when he plays with it now, if he plays with it at all. Fisher-price should have never messed with the old version, I use to recommend it often. I won't be recommending this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"totally disappointed!!!","review":"I bought this toy for my newborn niece after seeing it on commercials and reading others' reviews just to be disappointed! The commercial made it seem like the little fishes were moving and the lights looked really pretty. I decided to test it out before I gave it to her and I am so glad that I did. To my surprise, neither the fishes nor the water moved, the lights were not as nice as I had anticipated, and frankly it was just plain BORING!!! I bought this toy under false pretences and I would not recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"The right sleep toy for my kid","review":"My 8 month old has been falling asleep to this for 3 months now. I wish there were more tunes and the bubbles are too loud, but other than that it is very soothing to watch and listen. He likes playing with the lever and button roller. They should ditch the bubbles and just make the fish move and add some more songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helps baby sleep, but also makes him smile.","review":"My little boy, who is 15 months, loves this aquarium. The music is very soothing and helps him fall asleep. Just today I rocked him with the music playing and he was asleep within minutes.I know he also loves to play with the aquarium since I hear him playing with it in the morning and after he wakes for naps. Sometimes he'll want to be put in his crib just to play with it.We are having baby#2 soon, so I am definitely getting a second one so both kids have one in their room.I highly recommend this for any baby!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Our Baby Loves This!","review":"I'm so glad I registered for this item. My 5 month old has used this for 3 months now and he is still as interested in it as he was the first time he saw it. It is wonderful in the middle of the night if he wakes up because I can usually turn it on and soothe him back to sleep. The other feature I like about this toy is, unlike other musical crib toys, this one has several different settings on it. You can use each setting with or without lights and with or without bubbles. Our little boy just loves this! I strongly recommend this item because you will get months of use out of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never got to use it...","review":"Some babies may like it, but ours never got the chance to use it. It doesn't fit her crib. Make sure you check that the top rails of your crib are small enough for the straps to fit around. Also, I think our particular toy may have been defective because the bubbles never worked and it was very loud and bright. Unfortunately, I had thrown away the box and literature before I knew all this or I would've taken it back. I will never do that again."},{"rating":"1","title":"If it worked....","review":"We took this out of the box right away. It worked when we tested it and less than a week later it stopped working. Of course, we threw our box away (husband never sees the use of saving the boxes) because we've read such great things about Fisher Price items. The bubbles and lights don't work and the sound is so soft that you can hardly hear it. We're very disappointed in this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor \\"sequel\\" for the original Ocean Wonders Aquarium","review":"We bought this one because we LOVE the original and assumed this 2nd version would be as good or better. It is a lot worse. It is loud and has a noisy motor that is anything but soothing, too many buttons that are not accessible to the toddler like the original. Overall a poor toy, one that neither of my boys ever uses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where does the water go???","review":"I received this product as a gift when my son was a few months old. After having it in storage for a couple of years I took it out this morning to put it up for my daughter and there's barely any water left. I called the consumer number on the back and I was told that yes, sometimes the water evaporates but no one knows where it goes. I was told it was a mystery. And there's no way to replace it. I expected a little something other than an \\"I'm sorry\\" from the very nice woman I spoke with, but no. We liked it very much for my son and would have given it a four star rating, but based on the fact that it does not survive the test of time, I give it only one star.As far as discarding it, I was told to bring it to an electronics recycler. There goes a few more bucks on a toy that has no use to me. Sigh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea but falls short...","review":"My son loved this at 6 months when we bought it for him, but he loved to hit it while in the crib and he kept shutting it off and hence screaming ensued. Needless to say we took it back the day after we bought it. It was very frustrating. I don't know why the manufacturer would make it so that the baby could turn it off on his own so easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it, but wish it would play longer","review":"I originally had the older model, which I picked up at a garage sale. But it was broken and made a clicking noise. So I bought the newer model and I love, love, love it. My son isn't old enough to turn it on by himself yet, but it TOTALLY helps him fall asleep.I just wish it would play longer. It seems to be on short play cycle, and if he doesn't fall asleep in the time it plays, I have to get up and turn it on again. And again, and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"SLEEPS GREAT!","review":"My son started using this as soon as we broght him home and he loves it! We have a large \\"real\\" aquarium he loves to stare at and when its time to go to bed the Ocean Wonders Aquarium does the trick. I do wish it would stay on longer as he doesn't quite get to sleep fast enough (it shuts off after 5, 10 or 15 mins depending on the mode)but i usually wait and push the button again for him.

It is on the side of his crib and I turn it on every night before he falls asleep. Sometimes it takes 2 or 3 restarts before he falls asleep but it does help! He laughs hysterically at the fish. Great entertainment! Unfortunately it did not start to entertain him until he was 4 months.

When she became 5 months old the bubbles stopped working and it leaked out some water and with no bubbles, the fish don't swim.

I put it on very low at night and it's fine.The musical choices aren't the best, but hey, it's music and he seems to like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed!","review":"I bought the Ocean Wonders Aquarium because it looked very cute and I hoped it would be a bit better than the Peaceful Planet Aquarium. My son used the PP Aquarium for almost 2 years and loved it. The only reason we aren't using it now is the motor seems to be going and is getting loud.If it weren't for the loud pump noise for the bubbles, I would keep this item. However, I'm also disappointed that the volume control doesn't go lower than it does and that the unit doesn't stay on longer. I've tried using it for my 7 month old but she has no interest in it and it's too loud to soothe her to sleep. This will be returned."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Accident Waiting To Happen","review":"I purchased this toy for my 4 1/2 month old thinking that the soothing ocean sounds would relax him and help him to fall asleep at night. Athough he seemed to enjoy it, the toy is an accident waiting to happen. I placed it on the crib rail per the instructions and it fell off into his crib sometime during the night while he was sleeping. As far as crib toys go it is on the heavy side and I am lucky it didn't fall on top of him. The straps obviously do not hold well. I do not recommend this toy at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"aquarium 2","review":"This new Ocean Wonder Aquarium is OK but nowhere as good as the original Peaceful Planet Aquarium. My 1 1/2 yr old still use his Peaceful Planet Aquarium (he LOVES it)so I wanted to buy another one for our new baby and when I saw the bigger Ocean Wonder Aquarium I thought great!!! But even though it has the fish & bubbles like peaceful did, the Ocean Wonder doesn't have the dancing waves on the ceiling and when you turn the music off & the bubbles on the motor has a Very noticeable sound, might not be very peaceful to some babies, where peaceful WAS peaceful. My 4 month old will watch the Wonder fish but doesn't seem as entertain as he is with the Peaceful Planet one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm disappointed! :o(","review":"We recently were looking for the peaceful planet aquarium from fisher price. My friend's new baby has it and my son loved it. The lights are wonderful, the music is great, and the kids adore it. But, as fisher price often does, they discontinued it and made the ocean wonders aquarium. I do not like this toy! I most definetly would not recommend buying this for your little one. The music is loud even on the lowest volume setting and the music is anything but soothing! The lights are a crude white in contrast to the soft blue of the peaceful planet aquarium and unlike the peaceful planet aquarium, the ocean wonders aquarium does not have the window that projects the light onto the ceiling and walls. I am extremely disappointed with my purchase. My son does not care for the toy, either. (Which is most important!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bring back the Peaceful Planet Aquarium!","review":"We bought this for our infant daughter as a replacement for my older son's Peaceful Planet Aquarium. At first, I was pleased by this product's design and the addition of toys for the child. However, when we began using it, we HATED it! First of all, as others have noted, the motor is excrutiatingly loud to the point that it drowns out the soothing sounds. Second, the lights are too bright for use in a dark room when trying to soothe (not shock) delicate little eyes. Finally, the music on this product is too radio-like, not like the tinkling little lullablies found on its predecessor. After using it for two nights, I put it back in the box and returned it to the store. This toy would fall under the old adage...if it isn't broken, don't fix it! Fisher Price really goofed on this \\"improvement.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"not impressed","review":"The only crib toy I really liked and thought was entertaining for my new baby was the Peaceful Planet Aquraium. Unfortunatly I was told that was no longer avalible. but this one was the new model replacing it. first the bubbles only come out of one side, instead of both sides(unless you tip it over). then the sounds don't sound much like waves or water running and actually scares my child and the toys on it for the baby to play with are too small for the baby to find. I hate to write reviews but this product was so dissapointing. Very much a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bring Back The Old","review":"My 2 1/2 year old will not sleep without Fisher Price's Peaceful Planet Aquarium. It has been great. Unfortunately, she has had it since she was born and just recently the motor that turns the fish in the aquarium stopped working. She had a fit so I told her we would get a new one. Unfortunately, the so called new one does not work like the old. She does not like the Ocean Wonders Aquarium. Why did Fisher Price change the model? If anyone knows where I can get a Fisher Price Peacefil Planet Aquarium please let me know!! Fisher Price should hire parents for R&D!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My son loves this toy!","review":"My mom bought this for my 6 week old son, he has colic and he loves this toy. We have it on his changing table and I turn it on whenever I change his diaper. His favorite setting is with the bubbles. This toy is especially great because it is sometimes the only thing that soothes him during his colicky periods. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivates my daughter...","review":"My 4 month old daughter is just starting to learn that she can affect the world and this toy is helping to teach that lesson. This is the first toy that she has ever been able to turn on and off by herself. She was stunned the first time she hit the blue bar and the lights and sound went off. She was thrilled when she hit it again and everything came back on. It keeps her interest about 10 minutes at a time --which is no small feat for a baby her age. The only problem I have is how to attach it to the crib with the bumper pad in the way --and still have it low enough for her to reach. I'm still trying to figure that out."},{"rating":"2","title":"The original is better","review":"I bought the original Aquarium when it first cane out in 2000 and I absolutely loved it. But when I took it out this year for our next child a lot of the water had evaporated. I bought her a new one and was certain this one would be even better than the first, but unfortunatly I was wrong. The original was so quiet, and this one is quite loud when it is on the bubble setting. We can barely hear the music over the hum of the motor. I'm torn between pulling out the old one or using the new one without the bubbles. All the other features are great. And I like the way the lights change. Oh yah, on the original you could see the lights reflect onto the ceiling. This one doesn't do that. I would have given the original 5 stars, but this one I consider average."},{"rating":"1","title":"BRING BACK PEACEFUL PLANET-P-L-E-A-S-E","review":"VERY SIMPLE. THIS TOY JUST DOES NOT CUT IT. MY SON CANNOT GET BACK TO SLEEP WITH THIS, AND I CANNOT FIND ANOTHER PEACEFUL PLANET. I WOULD DO JUST ABOUT ANYTHING TO GET MY HANDS ON ONE. MY SON'S PEACEFUL PLANET'S MOTOR ALSO BURNED OUT, BUT IT WAS USED EVERY DAY, EVERY NIGHT!!. IT COMPLETELY LULLED HIM TO SLEEP WITH THE LIGHTS, DIFFERENT SOUNDS, MUSIC, ETC. IT WAS WONDERFUL!! THIS PRODUCT WAS JUST A WASTE OF $$ FOR ME."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love it...HATE IT!","review":"I have a love, mostly hate relationship with this product. My daughter absolutely loves it.2 hours after I put her to bed she is still pushing the button with her foot and is having a good old time. I have to go in there and physically shut it off. This toy would be awesome IF when you set it to turn off in 5 minutes, the child didn't have the ability to keep turning it back on!!!! What incentive is there to sleep? Not sure this is going to stay in the crib. I don't really need her turning this on in the middle of the night to have fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"1st time Mom","review":"This toy has been the best buy I have made for my son so far. We visted my in-laws in Oklahoma and my son could not sleep without it so his grandmother went and bought him one. We have gone through a lot of batteries! I have enjoyed the different setiings, not only is it calming at night, but he loves to play and watch the bubbles durning the day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish I had one when I was my baby's age!","review":"We've been living with the Ocean Wonders Aquarium for almost two months now, and so far, this one is a slam-dunk winner. Amazon's sale price of $19.99 was a great deal, but to be honest, I'd have paid many times that just to see the wonder on my three month old boy's face the first time we fired it up. The whole effect: music, bubbles and swimming fish fascinates him to no end, and has been soothing him to sleep reliably since day one.I can't say your baby will appreciate it as much as ours, but from the reviews I've been reading here and our own experiences so far, the odds favor your child loving it!Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good option","review":"The only reason I'm giving this four stars is that it doesn't have a continuous play option. We stopped using this for white noise and bought the First Years Nature Lullaby Player instead because it plays constantly and won't shut itself off, since our baby wakes up if the white noise goes away. Otherwise, very cute, very entertaining and easy to use. And for the reviewer who said it was too loud--the volume control works well for that problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every Mom needs one of these!!!","review":"This is the best crib toy I have ever found. It has an on/off switch, PLUS a volume control. The music is soothing and melodious, (not loud & obnoxious like toys we have). The lights start out low, then brighten, and the sounds start out soft and get louder. This is great, as it doesn't startle baby out of her bed, plus, it doesn't abruptly shut off and wake baby when it is finished. You can set the music and lights OR one or the other. This was made with Mom's in mind!!The perfect shower gift!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed.","review":"My hope was that this toy would help my 2m old son fall asleep and/or keep him occupied for a few minutes. He seemed to like it the first time we set it up...even fell asleep once. Since then, he has showed no interest in it. When I turn it on, he starts crying after a few seconds. I give it two stars because I like the concept and because I remain hopeful that he'll like it when he gets older. I recommend the Tiny Love Mobile instead. That keeps my son's attention for 15 min. and puts him to sleep sometimes."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretty, but boring","review":"My 5 month old did not like this product. She could turn it on and off right away, but lost interest in 2 minutes. It definitely sounds like an aquarium. I did not like the music. I do like the water sounds, I just wish there was an all night option. That is the only way my baby sleeps. I also don't like the fact that if you change modes (there are 3) you have to reset the sound you want, i.e. crashing waves. Any time you switch modes it automatically goes to the 1st song, which I can't stand. I don't feel it is worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"FINALLY-no crying during the night","review":"My 6 month old daughter usually wakes up and cries for 5 or so minutes around 3:00. Last night, I installed this on her crib. When she woke up, she hit it to turn it on and went right back to sleep-no crying!!! I love this."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Good, but could be better\\"","review":"My son loves this toy and goes well with his nautical themed nurshery. The only thing I hate about it is the music. My son is fine as long as I have the music turned OFF! I would not really reccomend this item. Also, IT LEAKS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Crib Toy","review":"I bought this to help ease my daughter's transition from my bed to her crib. It helped a lot, my daughter really likes the lights and bubbles. Plus the calming music really lets her know that it's time for bed. Now that she is almost 7 1/2 months old, she can play with the buttons that spin the starfish or open and close the clams mouth. It's cute when she cuts the music on and off herself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great but it shuts off way to soon!","review":"IT should have an option to get it on for longer 20-30min! it only last like 5 and it is annoyong to restart it when the babe is trying to sleep!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy","review":"All this aquarium did was disturb my son's sleep. It seems to be made pretty well, but I don't see the benefit of having one of these in my child's crib. The amount of times he would switch it on and play with it therefore waking himself up was crazy! In the end I removed it. Total waste of money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nighty night!","review":"The most restful music I have ever heard in a crib toy. The lights slowly brighten and dim, and the bubbles are soothing. It has been a great tool to help my son go to sleep on his own. I put him in the crib and turn that thing on (we choose to do just music and lights for 10 minutes usually) and he is asleep before it is done. I wish they made one for grown ups!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Shower Gift","review":"My 6 month old daughter loves this aquarium. We've been using it to lull her to sleep since she was 8 wks old. She's just now learned how to turn it on herself when she wakes up in the middle of the night.

The orginal was a life saver because my 3 year old loved that. This new model's motor is way too loud and just does not have the attractive features of it's predecessor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mothers BEWARE .... it leaks","review":"This aqaurium has been a lifesaver for me for almost 5 months. Sadly, I have to give it \\"1 Star\\" because it started leaking last night. The water was sticky (almost like a gel) and had an unusual smell. Luckily, my baby was not in his crib when this happened. Although this has helped many sleepless nights, I am afraid to purchase another one. Hopefully I will be able to find something similar to this to replace it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many little flaws add up","review":"I was really excited to register for this - and really disappointed when I got it. Biggest problem I had was that the moving fish part was broken. I could only get music and lights. But even if that was working, the music itself is wierd and annoying sounding - and really loud. I can't imagine how they think this would put anyone to sleep. The nature sounds setting was ok. Worst part was the button for baby to manipulate. The lever and the spin dial that work the fish were hard for me to use, I can't imagine a baby having the strength and dexterity to work this. And the large button in the middle which allows baby to turn it on themselves was so touchy that they would just start the same song over and over again. Since it has a motor and moving parts, it eats 4 huge D batteries. I can almost see using this as a toy, but not a soothing crib item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it!","review":"I received the previous model (peaceful aquarium) of this product for my son that is now 3 years old. He still uses it every night to fall asleep. It is such a great item that I bought it for several friends when they had children and added it to the top of my all time favorite baby items list. Now that fisher price has stopped making this item and started selling this new model, I am completely disappointed. I have a 3 month old baby girl who was given this one as a gift. I would return it in a heartbeat if I didn't think my friend would be offended. It is loud, obnoxious and not soothing at all. I can not say enough bad things about it. Fisher Price made a huge mistake when they made this model. It has mechanical sounding music that makes my child cry when I play it. It is AWFUL!!!! I too would pay dearly to have another of the previous model."},{"rating":"2","title":"no room","review":"I am curious if anyone else had a problem with this not fitting in the crib. Maybe it is just my bumper, but even on the lowest mattress setting, there is still no room to hang. Too bad, because I think my baby would have loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Night Night","review":"I use this to help my little one go to sleep. He is only 6 weeks old so not that into it yet but he dose sleep when he hears it come on if he was starting to wake up and we turn it on before he is fully awake. The light it makes is pefect to use to check on him durring the night with out waking him up. If I put him in his craddle and he is awake it will keep his attention for a short time so I can go to the bathroom or do somthing before the music stops, somtimes he is even asleep by the time I got back to him even if it was not nap time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great! My daughter still loves it!","review":"This was a gift that I will definitly be using for my second child. My daughter has had this since birth and has always loved it. She would play in her crib with the music while I picked up the room, bubbles and lights at nap/bed time, and all three at bedtime now. She is almost two now and will reach up and turn it on herself in the middle of the night when she wakes up sometimes.It can be loud. I've had the volume turned down to where it is almost off the whole two years, but it's been the perfect level for my daughter."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best toy my newborn received!","review":"From the time he was one week old, this toy has kept my little boy happy! He loves looking at the moving fish and the light. He's not all that interested in the music, but loves the bubble sounds it makes and can just stare at it forever! It has come in handy endless times when I want to take a shower or get some housework done. My god-daughter calls it \\"Fishy TV\\". The only things I don't like is that it only stays on for a short time and until they are bigger, babies can't turn it back on. Once they learn, it's no problem. Also, it was a little hard to attach to our crib, but we figured out a way. Overall, it's a great product and I would recommend it to any new mom or as a gift for a baby shower!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps him entertained in his crib.","review":"We got this gift for my baby shower and put it in our son's crib. At 6 months, he is now rolling over and many times we find him on his stomach, watching the aquarium in his crib. The lights, movement and music keeps him entertained and helps strengthen his neck and arm muscles as he pushes himself up to watch it; and then he reaches over to press the on and off button on his own. We can catch a couple more minutes of sleep while our son plays in his crib, enjoying his aquarium."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helps my baby sleep.","review":"We used this at nap and bed time since by son was born. Now that he is 16 months, if he wakes in the night he \\"fishboxes\\" himself! He hits the large blue button and the music soothes him back to sleep.

After reading all of the other reviews I decided to give this four stars even though she doesn't like it anymore. I guess she's just spoiled rotten because she couldn't care less about the fact that it's hanging on her crib. She just wants to get out. Maybe she'll like it when she gets older and a little more independant. (If that ever happens!)Also, this may just be a problem with mine, but the volume doesn't turn down very low. Even if she would go to bed with it, I'm sure it would wake her up because it's so loud.If anyone has any suggestions about the volume problem please let me know (vessjl@yahoo.com)."},{"rating":"1","title":"This toy leaks the water...","review":"I've had this item for two years, and recently had to replace the batteries for the second time, and low and behold, one of the batteries' silver cover was coming off, and it was all corroded.

I would no recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great item","review":"My husband & I love the adjustability of this crib toy. You can keep it soft and low lit for those times you want to soothe your baby to sleep- or you adjust the volume and light controls for more playful times.

I must say that I couldn't get my 1 1/2 month old to stay asleep in her crib without me getting up and touching her every 20 minutes. You really can't expect them to sleep alone, adn put themselves to sleep until 3 months or so, but this saved my sanity for the first 2+ months. Kylen just LOVES this toy....yes, the bubbles are loud, but that makes her stop crying b/c its louder than she is. She has kicked it a few etimes and made it go off at night, but it hasn't woken her up. I don't use it EVERY night so that she's not dependant on it....but it was well worth the 25-some odd dollars for this aquarium!...Much better than the conventional mobile!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not that impressed","review":"I tried this with both of my children, and it certainly did not allow me to just put them in their crib and fall asleep. My biggest issue with this item is that it can really only be hooked up to the top of the crib railing, which is too far up to really look at if you're the baby lying on the mattress. I tried to rig it up so it was mattress-level, but the bumper pad got in the way. Plus, my kids would either turn it off or on if they accidentally hit the on/off button while trying to play with the other buttons--that should be on the top of the device."},{"rating":"2","title":"A big over hype for my son.","review":"Got it because of the good review.

She is now 3 months old and loves it even more. She loves to look at the bubbles and the lights. She loves the different sounds and songs. Only thing that I would change on this is that it should stay on a bit longer.

Overall this is wonderful and I highly recommend it for your baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the toy....Still Disappointed","review":"Before I tried to attach this toy to my sons crib, I really loved how it worked. I thought the sounds and the music were great. However, I am very disappointed that because this is our first child who is 3 weeks old, and we purchased a brand new crib, we cannot use this toy. It will not attach to new cribs that have wider top bars. I can use it while he is laying on his play mat and lean it up against something, but I am still bummed because when we were shopping we were looking for a crib toy specificaly.

I haven't tried putting him to sleep with it but I'm sure it would do the job. He gets very relaxed looking at it and hearing the soothing sounds. It also has a button on it to change the different sounds. A friend of mine has the same one for her son and he loves it too.

When we put our daughter to bed, we turn it on and she falls right asleep. This is a must have for the crib!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh Magical Fish!","review":"My baby loves these fish. Originally I had the older Fisher Price aquarium, but they recently \\"died.\\" I ordered the newer version as fast as I could. As soon as my little one starts to stir, I can turn them on, and she will fade back into sleep. The only drawback I can see is that they take 4 size D batteries which seems like a lot to me for a little toy. All in all though, it is worth it for me to get a few extra zzzzzs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"fun aquarium","review":"I bought this for my third baby. Two babies later it still works. The kids still like to push it and watch the fish go round and round and the bubbles. It is a great baby toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"great sleep inducer!","review":"Our baby was fascinated with this almost right from the start. When we transitioned him from the cradle in our room to his crib @ 4 mos. we'd turn it on right away when we laid him down in the crib. He wouldn't fuss that we were leaving him in the crib - he was too wrapped up in the Ocean Wonders.Older babies can turn it on themselves easily too (which he does now @ 7mos - sometimes.) The batteries are just starting to wear down after 3 mos.+ of nightly use.We'd consider this an ESSENTIAL for a new baby & a PERFECT shower gift!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An absolute lifesaver. And relaxing too!","review":"I first discovered this toy while watching a friend's baby and vowed that when the time came I'd buy one for my own child. Well, I did (months before Baby was born!) and it has proven to be one of the best purchases that I have made for my baby so far (apparently others feel the same way because I received two more Ocean Wonders Aquariums as gifts before our baby's arrival!) Aside from mesmorizing infants with the lights and fish, the bubbling sound feature is perfect for baby's relaxation and for lulling to sleep. The sound is perfect for nighttime feedings as well. An added bonus is that the bubbling noise also calms and relaxes my husband and me as we prepare our little one for bed (sometimes we find ourselves dozing off too!) All in all, an absolutely great toy and wise purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"soothing","review":"I got this as a gift and really like it. It is so soothing while hearing the music and the bubbles. I would recommend this and the bouncy chair."},{"rating":"1","title":"kind of so-so","review":"We have had this thing for a while. I have everything from the Ocean Wonders Series. While I am extremely happy with most of the other items, this item was rarely ever used with my son. The music did not soothe him when he was worked up, and it has never once put him to sleep. The fish and clam in it has never been able to catch his attention for more than half of a second. He will listen to the music while I change his diaper, but that doesn't last very long. Maybe the company should try again."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than just to soothe...","review":"We got this as a gift when my son was about 2 months old. I put it on his crib altogether with the sounds and light mobile from FP too. Until he was able to pull him self up (around 7 months), he only interested in his mobile.. maybe those stary ceiling worked better to soothe him to sleep. He's 11 months old now, and this Ocean Wonders has been his fave thing to play until he's worn himself out and fell asleep. He knows how to turn the volume low/high, change the music and he loves doing the clam and the starfish too... sometimes we even didn't know that he was up from his nap or sleep until we heard he turned this toy on. He barely ever cried when he woke up, straight to the Ocean Wonders and he's all happy!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT TOY!","review":"I bought this for my little one when right after she was born and it was wonderful! She loved to listen to the sounds and she would go right to sleep! Now she is older and she can push the buttons herself and she still loves it! This is a toy that will last a long time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"We took this everywhere we went. It soothed our daugter to sleep and she LOVES the sound of the Ocean it makes. Now that she is a Toddler she enjoys playing with it in her crib while she waits for us to come wake her up."},{"rating":"2","title":"My baby LOVES this...","review":"My son is 3 months old and he loves this. I keep it on the music/lights/bubbles setting, and he becomes completely mesmerized by it. One night I heard him fussing a little, and then I heard the music come on (he must have been kicking his feet up and hit the switch by accident). But it was great because within minutes he was back to sleep!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT bedtime friend, but LOVES batteries","review":"I have the smaller aquarium, but really have ejoyed it for my son. He is 22 months old now & still loves it & actually, has to have it on for bedtime. He prefers it when the light is on which really burns the batteries. I'd say that this is a fantastic product, but I will not use it for my second baby b/c it goes through batteries too quickly. I don't know about this large version, but the small version takes 4 C batteries & it needs new batteries about every 3 weeks."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful way to sooth your infant to lullaby land.....","review":"My baby slept in her own room in her crib because of these soothing sounds, if she would cry I would just turn it on and she would stop and fall right back to sleep. We have also moved several times and passed this on to a friend so I would rate the durability very high also"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great cot toy - but can it really send babies to sleep?","review":"This is sold partly as a toy and partly as a device to aid sleep. My 9 month old has not yet got to sleep using it, as it distracts him, but this may be different for other babies. He does love playing with it, watching the fish, listening to the music and batting the lever to make the little starfish spin.The water leaked slightly during our transaltantic 'plane flight (not the manufacturer's fault but it's worth knowing). It would benefit from having a few more controls - perhaps they couldput Spongebob Squarepants in to make it perfect!"},{"rating":"1","title":"motor way too noisy","review":"my last baby loved the older peaceful planet aquarium model. Even though it was a battery eater it was worth it. so i got this one for my son, 4 months old. I was very disappointed. I assumed they would improve it. But the motor is so noisy it drowns out the sounds and music. i found it very annoying and returned it. I found the older model at a resale shop and bought him that one. At least we can hear the sound effects, even though it is not as interesting or cute looking than the newer one."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Baby Boy Loves It!!!","review":"I purchased this after my son outgrew his mobile. He loved to watch his mobile and I didn't know if I could find something to take it's place. When I first put this in his crib, I turned it on with the bubbles and everything. I think that kinda freaked him out at first. Then I adjusted the settings to where it is just the lights and music. Now he lays there and stares at the lights and fish and goes off into sleepy-land. Another perk is the songs aren't that annoying (like many other baby toys). They are are calming and relaxing. I highly recommend this item for anyone looking for something to lull their child to sleep. It works!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Part of my baby's bedtime routine","review":"I play this as I get my 11 month old son settled in his crib. We've been using it since we moved him to a crib at three months. It helps him understand it's time for sleep. In the morning the aquarium is usually on when I go get him. I don't think it sounds particularly melodic or soothing, the background noise reminds me of an old air conditioner. But it works for him, so it works for us. I definitely recommend this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"8 week old loves this toy","review":"I just bought this for my daughter who will be 8 weeks old tomorrow and for her it was love at first sight. I put in on the side of her crib and she just stared and stared and stared in amazement, when the music and lights went off she cried for me to turn it back on. The only complaint I have is that the setting that turns the music lights and bubbles (her favorite part) only lasts five minutes, but I still love this toy!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Motor is too loud","review":"I just got the Ocean Wonders Aquarium for our daughter. We have the Peaceful Planet, but it always seemed to eat through batteries. I thought this one might be better, but I was wrong. The motor, when the fish swim around, is way too loud for her to fall asleep. I do like to music on this one better than the Peaceful Planet, but I bought so she could watch the fish swim around. I think we will just go back to the Peaceful Planet and deal with changing the batteries all the time...at least she falls asleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish It Stayed on Longer","review":"I have the Peaceful Planet aquarium for my 4 month old, and I see that Fisher Price tried to improve on it, but they goofed. They still only allow it to run for 5 minutes, which isn't long enough for my baby to soothe herself to sleep. Also the motor is loud and when everything stops, everything STOPS! The change from all the stimulation to nothing at all is too startling for her and will make her cry for more. It would be nice if this product would slowly shut itself down and run for a little longer (at least 15 - 20 minutes)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Loud","review":"This toy is supposed to be soothing. The motor is too loud! The music has to be turned up too loud or all you hear is the motor. This could have been a nice toy. The Peaceful Planet Aquarium was much quieter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mikasmom","review":"We love this aquarium! My daughter is 8 weeks old and focuses on this when turned on. It seems to really attract her attention. My 5 yr old loves it, also and is constantly turning it on.We have no complaints about the noise -- I agree it's more of a \\"white noise\\" and seems to be a soothing sound for her as well. I can't wait until she's old enough to touch it and turn it on herself to see her reaction.All-in-all, it's a great gift idea, it's a wonderful crib toy, it's soothing for parents & baby!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Thanks!!!","review":"This toy is not all its cracked up to be!!! Don't believe the hype. My 14 month old hated it! I am bringing it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great for me...","review":"To tell you the truth, my 14 month old daughter didn't care for this toy at all. I wanted to buy her something to put in her crib to help lul her to sleep (since we took the binky away, finally). But this toy did no good. And I tried it for a week, I would put her in her crib turn on the music ( I tried all 3 sounds, lights and bubbles) and she kept hitting the button on the front to shut it off. My recommendation would be to put the button to turn the music on and off in another location where the child can't get to it (like the back). I put her to sleep alot quicker by just patting her back. Sorry but She didn't like any part of this toy. I will be taking it back today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A LIFESAVER... or sleepsaver!!!","review":"This is the best invention yet! A friend recommended this aquarium to me, so I had to have it. My baby was very colicky for the first six weeks of life. I put this in his bassinet and he would look at the lights and bubbles until he fell asleep. My favorite setting is the bubbles and lights only. Now, in the middle of the night, if my six month old wakes up, he presses the button to turn it on and watches until he falls back to sleep. I recommend this to every new mom out there!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly difficult to get through...","review":"I used this book for an Organizational Behavior graduate course. The overall topic is very interesting, however, the book is incredibly hard to get through. It seems that all of the long drawn out chapters could be cut down easily to a tenth of their size, while still conveying all the necessary information. I found myself spending several hours reading each of the chapters, only to find that the same information was just being regurgitated over and over again. And I had to read many of the sentences over and over until they made sense. Though such an interesting topic, it was difficult, time consuming, and frustrating to get through the whole book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Torture","review":"This book is about inflicting pain on the reader. It is incredibly difficult to understand and absorb the ideas presented in this book, as the author has a dull, long-winded, and pedantic writing style. Requires rereading many sentences, often just to understand the sentence structure itself, let alone its meaning and context within that section of the book. I can't believe the author intended this as an introduction to Organizational Behavior."},{"rating":"1","title":"they dont diserve a star. the cookies expired in 2009","review":"the tea buscuits expired in june 2009. they are stale. the absolute never trust these people. they will not let you return the product or replace with ones that havnt expired. do not ever do business with this person or company"},{"rating":"1","title":"Need more detail","review":"This book is good for extr reference, however there is not enought information to pass the exam.

I feel taken by the 2 disc set. The only real addition is the Match Race footage which is only a few minutes. The Winner's Circle, HBO First Look and True Story are all re-edits of the interviews and commentaries on the first disc. It's too bad that the studio did this because I will never pay for extra features again. Fool me once, shame on you.

I would have liked to see more information on common feeding problems such as Reflux in infants.

(No information on this common feeding problem was addressed)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good practical reference","review":"This book is very good with detailed lists of suggestions to try for various problems - blocked duct, underfeeding etc. It is a good reference, but for a more all around comprehensive book I prefer Nursing Your Baby by Karen and Gale Pryor."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent resource for women told they can't breastfeed","review":"I love this book--it helped me during the first two weeks of of my baby's life when I was told by my pediatrician that I was not going to be able to breastfeed. This book not only proved him wrong, it reassured me that my child could thrive without supplement and taught me to ignore well-intentioned but wrong advice. Huggins presents her material in a practical, down-to-earth way and in the early hours of the morning when nothing seems to be going well, this book can be a lifesaver."},{"rating":"2","title":"Invest","review":"I bought this book when my daughter was 3 months old and wish I had gotten it earlier.

I recommmend anyone who plans on breastfeeding to buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Counldn't have done it without this book....","review":"I actually bought this book at a lactation consultant's suggestion and at her offices. My child was 5.5 weeks premature and had difficulty learning the suck/swallow reflex. I read this book while pumping in the hospital NICU as well as at home. This book answered each and every question I had throughout my nursing relationship with my child (now almost 2). I highly recommend this book to all mothers who want to do everything they can to educate themselves about nursing their child. Because of my experience with it, whenever a friend of mine is pregnant and planning on nursing, I put together a care package for her that includes this book, a tube of Lansinoh cream, and breast pads along with other gifts for her baby shower!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for breastfeeding mothers","review":"I enjoyed reading The Nursing Mothers Companion, topics are easy to find and offer somewhat good advice.

It clearly outlines potential problems and allowed for quick identification of breastfeeding problems for both me and baby. One of the better more straight forward reference books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be better","review":"As a first time nursing mother, I found this book repetitive and the layout confusing, with many \\"refer to this section and that section\\" references (without page numbers) and little help.

The only parts I found useful were the appendices for drug interaction during breastfeeding and contact information for nursing products. BEWARE! Advice given in this book for starting solid foods contradicts the current guidelines given by the American Academy of Pediatrics--some foods recommended in this book are peanut butter, whole eggs and some nitrate-rich foods that should be avoided/given in moderation until your child is older. I would much rather follow the advice of a full-fledged DOCTOR."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for common problems only","review":"I bought the book since I was suffering from this extreme pain after nursing and none of the doctors I was going to really knew what was going on.

It is a little pushy in some parts but has a lot of good information. I just wish I had had it sooner, I didn't get it until my baby was about 3 months old!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Credibility Problem","review":"I found out that the author of this book is taking money from formula companies. Apparently she works for a company that accepts formula advertisements. It's difficult to believe objective advice on breastfeeding can come from an author being paid by the formula industry. That's like the cigarette industry giving advice on quitting smoking."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Survival\\" Sections are great \\"","review":"This book answered a couple of questions that went unanswered in the Sears Breastfeeding book and in the LLL \\"Womanly Art of Breastfeeding\\", so I found it worth having.Worth noting: the author, Kathleen Huggins is the lady who patented the \\"My Brest Friend\\" nursing pillow - a great nursing tool!This book features \\"survival\\" sections which are highlighted for easy access and summarize the events of the child's and mother's breastfeeding needs at particular stages: \\"Survival Guide for the First Week\\", \\"Suvival Guide for the first 2 months\\", \\"Survival Guide for months 2-6\\" and \\"Survival Guide for the Later Months\\"None of my three breastfeeding books have all the answers, but I think that if you bought this book and the Sears book, you will have all the info you need."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saved Me During the First Week","review":"No matter what anyone says, breastfeeding is not always easy.

I would recommend this for any mother planning to nurse!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent guide for nursing mothers","review":"This book exceeded my expectations. This is a complete guide for breastfeeding, and it helped me to take care of my baby and of myself too. I recomend it to mothers who really want to breastfeed theirs babies, wich is a difficult thing to do, sometimes. I could not breastfeed my fisrt son because of the lack of knowledge about this matter, and when I was pregnant of my daughter three years later I said to myself that I should not spend so much money and time with formulas, and when she was born I could feel the happiness of being so close to her with breastfeeding, with the help of this book. Enjoy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book for NEW breastfeeding Mothers.","review":"If you are planning to breastfeed ( which I personally highly advise you to ) then get this book and read it as soon as possiable, preferably before you have your baby and then again after.

Good Luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good information, if you can find it.","review":"A reference book is only as good as its index, and this one was terrible! The book contains valuable information for the new breastfeeding mother. However, the index was the worst I have ever used. There would be 10-20 pages sited for a word or topic, most of which only mentioned the word in passing, or not at all. Unless you plan on reading this book cover to cover (and think you will be able to remember everything you have read) find a different book."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY THIS BOOK","review":"I recommend this book to all of my patients. I have yet to see a mother who purchased this book in the last part of pregnancy, not \\"make it\\" breastfeeding.If you plan to breastfeed, this book is one to have in your bag, take to the birth center or hospital and believe me, you will use it and find it helpful.This combined with Simkins \\"Birth Partner\\" are two absolute essentials for purchase in late pregnancy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best resource for breastfeeding!","review":"This book is by far the best, most comprehensive resource for the breastfeeding mom. I turned to this book regularly during the first few months (especially the first weeks!) of my son's life. The writing is direct and simple without being preachy, and the solutions for basic breastfeeding issues were right on the money.Despite the fact that breastfeeding is painted out to be \\"natural and instinctual\\" - it isn't.

There was no physical way to reach the mixture screws on the carburetor once it was installed onto the engine in the vehicle (Ford E-250 ClubWagon). This adapter was installed onto a 305 Chevy engine which I had configured onto a home made stand-alone test stand, complete with all components (radiator/alternator/battery/fuel supply etc). This adapter enabled me to test and adjust a 4 bbl Holley on a live 'sound' engine with plenty of open access space prior to installing it onto the engine of the receiving vehicle.

So why did Universal decide to issue this cheaply produced \\"season one\\" set?Blank DVDs and plastic cases cost pennies--there's no valid financial reason for any production company to put out double-sided disks. All the complaints about defective disks have hurt sales. And if sales are slow, Universal will abandon the project, leaving those who did buy with only a fraction of the series in their libraries.It would have been smarter to issue a well-made box set of the entire series--perhaps including a new interview with St. James--and charge a premium price.

Susan St. James is VERY cute. John Schuck is funny enough. But everyone else is boring. In one episode, Rock Hudson's fake punch is SO FAKE, it was laughable.

I've seen that show often through the years and it combined great acting, writing, and story-telling.Sometimes nostalgia stinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed with DVD playing-skipping, missing content.","review":"Got this for my husbands birthday this Saturday and just one episode on the first disc plays properly. The other three episodes all skip, freeze, jump ahead several minutes and in one case over 20 minutes was lost due to it's inability to play. There seems to be a pattern to these dvd's for this show and now only after just reading the problems others have had with them, I don't understand why they are still being offered. I will be sending amazon an email outlining the problems we are having like many of the other folks that have bought universal DVD of the classic tv shows. I'm hoping it might have been bad authoring equipment and that corrected copies can be sent as a replacement. I just wish I would have read the reviews section first.

The very first episode skipped and finally stopped altogether near the end. I tried it on 2 different players with the same result. Cheap double sided dvds. I expect more of the same on the other episodes. A great show treated shabbily with cheap disks.

I don't mind watching a good anime with cussing, violence and some nudity. But that's all this series is. The plot is weak. 2 episodes per DVD is nothing to be happy about either. (Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Comples has 4 per DVD) The animation quality is decent. While watching this DVD, I could almost see a worthwhile story underneath the useless swearing, but it appears the creators decided to focus more on weak battles scenes and (..) than on a quality story line. This just left a bad taste in my mouth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ummm....yeah....","review":"I'll keep this brief. To start off, my rating is for the series as a whole. This particular DVD would get 3 stars. Now about Gantz. Gantz is an action series with long pauses in the action for random pointless dialogue from people who should be fighting for their lives. If you know anything about the Gantz series, you'll know that it is 2 season series (based on a continuing manga of the same name) totaling to 26 episodes. With 2 episodes per DVD that equals 13 DVD's you'll have to buy to finish the series. And just to let anyone who's thinking about going for the entire 26, the ending was made up by the animation team and is most typically described by Gantz fans as \\"Horrible\\" or \\"Crap\\", so unless you enjoy wasting money only to be dissapointed, you might not want to even start this series. If you did buy this and you found its concept interesting, you might want to check out the manga, which is many times better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Anime","review":"I can't belive this anime has already come out in the U.S. It is an awesome horror/suspense I can't say too much about it without spoiling it.

It is a gripping story and the author painted extremely vivid pictures with her descriptive writing. I found myself getting emotional at some parts of the book and that is not an easy feat to perform for a writer. There is a difference between making someone smile on the outside and inside as well. For a novelist to do both shows a remarkable gift. Its hard to believe this is her first novel. Her style of writing is amazing and her attention to every detail was refreshing.The underlying theme of judging the inside of a person rather than what is on the outside really hit home and I commend her for such a bold debut into the writing world. She boldy ventures into a world of black on black and white on black racism and is real with it.I look forward to reading her future novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely not another sister tale...","review":"To the author -- THANK YOU for something different! I'm at the point where I can't read another book about three, four or five Black women and their silly relationships. SKIN DEEP was skillfully written and I enjoyed the multicultural theme. The twists and surprises were so well done that I couldn't quite believe this was her first book. I've recommended this to several friends and the best part is -- the book is not expensive.

The issue of skin color was treated in a refreshing way that made me want to pass the book on to some folks I know who I wish would've read it aloud to themselves A LONG TIME AGO.

Vidal's storytelling skills are venerable, however, the text often reads like a stream of consciousness rather than one marked by satisfying conclusions on his characters' actions. Rather than being swept up in the narrative, I kept getting lost in the vast number of characters introduced. Vidal's incisive wit seems to have been tempered by age to the point of blandness at times..

It's enough to make you weep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Title should be Washington, D.C.","review":"I bought this book because it was ostensibly about Hollywood during the golden days of the silent movies. I found the beginning of the book so tedious I actually stopped reading it-- starting over again a few months later. After at least one hundred boring pages introducing endless Washington characters (trying to sort out their relationships to each other is mind numbing), you finally get a glimpse of Hollywood. The book then goes back and forth, with the majority of \\"action\\" (a term I use very loosely) taking place in the east. I enjoyed the last fifty pages or so. If you like Gore Vidal, okay read it.

The strong points are convenience (it is nice to walk around the house in freedom) and comfort (they're heavier than most corded headphones but not bad, and the earpads are comfy). But the sound quality is not what I had hoped: there is clear distortion in mid-range sound, bass capability is fair at best, and static can be a problem even within 15 feet of the base when the headphones are at certain orientations. Your level of satisfaction will likely depend on the type of music to which you listen; most rock and jazz will sound acceptable, but fans of vocal or classical music will grit their teeth when the grating distortion clobbers a nice passage.

So if you like listening at a high volume don't use this. The broadcast quality is good if you're at close range or in adjoining rooms. But if there is a door in between anywhere the headphone will stop receiving. For home use this product is ideal. The cloth ear pads are real lint attractors.

I usually discard such personal memoirs halfway through, but this work kept me engrossed until the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hmm -interesting","review":"I've read Sara Hall's book a couple of times. She's a fantastic writer.Some of the recent reviews are interesting. It's my impression that Ms. Hall downplayed her absusive husband and in fact treated him with not just kindness but with necessary kid gloves in her portrayal.Her book reminded me of other women I know who have been in non physically abusive marriages. The horror of her truly sociopathic husband is evident between the lines in her book. What actually took place in her marriage is likely far worse than the reader can imagine.Curiously enough after reading Hall's book the last two reviews seem as if they could have been written by a very angry, very disturbed ex-huband.I hope that Ms. Hall has moved on. Her book demonstrates that she has the pluck to do just that. Somehow I doubt very much that her ex-huband does"},{"rating":"1","title":"Engine Room Starboard","review":"I borrowed a teammate's copy of this book and was disappointed. I would agree Ms. Hall has certain gifts as a writer and I'm sure journaling this was therapeutic for her, but I think I'd like to read her husband's account as well - like the old saying goes, it takes two to tango.

The book is a self-serving account of Ms Hall's priviledged life in which she seeks to blame her dispair in her adult life on incidents of abuse in her preteen years. She ridicules her life as a mother, trivializing the importance of being a presence in her childrens early years. Her life with her husband IS tragic, is it any of our business? She wants us to believe that winning is not what is important to her, yet the bulk of discussion on rowing focused on her accomplishments, placements, and medals.

Here it's a war involving numberless galaxies (where the movie's was just between two planets).The novel is good, but the book is terrible.

The information within was very minor, and the routines did not seem as ultimate as the cover suggested in achieving the athletic body or performance as Dan O'Brien possesses. The most disturbing aspect was the graphic content inside. Most exercise demonstrations were in pencil sketch. Text was large, as if filling up space, and the design concept at the start of each chapter was too busy. It had the feel of a rushed book, and that Dan didn't even have time to perform the routines himself so drawings were made of him instead; which made knowing how to perform the workouts correctly & safely difficult to gauge. It also lost the personal touch that most books have because I never felt that Dan was actually there with me at every step."},{"rating":"2","title":"NFL blitz.

But his legacy lives on in these fables,the morals of which can still find relevance in today's society.For those of you, whom are easily offended some of the fables bring up racial differences that may upset you.In particular fable 361:~ The Black man in the river, but then you would be merely taking things out of context of the time in which it was written.I found fable 136:~ The man and his daughter particularly sad and unpleasant, but it does remind you of the bad side of Human Nature.These fables express what being Human is all about, the bad and the good.I never tire of re-reading this book, and I think you won't either."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Crane and the Chopsticks","review":"\\"The Fox and the Crane\\" is one of my favorite Aesop's fables. I am surprised it is not better known. Glad it's used as the cover for this edition.Whenever I see Westerners trying to use chopsticks to pick up food from a plate, it reminds me of this delightful fable. I of course act like the fox and laugh at the silly attempts. It seems funny to me when people borrow ideas halfway, only based on hows and whats without any understanding of the whys.Chopsticks is designed to shove food from the bowl into the mouth and plates work best when food is delivered to the mouth by forks or fingers. Different tools are designed for different purposes to accommondate different arrangements.Strange enough, crane is revered by the Chinese and the Japanese and is the embodiment of elegance and other lofty spiritual concepts. Fox on the other hand embodies different meanings.I bet this is news even to Aesop."},{"rating":"2","title":"The first is the finest","review":"Aesop's fables short tales in which animals act almost as if they were human , rounded off with a good 'moral' are the first instance of , and perhaps the most memorable of the fable form in literature. Only Orwell it seems to me in ' Animal Farm' does something far surpassing the original.But Aesop is a classic , and one often used as first literature for children. I have never found the morals very deep or profound or the stories the most moving in the world, but this does not change the fact that they are part of Western mankind's fundamental vocabulary in literature and story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow and inacurate misrepresentations and interpretations","review":"I'm sorry but referencing Rumi? I don't think you ever even read it. Judging from the interpretation that this silly Aesop fable has anything at all to do with of - The Mouse and The Frog, Rumi's Mathnawi , the author completely misses the point and takes a very lazy view of the meaning of this great poetic work. The Mouse and The Frog is a powerful LOVE STORY not a tale of ~revenge presented by this author.

(For instance the fox that fools the monkey king becomes 'her' in this 'translation'. It totally changes what the fable is delivering, injecting a lame, shallow feminist theme where one never existed before.) For anyone who knows fables and folk tale type works every detail has meaning, and changing a detail as central as gender is like gluing a new appendage to a famous sculpture.Ms. Gibbs has molested these ancient fables. Her 'work' doesn't deserve to be mentioned even as a translation.May the sick academic culture that produces such shameless, pedestrian acts somehow, some way come to an end soon.Pathetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad, sad , sad!","review":"It is rather sad that someone who sets herself up as being scholarly cannot accurately interpret the meaning of those simple fables. For example, the tale of 'Zeus and the Tortoise' #508 has no connection whatsoever to 'home is best' but, more accurately, that 'there is no God but there is Mammon' or alternatively, 'he who weilds the sword never wears the crown'! There is a profound social message to learn from all Aesop's fables but regretfully many do not originate from his pen but accreted around his tales with the passing of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible translation of a great story","review":"I brought the first two volume of this translation. What a complete waste of money. The chinese story is funny, vivid, and full of life. However, this translation sucks all the complexity, life, and wonder from the story. If there were only this translation, no one would care about this story. For those who are only able to know about this chinese story from this translation, they will never understand that this was Jin Yong's (Louis Cha) last and perhaps, greatest novel.It's just really sad that because of this translation, no one else will now do a real translation of this great story in english."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way overpriced,0- support service, faulty safety switch renders item useless.","review":"This is by far the worst product I have ever used. it jammed after just six shots , constant dis assembly, Bostich support was rude and incompetent.

This was a bad move; I have searched Home Depot, Lowes and a major hardward store in the Dallas Mextroplex without success. Definitely, order the staples when you order the stapler. I will end up ordering the staples online which will push my schedule back 2 weeks due to the Christmas holidays. Whenever I get to use the stapler, I'll let you know how it worked. BTW. I'm laying 1/2 inch 5\\" wide hand scraped. I used glue to do my walk in closet and it was so messy and tiresome, but the floor came out beautifully. Hopefully, using the staple down method will be easier.Update: I finally began using the gun. It is easy to use once you get the hang of it and the height adjustment correct. It too me 1 1/2 mins. initially to staple a 5 ft. plank, once I got the hang of it it took about 30 secs. It is definitely great for the DIY installing floors around the house.

I won't lie and say it completely fills me up, but pack a handful of almonds for your crunch craving, a serving of fruit (I recommend the Fruit Leather products), and of course, a bite or two of dark chocolate - and you've got yourself a meal.

Generativism and performance explore the way the brain basically spits out sentences. Generativism and performance are also more linguistical in approach, owing a great deal to Noam Chomsky.I found this book to be quite useful.

My daughter has read parts of this and has learned much about spelling. It has improved her spelling abilities in school (she now gets 106% on her tests) and made her more self-reliant, which is important to me.I'd recommend getting this book andMerriam Webster Children's Dictionarytogether, as one is good for looking up spelling, and the other is a great reference for definitions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for 4th grader","review":"Ordered this with a copy of pocket dictionary and pocket thesaurus.

I got a good idea of HTML from this book but I went on to get two more HTML books for better reference and in-depth programming techniques. However, I would NOT recommend this book to someone who already knows basic HTML or who is looking for a good reference book on HTML. One important thing to note is that this book was basically written for HTML 3.2 and later when HTML 4 came, a few last minute changes were made to put 'HTML 4' on the cover.

However, Mr. Darnell did a very good job with this book. Many of the available HTML books have only a few very small chapters written about HTML and the rest of the chapters are used to skim other languages that require a book in themselves. This book gives a lot of attention to HTML and when I buy a book on HTML, that's what I want! HTML is the core language of the web and this book provides a good working understanding of the latest version, 4.0. It also gives very nice, but not overdone, history lessons about HTML which further help to understand certain conventions.

I attempted to use this book a couple of times on things I was stuck on, but found that it only scratched the surface of very basic topics (forms and tables, for example). Examples were particularly unhelpful, and the CD is worthless. It seems like the more pages stuffed into a computer book (notice how the author brags about 1000+pages), the worse the quality of the material inside.

Unfortunately, I ended up wasting money on this millstone instead. The book's technique--if it can be called that--is to bore the reader with arcane aspects of a topic and then forget to say how it is applied in an HTML document in the real world. Most of this unwieldy tome reads like a verbose editorial on HTML rather than a book designed to teach a person HTML. (And the authors exhibit an almost ideological contempt for \\"cool\\" websites.) \\"HTML 4 Unleashed\\" is a 1,000 page waste of the human spirit. If this were the only book in the world on HTML, it might be worth having. But it isn't. Buy another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something is up here!","review":"This really is not a good book. It's decent for reference but the fact that the author defines some parameters as \\"standard\\" early on and then refers to them as \\"the standard parameters\\" through out the book makes it a bad for looking up quick questions (unless you want to take the time to memorize what he considers standard OR go looking for the list every time). I'm not saying the book was without worth, after reading another book on HTML 4, I went back to this book and it did add some more advanced features to my knowledge, but there are other books that would probably be better.If you do buy this book, I would suggest you skip the first part. It's worthless, and it only confuses you."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book ever made on any language!","review":"At first I asked myself if I am reading the history of the internet, cuz until page 100 no signs of any language came in town....

I find The Man from Ceasaria to bring a refreshing MidEast flavor to any celebration, and the Return of the Magi is especially moving. John Doan's version of God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen is one of the perfect evocations of how the holiday feels as you're packing up the ornaments and reflecting on all that's happened in this season and seasons past.This album is especially suited to sitting quietly by the fire or dozing off to sleep -- or anytime that the joy and hecticness of the season threatens to make you forget the real reasons behind it."},{"rating":"2","title":"~ MAGICAL~","review":"Ok, so I collect holiday CD's and have Many!

Rex, Bowie, Cocknet Rebel to name a few) and had heard of the Be Bop Deluxe and Bill Nelson, but never sought out their recordings until now. This my first sample of the group's output. I'm amazed at what I missed out on: Great guitar playing, sonic soundscapes, and wonderful lyrical imagry. I found every song on the CD enjoyable and will be seeking out the band's outher CDs to fill in the gaps this complilation doesn't cover.This album brings you the highlights from \\"Axe Victim,\\" \\"Futurama,\\" \\"Sunburst Finish,\\" \\"Live in the Air Age,\\" \\"Modern Times,\\" and \\"Drastic Plastic\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gotta love this one...it's The Cowboy Way!","review":"Tasteful, newly recorded versions of songs that Riders' fans have been enjoying for the past quarter century.

Purchasing \\"Silver Jubilee\\" is a no-brainer for all self respecting Riders fans, and would be a fantastic introduction for new listeners.

Well the DD50 showed me the light !! This high quality, lightweight unit was more than I could ask for. A couple of its 7 pads are a bit small, but after practicing awhile, you never notice. It has a multitude of sounds and ryhthms which our entire family enjoyed listening to. The 2 foot pedals make it a much more realistic drumming experience.

And, as a plus for parents..It has a headphone jack that makes this a nice \\"quiet time\\" activity..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun to play, but not quite sensitive enough","review":"The drum machine is fun to play, and with the two foot pedals, I can pretend I'm playing a real drumset. I enjoy having all 100 sample songs to play along with, and I like being able to choose which parts play (drum 1, drum 2, bass, and backing). My only gripe with the sample songs is that while there are plenty of examples of rock music, there are not enough (or no) examples of some other types of music (folk, blues, alternative).The drum pads do not always trigger if you hit them too lightly. I would expect them to play very quietly if you hit them softly, but you have to hit them fairly hard to make a sound. There is a way to adjust the sensitivity, but even with the highest sensitivity, it is not sensitive enough for me.Also, the bass drum pedal has no sensitivity at all. No matter how hard or soft you kick it, it plays the same volume."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Good ! BUT it's missing one major part!!!

However, after about thirty hours or so of use the power wouldn't stay on, making jam sessions real hard. The repair shop wanted to charge me the same amount as a new unit to fix it. When I contacted Yamaha directly, they wouldn't have anything to do with me, saying that the unit was seven years old. When I pointed out the unit was purchased only two months previous, they reiterated it was seven years old. These things are only good for kids toys or someone that just wants to fiddle around, not a serious musician.

Even the calm sections, where nothing important is going on, it is very interesting.If you are a B5 fan you must get this book, so you will know the answers to many questions that arise from the TV series:What happened to Sinclair during his years on Minbar?How did he get involved with the Rangers?What ever happened to Chatherine Sakai?Is there or was there a Minbari leader, and what happened to him?This is a B5 classic, no doubt about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Valen! Valen! Valen!!","review":"This is the kind of book you can just sink your teeth into. It started off a little slow for my taste, but Drennan really fascinated me with the intrigues of Minbar and the story of the Rangers. I'd always been fascinated by the mysterious paladins of Babylon 5, and felt cheated when Crusade didn't feature them at all.But it's a real cheat that the novel ends so soon! There's a wealth of material that could be covered here. I felt the training of the Rangers could have been a little more in depth. But that's a minor complaint.I sincerely hope she plans a sequel, perhaps detailing the life of Valen, and the early days of the Rangers? Please, Ms. Drennan, do us all a service and answer the question that all listeners ask the storyteller. \\" What happens next? \\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice, but...","review":"This was good \\"filler\\" material for the time between Sinclair leaving the station and his assumption of his destiny. And it was nice to explain what happened to his girlfriend, even if that was not ultimately satisfying.But there was little that could not be guessed at, and the action seemed tacked on in some respects. There were some nice moments with Sinclair and his background, but the Mimbari moments seemed out of joint.As a big fan of the series, it was very nice reading. As someone hoping for more, it was barely satisfying reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dull, boring experience","review":"I'm a big fan of Babylon 5, even took the time to put together my own model Starfurry. Got the pencil sharpeners for my office, taped the episodes, watched the repeats, etc. And so, finding a novel by JMS's own wife filling in the gaps of Sinclair's life seemed great... And then I read it. Terrible. Within a few pages I realized this ranks right up there with the long list of horribly-written Star Trek books. And my major complaint is with the writing. The style is very tedious. Sorry, Babylon fans, skip this book! My other complaint is the sheer lack of action. Chapter after chapter goes by while NOTHING happens. Sinclair looks at the statue of Valen. Sinclair sits around. Sinclair seems to be in charge of high-tech military training yet he doesn't interact with the students. Right up to the ending, which wasn't a surprise, seemed a long drawn-out, boring experience. Avoid, avoid, avoid."},{"rating":"2","title":"To Dream in the City of Sorrows","review":"I loved this book. It answered questions I still had after watching the series again. It was exciting, romantic, fun and energizing. I would love to read more like this one. It continues the love story of Sinclair and Sakai, it give some info about the Minbari, Naroon, Marcus, some of the best characters from the tv series."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best of the Babylon 5 novels!","review":"With \\"To Dream in the City of Sorrows,\\" Kathryn Drennan has written the best of the B5 novels. Her unparalleled access to J. Michael Straczynski,the creator of the B5 universe (they're married), shows in the amount of interesting detail and gap filling that Drennan weaves into this tale of triumph and tragedy. This would have made an excellent episode of the television series."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best B5 book so far!","review":"This book fills in the gap that was left after Commander Sinclair's abrupt departure. It fleshes out the story concerning the Rangers and shows how Sinclair becomes the Entil'Za. I highly recommend this book to anyone who remotely likes B5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just one remaining question...","review":"An excellent read for Babylon 5 fans which answers many open questions from the TV series. The only thing missing is a discussion of how Sinclair actually discovers his destiny and how that knowledge affects him in the present."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book is useless.","review":"I found this book very useless. It doesn't talk about GNOME internals, all it teaches you is what to expect from the icon when you click on it.

Many, many pages are taken up with descriptions of various programs that work under Gnome.

It contains hidden symbols to, at the time, both get the book past the censors and give the french audience moral and courage to stand up to the Nazi's and follow their beliefs. The characters are adapted slightly to fit his version, ie Tieresas is left out and a nurse is introduced. He also had to adapt the personalities of the characters, for instance Antigone develops a whiny habit, and Creon is seen as a \\"good guy\\". This was also done in order to get the play by the sensors. It is a well-written play with rounder characters than the original. This version would be better read after reading the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"For school","review":"I needed this book for my kids.

It is an adaptation of the Greek play \\"Antigone,\\" by Sophocles, written here by a French existentialist author and playwright. The ending contains something of a twist from the original, and there are some excellent symbolisms contained in this play as well. Both of these elements stem from rich existentialism views. The book makes one think of the meaning of life, when and if it is worth living, or better to die instead, for a cause."},{"rating":"1","title":"Antigone","review":"I was extremely annoyed with the translation of this play.

Every song sounds pretty much the same, the vocal tracks by the members of anticon are drowned out and the song done with Angelina Esparza, is less than so-so. It sounds like Dj Krush was given 10 sounds and was told to make an album using only those 10 sounds and 1 tempo. Again, I would reccomend any other Dj Krush album, and suggest that you check out anticon if you haven't already because they are splendid, but this album was weak."},{"rating":"2","title":"angelina","review":"Most of the album is o.k...but what stands out is Angelina's voice on \\"Alepheva\\".

They did state they were Megadeth fans and their fans are loyal and passionate of their Megadeth music. The Confession has been touring the country opening for Megadeth and, as one of the band member's parents, have heard first hand how wonderful Dave Mustaine and Megadeth has been to The Confession. But the fans were another story. They were rude, violent and totally unable to open up their minds to anything other than hearing Megadeth. Even Dave himself said to the guys in The Confession that they should be proud of being hand picked to open for Megadeth and he wished the fans would be respectful of their musical talent. If you love music and respect talent than give Requiem a listen - you won't be sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspiring...","review":"I had the displeasure of seeing this band open for MegaDeth last night.

In many cases, this means having the units hanging off the front of your computer while they charge. Kind of a heavy load, in my opinion. Many don't come with AC power adapters.Male-to-Female USB cables like this solve a couple of problems.First, they allow you to charge or upload video to the computer without putting strain on the computer's USB port.Second, you can use the cable with any number of AC and car lighter adapters to charge your Flip or other camcorder.These particular cables are well made and work for charging and data sync.But the coolest part of ordering these inexpensive items from Amazon is your Amazon Prime subscription which covers the shipping.

Now granted I didn't buy the high priced version of this book but even what I did spend wasn't worth it. All the stories are the same and kind of boring.

Even with this disadvantage, the book gives the reader the information needed to understand how XML works, what its potential is, and generally how to implement it. I have two negative comments:1. The book is a too cursory with emerging technologies which will be the mainstay of the technology: DOM, XSL, XSLT, SAX. These parts are critical for implementors and should have been discussed more thoroughly.2. For a book on markup, they should have gotten the table of contents marked up correctly.On the whole, an excellent book.

Lamb's Tales from Great Operas takes the name literally and is illustrated with all manner of absurd and comic ink drawings of muttons performing opera, to great effect. Arrowood's illustrations are fabulous, and Elliott always explains the scene each drawing derives from. We are introduced to seventeen operas: two from the 18th century, eleven from the 19th century, and four from the 20th century. The text is unfailingly charming, and would be suitable for both lovers of opera or the curious and sympathetic uninitiated."},{"rating":"2","title":"The REAL End is there!!!","review":"I read this book (I think from the screenplay) before seeing the movie and was very disappointed when I did see it.

The box says \\"Enhanced for widescreen TVs\\", but the only parts that fill the screen of my 1080p HD widescreen are the menus. So if you got an \\"old\\" TV, you're good to go. If your DVD player puts out a 480p signal, you can fill your 1080 screen (with letterbox on top & bottom), but then this is just a crummy looking video picture. Nothing \\"special\\" about that. So if 20th Century Fox knew enough to make the menus HD widescreen compatible, then why not the film? Especially since the release is advertised as \\"Enhanced for widescreen TVs\\". Seems pretty deceptive to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible DVD transfer","review":"Its in a 4:3 letterbox format, and is just a horrible transfer.Please update this wonderful movie with a better DVD/BluRay disk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Special Features!","review":"Assuming you liked the movie in the first place - this DVD is a *must* have. I have never seen so much covered in a special features section on a DVD. Everything. Absolutely everything. The script (several versions), the making-of (several versions), more production notes than you have time to deal with, commentary, etc... Not to mention both versions of the movie are there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch the documentary first.","review":"Wow! The plot itself plods along, but the cinematography is great. A film that is more appreciated after watching the documentary. The DVD is worth it for this alone. Most of the actors and crew had to be scuba certified. If you are certified, you know this isn't trivial. The suits aren't props either, but fully functional life supports. No wonder the film was called the hardness shoot ever. The DVD is packed with extras. I mean whole scripts not just the final script but initial scripts as well. I thought Ghostbusters had a lot of extras. This much extra material is sometimes hard to present, but unlike many DVDs that have very confusing interfaces, this one makes it very easy to find the material you're looking for. All together an absolute must for a DVD collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exploration of the final two frontiers.","review":"Don't pay attention to the negative reviews here. This film is still one of the best ever, even more than 15 years later. James Cameron really made a masterpiece - forever solidifying his emminent status among film directors of all-time. Aliens and Titanic were both very good films, The Abyss is an excellent film, with the Director's cut rating slightly higher - I enjoyed the new ending best (I actually saw the director's cut before seeing the theatrical version). Recommended to all, especially sci/fi and action film lovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best DVD docummentary yet !","review":"Regardless of how much I love this movie, it is the extras in this edition that really surprised me. The 1 hour docummentary has got to be best I've seen in a DVD yet and the reason is very simple: few filmakers have gone through such lenghts to bring their vision to the screen as James Cameron has with the Abyss. To think he went even further with Titanic ! It's a shame that DVD edition is so very plain."},{"rating":"2","title":"An abyss of special features!","review":"All DVDs should be made as this one.

You may have seen an under-water film before, but never this good. Special effects won an Oscar; and boy did they deserve it!

Fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Abyss: Special Edition is a GREAT DVD!","review":"\\"The Abyss:Special Edition\\" is the best DVD I've seen yet. First, the movie is one of the greatest science fiction films I've ever seen. It has a great story, written by James Cameron (\\"Titanic, \\"Aliens,\\" \\"The Terminator,\\" and \\"Terminator 2: Judgement Day), which is smart, fast-paced, and very exciting. It has awesome special effects, especially the giant wave at the end of the movie. And, the acting, well done by the leading actor, Ed Harris, who was also great in \\"The Truman Show.\\"Second, the EXTRAS ARE EVEN BETTER! It has an excellent 60-minture documentary (don't watch the 10-minute one, it's a promotional featurette), storyboards, theaterical trailers, and countless special effects featurettes, and there are still countless more special features.Now, I all I want you to do now, is to go buy this DVD, if you are a serious science-fiction fan, and you want a great DVD loaded with special features. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie","review":"Great price for a great movie from the past. I love underwater shows, and this one is a great addition to my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly masterful, just like most of Cameron's other works","review":"James Cameron directed and wrote this very beautifully shot, masterfully told underwater saga. Like his other masterful works, The Abyss deserves credit for the technological achievements; therefore, it propelled all films since into a new realm of computer graphics.The acting of Ed Harris is Oscar quality, though he was not given credit.Cameron's other version, the 'Special Edition' is quite impressive...as far as the original story is concerned, it makes incredibly more sense. But with either cut, this movie deserves our most abundent attention for the message against our many dangerous defenses that is obviously relayed by director, Cameron.Two thumbs high up in the air and it gets my utmost respect for the attempt of trying our senses against violence, not obvious to even the director--I see it clear as day in most of Cameron's films."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best underwater pictures ever made!","review":"This is an excellent effort by Cameron. It is a thinking person's film that includes superior characterizations, a thoughtful script, and outstanding special effects (the wreck of the sub at the beginning is a knockout and the Sea Tentacle forshadows the \\"bad terminator\\" in T2)!. The plot pacing is a little slow and the aliens as shown are much too benign to be truly frightening. Mastrantonio is just a little too strident, Ed Harris is his usual virile self and Biehn is excellent as the antagonist. Go only with the laser edition that includes the expanded footage, otherwise the entire movie doesn't make sense at the end!!! The extras on the laser also explain how Cameron made it all come together. This is a movie for the entire family to enjoy together and discuss afterwards. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"When a decent release?","review":"Whats up with this movie? Never an anamorphic release.Fox lose the masters?May be the masters was stored by Edward Scissorhands after visit a knife grinder and need a lot of digital retouching?For last, when Blu-ray (2D/3D) comes to life we whant the extended cut, not the childish theatrical version.Thanks in advances."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best DVD edition","review":"I love this movie. It's hard to think of a better masterpiece from the 1980s. It's just too bad I bought this version -- older DVDs like this one have some problems with playback on modern widescreen TVs. Without using the TV's \\"zoom\\" feature (which basically makes the image larger to fit the screen, but reduces resolution drastically), you have to watch the movie in a truncated box within the screen. There is no true 16:9 output from the disc itself.It is indeed presented in \\"widescreen\\" format, but the movie plays in a 4:3 setting which shrinks the image to fit within 4:3-sized box in your 16:9 monitor. Not the best way to watch a great movie. I'll have to wait for a Blu-Ray version when I finally upgrade to hi-def.That aside, the extended version of the film is included along with the standard version. But there are almost no special features at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still one of the best scifi movies","review":"Wow, we didn't know what we were missing...! We had a recording off HBO forever and watched it several times. The tape was just about worn out so I bought this DVD. I guess they had to fit an over-length movie into two hours for TV.

The Special Edition is a film all it's own, and the version I was previously speaking of. It has an incredibly profound messege hidden in a really cool story with some great performances. As emotionally epic as Titanic in my opinion, but without the 50's-ish melodrama. Ed Harris delivers one of his best performances and the special effects still stand up to scrutiny in a world of Jar-Jar Binks' and See through Mummy's. The debit is of course the length, handled somewhat well but (hey I'm being honest) not well enough for the nearly three hours it encompasses. Multiple viewings will reveal a marvelous epic that rivals Close Encounters of the Third Kind as one of the best Aliens-on-Earth movies ever made."},{"rating":"2","title":"James Cameron's Secord Best Work Next To ALIENS","review":"Well what can I say! I saw this film 11 years ago at the cinema, I was only 13, and I loved every minute of it. I was however left a little confused as to what part the aliens in the film actually play.

I too, was nonplussed before I watched it. I like audio commentaries! They offer personal insights and details about movies we love, at least enough to spend 30 bucks on it. The text commentary here is not just a bare-bones dissection of special effects, like, say, the audio com from Star Wars Ep. 1. What a dissappointment.Anyway, there are plenty of details about the actors, fluid breathing experiments, famous submarine disasters and even some karaoke(long version only)! Very fun. I was hoping for an audio with James Cameron (still am, for any of his movies) but this was just as satisfying.Go get it! Have a bud light (wink)."},{"rating":"2","title":"...the abyss also gazes into you.","review":"Simply excellent. The Abyss was already a favorite of mine after seeing it in the theaters, it's even better with the expanded scenes. It's another great, original work from the director of Aliens and Terminator...not to mention Titanic, the biggest money-maker of all time.Movie aside, whether or not you liked the movie, you HAVE to see the making of the abyss. This WILL give you a healthy respect for the movie, the actors and everything involved with bringing this film to life. I had no doubt after watching it that this had to be the most incredibly difficult film to ever have been made!The Abyss is a great sci-fi flick.

But still when you're watching the DVD version you don't believe it from what you see and what you hear. The picture quality is almost perfect. I know it must have been hard task to convert the picture in mpeg2 format, especially when almost entire movie is underwater. Still you won't notice any distortion or age wearing on the film. The soundtrack is truly amazing. Especially the Dolby Digital 5.1 track. It creates one of the best spatial effects that i've heard in any DVD movie mixed in Dolby Digital 5.1. You really can feel the action and suspense. What about the movie itself, well if you've already seen abyss then buy the DVD and see it again, if you haven't, you should be going to nearest video store faster you can say \\"Cheesy poof\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best DVD to Start Your Collection!","review":"This DVD is an excellent example of the superiority of the DVD format. There is so much information on this DVD, any Abyss fan can become an expert on every aspect, from the making of the movie to the script rewrites. This James Cameron masterpeice is shown in it's entirety, yet the theater cut is also included. There is such an incredible amount of information on this DVD, one is overwhelmed! This is a great gift for anyone just starting a DVD collection, or looking for a great classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Abyss is a great movie. The special edition rules!","review":"The Abyss was a very good movie. It combines sci-fi, action, fantasy, and drama. I love the special edition because you get to see the full 3hr. version. Which has some wonderful and important scenes that are missing from the 2 1/2 hr. version. I love the tidal wave sequence! I really dont understand why the original version was cut. So what, its long but the cut up version does not completly get the point across. The 3hr. version definetly does! Its a task to sit down to watch, but the film is well worth it. This film will satisfy most anybody!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An underwater adventure you will never forget!!!!!!","review":"This book was really good! Ive seen the movie before but the book was better. In the movie you dont get to know what the person is thinkig or feeling but in the book it explains everything to you. It made it much easier to understand. i like how they made the movie a lot like the book. I really dont have anything bad to say about this book, it was very easy to understand. I recommend this book to anyone who likes to read. I recommend seeing the movie first and then reading the book because it gives you a better visual on what is going on. Go read it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst quality DVD","review":"First let me say that I absolutely love this film. A classic alien encounter movie with suspense, action, and even a love story. Now why the 1 star? The video and audio quality is like watching it on a 1980's TV...The special edition has a few more minutes of alien injection and some lame political statements. Keep the original or theatrical edition and don't buy this expecting quality of any sort."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD flawed during manufacture!?","review":"I agree totally with most of the great reviews below. However, after buying this DVD locally and now on Amazon.com, I keep getting a defective DVD. It is defective in the fact that it IS NOT widescreen, and it DOES NOT have the extended and regular version of the movie on it. For those looking for these, be aware of this issue. I have no idea how many of these DVD's are like this, but I'm 2 for 2 so far. Mine is going back!Note - this applies to the 1 Disc version of the DVD. Since the 2 disc version is hard to get and high price, I cannot say if that one is good or not in regards to the above issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good film but Amazon DVD not the SE as advertised or marked","review":"The DVD I bought directly from Amazon was advertised as the Special Edition and was marked as such on the case and on the disc. However it actually seems to be the full-screen regular-length edition with no text commentary or SE extras. Do not buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"The Abyss\\"","review":"I thought the movie was way too long and pretty cheesy. There were some good things about it - and I don't know how ppl who watch it without the added footage completely understand the end (all the TV news footage) - but I didn't like the movie much. I saw this video with a bunch of friends at one of our friend's place, so it was fun to get the reaction of everybody and stuff. Some liked it, some didn't. I thought there were some really cheesy parts which didn't even seem they should be there. It's an interesting movie to watch, if you have the time and really want to see it, but get comfy, you're going to be watching this movie for a LOOOONNGG time. (It's way too long!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"The title says it all.","review":"Truly abysmal. Yes, the special effects are tremendous, but the moronic screenplay is hard to get past. Is this film what took Mastrontonio and Biehn off the A-list? They're directed to play ideas, not people. Biehn, otherwise a competent actor, twitches and rolls his eyes here, indulging in every acting cliche. Poor Mastrontonio, usually brilliant, here goes from cynical realist to alien-spotter in one fell swoop. Come on. Anyone else in her position would assume that she has discovered a previously unknown sea creature before deciding it's an alien. There are unbelievable jumps in the story; it's just a mess. Only Ed Harris escapes unscathed. I'd rather see an Esther Williams water picture than this mess again."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAD ENDING...","review":"I have only the VHS, and I must say the end ruined this movie, which was following so tight,well crafted and with good actin (although I think Mastrantonio ia a very bad actress). Anyway, I'll seek a DVD edition for myself, to understand what the reviewers below are talking about. To say this movie is better than \\"TERMINATOR - JUDGEMENT DAY\\" is a kind of heresy, but , well, who knows...?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The ABYSS - A real LOSER!","review":"You know and I know this movie is so boring it will leave you with nothing! One of the worst! Truthfully, this motion picture is an absolute waste of time.... Dosen't deserve a one star, except for special effects. Almost ruined Mary's career."},{"rating":"1","title":"ABYSS - MAL","review":"Like coffee with so much milk and sugar you can't taste the coffee, so the Abyss pours on so many \\"special\\" effects that you can't stomach the movie. I saw this big hunk o' nothin' in the theatre and the whole house walked out in silence shaking their heads. I doubt if fifteen years of ripening will have made it any more palatable. Indulgent, excessive and ultimately juvenile fluff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been better","review":"How can a woman that has drowned and been revived get up and walk around a short time later? No wonder the ausience sniggered at the cinema where I saw this movie. It has some big and impressive scenes and great music.What a pity the story wasn't properly thought out a bit more.The end is an anti-climax and makes no sense.OK.the aliens have gone to the surface and ships lay on their side.What now?If it goes back down then those ships will sink!

Talk about showing off all the flaws in the VHS version. When I noticed that the DVD version will be released on 3/2000, I immediately put in a pre-order for it. My roommate thinks that the nuke was well below crash depth and should have detonated or crushed at the very least. I said, \\"So, it's still a fantastic movie.\\" Can't wait for the DVD. I already have the special edition with the 28 extra minutes but it's more fun on DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"NON-ANAMORPHIC?!","review":"The Abyss (Special Edition)is not the set that a proper cinephile would appreciate.I was so excited that this DVD was on sale at Best Buy for $9.99 that I immediately bought it. I put it in to play on my widescreen TV to find out that Fox did not set this DVD up to be played on HDTVs! I have to set the picture in a 4:3 image to watch a film that is presented in a 2.35:1 aspect ratio.This set is utterly disappointing! I would recommend that everyone wait for this to be released on BluRay. Only then will Fox actually make good on their \\"special edition\\" promise. At least, I hope they will..."},{"rating":"1","title":"If only I had read these posts...","review":"Bought this believing it would be recorded correctly. They just took the 2003 non-anamorphic DVD and put a cardboard with a hologram on top that says 2007, that's all. Once opened, you cannot return these.

A technical marvel with breathtaking visual effects and sound. The action sequences are intense and very well done, what else can you expect from James Cameron, one of the best action directors of our times. The story is great and so is the acting. The fantasy and sci/fi elements are fascinating but are put beside to concentrate on the suspense. Great special effects and suspense make this one definitely worthwhile. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film a 7!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good deep water movie to own","review":"I really like the graphics of this movie.

Its one to own and have as one's collection. A+ movie"},{"rating":"1","title":"It JUST Sucks!","review":"I watched this too long movie just because it is a J.Cameron film. But it was a sheer frustration. I am very sorry to spend my 2.5 hours for it. It is just a waste of time. Don't watch it. It is full of ridiculous scenes. Slam a dead person and watch her bring back to life! Isn't it be to stupid? Too many sub-plots. Too many dialogs. Everyone in the movie talks in every occasion. Only when Bud dives into the abyss we can have some silence. Please don't watch this. It is nothing but a waste of time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for this century!","review":"After reviewing the encouraging reviews I decided to buy the movie and see it for the first time.

Several are single-disk, and several are double-disk.But no matter which of the many one looks at, one finds the exact same reviews on all of them: single-disk, double-disk -- no difference.So how is one to determine which will meet one's needs, thus which to buy, if there is no information provided that would help one do so?One fact is certain: until Amazon gets its act together -- keep the reviews for separate versions and \\"editions\\" separate -- there will be instances, as with this one, that I won't buy that which is immersed in a swamp of unnecessary confusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing 5.1 audio!!!","review":"The one star is for the single disk edition of the abyss. The back of the box claims it has 5.1 audio when in fact it does not! I returned the first one I bought thinking it may be an isolated incident, but much to my surprise it was the same!! I have e-mailed fox video several time's but they do not answer, I guess they don't care about their costomers.

This movie has it all: realistic characters, played by great actors, stunning visual effects and heart-pounding action, a moving lovestory and humour.

The underwater stage and filming were well done and the use of new diving equipment to make the movie that much more realistic was a great part. The directors cut helps make the movie more understandable, although I would agree that the pace can be somewhat nerve racking. The few technical in-accuracies are not enough to go into here because VERY FEW movies are made totally technically accurate and if more were there would be more box office failures.Overall a good movie and the documentary makes a good learning experience on some of the technology used to make movies.Review based on Laser Disk Version END"},{"rating":"1","title":"Squished Picture Too","review":"First off, I love the movie, and I would normally give it 4 out of 5 stars. The problem I am having is that the picture appears as if it were on a standard 4:3 television. I have a widescreen TV, and the image is \\"squished\\" with double black bars. I set my DVD player for a widescreen display, and the aspect ratio is still wrong. I am having this problem with the two-disc DVD that came out some years ago now. Not the newly released two disc set with the white box.

Mary E Mastrantonio is outstanding","review":"James Cameron have made one of his best movies here, with science fiction, thriller, action, drama The Abyss. The movie is a classic, the cast is outstanding. Award winning special effects. One of the best moments in recent movie history is the drowning scene with Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio. She is truly and great actress that i want to see more of.The DVD is full of extras, and there are the better, \\"special edition\\" of the movie.

When I fist saw this movie in the theatre it seemed incomplete. And now I know why, because it was incomplete. The job that they did to put the full version together is fantastic. The effects are possibly the best done for any movie ever and it is 14 years old. Still today I have yet to see a movie that is so wonderfully comprised. The acting is outstanding.

This reference is taken from Fonzy's famous jump over the rubber shark. If I'm the only person in history who thought this movie jumped the shark, than so be it, but I believe it did. Jumped and landed right in the Abyss.For a crew that seems to be so knowledgeable on \\"Deep Pressure Syndrome\\" not to realize that the leader of the Seal team is not only suffering from it, but is on the verge of a nervous break down that will put them all in jeopardy, is just unforgivable.

But, nonetheless, this is still a wonderful album. Some of my favorites are Still A Friend Of Mine, Smiling Faces, Where Do We Go From Here, and Keep The Fire Burning.

This is one of the biggest loser films I have ever seen in my middle aged life. It is sappy and contrived to the max. It was a film about a Christian preacher/missionary, and they managed to go through the entire film without saying the word \\"God\\" once in either dialogue, or song--of which there were many. They went completely out of their way to do this. This is Hollywood liberal political correctness run to it's furthest ridiculous extreme.

This is just flat out wrong. First, a great deal of extra software is required (VB 5.0 Enterprise Edition, IE4, Office Professional, and more) to complete the exercises. It seems to me that Microsoft could have included some kind of simulator software on the CD (as they did for the SQL Server Prep Kit). Second, I don't believe the book's sketchy treatment of its topics is sufficient -- I needed other resources (including many from Microsoft's own web) to prepare.

Yet later they mention that for the Internet and Intranet portion of 70-160, you need to read parts of chapters 3,8,9.Occasionally review questions cover items not event metioned in the book. The CD that comes with the book looks like an afterthought or a good idea that wasn't completed. It has some animations that don't really add much to your understanding of the topics."},{"rating":"1","title":"An OK intro to the topics, but thin on meat","review":"This book is OK as an introduction/overview to most of the topics covered, but don't rely on it to contain everything you need to pass.

They're all earlier works and in these films you witness an incredibley inspired director do more with a low budget film than most high paid directors could ever dream of doing. I'd also like to say that if you've never seen a Hal Hartley film then this is probably the best point to start out at."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Hal Hartley's best","review":"Along with Simple Men and Surviving Desire, the Unbelievable Truth is one of Hartley's best films. Firmly entrenched in the 80s when it was made, this lightweight comic romance has a lead character of the wonderful Adrienne Shelley (RIP) as a young woman who negotiates college versus work deals with her parents while believing the world is going to end via nuclear disaster at any moment. Into this comes the hero, Robert Burke in his gorgeous youth, as a newly released prisoner coming back to his hometown. The script is brainy banter and just walks the fine line between stage and actual people, which is one of Hartley's best talents. The earlier films like this one (pre Amateur, for instance) still have a light touch with the dark edge instead of the dark edge with blacker humor like the later films: for fun, romantic, cynical college-educated Hal Hartley, watch this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought it was.","review":"This is a Cd of the history of the band.

If you've read the manga and enjoyed it you'll be happy to know that the anime has stayed true to story-unlike the live action movie.

Most shows and movies involving mystery focus more on the investigation, but this is different. Light Yagami wants to rid the world of evil and becomes a murderer himself. Meanwhile, the police begin investigating Kira, due to the unusual number of heart attacks. This show would probably be like dramatic irony more than anything else because we, the audience, know from the beginning that Light, the protagonist of this story, is the culprit.

Then prepare for a frenzied round of battle! After the round, you do it all over again! I'm not sure when or how you win, but you just do. Even though it sounds simple, it's quite entertaining. I cannot play for more than a half hour or so at a time because it just gets too difficult. When it says GAME OVER, you just feel like you need a break.

They're really the only band I've ever heard that I can compare them to, and vice versa. Sure there's going to be some general Opeth or Ulver comparisons just based on the contrasting metal mayhem and acoustic interludes, but Woods of Ypres and Agalloch are different enough from Opeth to warrant their own sub-category. And Woods has more black metal than Agalloch, so even they differ when you get down to the nuts and bolts. Like an earlier reviewer said, Woods is 'summer' and Agalloch is 'winter' sounding. Good way of putting it. Two hard bands to categorize because nobody else does it exactly like they do. But comparing Woods and Agalloch to say In Flames and Opeth, Woods and Agalloch get paired up in my mind as being far more similar than not. If you are looking to order them, check out Vendlus.

I'm sure this was fine for printed books in the 1800s, but it looks horrible on a Kindle 2 screen in the 2000s. Come on Oxford, when you convert your books to an e-reader format, you need to put some thought into how the work will be displayed on e-readers.

I was assigned this book twice in college, and while I can certainly understand why this book would be studied in literature courses because of the value it contributed to the form of novel writing in general, I firmly believe this book can only be appreciated fully by someone with a little more experience under their belt than the average college co-ed. So, if you remember trudging through this large tome in the early morning hours of your college days, finding it unbearable, give it another go once you're 30 or 40 -- I think you'll be more than pleasantly surprised.

If you are used to the broad comic brushstrokes of Charles Dickens, you will find Eliot a much subtler artist. She paints very subtle shades of emotion and morality.If you have already read Middlemarch, you should seek out Virginia Woolf's essay on Eliot in her book, The Common Reader. Also, Eliot figures highly in Sandra Gilbert's study of Victorian literature, The Madwoman in the Attic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Characterization & Setting; Victorian Realism","review":"I was enchanted with Dorotha who had to overcome those typical barriers on females in the Victorian age. Timeless story in all aspects, you begin to take in the ways of life in the past, the bust and the corsets, the quiet gossip behind others backs.George Eliot is a wonder of a writer, she needs more attention in high schools and colleges, her books entertain as well as challenge."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best -- bar none.","review":"Middlemarch is, simply, the best book I have ever read. The story itself is absorbing (following a rather long, but necessary, period of exposition at the beginning of the book), but what I found most engaging were George Eliot's sense of humor and the total relevance of Middlemarch's themes to life 150 years later. What an amazing work!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not use this edition of Middlemarch","review":"This review is of the 2011 edition published by Simon & Brown. I got this edition from Amazon and was completely shocked at the atrocious editing. There are numerous typos and transpositions, so numerous and egregious that they are completely distracting and make the book unreadable. Furthermore, the chapter headings are completely mangled. Eliot began each chapter with a quotation or poem, or piece of a poem (many of which she wrote herself), and in this edition, the lines of poetry are all run together so you don't even know it's a poem! I ask you! Avoid, avoid, avoid. Wonderful novel, read it in ANY OTHER edition. Edition to avoid is:Middlemarch"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Formatting","review":"Middlemarch is one of my favourite books but the experience of reading it on Kindle is marred by poor formatting. When looking at the sample on the Amazon store the bad formatting is not obvious. Why is it the kindle editions of books give no contents pages. I am uncertain whether I want to buy an edition of this book because I cannot tell if the formatting will be any more worth it in the paid for editions. If I did not know the book really well I am not sure if I would be able to follow it with the often confusing format. The quotations at the beginning of each chapter are presented just as part of the text and their is no space between chapters which is really very bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Book, Disgraceful Edition","review":"This novel doesn't need my praise. But this edition needs censure. I have found over fifty typos and legitimate mistakes, the kind of thing you almost never see except in translations. \\"Unconquerable\\" is rendered \\"conquerable,\\" \\"in\\" becomes \\"is\\" (so you get things like \\"All force is twain is one\\"). You can't read more than a few pages without being distracted.It's embarrassing that this edition slipped by even a single editor."},{"rating":"2","title":"George Eliot's greatest novel","review":"Middlemarch has been described as the one Victorian novel written for grownups. Here, Eliot combines the multiple and interlocking plot lines so beloved by the Victorians with adult characters facing real problems. Particularly engaging is Dorothea Brooke's efforts to find a way to serve, if not achieve, greatness. Rather than undertake some great work herself -- something that Victorian women were not encouraged to do -- she chooses to dedicate herself to supporting a man that she mistakenly believes to be creating a major work. Similarly, Lydgate's slow downfall is realistically portrayed. Unlike many of the works of Dickens, Middlemarch's multiple plots work well together. If you have not read anything by George Eliot, this is the book to begin with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hang in there, it's worth it.","review":"Yes, much of this novel is slow going, but the characters have a complex authenticity sometimes absent from the \\"marriage as ideal\\" type of narratives. I admit I had to quit a few times and read other books before finishing this, but it was worth it. The last paragraph is gorgeous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warm, fuzzy, too long. Think Tolstoy after a lobotomy.","review":"Middlemarch is treated as a classic: it shouldn't be. While it has some amusing stock characters and portrays some of the great disappointments of life, its moralizing is overt and its plot is boring.The characterization is thorough and and frequently good. But the villians are all too villainous and the good guys all too good. One can see the ending a mile off, and one begins to shift in one's seat after only 200 pages.However, one hopes that the end would have some twist that would dispell the reader's suspicions of a transparent march to an inexorable ending. Eliot disappoints with her anticlimactic and smarmy ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warped CD's, Unfortunately Abridged.","review":"I am very unhappy with this product. Although it is described as 'unabridged' that was not the case at all. I suppose I should have known this from the fact that there were fewer CD's than other audio offerings, but I believed the description. Two of the CD's were so warped they wouldn't spin in my stereo. I was extremely unhappy with this purchase.I needed to read this book for a university class. As I love literature, I would ordinarily have purchased the book, but I have had some health problems crop up unexpectedly and am having trouble with my eyes. I thought the audio book would be the way to go. So much of Eliot's wonderful narrative voicing is lost in this abridged version, and the actress who reads sometimes tends to mumble. It was impossible to hear in the car.Loved the book, hated this version. I listened through the end of the first disk, then had to give up as the second arrived too warped to play. Completely disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A blow-by-blow account of the boxing industry","review":"George Eliot was one of the most agile sports reporters of the Victorian era, and this novel, set in a bucolic English town, shows Eliot at her feisty best. The scenes of blood and gore were a bit much for readers at the time, but the exalted visions that overcome the boxers when they succumb to a knockout punch are as inspiring as any of the techno-hype that Hollywood delivers today. It's time to resurrect the reputation of this in-the-ring journalist-writer who knew the pulse of the people and put it on paper on purpose, pulling no punches."},{"rating":"1","title":"what happened to the downtempo groove?","review":"It's got a few good tunes on it, but being someone that was immediately taken by AL by getting 1-7, 7 almost sounds too commercial. It's like 7 was produced by someone else it seems. Lionel Richie's Easy on AL 7 and Marvin Gayes Sexual Healing on AL 6 are great songs, but I just don't think the typical AL buyer is buying the cds for those types of songs. To catch the real downtempo AL vibe, start with the first one, Ambient Lounge 1, and work your way up. I hope AL 8 will go back to its roots.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Playsize Teepee","review":"This teepee was the perfect size for my 5 year-olds plastic indians. He loves it!

I soon found that the examples and exercises were very poorly done. I had to work twice as hard as a teacher to prepare meaningful lessons and assignments because the book was so poorly written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected","review":"I expect that a book with a subtitle of \\"An Investigative Approach\\" would teach concepts through discovery learning. That is the trend for learning/teaching nowadays. In fact, this book teaches math concepts like every other math book, it just has little activities to reinforce the concepts. I wasn't that impressed by the activities, either.What I want and can't find is a math book of discovery learning activities that help students uncover the ideas by connecting previous knowledge in a new way. I also want a book that provides meaningful, real-world applications to the concepts learned. This book isn't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst math book I have ever come across","review":"I had a 4.0 GPA in my math major at a top 20 private university in the U.S. and have loved solving math problems my entire life.

It seems that they wanted to make a little more money off the first. Even bruce willis hated this.

Anways the movie rocked, and is definitly worth the purchase, ah instead buy the whole trilogy. The only minor flaw in the movie is when bruce is on the phone at the airport. it says \\"Pacific Bell\\" but note, that theyre on the east coast in d.c.? Thats Bell Atlantic's territory, oh well, so prop guys arent the best, but its still action packed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of them all!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"What is wrong with you lot??!!! This is a great movie and I have to say that this is better than the first one!!! Not to say that that one was mediocre. It was great to but I love this one even more! McClane finds himself fighting vicious terrorists whove seized a major international airport with many planes stranded in mid-air and McClane has to save the passengers on the planes and destroy the terror network before fuel runs out and causes the planes to crash. This is a great movie and should be owned today!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The movie is good, blu-ray audio quality is suspect","review":"This is my least favorite in the series. The video quality of the blu-ray is much improved from the sd dvd. The audio however is a big problem. Depending on what type of blu-ray player you have, you may not get any sound or only the core DTS. There was a problem with authoring this disc and FOX has been aware of it since the disc was released. I and other on a particular forum have been waiting more than 1 year now for FOX to release a replacement but the replacement they sent was exactly the same disc. Unless you get a blu-ray version from the U.K. or Australia (this disc is region-free)you may not get what you want from the audio.A big disappointment from FOX."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's the 2nd worst movie of all time.","review":"The first and third Die Hard movies are great, but this one *****.

I know part of the blame is on Renny Harlin heavy colour filters he used, like the orange or reds are to imposing at times .I couldnt help but notice the low quality tranfer which obviosuly came from a poor print.

Buyer Beware!","review":"As soon as the movie would started, and the audio switches to DTS-HD, it would either go totally quiet or make this little clicking noises like there were aliens trying to talk to us. Unfortunately I didn't know there were problems with this disc, so I spent all kinds of time fooling around with my equipment. Buyer Beware! They are having issues with DTS-HD audio on this movie. It did work when I switched to Dolby Surround, but who wants to listen to that if your into uncompressed audio?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Goodbye, skyscraper...hello, airport","review":"Die Hard 2 is basically just a few notches below the original, but it's still one heck of an action film. It still has plenty of action, drama, and occasional humor. The plot is pretty much the same, but instead of a high-rise building, the film is now set in an airport in Virginia. And sure, the story is a bit more implausible, but it's the action that's truly worth seeing. Bruce Willis returns, of course, and he just as awesome as he was in the first movie. Gun fights and explosions are still spectacular and they still hold up pretty well today. Again, it's not as great as the original, but if you are truly a fan of the Die Hard series, then you wouldn't doubt that this is a very good action film.Grade: B"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining sequel","review":"This has some great action and good lines. It's a good film and the stunts have some great moments to them. Well worth buying.Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys"},{"rating":"2","title":"Deja vu","review":"LA cop (formerly New York cop) John Maclaine (Bruce Willis) is in Washington DC waiting for his wife's (Bonnie Bedelia) flight to land, when history suddenly repeats itself. Another Christmas. More terrorists. Wife in peril again. More dunderheaded authorities who won't listen to common sense. More crawls through ductwork and hammering fist fights with powerful opponents. More guns. Another very entertaining film.The amazing thing about this movie is the way all these repeated elements play like sly tributes to the original rather than examples of creative poverty. This is no doubt largely due to director Renny Harlin. This was the film that brought him to America's attention for a while before he faded away again. Willis is also uncommonly effective at coming across like an everyman even while he is performing feats that James Bond would be hard-pressed to pull off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Die Hard 2: Die Harder","review":"After the ground-breaking, awesome Die Hard comes a worthy sequel. Though not as good as the original, Die Hard 2 has its moments and turns out to be a good film. Bruce Willis is again great as NYPD cop John McClane, and Bonnie Bedilia gives an even better performance as McClane's wife, Holly. The downpoint of the casting is certainly William Sadler as villain Colonel Stuart. He can't compare to Rickman or Irons and hurts the film. The plot is interesting but why couldn't the planes have landed at a diferent airport? The darkness and helps the film a lot, and the script isn't that bad. action is entertaining, including a snowmobile chase, several gunfights, and a fight on the wing of a plane. Music is okay. The suspense is well-balanced and the feel is good, yet it is very unrealistic. However, if you put aside all the plotholes and unrealistic things, Die Hard 2 is quite an entertaining action romp and is worth renting and possibly buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"CAST THE FIRST STONE","review":"I absolutely loved the book HERE and NOW and couldn't wait to purchase and read CAST THE FIRST STONE. I found the book quite disappointing, however. It lacked the depth of HERE and NOW and though the theme could have made for an interesting read, the book droned. I read it until the end (although I'm not sure why), but would not recommend it. If you want to read it, I would suggest you borrow it from a friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed At All","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. I found the character development poor and I was tired of Tanya in each chapter discussing her desire to leave Curtis but why she couldn't. She also spent a great deal of time discussing abused women and too much detail on clothing, cars, coach bags, etc.. which was unnecessary for me. Overall, I was not impressed. I also did not find the writing challenging. This is no J. California Cooper or Toni Morrison."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great storytelling!","review":"Like most of the books on my shelf, I started this book years ago and just went back to finish (not because they aren't good, but because I keep buying new books!). I thoroughly enjoyed Kimberla's storytelling style. The characters were vidid enough and the story kept me turning the pages. Great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pastor Black Is A Mess","review":"I enjoyed this book. It was a little slow at times, but the more I read the more I enjoyed it. By the time I got towards the end of the book I didn't want to stop. The basis of the book is about Tanya trying to believe and wait on Pastor Black her husband to become the husband he should be. Pastor Black says one thing in the pulpit and does the opposite as soon as he says amen. The book is a trip. How long will Tanya wait on Pastor Black? Will his ways finally catch up to him? You'll have to read it. The book is really good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a page turner","review":"After reading \\"Here and Now\\", I wasnt too sure how I would like Casting the First Stone, because \\"Here\\" had alittle too much drama for me. But this book was really good. The characters were realistic, (except maybe James!) and the story moved along at a comfortable speed. I guess I'll check out \\"Thin Line\\" and see how it is. Overall, good job Ms. Roby!"},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT READ!","review":"This was a terrific read. The author tells a superb story. The heroine did get on my nerves a few times because she was so incredibly complacent.However, I do want to point out that the author holds her own in presenting her material. One of the reviews on the book cover compares her work to that of Terry McMillan. I just want to go on record and say that there is no comparison needed. This author sets her own standards (very high I might add) and delivers. I look forward to more from her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your money!!!!","review":"This was one of the worst books i have ever attempted to read. I could not finish it. The characters were boring. I was tired of Tanya putting up with Curtis day in and day out, and complaining about it all the time. I just kept finding myself, drifting off and having to force myself back into finishing a chapter. I finally decided to stop punishing myself and return the book. I also decided to return \\"To much of a good thing\\" because it couldnt be much better. I would suggest, \\"let the church say amen\\" by reshonda tate billingsley. Or any michele andrea bowen books. Much better reads. If you still want to try this book i would also suggest you borrow it from the library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sad subject, good story!","review":"I was truly sorry to read that the topic matter was of a Baptist Minister with a promising congregation, but the story was good because it could be true. I was proud of the main character, Tanya, for sticking to her guns and looking out for herself and her daughter, because they are who matters. Curtis, who is no-good anyway, got what he deserved. The ending was surprising and had a good finale. I was intrigued througout the entire story and was hoping and praying for James the whole way through. This is a worthwhile book and a good weekender if you want something to keep your attention and is easy to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTING NOVEL","review":"Although I commend the author for tackling an important issue of hypocracy within the Baptist church, I felt the author spent much to much time on mundane details and repetitive concepts which ultimately detracted from the novel. More significantly however, I think the author should have spent time discussing the factors and issues which led Curtis to be the person we see throughout the novel. The authors failure to discuss or give any insight whatsoever into what happened during the 8( eight) intervening years left a significant 'hole' in the storyline. At the conclusion of the novel, I didn't feel that I had anymore insight into the characters or storyline than I did when I started the novel.The discussion of situations faced by the characters seemed to be incredibly disjointed. I did not feel the author took the time to develop the characters and/or situations in a meaningful and significant manner. All in all, very disappointed"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. I consider myself to be a great fan of Lawson-Roby's previous novels, but this book left a lot to be desired. The same points and ideas were belabored again and again and it took away from the interest of the book. While I LOVED 'Behind Closed Doors' and 'Here and Now' I wonder why the wit and skill reflected in those books was not seen in this one. And if I had to read one more insignificant detail...To the Editor or whoever advised her to add more scenery or bulk to scenes: READERS DO NOT LIKE INSIGNIFICANT DETAILS THAT DO NOT CONTRIBUTE TO THE PACE OF THE STORYLINE. Kimberla, get a new editor.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs a rewrite","review":"This could have been a better book if the author spent more time on character development. For example, Tanya's boyfriend was not a well developed character. He was just thrown in for a happy ending. Curtis was far more interesting. I wanted to know what made him tick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Plot Amateurishly Written","review":"Roby has an interesting plot line, although it leans toward the predictable and sometimes turns preachy. Still, it's a good story with a logical plot and a significant message. Mrs. Roby has the potential to be a terrific writer, but she needs to develop her craft to reach beyond the amateur technique, sentence construction, and punctuation errors that plague her novel and distract from her story. Her natural ability provides a good outline, but her lack of knowledge in the art of telling a good story well proves to be a crippling flaw. In an interview with Mrs. Roby, she proudly said she had never attended a writing course or worked with a writing group. Investing herself in such opportunities for critique would polish her natural ability and challenge her to strive for excellence and craftsmanship. With the odds she's beaten already, what is there to fear from an opportunity to sharpen her skills?"},{"rating":"1","title":"zzzzzzzzz","review":"Can I give it negative stars?The topic that this book attempts to takcle is relevant and real in today's society, but this author writes like an 8th grade English paper.

I just ate a ceaser salad and mozzerella sticks. I always speak in complete sentences and never use contractions or slang. James is so attractive. OOOH I drank wine I'm going to hell.

The going back and forth trying to decide whether or not to stay or leave her husband, got kind of tiring and very boring. However, the author did enlist a surprise twist at the end of the story. Ms. Lawson may well be on her way to adding a little mystery or intrigue into her storylines. I wonder how the author would rate as a mystery novelist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Explosive!","review":"Again you have done it! After I read the first chapter, I was unable to put the book down. Ms. Roby embarked upon an area that many have viewed as an \\"upright, straight, nothing to hide\\" existence, only to reveal that secrets and indiscretions can exist in the most seemingly perfect place--the church. Tanya Black despite what she felt deep down, stood when most would have bowed out. Casting the First Stone is definitely a must read. Kimberla has a style and flair that is truly commendable. I look forward to more of the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good job by Ms Roby","review":"I really enjoy the writings of Kimberla Lawson Roby so I must say I was pleased again. This is the story of Rev and Ms Black. Power, money and women become the Rev. downfall.

I especially like the Pastor's Appreciation Day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Casting the First Stone Review","review":"I think that this book was excellent. I love the way Kimberla described so precise each move that the character made. This gave me a feeling of being there. I love the idea for the discussion questions in the back.

I thought the soap opera plot was built upon stereotypes of the one dimensional characters who I found completely lacking in depth. I disliked it so much that I was completely turned off by the idea of attempting to read the sequel Too Much of a Good Thing, even after I read the preview online on the authors website.

I am very involved in my church and we had a similar situation a few years ago, so I know it is \\"real.\\" It is very sad when these things happen with supposedly \\"spiritual\\" individuals, but some people aren't able to handle \\"fame\\" and the responsibilities that go with it. It is unfortunate that some pastors of large churches have to be strong and able to avoid temptations that are so easy available. NOt only did Curtis do wrong, but he didn't seem to be able to distinguish the difference. He had too much \\"going on\\" in his life and he got exactly what he deserved in the end. I read with baited breath, hoping that his wife wasn't going to give in, in the end. I'm glad she went on with her life. Kimberla did an excellent job. I e-mailed her to let her know and she responded the very next day. A wonderful person!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"I absolutely loved this book. Even though this book is fictional, it is very \\"real\\" in many aspects. Ms. Roby's writing depicts the ups and downs many couples face when one partner is torn between family and greed. It is absolutely amazing what a person is willing to sacrifice for the love of material things. In many instances, I felt the varied emotions that the characters in the book were experiencing. I laughed and cried. This book should be on Oprah's book club list."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Page Turner - Excellent","review":"Kimberla has done it again. This book is excellent.

They can never get enuf satisfaction. They want Sister Sally and Sister Sally's momma and her grandmomma too. They just can't get enuf of that funky stuff. This book told the naked truth about these so-called Reverends. It was a well-written, entertaining novel and deserves 4.5 stars. I recommend it especially to those of you that knows that y'alls pastor ain't no-good! Maybe it'll wake you and shake you to leave that vulture of a preacher. But if you know that your pastor ain't no good and you choose to stay under his teachings, then all I can say is that birds of a feather, flock together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat disappointed","review":"I read Here and Now first then Behind Closed Doors, I wasn't that enthused about Casting the First Stone.

However I do comend Kim on choosing a very touchy topic, but her approach wasn't that clever."},{"rating":"1","title":"KIM ROBY-I WANT MY MONEY BACK!","review":"Casting the First Stone, a novel which supposedly exposes corruption in the church family, failed miserably. It really exposes corruption in the literary community by passing itself off as quality literature and ripping off hundreds of readers looking for substance and quality. Kimberla Roby has not mastered the writing craft and this book shows it. The words don't sing, they huddle together like a clumps of gooey mess staining over two hundred pages. The characters are shallow, the writing is repetitive, and the writer insists on telling the reader information they already know. Page after page after page, the writer tortured her readers with needless nonsense, perpetrating the myth of keeping a family together and then she turns around and commits adultery. Do two wrongs make a right? The topic of the book is a worthy subject, but this author does it no justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kimberla Does It Again","review":"\\"Casting the First Stone\\" is a book that I would rank in my top ten for the year. Tanya is trying snd praying every day to keep her marriage to Curtis together. She tends to keep it all inside but when things start to affect her child she realizes that she has to get out. This is the story of a strong black woman who's faith in God gets her through some pretty rough times. I can't wait for Ms.roby,s next book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Will You Hurry It Up A Bit?","review":"I liked the premise, and I also like that the character seemed to be able to see through her husband's lies. The problem was that for the whole first half of the book, Tanya seems to do nothing but mull--over and over again. I wanted to yell at her to just follow the man instead of confronting him for the umpteenth time and doing nothing.As previous readers say, the book takes way too long make small progressions, yet seems to skip over important details--especially like how Curtis became the man he is and started his life of deception; and Tanya's relationship with Rebound Man seems too rushed.The premise of the book, I like, I just really dislike the pacing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll Pass On The Next One","review":"This was an okay read. It took me a long time to finish this book because in certain spots the book was downright boring. I really got tired of Tanya going back and forth on the seesaw trying to decide if she should stay or leave Curtis. And the whole idea of staying in a marriage where the husband lies & disrespects you daily and you know he's cheating but you choose to stay for the sake of your daughter was too much for me to comprehend (I lost interest at that point). Curtis was a terrible person and demonstrated many of the negative attributes associated with \\"Black\\" churches. This one was okay, not interested in reading the sequels"},{"rating":"2","title":"Never glorify your pastor...","review":"\\"Casting the First Stone,\\" was a masterpiece, a clear depiction of a corrupt minister. Curtis Black was placed on a pedastal by his family and congregation, glorified to no end. However, he didn't live by the words he preached, which is very realistic in our own lives. Lesson learned, never glorify the man on the pulpit. Hear the pastors words and look up to God for guidance.~LeBlanc author of \\"Characters of Lust\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Reality Steps In","review":"I just finish reading this book, and it was so realistic. The characters were alive and you could feel the pain of Tanya and Curtis.It was well written and showed how greed could lead to nothing but trouble, that only God could fix.This family went through hell and faith is what brought the family through.I was very happy how the story ended, even though it was sad, but Tanya is now happy. Curtis on the other hand took Greed to whole new level. Greed destroyed their marriage and his ability to Pastor. I won't tell the whole story. But this is definitely a very good book to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This is the first book I have read by Kimberla Lawson Roby and probably the last. I was not a fan of her writing style. While the book started off pretty well it went down hill from there. Tanya took forever going over the same things over and over again just to make up her mind to leave her husband Curtis. Then to add insult to injury she kept challenging Curtis when she was alone and he reacted like a nut. At least 150 pages of this book was a repeat of everything over and over again. There was no suspense for me as I finally didn't care how it ended. Although I completed reading the novel I won't repeat this exercise with any of her other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"MMPH- MMPH-MMPH!","review":"I believe the main reason this book was a page turner to me was because it hit too close to home with an extrememly similiar incident in a church I once belonged to. Unfortunately, it is also the main reason I no longer attend church, too hypocritical.In any case, I did get a little tired of Tanya's prolonged excuses to do something about the situation and using her precious daughter as one excuse. There were many instances where I thought she could have been doing some detective work on her own instead of sitting home on her butt wondering. As for Curtis, he finally gets what he deserves...no mercy! I'm waiting for Too Much of a Good Thing to be delivered, I'd like to keep up with how this ends up."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Sorry but So True !","review":"Like always, Kimberla Lawson Roby, you have outdid yourself again.

Curtis Black is a mess that I love reading about!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Inappropriate reading for christian bookclub","review":"This book was recommended by several people. Upon reading it, I found the language to be inappropriate for a christian book club. I was amazed at the necessity for the language that was used. I believe the story could have been told without the use of obscene language. I was unable to read the entire book. It was very disappointing. After ordering 35 copies, I had to return and order 35 other books which were more appropriate."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of the Same","review":"Same old relationship drama - however, this one involves a minister and his wife.

I will be sure to tell all my friends about this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"He who is without sin!","review":"“Casting the First Stone�?by Kimberla Lawson Roby is a masterful presentation of creative writing. Ms. Roby is very inventive and uses great imagination in portraying the characters and situations of her story. In this novel, she vividly described the fraught lives of a married couple who struggles to remain faithful to each other in their Christian walk. Tanya, who is presupposed to have achieved a degree of life success, is married to Curtis, a charismatic pastoral husband who is laden with some obvious spiritual weaknesses. As their marriage suffered, Tanya’s serene and beautiful love of life began to turn sour and her affection for the things she once admired began to grow cold. And like a woman who was abducted for marriage falls in love with her abductor, she learns of her husband’s infidelity and succumbs to the same weaknesses that plagued his life. It is an interesting read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Takes You To Another Level","review":"This book is one that needed to be written. It is serious yet humorous to some degree. It illustrates to its reader the fact that no one is free from sin! I encourage everyone to get a copy of this book!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"I enjoyed reading this book because it reflects ...the church. I think it points out how some people go about representing God and his teaching the way they want instead of how it is written. The 3 evils lust,greed, and power all play big parts in this book and shows how God condemns those who thrive on these evils."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT","review":"The novel opens to a world of hopefullness with a young couple starting on a journey of togetherness and spirituality, but eight years later all this is turned around. I have to admit because I read so much I cannot remember the main character's name but her lack of naivete' and trust is what alot of women do today. I was with her all the way with trying to give her marriage all that she could but I was also with her when she said enough was enough. Now the only thing I didnt like about the book was her reasoning to stray when her married life wasnt taken care of--when she hadnt made any concrete moves to end it.What this book also echoed is that spirtuality is in the heart not a church/building/man/tithe. I dont even think it is worth mentioning the souless display of her husband Curtis!Without a doubt I recommend this book and it is now being circulated throughout my friends list to finally be read again by me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"This book took forever to get to the best parts. As some of the readers said Tanya took forever to make her mind up as to what she was going to do about her cheating husband. Although I never expected the to find out those other things the Pastor did, it was still a little slow for me. I read one of Mrs, Roby other books and that was better than this one (Changing Faces)I purchased Too much of a good thing, and The best kept secret at the same time hoping that they all would be good books to read. From the looks of Casting the first stone, I'm not looking forward to reading the other ones.Overall I could have save my time and money, I killed time reading it but I would have rather reading the newspaper.Sorry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT READ!

The text comes up front, and all the plates are at the back. In my opinion, a terrible idea, mostly because the author refers CONSTANTLY to the plates.The publishers apparently realized there was a problem with this misorganization, because they supplied two ribbon book-markers -- one to mark your place in the text, and the other to mark your place in the plates.The result is a study in frustration, trying to keep both markers in place while trying to follow the author's discussion. In my case, updating the markers actually caused me to lose the thread of the discussion.How much better it is, to have the illustrations printed right alongside the text, which is the way the book has always been printed.Get the 16th edition and save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"very informative and easy to read!","review":"good value and great writer!!!

The examples are terrible, and most of them don't work.Too bad that there is no zero star catagory.This book appears to be some class notes slapped together to cash in on the client/server \\"dot com\\" boom of the ninties. If you see it in a used book bin for a dollar, don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst programming book I've ever read","review":"The book has the worst explanations of programming concepts I have ever attempted to read and the CD-ROM is nearly worthless. You will be fortunate indeed if the examples work with your installation of VB6. Several of the examples that were to supposed to use a data control actually displayed a picture box and never did work as a data control. The only way that I could get them to work was to delete the picture boxes, add a data control and program it. For that I didn't need this book or the waste of my time trying to make the examples work. As a database programmer, I feel that the money spent on this book was a waste. I might as well have burned the money for warmth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for experienced c/s developer who wants to switch to VB","review":"This is an excellent book for experienced client/server developer. Author identified new concepts of database connectivity in VB6 and future trend.

It would be better if author gives more \\"step by step\\" instructions. This book is not recommended for new c/s developer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixed review - be careful of the Source Code on the CD","review":"In general I liked the book. In some areas it was very helpful. The typesetting with the very wide left margins insured that the example code was very hard to follow at most times. My biggest problem was with the sample code on the CD. To run the code I wanted to try, I was supposed to load the sample database on SQL Server. The SQL script in the MS folder for creating the database does _not_ run on SQL Server 6.5. The author and the publisher should have checked this out. After hand creating the tables, the code would still not run as the author had not tested it with no data. Seemed to bring in to question the quality of the information in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Book!","review":"The MVT process outlined in this book will benefit every organization. MVT greatly accelerates learning. Imagine being able to quickly distinguish the initiatives that are doomed to failure from those that are destine to be wildly successful. Learning in a few months what you previously had not been able to learn in five years.The mountains of examples in the book make it clear that MVT can effectively be applied to any goal."},{"rating":"2","title":"MVT Results Made Believable","review":"I loved what this book demonstrates. QualPro and MVT provide clear, concise, verifiable, reliable ways to improve any process in a multitude of industries. It is truly unbelievable that this methodology is not more widely encompassed in businesses around the world. I had attended QualPro's annual symposium in Atlanta for the last two years and was really impressed with the success stories but wasn't sure this was the firm I wanted to use. The book clarifies how this process may be used to improve the bottom line and increase shareholder satisfaction."},{"rating":"2","title":"MVT--a great tool","review":"This is a great book and should be taught at the college along with a supporting statistics package. The essence of the book is in the Placket-Burman fractional designs and how to analyze them. QualPro keeps some of their business secrets and that detracts from the books \\"useability\\" and in that respect, the book was a downer. They also put in a few plugs for hiring a \\"MVT\\" consultant--which is more like advertising than telling a story. However, the methodology is sound and needs to be used in more areas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breakthrough Testimonials with an Undisclosed Process","review":"The book admonishes that one shouldn't attempt to design screening experiments without consulting an experienced MVT veteran (apparently QualPro staff). Aren't MVT screening experiments why you'd purchase the book in the first place? Hmm.While it would be simple to explain the basics of Plackett-Burman designs, that doesn't mean good business for \\"experienced MVT consultants.\\" The author leaves the origin and nature of his test grids mysterious. The book should be titled \\"QualPro MVT Case Studies,\\" but I don't imagine that it would sell quite as many copies.Read _Design of Experiments for Engineers and Scientists_ instead if you're interested in actually -doing- multivariable tests with Plackett-Burman designs. Oh, and take a look at the dates on previous Amazon reviews. Just a little suspicious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breakthrough Business Results with MVT got through to me","review":"Before reading this book, I felt, as many people do, that I understood \\"process improvement\\" about as well as anyone, and that Six Sigma (although I didn't really know that much about 6s) was a useful tool. Now I know better.MVT offers much faster results and appeals to me because it solves the most fundamental business problem - which ideas work, which ideas don't, and which don't matter. Once you know this with confidence, any business problem can be solved, any process improved. After refining your experimental results and implementing the corrective actions, you cannot escape improvement unless you sabotage the process.Fascinating reading about many companies who have used MVT to achieve extraordinary gains. Highly recommended to anyone interested in improving their business or reading about companies who already have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Six Sigma","review":"When I read chapter four of the book, the differences between the 12-Step Process and Six Sigma became clear.My company has been in the Six Sigma process for over two years now. We have had some good results, but the up front load has made the costs much greater than the benefits. The 12-Step Process is tactical in nature and focusses on a high payoff project. There is no upfront loading.Another important difference in the two approaches is the 12-Step Process emphasizes operator involvement. In our company black belts are expected to accomplish the projects alone or with only minimal assistance from green and yellow belts. If operators are not involved in the improvement effort, they become part of the problem. Also in my experience operators have the best ideas.Low frontend costs and rapid gains through operator involvement convinces me that our company should give the 12-Step Process a try on one big-bucks project."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diablotek are unreachable.

The Dual Shock is basically the same thing as the original Playstation controller designed a few years ago, except it has the two analog sticks. This brings me to my only complaint about the controller. The two analog sticks add some weight to the controller and get in the way of rapid button combination pressing in games like Tekken 3, and especially Capcom's fighting games (I think the whole analog idea isn't necessary anyway). So if you are used to the regular Playstation controller, the Dual Shock may take some time to adjust to.

These light grey versions have VERY stiff directional pads that make pushing diagonals nearly impossible. The D-pad will click and make noises like a button rather than moving smoothly between presses. For example, if you push Up and Right at the same time, the controller will only register one or the other. Your character in the game will not move in both directions at once, ie diagonally. This isn't an issue if you plan on using the controller for the analogue sticks only, but if you're playing a 2D game or older game that requires the D-pad, you will be in for trouble. Buy a third-party controller or a PS2 Dual Shock instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sony Playtation Controller","review":"Awesome price, I got the actual Sony PS one controller was surprised at how much I paid works with the PS2 has vibration and everything I wish I could afford like 2 or 3 more just to have in case this one gets worn out or I break it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deception....","review":"I ordered the PS1 controler thinking it was going to be Sony brand(as pictured)...Insted I got some cheap spin off brand with no Sony logo thats nowhere near the quality of Sony.

An absolutely preposterous plot, some really bad acting (from Kenneth Branagh of all people!), and regrettable casting choices (e.g., Robin Williams as a disgraced ex-psychiatrist forced to work as a grocery store shelf stocker and Wayne Knight--Newman on Seinfeld--who [sorry Wayne!] will always be Newman and therefore should not be cast in any serious movie).Among its other sins, at times this \\"thriller\\" seems to think it's a comedy. If you're a fan of Kenneth Branagh and Emma Thompson's other fine works, you'll especially want to skip this one.It's a real shame--after wasting $8-$10 on this movie, you'll naturally want to see it to its conclusion despite all the warning signs that it's not going to get any better.

Yes, the plot is threadbare, but no more so that those of Hitchcock's best, and irrelevant in any case, as the tension winds tighter and tighter, seeking a violent conclusion. Branagh is his usual self, so completely disappearing into his two roles, both with American accents, that he does not seem the same man who thrilled us in Henry V, delighted us in Much Ado, and took our breath away with Hamlet.See it on a dark, winter night, with the lights low, and your arms around someone you adore.

He and then-wife Emma Thompson play strangers who meet who may have met in a previous life (the concept of reincarnation plays heavily on the plot.) Black and white and color filming alternate cleverly as the setting flip-flops from the 90s to the 50s. Andy Garcia also does a fine job in the movie. Look for Robin Williams to give a stellar bit performance. Telling much more about the movie would give it away to those who have not seen it, but what's important is that Brannagh and Thompson are both unknowingly involved in a 40 year old murder case and the movie has a very surprise ending. In fact even though the term \\"Hitcockian\\" has been widely overused (to the point of running it into the ground) the ending to this movie actually deserves that title.

Perfectly cast, superbly acted, it is a riveting double plot woven in and out of L.A of the 1940's and the 1990's.Love, passion, murder, reincarnation are all blended together in a thriller that is spellbinding in the fashion of Hitchcockian \\"film noir\\". Kenneth Branagh and Emma Thompson spark passion in past and present as Roman/Margaret - Mike/Grace. It is especially enjoyable to watch the enormously talented Mr. Branagh play a case-weary L.A. detective. Derek Jacobi also scores definitively in a supporting role laced with both charm and menace. This movie is absolutely a must for anyone who loves the vintage Hollywood romance-thrillers of the of the Forties.

You'll also wonderful performances by Derek Jacobi, Andy Garcia, Campbell Scott, and Robin Williams to name a few. With Patrick Doyle's score intertwining throughout the film.

As a hack drummer, I can tell you that Ringo practically invented the way that drums are tuned and recorded in the studio. He invented sounds and made the music better by his accuntuating the verses. No, he didn't have great technical ability, most rock drummers don't, but his attention to the tuning and sound of drums, while incorporating his own style, was very original. The Beatles would not have been as good without Ringo behind the kit.Listen to \\"Flying\\" and \\"Blue Jay Way.\\" Very innovative drum \\"space\\" fills, unique for 1967.

Blue Jay Way is boring, boring, boring and Flying is a throw away piece of filler. The title track and \\"Your Mother Should Know\\" are terribly written and seem like they were just cranked out in 15 minutes. The only good song on the whole soundtrack is \\"Fool on the Hill\\" and that pales compared to other songs by Paul such as found on the Revolver CD. The collection of singles on this CD are good. But even songs such as \\"All You Need Is Love\\" and \\"Baby You're a Rich Man\\" have fared poorly over the years. While I'm a big, big Beatles fan, even I have to admit when the Beatles made some [low grade music]."},{"rating":"1","title":"A few good songs but mostly trash....","review":"I wasnt a big fan of this LP but it had its good moments... not many though...I wouldnt recommend..."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Beatles fans and old hippies","review":"I had to have this because, well, it's the Beatles!

I just love it! like people before have said, all the songs are so unique and would be gems by themselves on any other band's album, but to have them altogether is magic. my all time favourite song (so far) is the fool on the hill - i listened to it around italy, so whenever i hear it, i adore the song, and think of people, places and things i saw when it was on - i used up so many batteries rewinding the tape so i could hear it again! it gets to the stage where i stop and rewind it halfway through so it never finishes. enjoy..."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the weirdist, yet one of the best!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"After when Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band was released, their music started to get weirder and weirder. That doesn't mean that the music got worse. Personally, I think their later work was the best. Except their worst song was on the White Album. I mean, Revolution 9? Ugh!!!!! But like I said, it didn't get worse. And this here album proves it.This album has great examples of absolute masterpieces. For example, Paul's work, I mean vocals, were just extraordinary. John's work on I am the Walrus were unbelievable. I mean, sure there are some weird ones like Blue Jay Way and Flying. But Flying is an instrumental, so you can excuse that. Look, all I'm saying is that this album does have some of their weirdest music, but it is still extraordinary. So if you ask me, if you are going to buy any Beatles albums, I suggest that you buy this one. I guarantee that you will be satisfied!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mystery to Me","review":"There is a maximum of 3 or 4 good songs on this album and it is generally recognized as being one of the Beatles' weakest.

Each song is very bizarre but still very good. Lennon says it was the finest album they ever made but I do not think so. However it is still awesome!!!My favourites songs are THE FOOL ON THE HILL, BLUEJAY WAY, YOUR MOTHER SHOULD KNOW,I AM THE WALRUS, and I feel ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE delivers a beautiful message.The only beef I have with this album is the lack of tracks only 11! Come on! Still now it is a fine album and worth the bucks! Highly reccommended!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT","review":"I found the Beatles, Magical Mystery Tour to be one of the best CD's that I have ever listened to. It has great hits such as Magical Mystery Tour, Strawberry Fields, Penny Lane, and All You Need Is Love. It also has some great songs that I never heard like Your Mother Should Know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing washes of sound","review":"\\"Magical Mystery\\" is a collection of film music that far exceeds the film itself, with the most brilliant singles ever recorded tacked on for good measure. The last of the Beatles' great psychedelic ventures should never be dismissed as merely trippy, for it is intelligent, carefully renedered, and highly imaginative work that shows what levels of art pop music can rise to. I miss this experimental studio attitude, coupled as it was with accessible songs and lyrics chock full of double meanings. And, in contrast to the rampant cynicism of today, \\"All You Need Is Love\\" remains a triumph."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magical Mystery- THE BEATLES","review":"What can I say? It's the Beatles for goodness sake. Every song is worth the listen, even the introduction song. \\"Fool on the Hill\\" is malicious but has a nice rhythm. \\"Flying\\" is an unexpected instrumental. \\"Your Mother Should Know\\" encourages you to listen to old hits. \\"I Am The Walrus\\" is interesting. \\"Hello Goodbye\\" is catchy. \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" is great as well as \\"Penny Lane\\" and \\"All You Need Is Love.\\" This album came out in 1967. It also has a film that went along with it. Half the songs have lead vocals by McCartney while another half was performed by Lennon. For 2 months this album was #1 on the US charts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album","review":"I've always loved this album, even more so than Sgt. Pepper. I used to have this on 8 track tape when I was a kid, and listened to it constantly. I'm glad they did the American album version so we got some extra songs like \\"All You Need is Love\\", \\"Baby You're a Rich Man\\", etc. Not a bad remaster, but when you listen to it with head phones, the back and forth between the right and left phone gets a teeny bit annoying (but all the remasters have that). I can live with it. I do like being able to hear the bass better and other sounds I never picked up on before."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of the Beatles studio CD's","review":"This is my favorite of the Beatles Studio CD not counting any of their compliations or anthologies.

Shut up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"my reaction","review":"It's a cunning move that Capitol decided to tack some of the SGT PEPPER-era singles onto the end of the record. So if that's what you desperately want, buy it. Otherwise, spend your $$ elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Their worst effort, albeit with some interesting highlights","review":"The only thing that saves this release is the collection of singles tacked onto the British release: \\"I am the Walrus,\\" \\"Strawberry Fields\\" and \\"Penny Lane\\" are great, but the actual soundtrack songs are weak as a whole. \\"Blue Jay Way\\" and \\"Your Mother Should Know\\" could come up missing from the Beatles' catalog and never be missed. \\"Flying\\" is a trippy instrumental that fits the feel of the LP, but is otherwise forgettable. Another of the singles included, \\"Hello Goodbye,\\" is one of the worst Beatles songs ever. Sure it's catchy, but it was a foreshadowing of the throwaways McCartney would come up with en masse during his solo years. Bad sign. The album is exactly like the movie - worth experiencing for a snapshot in the always interesting Beatles chronology, but their least-lasting work. Oh yeah - the title track is neato, if nothing else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cartoon trash...","review":"There's a reason so many other reviewers give the Rolling Stones so much more praise than the Beatles. When you listen to (almost) any Stones album, you hear a spirited collection of rocking blues and talented playing. When you put on any Beatles album, you hear what sounds like a bunch of little children trying to write, play, and sing like grownups. And failing miserably. How even one of their albums got on Amazon's top 10 list for this decade (ahead of Hendrix and Aretha Franklin, no less) I'll never know, but it's no accident that \\"Let It Bleed\\" is at the top. Save your money on this one if you're over 15."},{"rating":"2","title":"an excellent comosition","review":"this was a great effort by th BEATLES, from magical mystery tour to all you need is love.

Even though recorded right around, and in some cases, during, the SGT Pepper sessions, none of these songs would fit with that album.So why 5 stars? The songs are great. The only one that I've grown tired of is All You need is Love. That being said, I'm glad that this was pretty much the end of the Beatles' psychadelic phase. Its clear that they had exhausted that aspect of their music, and it was time to move on to different things (White Album, Abbey Road, etc).......yes, better things. Still enjoyable, still 5 stars, but The Beatles just kept changing and rewriting the history of music. Oh, and listen to this album in MONO. The mix is far superior."},{"rating":"2","title":"Waiting To Take You Away","review":"Where Pepper has been labeled a psychedelic album, MMT shows a more detailed picture of The Beatles foray in this genre. Where the British version was a two EP set(?)of the soundtrack music, the US version expanded it to an album that included the non-album singles from '67(Strawberry Fields Forever/Penny Lane, All You Need Is Love/Baby, You're A Rich Man & Hello, Goodbye).The best songs from the film are the now standard Fool On The Hill, as well as the brilliant I Am The Walrus. Your Mother Should Know has a certain charm that even made the final scene in that terrible movie a welcome relief. Even for those who didn't see MMT(or who did and regrets it)the music in the end always conjures up a vivid picture of The Beatles psychedelic period."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated!","review":"Released between Sgt. Pepper's and the white album, The Beatles' Magical Mystery Tour is largely overlooked and I don't understand why. It features John Lennon's inspired wit becoming truly baroque (\\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" \\"I Am the Walrus\\"), the continuation of George Harrison's intriguing experimentation with Eastern culture (\\"Blue Jay Way\\"), George Martin's most breathtaking studio wizardry (\\"Strawberry Fields Forever,\\" \\"All You Need Is Love\\"), some of Paul McCartney's brightest shining pop tunes (\\"Penny Lane,\\" \\"The Fool on the Hill\\") and, of coarse, Ringo performed too. Maybe being basically collection of excellent songs rather than a cohesive experience (like Abbey Road or Sgt. Pepper's) hurt it or perhaps people can not forget that absurdly stupid TV movie it soundtracked. In any case, it is about time Magical Mystery Tour is counted among the Beatles' best work."},{"rating":"2","title":"FAVORITE","review":"Why I waited so long to add this to my Beatles collection I know not. Easily my favorite. I remember hearing Hello Goodbye on the AM oldies staion as a youngster driving along with my dad. While I loved it then, I agree with most reviews. An ill fit.

In essence, this is a hits collection, featuring some of the best singles ever written. Paul's \\"Penny Lane\\" and John's \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" in particular, are both sumptuously orchestrated slices of pop nirvana, but the clear winner here is \\"All You Need Is Love.\\" A must-have for any Beatles, I also suggest this disc to casual fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Beatles stiffest competition...The Beatles","review":"Strangely this is viewed by some as one of the fab's weaker album's and maybe it is when compared to the conceptual cohesivesness of some others but...MY goodness Penny Lane, Strawberry Fields, All You Need is Love (musically simple but thematically a rip tide).

The album contains lite pop disguised as rock music. Neither disguise works very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"An awesome mystery trip","review":"This was the first Beatles album I ever got. I thought it was okay. But now that I'm really into them, I've begun to appreciate it. The title track is a catchy tune, with a nice brass part. Then comes one of the better McCartney songs, Fool on the Hill. I like the recorder. Flying is pretty good, and very underrated. Blue jay way is a neat song, too. I am The Walrus (no you're not, said little Nicola) is a brilliantly silly song, with an interesting fadeout and positively weird lyrics.Hello Goodbye is one of Paul's better contributions. Strawberry Fields is arguably John's best work. The Mellotron part is cool. Penny Lane and Rich Man are some great songs. And, last but definetly not least, All You Need Is Love. What more can be said? The anthem of the sixties, it voiced the feelings of people aroud the world. I personally just think it's a good song. Overall it's a must buy. Oh and one more thing.

Actually, the first side of the album featured all the songs from the film. The second side contained the a and b sides of all the singles the Beatles released in 1967 (other than \\"I am the Walrus\\", which was on the first side of the album). There are a lot of great songs here, of course, but the album doesn't hold up that well as a cohesive unit. It feels more like a collection of songs than an actual album. Of course, you can't complain too much when you get great songs like \\"I am the Walrus\\", \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\", \\"Penny Lane\\" and \\"All You Need is Love\\". The one track I will criticize is \\"Flying\\". I hope my fellow Beatlemaniacs will forgive me, but I have to say that this is one of the boringest instrumentals ever recorded. Regardless of that, this album is still well worth purchasing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magical Remastering Tour!","review":"Only a simpleton would feel inclined to argue the merits of the Beatles or in particular the Album \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\"; the merits of both are set in stone. This review is concerned only with the latest cd release. Rest assured that the new remastering is upto the high expectation, perhaps even beyond.I've owned this Album in just about every format imaginable and I can easily say that it has NEVER sounded this good! I heard things, subtle nuances in instrumentation and vocals that I have never heard before ( I.E. \\"I Am The Walrus\\" ). I can't praise the sound quality enough. As if that was not enough, I also really liked the packaging; sure it will require a little care BUT I liked the liner notes, photos, and \\"throw back\\" look of the digi pak. Nice job.Trust me, you need to go on this Mystery Tour one more time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Your Invitation","review":"Great album. Haven't heard some of the songs in years.

Get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magical Mystery Tour","review":"There are some really good tunes on here. Magical Mystery Tour is a pretty standard Beatles song. Fool On The Hill is good, too. The real highlight on the album is Lennon's Strawberry Field's Forever, which is a masterpiece.Bluejay Way is one of those psychedelic songs from the era, and it's a nice piece by Harrison. How could you not like I Am The Walrus? Closing out the record is All You Need Is Love, which was the anthem for a decade...need more be said?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Commercial Trip","review":"I bought this CD only for the song \\"I am the Walrus\\", which I heard on an ad for the BBC. It's bizarre, to say the least, but retreads the Sgt Pepper formula quite well - Wild trippy tracks, \\"I am the Walrus\\" , \\"strawberry fields\\", with more mellow Mccartney tunes \\"the fool on the hill\\" and \\"Your mother should know\\", and Harrison's usual Indian influeneced madness \\"Blue jay Way\\". All in all, it's great fun, and \\"Hello Goodbye\\" is possibly one of the greatest songs ever to come out of '67."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Beatles songs - uneven package","review":"This CD has great Beatles songs, but it's a little confusing as to what this \\"album\\" really is - it is the 6 songs featured in the Beatles' 1967 TV film \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" plus the other Beatles singles from 1967 to make a full album. The only song that is unnecessary is \\"Flying\\" which is sort of incidental music from the film. Everything else is really cool! Another cheap thing is that they don't even give you all of the pages of the book that originally came with the album - but Capitol cheated with all of the Beatles CDs. \\"I Am the Walrus,\\" \\"Hello Goodbye,\\" and \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" really stand out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Told You About Strawberry Fields...","review":"This CD is something of a paradox. This contains some of their most majestic songs that they've ever made (Strawberry Fields, I Am The Walrus) on one hand. On the other, it was intended by Capitol to be a package containing the Magical Mystery Tour soundtrack and some of their recent singles that had not yet shown up on album format. In CD form, it still is found lacking. The original album booklet appears in a much truncated form. Also, the sound could use some upgrading, perhaps in a similar way to the recent Yellow Submarine songtrack. They might wish to add some bonus tracks, as there are other versions of I Am The Walrus, Penny Lane, etc, that are known to exist. I grade this CD 5 stars on the basis of Strawberry Fields Forever alone, one of the greatest songs ever written by John Lennon.

Pepper (summer 1967) and \\"The Beatles\\" (1968), this CD offers 4 songs that fall into the category of memorable Beatle classics - Strawberry Fields, Penny Lane, Hello Goodbye, and All You Need is Love. The rest are songs that were used to create an EP in addition to these popular singles. An alternative approach would have been to include these songs on Sgt.

Every student of the vibraphone should include his recordings in their collections. His mallet technique was flawless. I think the most creative years of his career was when he recorded at Verve. He played \\"styles\\" from all over the world, and painted a fresh approach, with their arrangements. Many so-called critics have said that the recordings were over-produced, but I don't think so. They just \\"dressed up\\" the listening experience. All of his Verve albums are represented here. It is a great CD to listen to in your car, as you won't have room for all the others.

The performances are great from Martin Balsam's Admiral Kimbel to Toshio Mifune's Admirial Yamamoto the action is believeable and the story told from both the perspective of Japan and the US hits the nail on the head. We see the development of the plan, the mistakes leading to the failures of Kimbel and most importantly we see the film in such a way that we understand this battle on both side was fought by Men, not monsters.

(for example, no usn officer is seen with the summer whites at pearl, but rather in dress whites, connotating a certain aura of ceremony in a combat situation) the movie is also made in part from a japanese perspective with directors and actors, and thus the japanese scenes are (combined with cross reference by the us counterparts) kept as authentic to history as possible. roles played by actors in Pearl Harbor are seen here, albeit in shorter context, while background characters in Pearl Harbor take the forefront. this movie is a beautiful historical counterpart to the dramitized Pearl Harbor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Pearl Harbor movie","review":"This is a great movie about Pearl Harbor because it seems, at least to me, to be an accurate account of what is happening on both the American and Japanese sides.

No fake CG stuff, you know all those planes on the tarmac were really blowing up. In todays movies, you just see a big fireball with some unrecognizable parts flying about. In this film, you saw propellers flying straight off the engine, unattached engines sliding into buildings, cowlings popping straight up, and fiery airplanes with no driver hitting other parked airplanes causing a chain reaction explosion.

It secured US entry into World War II which in turn helped in the victory in Europe over Nazi Germany.A key feature of this movie is that it was a joint American-Japanese production and hence gives both perspectives and a balanced picture of the story. It is both a historically accurate account of the events and also a gripping and watchable film.The first half of the movie maps out the events leading up to the attack, the question of why it happened is an important point for any event in history but particularly in this case.The movie's second half is a stunning recreation of the devastating battle. Considering when it was filmed the effects of the battle compare favourably with those of the far more recent Pearl Harbor directed by Michael Bay."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent war film for any age!","review":"This film is a superb telling of the events leading up to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. This film stays true to form and doesn't drift into fanciful stories related non-existant characters.

Having been born in the years since this film was made I wasn't expecting the special effects to turn any heads, but I must say that the film is far better than the recent \\"Pearl Harbor\\" with its computer generated aircraft and warships.

Tora! Tora! is a far superior version of events leading up to and including the attack on Pearl Harbour. I thought the movie was an accurate account of the the attack and gave a good perspective from both the Japanese and American sides. Certainly ranks in the upper bracket of very good war movies and has been warmly welcomed into my movie collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful restoration and presentation!","review":"I grew up watching this film, always enjoying its attention to detail and how it slowly built tension through to the actual attack. I always thought that the special effects and live-action stunts were very impressive for the era, as well. So I was among the first in line to pick up a copy of this restored version on Blu-ray. Let me tell anyone sitting on the fence: buy it. The quality of the restoration is so good that it looks and sounds like the movie was filmed yesterday. Brilliant work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite movies.","review":"As a history buff of the Second World War watching history come alive on the screen is a thrill. This is one of the few historically accurate movies that you will see. The actors bring the real life characters, that they portray, to life. If you like history and action then you should have this movie in your library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tora Tora Tora!","review":"Excellent Classic masterfully recording on DVD. A must for the collector of the classic WWII films."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tiger! Tiger! Tiger!","review":".....That was the signal to attack on Dec, 07. ..This is probably the BEST movie concerning this subject. Gripping & exciting all the way through. I much prefer finding out what the Japaneese are thinking and doing, in the days & weeks before this brillant sneak attack,.... than have a verry slow and corny love triangle provide the prologue for an exciting snapshot in history. If you haven't seen it by now, order now!! You won't be dissappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tora! Tora! Tora!","review":"One of the best 'factual' war movies out there. It has become a ritual for me to see, this movie near the anniversary of the Pearl Harbour disaster. There is no love story, no other distraction. Just what happened (well mostly). All actors did well, in portraying there parts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can not wait","review":"Just made my order today on Amazon for the blu ray.Have this on vcd, dvd, vhs and I also think it was on betamax.Not sure if anyone can put me right here, but I thought I may have seen this movie in a cinema in the UK on what they then called the wide screen.Some cinemas in the UK at that time would adertise the show as a wide screen production and I remember the curtains would open really wide as if they surrounded the cinema.Aftet that is was wow for a great experiance if like me you liked to view from what we called the gods, the upper circle.Anyway looking forward after great reviews to see it on my blu ray system.I will come back and review my total experiance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Factual to a Fault","review":"Ever wonder why hollywood directors take so many liberties when making a war movie? In my opinion, this film provides a more than adequate answer.Granted, the attack scene is very well executed, with special effects that are impressive even today. But the rest of the film is dry and soulless. The characters spout dialogue that sounds like it was taken out of a college history textbook word for word.If you want an impressive factual account of Dec. 7 and the preceeding events, then check out the two DVD History Channel documentary. If you want to see an entertaining Pearl Harbor film that is true to the essence of the 1940's, see Michail Bay's Pearl Harbor.Of course, if you fall in between those two extremes, then Tora Tora Tora just might be the one for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"TORA! TORA! TORA! is...","review":"BORING! BORING! BORING! And hopelessly jingoistic as well; you best bet might be to join in about two-thirds of the way through this mess!

A let-down that was hyped to rival PATTON."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bora Bora Bora","review":"Just received this DVD and was very disappointed, after reading all the other customer reviews. The Wide Screen format was hard to watch, and not nearly wide enough, and the story was basically slow, boring, and basically no character development. I should have just rented it. Quite a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"no effort","review":"Nintendo have put absolutly no effort into this game, they've just taken an old classic and thrown it in a gameboy cartridge. The worst problem is that there is no save, there are 100 levels and you can't even save! So you've got to sit down and play for 5 hours in order to finish the game. At first the game is really fun with all the old moves and characters but it so ... repetetive it's not funny. With the exeption of a few buildings all the levels are pretty much the same for 100 levels. What a shame this could have been really good.

They are junk! They should be classified as irregulars. On one set the edging is different widths, not a little different. It's off by 5 inches! A different set had 1 pillowcases stitches come out after washing and they shrunk a little bit but it was enough that my regular sized pillows don't fit in them anymore. My mother in law is not at all impressed with her set either.So save your money...don't buy these sheets"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Construction","review":"I purchased this set because of the low price and photos. They look nice, feel comfortable and seem to fit well but the stitching on the hems began unraveling after the first washing and will require mending before they are used again, the rest of the stitching looks like it will be unraveling soon. I would not recommend these sheets. Joe"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Nice! Happy!","review":"I have washed these sheets a few times and after reading the reviews on here, I checked out the stitching. I have no problems! It could have better stitching on the flat sheet.

We had a newer Kenmore on the first floor, and a dirt cheap Dirt Devil on the second floor. After a couple of weeks, we loved the features on the Hoover so much we made it our primary unit on the first floor and demoted the Dirt Devil to the basement. All the controls are operated by foot, cleaning the canister is a snap, and the retractable cord is great; vacuuming has become much less of a chore now.The only negative is that the beater bar doesn't have a shut off option; I always worry about burning carpet or scuffing the hardwood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst buy ever from Amazon","review":"I bought this vaccum after reading many 5 star reviews on Amazon. However, I am totally disappointed in quality & functionality of this vacuum. Within 3 months, this vacuum started falling apart. First, bin cover broke, followed by other parts. Please do yourself a favor and don't buy this piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavy, bulky, yet delicate.","review":"I found the thing as heavy as any machine I've ever used, but was pleased, at first, with the pick up, and lack of having to deal with shopping for the appropriate bag replacements. On the third use, however, I ran over a computer cord and when I pulled it out, usually nothing major, the rolling brush stopped rolling, and the sucking action was reduced to almost nothing. This thing is much too heavy and bulky to be so darn delicate. I am currently waiting for a replacement, and will live with my mistake, but certainly wouldn't recommend it, especially for a woman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy","review":"Should give 0 stars or even negative. Doesn't clean well at all. Didn't pick up even half the dirt that my old vaccum (which was also Hoover) used to pick. Had to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"I was so please with this vaccuum when I first bought it. I have a golden retriever and a long haired chihuahua and it sucked up the hair very well. The bad thing was though that I had to change the bucket like 5 times everytime I vacuumed just one room. I have had this vaccuum about 5 months now and I swear it wont pick up anything! I have tried it on every setting and it rolls up little balls ofhair and wont suck anything up. I am very unhappy with this vacuum, dont waste your money. !!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hoover 5507-900 Elite Rewind Upright","review":"This vacuum could be a nice product. I will never know because the BELT buned out the first day."},{"rating":"2","title":"This vacuum is GREAT","review":"Wanted to say it \\"sucks\\" but not in the slang sense! It has tremendous suction power, is easy to handle, lots of on-board tools, it's what I've been looking for. I am giving away a Eureka stick vac, only a year old, that's the opposite of this one. It was so loud I had to wear ear protectors when using it! And it had lousy suction. This oneHoover U5507-900 Elite Rewind Bagless Uprightisn't silent, but it's bearable. Emptying it is easy. The cord reel is a nice touch too. Handy. It's only its first day but it's a keeper!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"buy a Dyson","review":"worked for about a month, now it barely picks up anything. If I could have rated it a 0, I would have. My advice, spend a bit more and buy a better product."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"Be careful if you purchase this product. The price is decent, but you have to keep it moving or it could cause damage to flooring. I luckily read about this issue from a reviewer who damaged the floor when letting the vacuum sit on unprotecting flooring while using the accessories. I vacuumed new but inexpensive carpeting with it and the amount of carpet fibers in the container blew my mind. Even at the highest setting. It is pretty heavy, and if you leave it sit for more than 10-15 seconds on a single spot it could cause damage. Use the highest setting on carpeting and keep it moving."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanted to like it, but...","review":"I wanted to like this vacuum because it has all the basics right. It has the attachments you would expect, including a pet hair vacuum for the extension. It's bagless and the canister is easy to empty and clean. The filters are also easy to remove and clean. It was cheap. It has good sucking power... at least at first.No matter how much I cleaned the filters, this vacuum would not suck anymore. It only lasted about a year. I took apart the filters and made sure they were spotless. I didn't see any other blockages or stuck parts. It just lost all its power! I even took it in for repair, and they said it was worthy of the dumpster.If you have a lot of pet hair, don't get this vacuum. I'd only recommend it if you want something cheap and you don't vacuum that often. Otherwise, get a nice, heavy-duty vacuum from someone like Riccar."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it","review":"Bought this in December 08, we use it like anyone would, cleaning 1-2 times per week. the unit started making noise, then smelled, I pulled the bottom cover off and discovered the that the bearings that support the beater bar are made of felt, and had self destructed. I know $ 89 is cheap for a vacuum, i guess you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT VACUUM CLEANER","review":"This is the second bagless vacuum cleaner and is far superior to the other model. Best features are start, rewind cord and naturally the beater can be operated with foot.It has real good suction, lightweight and colorful, if you happen to care.Amazon refused to commit to two day delivery, though I have primer and a previous customer pointed out in a review that the Hoover had been received within three days.Despite Amazon declining to promised delivery within three days, it arrived in three days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible vacuum. Do not buy.","review":"We bought our first Hoover and are so disappointed with the product. It worked twice. The first time it was absolutely incredible. A little loud, but I can deal with the noise. It picked everything up great. A week later, I vacuumed the house again. Granted there is nothing special with our carpet. Just a plain carpet, I turned it on, began vacuming. After about 5 minutes I began to smell burning. It was coming from the vacuum. We contacted Amazon , who are absolutely wonderful with their return policy, and acquired another one since everyone gave it amazing reviews. Again, the first time, it was amazing. The second time I used it, the turning carpet brush part underneath the vacuum just stopped turning and it no longer sunctioned. Do not buy!!! I will never buy anything from Hoover again. Two vacuums in a row broke? No good."},{"rating":"1","title":"not great at all","review":"at first i was happy with it but after a month of using it on normal conditions it just didnt pick up much and made a loud noise. took it to a service company and they wernt able to get rid of the loud noise. the connecting part for the canister broke so it has to be ducted taped and have to take it apart to clean it out. the only great thing about it, is the rewind cord. obviously im on amazon to look for a better vacuum. i bought hoover for the quality but its just not in this machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it! And for only a fraction of the cost of a high-end Dyson!","review":"If you've ever been fortunate enough to have had a high-end $500 Dyson Animal, there's pretty much no going back ever again. When circumstances led me to part with my Dyson, I looked for a replacement with all the same functions: bagless, HEPA filter, hose - all the important basic stuff. And this had it all! Same features, same ease of use, but at only 1/5th of the cost! The only difference seemed to be the power: the suction in a Dyson is almost hurricane-like. This one, while still respectable, isn't as strong. It's lightweight, and medium duty in terms of cleaning power. I've been very happy with my purchase and would recommend this highly to others who're thinking of taking the plunge for a quality vacuum at an affordable price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mine didn't last 3 years","review":"Mine is no longer usable due to a ridiculously cheap design flaw. Where the brush roll assembly hooks into the nozzle cover assembly, it is held in place by thin plastic molding. I belt broke (normal), but I guess it was too strong because it ripped the brush roll assemble through the plastic slots. Now the only way to repair is a complete disassembly of the vacuum and a new $50+ cover.No thanks. Would not buy again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goes through belts every time you vaccuum","review":"This machine stinks! (I would say it sucks, but it actually DOESN'T!) I've had it 3 years, and have replaced the belt at least 10 times. Like other reviewers stated, the belts were installed properly and working correctly. Then, all of a suddden, POP! there goes another one! The suction has been mediocre, and lately it just seems to blow dust everywhere. The rewind feature is awesome, but other than that it really is terrible. I've only kept it this long, because my hubby is too cheap to get me a new one. Can't wait to replace it soon though!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very powerful","review":"We have had this vacuum for about 2 years and it is very powerful. It's also easy to clean with no bags, I just throw the dust out and wash it out. It is a bit heavy and some of the attachments are constantly falling off. But on the flip side the attachments are very powerful as well and suck everything up quickly. I use it on my hardwood floors too."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Big Drawback","review":"Not a bad vacuum for the money (decent suction power) and the cannister is easy to empty because it's a bottom drop style; however, putting the cap back on top of the filter cannister is a royal pain in the backside. It's secured by a twist-lock style, but I spend more time trying to lock it back in place than I do vacuuming, and that's no exaggeration. Furthermore, my attempts to replace the top (which should be quite easy) cause my hands to be covered in vacuum dust. It's a source of frustration that prolongs the chore of vacuuming. For this reason alone, I would not buy this vacuum cleaner a second time. The other problem I have with this product is that the attachments, when not in use, fall of the body of the vacuum. They're simply not well-secured in place, and I'm constantly having to bend over and pick them up. Grrr."},{"rating":"2","title":"great value","review":"We purchased two of these vacuums - one for our daughter and one for ourselves. This vacuum is a great buy. It does a wonderful job on pet hair and day to day dirt. I was very surprised at how many times I had to empty it since our older vacuum, a hoover wind tunnel, seemed to be doing a good job. My only complain after a few weeks of use would be a wish for a longer cord. I really like the auto-rewind feature and the ese of emptying the cannister. Would definitely recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mine did not last even one year","review":"I liked the vacuum at first, easy to empty and use. I only have a rugs on my hard floor in the bedrooms and the living room, so it did not get used like someone who had carpets throughout the house. It began to overheat and would shut off. I have only had it about 6 months. Not worth the $$ I paid.Unhappy in Texas"},{"rating":"1","title":"CAREFUL this vac will damage your rugs !!! !!! PLEASE READ","review":"hi. prettty good vac for the money, but the beater bar does not turn off when you are using the tools, if you leave it in one spot for too long, it will damage your rug(s). So move it to hardwood floors or lay it down. I called Hoover to inquire why they would make such a huge blunder when designing this product, and the customer service rep told me that the higher priced hoover models have this feature, and that I get what i paid for. Very very rude ! I have a Dyson also, which was way way WAY overpriced, broken, and does not have a height adjustment, which will damage antique oriental rugs."}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:M,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},B={class:"card-container"},W=["disabled"],N={key:0},H={key:1};function x(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",B,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",H,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",N,"See more"))],8,W)):b("",!0)])}const C=d(O,[["render",x],["__scopeId","data-v-2384dc3f"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/14.md","filePath":"drive/14.md"}'),R={name:"drive/14.md"},P=Object.assign(R,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(C)]))}});export{L as __pageData,P as default};
