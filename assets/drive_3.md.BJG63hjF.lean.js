In the beginning it starts out like any country in a war, but later it delves deeper. The world being controlled by three super-powers that (if you read to Goldstein's book) would supposedly, and I agree, would gain absolutly nothing from all this. The are simply trying to use excess junk. Anyways, Orwell did an amazing job on this book, creating several radically new ideas for the time, including creating Newspeak, Big Brother (which was the basis for the show \\"Big Brother\\"), and, the worst, Thoughtcrime. Anyways, this is DEFINATELY not a childs book, so you should keep it out of the hands of anyone ignorant to the world. It makes you think of the present, and the future. If you like Orwell's books you'll LOVE Animal Farm."},{"rating":"2","title":"1984 defines our distrust for government","review":"The book is a fantastic read of Orwell's projection of a future in which three totalitarian governments (all equivalent) rule the earth. I would say the book has two sections, the story, which follows an Outer Party member's struggle to rebel, and philosophy, which is Big Brother's Manifesto (or, one could say, Goldstein's but really they are one and the same). The book puts the story on hold when Winston, the protagonist, reads the manifesto; I would say that there is flow problem with the abrupt nature of this switch. Certainly the Manifesto is endemic to the book and provides another perspective and history of the rise of Oceania, the state in which Winston lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"1984- More than just philospohy","review":"When you finish reading 1984, you don't know what to do with yourself for the next couple of hours. The themes of the novel are so thought provoking and powerful that it leaves you stupefied. However, the book is more than just a philosophical message. One of the reasons that Orwell's message is so powerful is because the characters are rich and the plot (forbidden love in a loveless world) is captivating. Not only did Orwell have some incredibly penetrating ideas, but he knew how to express them in a very well written story. 5 out of 5!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating","review":"Although I used to read books all the time (mostly teen series like the Baby-Sitters Club), I rarely find one these days that I can stand to read for more than 10 minutes. A few, however, I have been unable to put down and one of those is 1984. This book compelles the reader to think, something so few people do today. It is incredibly frightening to think about living in such a tightly controlled society where one cannot even hold one's own opinions! To live without love and sex and opinions or emotion of any kind is truly terrifying. The book is so enthralling, I could not finish it the first 2 times I read it. Imagining the depths of the Ministry of Love and thinking about what would await me in my own personal Room 101 gave me nightmares. No other book has produced such an effect on me. It doesn't matter how accurate he was about communism or whether or not communism is really bad. The fact remains that it is a wonderfully written and incredibly creative piece of work."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"this has got to be the greatest book i have ever read.it kept me in suspence to the very last.it can be taken on so many levels. the best thing about it is the ending, where unlike day of the triffids or any other contemperies,there is not one glimpse of hope which is better than \\"they live happily ever after\\" BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Big Brother is watching you\\" turns real","review":"I read a article about Spycams in MLK Jr holiday.

I will resist the temptation to make my review the shortest one here by saying that I think that 1984, for all of its literary value must be regarded as one of the greatest literary works of all time. The way in which George Orwell composes his purposeful sentences makes us reminisce of the style of Daniel Defoe. Here is a book, similar to Brave New World and We which shows what we may be coming to. A definite read. I couldn't put it down for a moment."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was a good book with an unfortunate ending.","review":"The entire book was good up until the last chapter, at least in my opinion. Without giving out the ending, I didn't feel that Orwell used the characteristics of his character well. Maybe I'll need to re-read the book to understand the true meaning of the book because I didn't get it in my first try.

I have really dark under eye circles and this does camouflage them somewhat, but not how I had hoped. Instead of covering them, it seems to change their shade. Kind of like as if I were painting and rubbed white paint on a black spot, turning it grey. Get what I mean? It also looks really CAKEY! It could be because I have really dry skin, but not even with moisturizer + primer does it stop looking cakey.I'm returning this for my money back. That's primarily why I bought it here.

I did not see the problems that others have reported with the light not turning off or shoddy construction.Cons: The breeze it produces is fairly weak and diffuse. It is also fairly noisy (from a rattle, not from the wind). I bought a 5\\" O2 brand fan which is smaller, quieter and more effective. The O2 has the disadvantage (to me) of taking two D-size batteries but I was able to get a few hours out of it using AA batteries with up-sizing adapters. I thought the built-in light on the Wenzel would be nice but it seems that I usually don't want the fan and light pointing in the same direction. It would make more sense to have a separate light."},{"rating":"1","title":"CRAPPY FAN, DECENT LIGHT....","review":"I ordered this fan for a recent camping trip, and never got to use the fan.

The only good thing about this film, as a matter of fact, was Huppert's performance of a woman coming undone. She lives her relatively closed (and closely monitored by her live-in mother) life as a piano teacher, and everything seems stern, put together (except for this bizarre relationship with her mother, who controls everything). And then Huppert's much-younger student begins to pursue her. By the time Huppert succumbs, she is unraveling. At the same time, the movie unravels with her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless Movie!!","review":"I was sold when I saw how many ratings this proclaimed 5 star movie it had received but to my disappointment, it was just a waste of time and money. If you really want to see a good movie about a piano or pianist with a good story to it then I recommend \\"The Piano\\".This movie was somewhat sickening and pointless. There was no real good story behind the movie. Just 2 puzzling demented sicko's who's only purpose was to make you vomit and throw that movie away. I'd like to give a synopsis about the movie but the truth is, is that there's really no good plot to talk about a synopsis.Do yourself a favor and skip this movie. You'll save time and money. Not all 5 star movies have earned their stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie sucks","review":"This movie was crap. It boasts of a journey of submission and tale of D/s.

An old teacher living together with her mum, whom she hates, very blunt loud dialogues between them, why does an independent self supporting lady stay there at all, ridiculous..I was very, very disappointed of actress Huppert's role, it was not her fault, that she had so little to do or say, eg in that scene on the public toilet.E. Jelinek's story was either not transported or is it really so far away from real life, or sex, or even perverse perversion?I did not even try to find out, too much time spent on that already. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Movie Of All Time","review":"This is the number one worst movie I have ever seen. I usually love French films and enjoy the unprudish and free attitude in most of them, but this one went too far. I wanted to leave the theatre, but I was too transfixed in horror to move. I gagged, I winced, I covered my eyes, but still I couldn't move. After the torture was finally over I felt shellshocked and needed to go home and watch The Lion King to recover. It was a glimpse into the world of a sad, demented, and twisted character that I did not need to see. There was no point to this movie and I felt that it existed purely for shock value with no lesson, point or true plot. If you value your time do not watch this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding me?","review":"I watched this film a few years ago, and like The Secretary, it was a truly bad film.

The whole movie was just too disturbing for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"From A Music Teacher!","review":"This film is outstanding, but I can't imagine the general public liking this movie. I'm in the classical music world and understand the music conservatory life. All the acting is wonderful. I would say not to watch this movie if you really don't know the music world and not like kinky stuff. I do understand why some people get bored with this. But to me I can really feel how my life would be over if my teacher put glass in my coat pocket to injure my hands so I'll never play again! That was the most terrible part for me to watch!Trust your own judgement. If you don't like the plot, the music is beautiful and they use great musicians."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected Or Even Close","review":"The acting was good for what it was.

This movie is criticized as being devoid of content, except for it's graphic sexual and violent content. I would disagree with this viewpoint. I think of it more as a study of mental illness. The film is highly unpredictable and very well made. I loved the music in the film as well. I personally didn't get the impression the filmmaker was attempting to make any broad-sweeping philosophical statements or moral pronouncements, as its critiques on this website are suggesting. Its simply a bizarre, somewhat disturbing movie that is very well made and interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misses the Mark","review":"I have to disagree with other reviewers who have heaped praise and many stars on this movie which I found to be art house at it's least pleasing. You will have seen words like, dark, brooding, disturbing thrown around like confetti, when in truth the movie simply does not deliver. What leaves an sour taste in the mouth is not the disturbed main character, nor the semi graphic sexual scenes, but mainly a very very compelling film that ends abruptly, if not predictably leaving the viewer feeling cheated. Is it well made? yes - well acted? sure - but like so many of these \\"critically acclaimed\\" dramas it's missing one vital thing. Most stories have a beginning, middle and an end - and this just leaves you hanging after nearly two hours, saying \\"What?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond Weirdness","review":"This subtitled film portrays the emotional deterioration and sexual perversions of an otherwise gifted and attractive professor of music.

Needless-to-say, a bit on the depressing side."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite funny","review":"Deadly accurate too, especially the mother stuff.

The tension and psychosis which built but never held interest, created empathy, or suspended self, finally erupted into a confusing condonning of rape.

Your time would be better spent watching lint form in the dryer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious bore","review":"Ok. So Isabelle Huppert was brave in doing some of the things she does in this.

I hated this movie in the shallow way it demonized bdsm culture, much as Irreversible demonized gay men.I was suprised that a young carefree boy in love would suddenly turn judgemental when the object of his affections, his teacher no less, provided instructions for him to please her. I had difficulty making that leap. I was not surprised that a pianist, being a tactile creature, would chose manual engagement for arousal.I thought the scene where Huppert pulled that little box of personal delights from beneath her bed had the greatest amount of compassion and empathy in the film. It was heartbreaking to see how small her world truly was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mostly quite good.","review":"The book has many very good points and suggestions for educators to deal with difficult parents.

That said, in my opinion, Alec Guinness is completely unconvincing as an oriental, even though he is one of the most celebrated actors of all time. Couldn't they have found a real Chinese guy to play the part? But the cantankerous Rosalind Russell was perfect for her role, and played it to the hilt.

Some of the dialog by the daughter and son-in-law comes across as dated and stilted, but the performances by Guinness and Russell eclipse everything else, bringing to life a lovely story that reminds us that youth, despite its \\"modernity,\\" isn't wiser or smarter than experience and minds that are willing to change and grow.I'm so glad this film has finally been put on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"a majority of one","review":"I've loved this movie forever...watched my old VHS so much that it was beginning to look like a moth eaten rug!As 'Bertha' says [played by Rosiland Russell], \\"It's like a Travel-log!\\"...a very interesting peek at the post-WWIIprocess of Japanese/American cultural assimilation as seen from the American perspective.Being a 'Trekkie' forever, too...see if you can 'spot' a young George Takei! And, Mr Takei reported in his marvelousAutobiography that Sir Alec Guinness had an awful Japanese 'accent'... to which I say = unless you're Japanese,you'll never know it....It's just great Guinness, great Russell, great Takei, other great character actors = a marvelous film!I decidid to 'treat' myself to a new movie...DVD this time...for many more years of enjoyment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"A Majority of one\\"","review":"I have been a big fan of the movie \\"A Majority of One\\" for many years. I have a \\"tape\\" of the movie, but was thrilled when the movie came out on DVD. Rosalind Russell is superb. The interaction between Rosalind and Alec Guiness is extremely pleasurable to watch from the time they met on the ship to their relationship in Japan. The scenes with Rosalind dressed in the Japanese Kimono were priceless. The ending was extremely enjoyable leaving the audience to draw its own conclusion on where their relationship would go."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Majority Of One","review":"This movie is a Classic!

I am so glad that is finally available on DVD. Thank you Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please someone stop me thinking that Green Thoughts is GREAT","review":"I found this cd through some random thrift shop pillaging and have been praising the heavens ever since. Green Thoughts is one of those albums that are so amazingly catchy and beautiful to the ears you have to listen to it on repeat ten-thousand times over.The tracks on Green Thoughts focus around heartache but despite their emo-esque titles (i.e. Drown In My Own Tears, Deep Black, If The Sun Dosen't Shine) its amazingly accessible 1987 vibe puts across more than just the loneliness of a relationship gone sour. Green Thoughts is The Car's with soul and and Elvis Costello with power chords.If you happen to be looking for an album with some beautiful melody and heartfelt lyrics, Green Thoughts is where it's at. It really is incredible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great band!","review":"Video killed the Radio Star. If this music came out in 1968, this band would have been a headline act. However in the MTV world, if your not pretty, you don't play.

On the box it says over 3 hours of tracks, but none of the CDs lasts over an hour. That, and the fact that it appears like it was made by some amateur over the Web with various soundbytes snipped together (I'm exaggerating) are my biggest complaints.Only some of the tracks are even worth listening to. At first I found the dialogue somewhat fascinating, but it quickly faded into trite without much replay value. And beware, for some of the tracks are not even Beatle-related, it's just music from that time period.And I'm a big Beatles fan. My favourite albums are the White Album & Abbey Road."},{"rating":"1","title":"Delightful Short Animates Stories for Young Children","review":"This is a delightful set of four short stories about the magic of Christmas.Each short is animated in either vivid color or black and white. 30 min. total playing time. Each has its own personality and charm. The stories can be used for discussion about Christmas between parents or teachers and young children. There is freshness in each. Few opportunities exist to share a Christmas story classic that is very short and talk about it with young folks. Makes them excitingly aware of the famed comic figure Howdy Doody and animation in fun terms.I watched it from the viewpoint of both a young child and parent. Four **** for delight and colorful fun that often brings out the smiles in young silent children otherwise prone to remain quiet. At a low price too. Not worth the new VHS price.Four Stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"monsters1.exe has encountered a problem and needs to close\\"","review":"I kept getting the following error on Windows 2000\\"monsters1.exe has encountered a problem and needs to close\\" when launching Disney/Pixar's Mike's Monstrous Adventure (Windows 2000)All my drivers are the latest.

I ended up having to return it unfortunately. sorry"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very positive book","review":"I bought this book to read to my son's first grade class for Valentine's Day. I was disappointed with the book to say the least. Every character that Louanne \\"investigates\\" as her possible secret admirer reacts to her very negatively. I think the story could have been told without shouting, name calling, food being dumped on her head and knockng her down. I would have much preferred more positive outcomes from each inquiry she made and don't think it would have detracted from the story at all. In a day and age when we lack positive role models and struggle with ill mannered children, a book that reinforces that these behaviors exist and are acceptable is a disappointment. The only saving grace of this book is that it presents an opportunity to teach and emphasize that these behaviors are not acceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"0 STARS: Total GARBAGE!!","review":"This is one sorry, cheap, low-budget and total garbage of a so-called horror flick! I mean the acting is atrocious in this thing!!!! This is a very poor and total disgrace of an addition to the slasher sub-genre!!! What a sad day it is for the horror genre when trash like this is made, let alone actually sold to any innocent victim! I can't say enough about how sorry this movie is. \\"Tower of Blood\\" is just pure rubbish!!The movie follows a familiar script, typical slasher flick format, but the acting is so bad, the film is so poorly executed and the movie is just so completely lacking in style that even the the most unsophisticated of horror movie fans will just laugh or cry (depending on how much you paid for it) after watching this trash. This is total amateuristic rubbish and is not worth a penny!"},{"rating":"1","title":"the bottom below the false bottom of the barrel","review":"This movie just barely goes through the motions of all the other movies it's ripping off.

Rock bottom."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star and that is being gracious!","review":"Bad acting, bad script, uncoordinated wardrobe, and pathetic \\"special effects\\". I'm glad this came in a 2 pack with a decent film and didn't cost any more the the one by itself. I have been watching horro and suspence films for the majority of my life and this one goes on the top of the realy bad list. That is why I say giving it one star is gracious. stay away if you want to keep your IQ."},{"rating":"1","title":"More like \\"Tower of Feces\\"!!!","review":"This was a pretty damn boring movie. Thank god I did not buy it, for I would be rather angry at myself. Boring plot, boring actors, you can probably see where I'm going with this. They couldn't even throw any gore into the movie for at least something to watch. I guess that would have put them over budget. I will say that I thought the cover art looked pretty cool, which is why I rented it in the first place. So overall, I would not recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"not proof read","review":"This book may be fine for someone that already understand web production but it is very frustrating for someone just starting out. There are numerous mistakes throughout. Examples are explained and then demonstrations of don't match the explanation. Some of the examples don't work because the syntax is incorrect. If you don't all ready know how to use the commands explained in this book you will spend most of your time experimenting to correct the mistakes presented in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to return it","review":"Unfortunately I had to return the Blue Ant because I couldn't charge it without the cycle turning itself off.

It's a heating pad you wrap around the bottle and how is it supposed to heat a bottle if your hands are warmer than the wrap? It took over 45 minutes to take a cold bottle to even room temp (we used Playtex Ventaires) and by then you might as well have just left it sit at room temp. Useless product. We now take a thermos of heated water and a jar and heat our bottles in the the jar. Cheaper, faster and even more portable. I wish I'd still had the receipt for this thing, I couldn't figure out any use for it so we tossed it. What a waste of money and landfill space :("},{"rating":"1","title":"it is a joke","review":"this bottle warmer is just a joke. It takes forever to warm a cold bottle up. I say \\" forever\\", it is forever. When I checked the power, it is only 13W.

Huge waste of money!!!1"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't overheat your bottle!","review":"The Munchkin bottle warmer is quite easy to use, and does a terrific job warming bottles. In fact, it really can get too hot. If used strictly according to directions, this bottle warmer does the trick, albeit a bit slowly. I learned the hard way that it can also melt bottles. If you start from a cold bottle, it takes some time to warm it up to an appropriate temperature, more time than my hungry son will tolerate. Instead, I used it as a way of keeping an already warm bottle heated in the car until my son is ready for it. Unfortunately, this resulted in a carful of acrid smoke, a lump of melted plastic, and a black hole in his bottle as I was driving one day. If used appropriately, ie by checking the bottle frequently and turning the warmer off when warm enough, the warmer works well. However, resist the temptation to use it as I did, as a longer-term warmer."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd pass on this one","review":"This bottle warmer seemed like a great idea--it was great to take the chill of a cold bottle. But the fact that it can start smoking and melt the bottle, like it did for me today, makes it not worth the convenience and dangerous. I'd seriously pass on this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cannot be used with Playtex Nurser Bottles","review":"I was very disappointed to get this product and find out that it cannot be used with Playtex Nurser bottles."},{"rating":"1","title":"So HOT it caught on FIRE!!!","review":"Purchased this item and it caught on fire during its first use. I had it plugged in for about 3 minutes when my sons bottle and product caught on fire. I do not recommend this item. When I called the company they requested that I spend my own money to return the item and if they found that it was a mechanical failure they would replace the item only after I paid shipping. When I asked about my bottle they said their was nothing they could do about my loss. (Fire had caused the bottle lid to fuse to the bottom)This product is not worth a penny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't warm at all!!","review":"It seems like all of the reviews on here had problems with this warmer from one extreme to the other! My problem was that the warmer didn't warm the bottles at all. At one point, I left it plugged in for more than 30 minutes and it did almost nothing, which of course is unacceptable when you've got a hungry infant! Wouldn't bother with this one again and I recommend that anyone thinking of buying it doesn't waste their money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I purchased this in hopes of (like everyone else) having something that would warm a cold bottle in the car fairly quickly. This is NOT the product for the job! It takes forever, and actually makes the bottle too hot to handle without warming the milk much at all. The outside of the warmer gets way hot, too. Definitely a danger to you and children to touch. Luckily I have not had the problem some others have had with it melting my bottle, but I am not going to use it again to risk that!! In fact, I think the company needs to be notified so they will recall this product before someone gets hurt!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Takes FOREVER","review":"I noticed some reviews saying this bottle warmer got so hot, it started fires. Well in our case it didn't. We got this because we had a newborn the week of Thanksgiving, and it gets really cold here between Oct-March, and being on the go frequently for the holidays, thought it would be a nice convenience to heat bottles in the car. After 45 minutes, the bottle wasn't even room temperature. I could have gotten it hotter placing it in my hands, or between my thighs. I thought maybe it wasn't placed correctly and didn't depress the activation button, gave it a few more tries but it never worked well.With the unpredictability of this product, between fire-starting the other reviews have stated and not even doing a darn thing in my case, I wouldn't get it. Very disappointed because now with 3 kids all under the age of 3, I have grown to like the Munchkin brand, but they really dropped the ball on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chilling & Fast Paced","review":"As of now, this is Leonard Goldberg's last book in the Joanna Blalock series and, in my opinion, the best yet. It deals with a very touchy subject: Smallpox & Terrorism and bits of 9/11 are added in the book as well. Joanna Blalock, a forensic pathologist at Memorial Hospital in Los Angeles is called in by the FBI to do a top secret autopsy of an unidentified man found murdered at LAX, Joanna and Jake fear that they are once again being pulled into another terrorist investigation; the previous one having nearly cost Joanna her life. While the investigation into the corpse's identity is in progress, another emergency intervenes when a man with symptoms of smallpox arrives at Memorial and everyone who has had contact with him is quarantined in the hospital's basement isolation center; including Joanna.Based on a scenario that has all the makings of a very real nightmare, Leonard Goldberg has put together a top notch medical thriller."},{"rating":"1","title":"My daughter think this is fun,but not that fun","review":"I bought this for my daugher on her birthday she liked the doll, but she did not love it.

After that the lyricism and delvery is pretty good but not the best it could be. This album is still very impressive though with some great beats and appearances by some of the best in the business. Overall this album is better than Young Joc and his attempt at rap or other wannabe rappers from the ATL. This album is definitely worth your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tha Dogg Pound","review":"This album absolutely sucked. They are still living off of Dr. Dre's scraps from '94. Seriously ever since Snoop sold out and became some wanna be 1970's style pimp, he has dropped off the map as far as importance to the rap game. Kurupt and Daz still have a little bit in the tank, but not enough to warrant buying this album. Anyone who says this album is good is only kidding themselves. Best advice: Keep away from this one and buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cali iz inactive","review":"Dont get it twisted. I used to love Dogg Pound when they dropped their best work DOGG FOOD. But ever since then Kurupt changed his style around and Daz has been slacking on the production. The only standout tracks are CALI IZ ACTIVE and KEEP IT GANGSTA(featuring Lady Of Rage) where Lady of Rage delivers a verse that makes these female rappers we have out now sound like pigeons cooing. Its all hood(featuring Ice Cube) might have been a standout track if it wasnt for the weak beat and the even weaker rhymes coming from the Dogg Pound. Filler: Its craccin all night(who the f*** in their right mind makes a song with PeeDoody?)Heavyweights(more like lightweights), Slow your roll, Make that p***y pop, She likes that and the rest of this album. Bottom Line: One of the lowlights of 2006 without question. Bland production and sophomoric lyrics and pathetic guest appearances describe this album in a nutshell. Pick up the classic Dogg Food and stay away from this tragedy of an album."},{"rating":"1","title":"title track was cool&then the rest is a Coaster","review":"Tha Dogg Pound was banging 10 years back,but they lost there Groove long ago. the flows are tired&there are too many hands on the Production end. seems to be going through the motions&hoping to catch somebody feeling the vibe,but you just can't recapture where things were at back in the day.

It has opened my horizons and gives me new hope for the future. The Purdues have laid out a road map on how to live longer and feel better.

Thanks a lot, Purdues!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I wouldn't bother with this one. Although I am a big fan of LPs guide books, this phrase-book was not particularly helpful. 9 times out of 10 they didn't have what I was looking for and when they did it was a real hassle to find. The pronunciation guide was not that helpful but the food section was good. If you already have the guidebook you could probably get by w/out this, but if you feel you need something, get a used copy over there(or maybe an Amazon auction.) If you do get fed up with it (as I did), it makes a very nice gift for a Thai friend. Next time I'll bring a pocket dictionary. Hope this helped."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother buying this one","review":"After traveling using a Berlitz phrasebook in Italy, I went to Thailand, and bought the only one available -- Lonely Planet. It is terrible.The tone markers don't make much sense. They are not intuitive.The Food section has something advertised as a \\"menu decoder\\" when it is really just the same section all over again. Compared to Berlitz's food section for Italy, the LP guide is rather lacking.The Dictionary section is very lacking. It doesn't even have all the words listed elsewhere. The index is the same way. It makes finding information in the phrasebook next to impossible.Unfortunately, this phrasebook has just been whipped out as a companion to LP's monopoly on guide books. Try to find something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot of useful info in a very small book","review":"This is a very compact book, easily carried in a shirt pocket. Which makes it all the more impressive considering the amount of information that is contains. My only real complaint of the book is that though it is organized into sections like \\"checking into a hotel\\" or \\"ordering food\\" it can sometimes be difficult to find the phrase you are looking for at the time you need it. However, after having made a few trips to Thailand now, I now realize how good this book is. What I would recommend is that you read through the book before you travel and highlight key phrases you think you might use. Normally, for a phrasebook that might be painful to try to read through it, but this book has a lot of interesting information on Thai culture, customs, food, history, etc. that it isn't simply a list of phrases or a dictionary. And if you are like me and a little slow to pick up languages, you will find the book even more useful after a few trips to Thailand."},{"rating":"2","title":"america the Beautiful","review":"this book works great for teaching the song.

The illustrations go very nicely with the words to the song."},{"rating":"1","title":"It really had potential, but....","review":"Although I am an avid Anne Rice fan, I initially bought this book because the back cover proclaimed it to be \\"the modern Story of O\\". Since Story of O is one of my favorite books in the genre of erotica, I just had to buy it, but then it seems that such sweeping claims hardly ever turn out to be true.... The book starts out strong, with intensely erotic scenes focusing on Lisa and Eliot and the beginnings of an interesting love story, but as the book progresses the characters seemed to become less and less realistic: by the time I finished it, I felt extremely unsatisfied. If you're an Anne Rice fan, this is a good book to read, if just to see how she fares in a genre other than horror, but overall there's much better erotica out there, and this book definitely does not live up to its claim of being as good as the Story of O."},{"rating":"1","title":"A harlequin romance set a sex club","review":"I found this book to be rather silly. Never mind that the protagonists work at sex club, they are just two crazy kids in love. If you want to read a traditional romance novel where the character's pasts as S and M enthusists are hinted at, this is your book. I was trully surprised at how convential this book was and expected more from Ann Rice. The ending was particularly silly and Harlequin-esq."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book!","review":"I'm a huge Anne Rice fan, and I bought this to add to my collection. She has a style of her own.

There are glimpses of BDSM but it is not \\"hardcore\\".Do not compare this book to the movie of the same name ~ The movie version is camped up & changed to make the story light & funny ~ The actual story in this book is not light and not funny, it is more of a complicated romance, between two people who don't realize how much they need each other.I thoroughly enjoyed this book and hopefully, you will too ~ and if you do, you may seriously want to pick up the Sleeping Beauty Trilogy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only if you liked the Movie","review":"If you have watch the film based on this novel more then once, then you'll find this book an interesting read. As usual film is very different from the novel, but this only makes it a good read if you are into S & M.Spoiler warning.Many of you probably want to read the chapter when Lisa was having sex Elliot. This is very different from the movie. In the novel Lisa is \\"doing him\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"hot","review":"Ann Rice writes erotica like no one else!! A must have for your library.

I expected Ann Rice to be a virtuoso. She turned out to be a hack with an anal fixation. The dialogue and narration is only slightly better written than Penthouse letters, and the effect is less erotic. The only reason I rated the book as high as I did is because it read quickly, so at least I didn't waste a lot of time getting through it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"This wasn't at all what I expected. Once I was done I understand what Anne was trying to do but while reading the book I was wondering what she was doing.It's not a bad book, just not what I expected.She spends lots of time spouting about why people become masochists. To be honest I wanted more of what went on in the club - not why they were there."},{"rating":"2","title":"A glimpse into the real world of s/m play.","review":"An extremely accurate view of the thoughts and feelings of people into the light s/m scene. Although the setting and plot are (most likely) fictional, Rice has done something here I've never seen before - realistically portray the eroticism and appeal of this sexual lifestyle. Much better than her over-the-top Beauty series.One flaw, though, was her tendency to hang people by their hands for long periods - definitely dangerous and never done by responsible \\"players\\". Don't try this one at home!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An erotic love story for Nineties.","review":"I enjoyed Exit to Eden for the simple reason that I love Anne Rice. But on a more specific note I would say that the character development really pulls you into the mystery of this island paradise/training facility. The subject matter is completely appropriate for the love story which unfolds towards the end of the book.I particularly like the way the book ends for the obvious \\"happy ending\\" reasons but also for the \\"bring you back down to earth\\" feeling it leaves you with, after being taken so far from reality it deposits you right back into everday life.Very enjoyable reading. Perfect for the beach or a rainy day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"Dissapointing compared to Anne Rices other works such as Interview With The Vampire. This story I found to be much to long and tedious. The concept of a \\"bondage vacation \\" was much to comical and contrived. If erotica is what you want to read pick up an Anais Nin book. Anybody that can read her work without starting to get a rapid heartbeat is gotta be senseless!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Be forewarned... this is NOT the movie!... THANK GOD","review":"A love story infinitely more readable than the Sleeping Beauty set, it delves deep into the human psyche, and attempts to explain how and why someone would choose BSDM as a lifestyle. Plenty of erotica, and a plot too! A great read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best work.","review":"I have read many of Anne Rice's books, including the books on the lives of the Mayfair Witches and Vampire Chronicles, and have loved every one. However, I was not impressed with Exit to Eden. I felt like the passion and literary talent evident in Anne Rice's writings was totally absent. I found it to be very harlequin-esque at some times, and pointlessly crude at others. I think the heart of good erotica is the ability to write in a way that transcends the immediacy of cheap porn. Unfortunately, Exit to Eden did not deliver.I plan on reading her Sleeping Beauty books in the hopes that they will be a better representation of Anne Rice's boundless talent.If you are looking for the sensual and dark romance of the Vampire Chronicles, or Lasher and Taltos, don't expect to find it here."},{"rating":"1","title":"One erotic passage in the entire book.","review":"I kept thinking that Elliot and Lisa would really get down and dirty at the \\"Club\\". Was I disappointed when they actually only had sex once, and in New Orleans to boot!!! I will say that the one time they did have sex was worth the price of the book. But the rest of it was very poorly written."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was extremely disappointed!","review":"The book just did not hold my interest very well. It was long and tedious, and I couldn't wait for it to be over. The characters were not believable nor were they erotic. They came across quite clown-ish. Anne Rice is an excellent writer, but from this novel you would never believe it."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Of The Worst Anne Rice Books!","review":"I have to say that this is one of the worst novels that she has ever written. I just didn't think that it was that entertaining. After finishing the book, I went out and rented the movie, and It is far better than this novel. I am sorry Anne rice, but I can see why you used a pseudo name when you wrote this book. It stinks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"some books suffer from abridgement","review":"The abridgement of this otherwise wonderfully delightful and wickedly sensual book is a huge disappointment. There was little of the drama nor the depth of character found in the actual novel. I read this book years ago and found it quite profound. The tape, which barely last 1.5 hours covers none of the motivation, the anticipation nor the quality of Rice's intentions for placing the characters in this specific situation and performing these activities. Incredibly shallow reading by both actors, also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected...","review":"This book wasn't what I expected; never read an Anne Rice, but after reading what others had written, thought I'd buy a book of hers.Should have saved my money; this story was too far-fetched.

Luckily I checked it out at the library, so I did not spend the money on it. It was filth, trash, and poorly written at that. I wanted the erotic sensations like the vampires get when drinking blood. Instead I got nothing but sorry, flabby writing that went nowhere. If the book had belonged to me, I would have burned it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disallusion","review":"I am by no means a prude but I find no interest in women or men \\"whipping\\" someone for reasons I can't fathom. To dicipline, arouse ,or to train them; it escapes me. Too 'kinky' for my taste. In all fairness, I never made it past the first few chapters either in this book or the first of Sleepy Beauty's triology. The theme was obvious. I will assume there is a message in these books but I didn't care to find it. I gave this 1 star because it was required to submit the review. Rereading this, this review DOES make me SOUND like a prude! In synopsis, if you like whips and chains and that sort of thing, you like the book; if not don't waste your money. I don't even want to donate them to our local library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Sleeping Beauty","review":"I bought this book because I thought it would be similar to her \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" series. It isn't even close. This is more romance novel than BDSM, and even then the romance is a little cheesy.If you want a romance novel, go ahead and get this book. If you are looking for good BDSM, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let down...","review":"It's not as erotic or engrossing as I thought it would be. There are parts where it begins to get really sensual, but then it ends rather abruptly or doesn't continue long enough for things to develop. Try the Sleeping Beauty novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetically bad!","review":"This is some of the worst trash I have ever had the misfortune to listen to. The language is overwrought, the plot far-fetched and shallow, and even the readers sounded embarrassed to be involved in the project. However, it did make me laugh out loud quite often. Maybe the book was better. For a good S&M story, try Alasdair Gray's \\"Something Leather\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Magical Adventure","review":"Anita Jeram's book, I Love My Little Storybook, is a favorite of my 6-year-old son. The illustrations are magical and whimsical. As a reader or a listener, it's easy to wish yourself into this magical world of adventure. It's a wonderful bedtime story and has become a favorite to give as a gift to other children and expectant mothers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vexx is very good","review":"I bought this game based off other reviews here and found it at a used game place(...). Like many of the reviews have already mentioned, this game is excellent! Movement, jumping, fighting, flying, etc is very well done. The variety of worlds and skills required to complete the tasks is daunting, yet fun. Some of the goals can be very difficult to figure out, let alone complete, so I would see younger children having a hard time figuring out more than about half of this game. My favorite thing about the game is the variety of each world. My least favorite thing is the occasional camera problem where it won't allow to look where you want look, but that is a minor nuisance and shouldn't discourage anyone from purchasing this game. Overall, this is one my top 5 Xbox games. It's fun, it's challenging, and it takes a long time to complete."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game","review":"This game would get 5 *s if it wasn't so...hard! You see, there are 10 goals that need completed in each level, in any order, but they are by no means easy in any way. You can just do the easy ones at first, to get to the first couple boards. But then the goals just get difficult to the point where playing any longer becomes a horror. Plus, you have to start over from the very beginning every time you complete a goal. It is also tough to figure out what the goals actually ARE. They are stated in the form of 4-line \\"poems\\" that can be accessed at any time by pressing the BACK button.This game is not racy in-and-of itself, but is rated \\"T\\" because of the extreme plot line. You are a young bat (stay with me) whose parents were killed by a king, so now you vow deadly revenge on the ruler, and I'm guessing that your quest is to kill him and take over as king.It's a fun time, and a recommended title; if you are willing to devote a WHOLE lotta hours on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap cheap cheap...","review":"I fell in love with the print on a set of 250 thread count Tommy Hilfiger sheets, so I bought two sets of twin size at $15.99 for each sheet. I also bought two packages of pillow cases, the comforter, two shams and a valance to match. What a big mistake. It was a total waste of money and I will never buy anything from Tommy Hilfiger again. The seams on the sheets (BOTH top and bottom) started unravelling after only THREE washes. The elastic on the bottom sheet came unsewn. I took the second set of sheets out thinking maybe it was just a freak thing that I got two bad sheets. The same thing happened with the second set. Also, the quilting on the comforter came completely unravelled after a couple weeks. The fabric of the sheets faded SO fast and they looked like I had had them for years. I will *never* spend my hard earned money on the Tommy Hilfiger brand name again. They are expensive to buy but are very cheaply made and fall apart right away. What a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"The title gives it away","review":"A dictator ?? You gotta be kidding.

My personal favorite is the chocolate-peanut butter one. I've purchased 4 boxes in the last few months of that flavor and love them as a between meal snack. They are the only thing I've found that can replace sweets for me and with no guilt after eating.BUT...The chocolate ones are not good tasting nor is it a good texture. Too dense, too strange, odd chocolate similarity but not really chocolate and bad aftertaste. Even worse, however, are the peanut butter ones. I gave those away. At least I'll most likely eat these eventually."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like them","review":"The first thing I noticed about these is they are very dense, with a very waxy but dry and gritty texture.

I can't say I care for the writing style. It reminds me of the \\"Guy Noir\\" skit on \\"A Prairie Home Companion,\\" which is, of course, supposed to be a funny take-off on these kinds of books. The protagonist seemed to be more of a stereotypical formula rather than a real person. I struggled up through Chapter 9. Then I began to get more invested in the story. I think the writing began to improve a bit and the characters gained some dimension. Still, it ends up being 2 stars for me. Perhaps his later books are better?"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books I've ever read....","review":"I read the first two chapters of this book, and I have to say that the writing was horrible.

It's worth reading, but for the love of Mike get a different edition. This cover is utterly hideous and completely at odds with the ethos of the story. Why would a female-only society, where dress is utilitarian and reproduction asexual, tart themselves up in pink eyeshadow and mascara that would make even an overly-flamboyant drag queen quail?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book ever written.","review":"Herland, by Charlotte Perkins Gilman, tries to take the view of a world without man. The notion that the world would be one peaceful little place without man is absurd. Women as well as men, have competed against each other for centuries. It is ridiculous to assert that women would not fight amongst themselves. If it was at all possible to give this book zero stars, I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite possibly, the worst book I've ever read","review":"This was assigned to me in college 25 years ago. I still remember how I struggled to get through the 90 some pages of this book. One reviewer wrote that the point wasn't to tear down men, but to show that women can live without men. She must have missed the part where because me are gone, so are wars. Clearly only men can be greedy/hateful. Women are only nurturing and giving. This book was assigned along with \\"The Handmaid's Tale\\" by Margaret Atwood. I can't say enough good things about THAT book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful feminist novel","review":"This is a great, imaginative book, one of my favorites. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Deserving of its Clout","review":"I know that \\"Herland\\" receives quite a bit of praise and is highly regarded. In my opinion, the work doesn't bear up under these accolades. The story is down right boring, which is disappointing considering how engaging Gilman's short stories and other works are. The plot is odd and the message that Gilman is trying to convey is lost. I saw another reviewer call this work a satire, but I would strongly disagree. Gilman did not intend \\"Herland\\" to be a satire. She was attempting to show that women were more adept at \\"social housekeeping\\" than men were.Unless you have to read it, there are many other and better Gilman pieces to absorb your attention with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong book","review":"wrong book sent.

The book itself is great, when it finally arrived it was in good condition.

Cowboy Billy, who looks to be somewhere between six and nine years old, lives in the city. But that doesn't stop him from riding his stick horse, Splinter, all over the place--watching out for rustlers, delivering Pony Express mail, and so on. Author Wendy K. Ulmer subtly introduces the point that Cowboy Bill's grandfather has died, and that Grandpa had once told Billy that stars are the campfires of those we love--those who have died before us. Billy takes comfort in this tale, and it doubles back towards the end to take on new resonance and meaning. Altogether a sweet and subtle way to discuss death with a child. Ulmer's story is energetically illustrated by Kenneth J. Spengler."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is hard to understand","review":"This book is hard for me to understand because most sentences doesn't make sense. Some does make sense but most of them no. Ray Bradbury should do more better then that. I've being forced to read this book because my 9th grade english teacher made us. When I start reading this book it is okey. When I'm on page 30 the sentence doesn't make sense. It just mostly say \\"I burn bookee\\". I would rather read Great Expectations instead. If you are a very good reader you may try it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Burn This Book! - OK No, Just Kidding","review":"If you wish to read an Orwellian, dystopian novel set in the future, read the novels by George Orwell himself, 1984 and Animal Farm. Undoubtedly, Fahrenheit 451 is a classic and I guess required reading, if only for completenes, but it certainly failed to hold my interest. I found the writing to be a little more fluffy than what I find enjoyable and the plot is remarkably thin, unlike the richly constructed 1984 and the taut Animal Farm. I'm afraid I can't call myself a Bradbury fan just yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"takes a wrong turn","review":"fahrenheit 451 starts off well, but definately doesnt end that way. besides the fact the some characters seem unreal and are impossible to relate to, at one point in the book montag and his friend have an incredibly insightful talk and end it in an idiotic plan, but i won't go into that too much. the end is boring and close to impossible to get through. read it, but be prepared."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip 451","review":"Basically, Fahrenheit 451 is a let down. The drop off ending cuts off the futuristic plot's potential. There is much colorful vocabulary, but some metaphors are so elaborate and sudden that one hardly knows whether something is actually happening or if it's just a figment of the character's imagination. It is more confusing that challenging to read. The main character, Montag, has a fairly interesting conflict. The only problem is that it is not resolved enough by the end of the book to leave the reader satisfied! Plus, the only moral or meaning from the book is given away early on, leaving nothing to motivate the reader. I recommend this book to nobody, because they will be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it","review":"could not stand this book. hated everything about it. waste of my time reading it. maybe just too out of date for today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very SLLLOOoowwww...ZZzzz","review":"This book could have easily been summed up in 30 pages! Not that I don't love attention to detail in stories, because I do, but F. 451 just dragged.

I'm never touching this book again."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you want action, dont read this","review":"If you want a book that keeps you on the edge of your seat with action and plot twists, then read a comic book. This is one of the slowest books I have ever read. It is one of the best books I have ever read. It is truely chilling, how close this book mimics reality. Free speach may not be outlawed here, but when the news media is outraged at someone who is prolife.. or when a TV show has to have either sex, violence, or very rude humor to get good ratings.. or when the most improtant thing on the new is the presidents love life.. it really makes you think about just how close we are to the world F451.

The idea of the book at fist sounded really cool and for a moment I thought I might accually enjoy reading this story. In the end, I hated just as much as everyone else in my class.

There are a lot of unanswered questions and undefined terms in this book, so you better get the Cliff's Notes, because without them, you'll be lost.

Ray Bradbury does not describe the story very elaborate and and so e.g. it is very difficult to understand what the people are talking about.Furthermore, the tension the fireman acts with doesn't get clear in the description by Bradbury. This is a very bad style of telling a story and makes me think the author himself didn't like the story.The dialogues between the fireman, Montag, and the girl he meets on the street are forced and do not seem vivid.

There are three sections, and all that the main character, Montag does in the first section is meet a girl named Clarisse and talks to her once or twice and starts \\"considering\\" his job as a fireman burning books. This should give you a rough overview of what the book is like: way to descriptive. A lot of my friends in the class didn't even read the second or third sections because it was so incredibly boring.

They were wrong. The only credit I can give this book is that it is the only one that has ever made me fall asleep. Its inconsistent plot and awful use of surreal events were written down in a rambling, incoherent jumble of thoghts, even if you can call them that. Even if it had any type of meaning or hidden morale, this supposed \\"work of art\\" was unbearably boring and slow. Maybe I'm not yet old enough to be able to pick out any real substance from the book's paragraph after paragraph of *@#$, but I do applaud anyone who had the strength to get past the first chapter.

Even using the Cliffs Notes didn't help at all. I don't recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bad Book","review":"The book Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury in my opinion is extremely confusing and difficult to read. The setting is in a futuristic world, where books are banned and anyone who is caught with books are prosecuted. The main character, Montag, is a fireman whose job is to burn books. The world he lives in is plain and dull, and he becomes desperate for something exciting, so he begins to read the books that he burns. Once caught by his fellow fireman, Montag must flee from his home and run away to escape imprisonment or possibly death. In the book, some of the concepts are hard to understand, and the futuristic conceptions in the book may confuse the reader. The vocabulary isn't too difficult, but there are sections of the book that may set the reader off track. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone younger than the seventh grade level, and I would recommend this book to people who like science-fiction. Personally, I thought this book was very boring and it didn't capture my interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was really odd..........","review":"This book was a hard read because I didn't find it interesting.

Fahrenheit 451 has managed to do this. Now one of my favorite books, I can sit back and wonder \\"what makes this such a good book?\\" I feel the answer is that F. 451 is a slap in the face to Americans living in this day and age. The fact that it appears this is where America is headed - wars (war with Iraq, war with Afghanistan), censorship (parental advisories on cds, ratings on movies), and just a general air of disaffection to the world can be seen every day. America: read this book! We'll be better off for it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Among the Best Ever","review":"Brilliant. If you have not read this book, read it.

Unfortunately, I missed this book in my earlier days of public education, but I have found a real treasure now. This book is very topical in the policitically-correct world in which we live. I find it hard to believe that so many of the fears that are expressed in Beatty's speech to Montag regarding why books or ideas were burned have come to fruition. In fact, the most stirring part of this edition is the coda where Bradbury's ideas about censorship are expressed in first-person.

The few free thinkers that are left are killed, and yet, one man saves a book and reads it, making him a wanted criminal. Guy Montag, the hero, is this man, the rebel, the fireman whose job it is to burn books. This is a classic about censorship, that is now more important than before. Be sure to read this one, along with Orwell's 1984, and you'll get a clear view on what the future can be. And remember, at 451 degrees Fahrenheit is the temperature at which books burn."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hearth and the Salamander","review":"Bradbury creates a world of extreme censorship that is our future, where firemen burn books and houses in which they are hidden. I first read this book in 8th grade (not because I had to, but because I WANTED to), and it had a profound effect on my life. Guy Montag is an anticonformist at heart caught in a world where conformity is the only path to survival. I respect those who gave it 1 or 2 stars, though, because if you are forced to read any book in school that you don't want to, you are going to be inclined to dislike it. But, if you read it once, try it again. You will see the underlying tale about society in general. A very depressing, but very moving book, I recommened it for all, young ones for the plot about anti censorship, and older people for the underlying plots."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scarier than LIFE","review":"Learning to appreciate everything around us is difficult, in today's society. We have everything ever dreamed of, and we have barely begun. By letting \\"..451\\" into you're mind, one realizes that this fiction, is not justly so.

Just waiting to be discovered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Censorship has never felt so real...","review":"This book blew me away, but to appreciate it, you must understand how technology has affected us and how we already act. Plus, you must understand, that this book was written in the 50s where they thought we would be even further in the future.In the time of Guy Montag, no book-readers were free. they were behind bars, or running from the law; and he was one of the people who put them there.this book is so moving and compelling i could only grasp the rhythm of Bradbury and his magnificent language that lets you know the fear and hatred of Montag.Before you start, you need to know that this book will be weird and confusing. You must appreciate philosophy and know how strange this world is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Critical View","review":"Bradbury's view on the future is startling.

I immediately fell in love with the book. In the almost 10 years since I fist read the book, I have read it over and over again. While in college, I wrote a paper for a Lit class showing the how Bradbury's science fiction is slowly becoming science fact (i.e. seashells= walkman. Its scary to see how a book written in 1953, as a work of fiction, is becoming reality. If you want to know what I mean, then read \\"Farenheit 451\\" and see for yourself.

Actually had the honor of seeing Ray Bradbury speak- LIVE - (yea, I know, it was eons ago) - but I hadn't read anything he had written before that speech. I got a copy of this book shoved into my chest just after that speech, and couldn't put it down. A marvelous read.

I'd say this is a must read for everyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"This is definitely a well written book. It's one of those books that has a message and makes you see the similiarities between our world and Bradbury's fictional world of the future. It's short and to the point, if you have a few spare hours you should definitely read this book. It makes you THINK."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I personally thought that the originality of the plot was what made the book interesting for me. Never before had I read a book about the banning of books and using \\"firemen\\" to get rid of them. At times there were some lulls and some confusing parts, but overall Bradbury's unique style is what made the book worthwhile for me to read. I believe that Montag was at times a flat character that could use a little spice, but his growth throughout the novel seemed to counteract the deterioration within his own surrounding society. To think that one day our own society could be like Montag's; burning books and stifling creativity; is absolutely frightening to me and this book does not try to supress that notion. It actually amplifies it, but it can be used as a reference for our future generations so they would never reach that low point that Montag's society reached."},{"rating":"2","title":"I generally liked this book.","review":"This book is exceptional in its portrayal of the future. Yet, it is slow for the few chapters. If you buy this book, brunt the hardship; it gets incredible later!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging fast read","review":"Fahrenheit 451 has been on my lengthy 'to read' list for quite a while. My book club selected it this month and I'm glad I finally took the time to dive into the book.What I found most chilling about the book was not the book burning although the idea makes me shudder, but the picture of a society that's lost all respect and sense of reality. Montag's wife with her television 'family' distressed me as the seeds exist in so many ways in our society. Likewise the premise that letting minority voices rule eventually leads to all voices needing to be the same provokes thought.My only complaint would be the suddenness of the book's conclusion. I was following Montag with great excitement, but wanted more answers than I had by the end of the book.I'd also recommend reading the afterward. Great perspective from Bradbury and some ironic moments."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic...","review":"After reading \\"The Time Machine\\" by H.G Wells (Great book by the way), I started looking for more Sci Fiction/Dystopian style of books. Fahrenheit 451 is perfect! The author presents us with a world where books and anything \\"upsetting\\" are illegal. Things like creativity and thinking are nonexistent, and life revolves around being entertained, mostly by giant television screens... The main character of the story eventually changes, but I won't say too much more about that. I will say though that is one interesting book to read, especially with all the similarities it has with the current times. I also found it to be a very entertaining and not too difficult read, so I'd say anyone 8th grade and older should give it a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Eye-opener","review":"This book is so relevant to today that it is scary. It has really opened my eyes. This book is a must read and is definitely one of my favorite books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fiction?","review":"I was first introduced to Ray Bradbury when I took up The Martian Chronicles at my community library. I was impressed. Now, several years later, I finally read Fahrenheit 451.The book is divided into three parts, and the first two were absolutely excellent. (The Afterword and Coda were, as well.) The third part of the story, however, lost me. Ray Bradbury decided, partway through the section, to abandon the easily flowing narrative that he had established in the rest of the book. Instead he picked up a very difficult to follow inner dialogue that lost my interest. Which made it even harder to follow for the rest of the book.But, Bradbury deserves a gold star for his insight into how society is working today (which he foresaw several years ago). We are giving up books and stopping thinking. Remember, at first, the government didn't have to burn books... People just stopped reading them.Love it or hate it, this is a book that rings with truth. And, whatever you do, don't burn it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful","review":"It is simply amazing how, for a book written so many years earlier, is actually quite accurate discribing how things are turning this day in age...It does make you wonder...and makes you more aware of your own behaviors."},{"rating":"2","title":"good..","review":"I enjoyed reading this. The book is about a fireman who starts having doubts about his job and his home life. He begins wondering if what he is doing is the right thing to do but it may cost him his job, wife and life. His strugles go on though out the book and in this furture that he lives in he is alone. Just a simple man with his thoughts wondering how different live would be if people were allowed to read books...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not 1984","review":"I've heard some people say that this book rips off 1984, that is NOT true. It's essentially the converse of 1984. In Orwell's masterpiece (I won't deny either of these books that title) the government has absolute power. 1984 has been called \\"The end of all Utopias\\" because the people can't win.In Bradbury's work, however, the government is not all powerful, and still has those who work against it that it foolishly ignores. Furthermore, the war is not to permanently distract the people, it is a real thing to win or lose. The people aren't closely monitored, they can even have ideas so long as they don't have books. In the end this is the beggining of a Utopia, in 451 the government can't win, they will eventually fall and a new age of learning will rise...to fall again, and again, and again, but as Bradbury points out unlike the Phoenix we may eventually learn NOT TO JUMP IN THE FREAKIN' FUNERAL PYRE, OR EVEN TO BUILD IT IN THE FIRST PLACE!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"eBooks","review":"In my humble opinion, I find it is riduculous that eBooks cost more than books printed with ink and paper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless that text to speech is not enabled!","review":"Hi!I guess I didn't look too carefully and missed that text to speech was not enabled.Is there a way to get the publisher to change their mind?Thanks,per"},{"rating":"1","title":"Target Practice","review":"Heyyyy I had to read this book for school and it was the worst thing I ever read.

The characters were entirely unconvincing - e.g. the professor with the strange name who can only express himself using metaphors.

I read it, because I'd bought it, but I found almost every word an insult to my intelligence."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Book Ever!","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is the worst book I have ever read in my whole life. I was forced to read it in school, and I disguised the book starting at the first page. There is absolutely nothing good in the book. It makes no sense, and I personally don't think the world will become to be, as predicted in this book. I also find this book very offensive to my religious beliefs. How can a book that takes the name of the Lord in vain, in almost every page, be used as a class novel. Everyone knows that taking the Lord's name in vain is breaking one of God's commandments, and is a sin. I have never read a book that was as bad as Fahrenheit 451 in language. I don't understand how the school boards can justify such a book, and use it for classes. Anyone who hasn't read this book, don't waste your time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible book","review":"This was the worst book I've ever read.

But the scary thing about this book is, despite the fact that we were warned of this type of thing, situations like the one in 451 are still happening! This book is even more relevant today than it was years ago when it appeared as \\"fiction.\\" How sad that we haven't learned our lessons. F 451 is beyond the definition of a classic and beyond food for thought. It's a wake-up call that should not be ignored."},{"rating":"2","title":"Orwell's shadow","review":"'Fahrenheit 451' is a powerful story that imagines a future world where literature is burned and readers are imprisoned. Bradbury creates a whole dumbed-down society of people who are robbed of creative and independent thought, and where this deficit is enforced by law.I felt that the major shortcoming of the book was that the entire book smacks of '1984,' but it is not nearly as powerful as Orwell's story. 'Fahrenheit 451' focuses much more intently on the relatively narrower issue of censorship in our society, whereas '1984' looks at the complete robbery of free will. I thought all of the characters were a rip-off, from the young girl to the protagonist to the mean authority figure who tries to \\"help\\" the protagonist and turns on him in the end.This is a good book, and I like the metaphor, I just felt like the same idea was espoused in a much more gripping fashion in '1984.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"I know it's a classic, but I was not impressed.","review":"Haing missed this book in school, somehow, I've always meant to read it since I keep hearing great things about it. I don't know if my expectations were too high or I'm just missing something that everyone else sees, but I didn't like it.The idea that political correctness grows into something so ridiculous that not only are books burned, but the houses that they occupy are burned also was just impossible for me to swallow. Add to that only a single character that was likeable at all (and she was killed off pretty early), then a pretty boring story to go along with it, and the only reason I was able to finish it was because it was so short.I don't see any reason why anyone would want to read this book, but I'm clearly in the minority on this one, so maybe you'll like it better than I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"ATTENTION TEACHERS!","review":"I had to read this book in my sophomore Honors English class. Basically, it is about book-burning and the importance of books. BUT IF YOU WANT TO IMPART TO YOUR STUDENTS THE IMPORTANCE OF READING, LET THEM READ SOMETHING THAT IS AT LEAST INTERESTING! Instead of having your students read Fahrenheit 451, let them read DUNE (and don't say it's bad because the movies were!), or HARLAN ELLISON, or PHILIP K. DICK. NOT this pocket-protector, suit and tie business writer, Bradbury. I've tried reading some of his other stuff. He's not that good. This book was okay, but nothing great and certainly nothing I would spend money on or read again. Have you ever heard of \\"show, don't tell\\"? This book only TELLS why books are important. But let the student read a good book and that will SHOW them why books are important. This is one of many rotten books that I have read in High School.

While throwing in a couple of other ideas, he builds up to describing the horrors of censorship. It seems ridiculous that the could actually become that crazy, but if we tried to make the world perfect-it would leave many people unhappy. And if we destroy books, we're destroying a person's valuable opinion containing the key to the past."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple but Perfect","review":"\\"Fahrenheit 451\\" is one of those rare books that goes straight to the heart of its issue, what we are doing to ourselves in this TV/Multimedia crazed society. So much more than a cry against censorship, this book is a rallying cry for us to wake up and see what is happening all around us. From the video walls to the relationships of children and parents, Bradbury is eerily prophetic in his predictions. I can see why some readers today would feel uncomfortable with this book; the truth not only hurts, but sometimes it can be downright damning.P.S. This is not a young adult book. The levels of symbolism and prophecy make this a read much more appropriate to an older, more mature audence."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've always had trouble reading","review":"I've always had trouble reading but when I read this book for my English 2 class I loved it.

It's a cautionary tale, as well as the story of a dynamic human being.I had tried to read this book several times in the past and was never able to get past the first few chapters. The very thought of burning books made me cry, and although I was relatively sure that it picked up from there, I had to put it down several times. The work postulates that books are necessary for three very important reasons: quality of ideas, remembering the past so as not to repeat it, and engendering community between readers. Important function of books, I think."},{"rating":"2","title":"Burning Books!","review":"This is said to be the temperature at which books ignite. The concept of the novel was satirical. The book was set in a sort of parallel universe or alternate reality that says that a government has taken over, which has outlawed books and goes into people's homes and sets the books on fire. There is a law against books even in schools, this seems insane, and the backlash to an idea such as this is the current popularity of books today then the alternative to books, would be the ebook."},{"rating":"2","title":"How Fitting...","review":"I'm 54 years old and I am reading this for the first time ever...on my Kindle.

Both in their community and ours, citizens follow what the government says and do it without question. In this case, people don't read books. If they do, firemen burn them. It's simple, but in Ray Bradbury's account of this tale, it becomes very complex.Guy Montag, the main character/fireman, discovers that this process is wrong.

Unfortunately I reckon that the style is weak, words are just thrown without explanesions in the pages, sentences are chopped in a way that often made me feel totally extraneous to the plot.

Go find another copy--trust me (I would quit but I'm trying to finish it for a book club). Mercifully @ 5 CDs it's pretty short.Amendment: So after finishing, I must say that the last CD is just an interview with the author and it's really very interesting.

I just can't seem to feel any passion for science fiction.Not that Fahrenheit 451 is scifi. There is a strong presence of metaphor in this book; too heavy a presence for my reading delight, though the idea is cute. Firemen ignites fires to destroy knowledge aka power. 1984 with an arson's twist. But the conclusion was so obvious from the start that I thought, why read what's in between?Written during an era of Cold War fear, I can see the appeal of his plot.

My love of reading can be traced back to this book. His recent death triggered me to think about how much he meant to me as a boy growing into a young man, and I thought I'd pick up something as a sort of memorial to him. I hadn't read anything of his in probably 35 years, and to be honest I felt like maybe it wouldn't be that good going back to re-read them. I mean, could they actually live up to my memories? Wow, and then some! His writing is poetry, magic and a sincere look at the human condition. It is as timely today as it was when he wrote it, maybe more so.

I love reading but this book really made me think about how some of my friends despise reading. Now, it doesn't seem like much, but in Guy Montag's society, the main character, reading and just owning books was a crime. I started thinking about how much knowledge can be attained through books, and this book made me think about what books offer. That is because this book offers so much to the reader. The only thing I didn't like about this book was that it had no closing to the story. I personally like closings but some people like to imagine the end and it always works for teachers to have a finish the book kind of project.

She places all of these wierd thoughts and ideas into his head. From then on he questions everything. This winds up getting him in trouble. However, in the end this works out for the best. We definitely recommend this book for anyone who wants to burn their brain. For under six bucks, you can get a great thriller."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is a must for society","review":"This book was not about neccesarily; the future. But it was about the society we live in today, and how actually close we really are to this horrific view of the future: where firemen are sent to burn books. The things Guy Montag went through, were just horrible, and the war was out of control. The hobos; or outcasts from society; were a great addition. The reason for their outcast, one might wonder: books. Montag realized this when that woman killed herself. I treasure books, and the thought of this ever happening blows my mind. Try this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye-opening & Spellbinding!!","review":"This novel is truly a work of art. It has mastered the art of allusion and metaphor. We had to read this book for College Prep. English (10th grade) and I was very disappointed at first. Then I went back and started over and read it slowly so I would understand it fully. As I read back through the pages, it seemed like a totally different book. I hung on the natural similies and metaphors, and couldn't believe how correct Bradbury was in placing our future. To those who \\"just don't get it\\" I say I'm dreadfully sorry. It's a pity that you wasted your time, not actually reading the best book ever written!

The plot and the story in general are extremely interesting- not only due to the actual events, but due to Fahrenheit 451's frightening connection to our lives. The futuristic, dystopian setting where the government has censored all forms of high art and learning, and where humans have 'dumbed down' to an unbelievable degree, gives way to a story where humankind fights with itself to regain a civilized society.Fahrenheit 451 is no doubt a critisism of our society and a scary prediction of may be ahead. Don't miss this wonderful novel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"I picked up this book because I was just in need of something to read. Once I began, I could not put it down! Farenheit 451 is set in a not so far away distopian future where media rules and books are illegal. In this place, firemen start fires on books rather than put fires out. Guy Montag is fireman who begins to see the truth in books. When this is discovered though, he has to run for his life. This is a great book for pretty much everyone, but there is aare heavy phycological thoughs throughout the whole book, and sparce mild language. Overall, if you want a great book to read, choode this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Farhenheit 451 The book about no books","review":"Ray Bradbury's account of a bookless world is realistic in every way. Farenheit 451 is realistic in how it describes situations, people, and places throughout the book. In the beginning of the book it describes Guy Montag and a book burning. The author describes the book in how the books \\"Flutter around like birds and the sky burns as black as night.Guy Mantag is a firefighter who, instead of fighting fires, he starts fires. Guy does this because of a massive government censorship act in order to keep people in line with the way they think. It is sort of like a cover up.

Yes, we have a long way to go to be in a state where books are outlawed and firemen start fires instead of stopping them. But still, we have a good head start. People come home from work and plop on the couch and watch TV. You have to be an intellectual to read books. It's just not the norm anymore. In this book, TV has taken over people's lives with wall to wall TV screens. The imagination is lost in the hours of meaningless violence and comedy that is blasted through cables to people's homes. Then, through an array of events, the main character, Montag, starts to wonder about things and think for himself. With society frowning upon thinking, he's in a world of trouble.

However, it's not the light, entertaining book that some may be looking for. Most of the book is a metaphor, and if the reader is willing to think about what is represented so much can come from this book. The idea of the book is fascinating and Bradbury's demonstrates his point perfectly with his amazing word choice. There are so many themes and life changing lessons that can be pulled out of this book.

My expectations were smothered, stabbed repeatedly, and left on the floor to die. This is not a good book. Bradbury's writing is incredibly confusing, and some pivotal parts of the story are so removed from the main plot that you can't understand them.Bradbury has a penchant for killing off characters. For example, one character, that changes the life of the main character, is dead 20 pages into the book. If she was burned 'cause she had books, fine, but she got run over by a car. How stupid is that?Pass this one up, and for a real futuristic utopia, try 1984. Just not this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simplistic Viewpoints","review":"While I can appreciate Bradbury's views on television's effects on people, I believe he gave far too much credence to the communistic approach to controlling people by doing away with books. Considering the beautiful complexity of a book like Dandelion Wine, this was disappointingly simplistic and unrealistic. And as to the war and the 'bomb' at the end, he stepped totally out of reality, since by the time this was written, the world would have known that the effects of radiation went far beyond the initial destruction. And he gave no explanation as to why there should have been a war at all.

I finally got around to reading it when I heard that Michael Moore's new movie is titled after this book. (Fahrenheit 9/11 The Temperature at Which Freedom Burns)So about the book... It is not only a good story with a strong message regarding freedom of speech. It is beautifully written and very easy to read.

More importantly, that it makes you think.Farenheit 451 does this and more. As I read it, it horrified me how much it applies to today's society. People are always offended about one thing, or they want you to delete that. Some people detest reading at all and are content to spend their days watching sitcoms - most of which are not funny and have no point to them whatsoever. These days, people seem to be longing for an easy, brainless, sacchrine happiness and existence. Farenheit 451 shows what happens when those people get their wish.A must-read for anybody of any age - five stars from me! If you like it, and haven't already read other books of this genre (dystopias and such) - may I also recommend 1984 by George Orwell, Anthem by Ayn Rand, and The Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fahrenheit 451 is a masterpiece","review":"If you have not read this book yet, you are missing out.

The nine days in dimes that he spent came to so much good. This is a classic because it is science-fiction that predicts our world today. If you look closely, you'll see ipods and cell phones and flatscreen TVs in Bradbury's artistic vision. The message is obvious but insidious. We know that books are the knowledge of our anscestors, that writing is ideas and that without them we would be vapid, yet we still don't actually get it.

Bradbury goes on and on for pages of nonsense, and his words leave you with no more enlightenment than you had 50 pages ago. He uses redundant adjectives, and pointless sentences. I was especially annoyed when he would go \\"inside\\" Mr. Montag's thoughts and repeat the same meaningless phrases over and over again.

But we will never reach such an extreme level, its simply a rediculous concept. I contest that we cannot worry about whether others are getting their daily dose of Shakespeare, Joyce or the Bible, and if we choose to read on our own, we will always have the chance to do so. I imagine that if you are reading this review, you don't run a high risk of losing interest in books in your lifetime.

The author, Ray Bradbury, didn't have difficult sentences, but he did seem to jump around. He would never be very clear. Within each and every page he would jump around, or lose the readers attention by rambling on in an unorthodox style. If there were a prime age group for this book it would have to be junior high schoolers to high schoolers. That is probably because it is about that difficulty and this alternate future may be the most appealing to this age."},{"rating":"1","title":"There Are Better Dystopias Out There","review":"This book was hard to read from the start. Eventually one can infer what is going on, but very little is explained plainly. The copy I read was from the library, and there were mispelled sticky notes throughout with what looked like two middle schoolers trying to figure out what was going on. (For instance, \\"Why is Beatty ask about the dog? Dose he know where the books are?\\")The ending is alright, and I really liked the quote about how the inability to build creates a need to destroy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit on the iffy side . . .","review":"I had to read Fahrenheit 451 for class in eighth grade, and from the beginning, I knew this book would turn out be quite eloquent and philsosphical, but also extremely tedious. I almost fell asleep in some occasions. Bradbury does a good job describing sections in the story, but sometimes gets carried away and forgets about some mood. For example, when the city is bombed, there should be some line of chaos and the people inhabiting the city running for their lives. In conclusion, I struggled through the book and only read it out of coercion. I would never read this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"I've just finished reading this book and although the premise behind it is intriguing, the books feels unfinished and rushed...Also, Bradbury's elegant and descriptive style of writing feels like a shroud that covers the rather poor character development and lack of interesting characters. This book also needs a large section (that should basically precede the book as it stands now) dedicated towards describing the overall setting and government climate in order to set the proper mood.....Therefore I cannot recommend this title."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fahrenheit 451 - Not worth it","review":"This book is boring. Unless you are interested in science fiction or Ray Bradbury's work you probably wont like it. This book takes place in the future in a world where all books are banned. People spend a lot of time watching television. Montag, the main character is a firefighter who burns books. The story of the book is ok but it gets boring and there is no excitement. The book is easy to read and there isn't any very hard vocabulary. Don't read this book if you are in fourth grade or younger because it might be to hard to read, just stick to the movie if you are interested in this topic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poignant and relevant still.","review":"There isn't anything I could say that hasn't already been said in the last sixty years.

Even though some of the material and references employed are a bit dated, as I said before, this was not intended as a prediction, only a warning. Are we wise enough to heed its message?"},{"rating":"2","title":"I HATE THE IDEA OF NO BOOKS!","review":"\\"Fahrenheit 451\\" is about a future where there is no freedom of speech. A future where every person is a mindless automaton with no feeling. They go about their life wondering whats going to be on the screen next or what they're going to eat for dinner. Worst of all it is a future where there are no books. It is a future where firemen don't douse fires, it is a future where they start them. Their job is to rid the earth of books by burning them.Montag is a firefighter who is questioning what he is doing. Lately he has been stealing books from the secret libraries he burns for a living. He finally realizes that without books people are mindless automatons who's only purpose in life is not to think.This is a great book and it makes you think of what life would be like if our only purpose in life was to be happy. We wouldn't be able to think for ourselves, just like the characters in the book. I give \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" five big stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"FAHRENHEIT 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 in my mind is a very well-written book by Ray Bradbury. Sometimes this book did get very weird, but it all had a purpose towards the end of the book. The author of this book had a very good idea for a story like this and he wrote it very well.Guy Montag has had his job for ten years as a fireman, but books were for burning and the houses in which they were hidden. This man goes out on midnight, runs and watches pages become inflamed in fire. Then he meets a professor that tells him in the future when people could think, and then he realizes what he has to do.I enjoyed this book quite a bit and I would recommend this book for you if you like Science Fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I had to buy this book for school. At first when I was reading it, it seemed a little boring because it wasn't the type of book I usually enjoy reading. But after I got about 20 pages in, I couldn't put it down! I loved every description and foreshadowing, and how much of the technology was similar to today's, even though the book was written in the 1950's. I was so happy with it that yesterday I went out and bought another of Bradbury's books, The Martian Chronicles!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST book i have ever read!!","review":"I love this book.

It is not in literary terms that knowledge can be controlled by burning books; there are other ways to accomplish that. As the world is full of people; running with lit matches. Ray Bradbury is basing his attack on every editor; censor; lobbyist; government that see themselves as the caretaker of knowledge and literature; and they control by shackle the words of an author who dare to speak out.The question is very relevant to present times. The news is splattered with stories of doctored intelligence documents; on the bases of which dreaded events occurred."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451At the tender age of 9, as my 30 year old father lay in a hospital dying of cancer, my grieving young mother packed me off to a theater nearby. The feature was Fahrenheit 451, the year was 1966, and I was amazed by the message in this movie, enough to go back every night for a week, and beg my mom for the book. Growing up, I often reflected on how I lost I would be without books, and vowed I would read voraciously through life, and never willingly be part of a society who believed in spoon feeding propaganda to people to make them complacent. Lo and behold, my America has crept in that direction. The message of the movie is not what Government can do to society, but what society allows those in power to do to control them. Reading is indeed the antidote to blind faith in bad leaders. This movie carries a timeless message, one I have shared with my children and grandchild, and everyone who I have lent it or given one to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feel the Heat of Words","review":"I must say that this classic, by the master of Science Fiction, is one of the greatest Scifi books written. Ray Bradbury has proved to the literary elitist, that Science Fiction is not just about non-existing technology. No, this novel questions the self-censoring nature of man. It takes place in the future, 1990s, a future for the when the book was written, and tells a tale of a world devoid of books. The firemen, no longer put out fires, but start them. They burn books. Hence the title: the temperature of which paper burns. Though, I suppose the most interesting part of this story is that the policy to burn all books did not come about from the government. No, instead regular people began to democratically burn books themselves because books typically have that one element of life that common people usually do not want to deal with. Controversy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't Put It Down!","review":"I have never read a book anything like this before. Most of the literiture that I've come across has had ideas that come from other books, but Bradury's idea was clearly original, especially if this was written in the 50's. The language is of the kind Shakespeare couldn't think of. I don't think that even George Lucas could think up such a world. Within the first three sentences I was entranced. The suspense was of the kind that kept me awake, even at 3 A.M., and reading by flashlight. This book will help society be more careful about the future. Bradbury's wonderful creation deserves no less than 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"emotional impact","review":"This novel intricately portrayed what Guy was experiencing, if you read this book in one sitting and allow yourself to absorb what is happening, you can feel the choas and indecision that ravages Montag's pyche. This was a refreshing aspect after reading so many award winning books that seem to try too hard to force emotional impact upon the reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Bradbury's best","review":"I rarely read SF, I'm more of a fan of general fiction books like Prince of Tides or The Triumph and the Glory. But I had to read Fahrenheit 451 for a class and actually enjoyed it. It had an aura of chilling prophecy, the world may well deteriorate to conditions like that described in Bradbury's classic book, where books are burned.

I couldnt agree more. Although I am a bibliophile, and found this book very interesting, I am also consious of the unique ability of english teachers to analyse books to death.

This book completely changed my opinion about the contrast between literature and entertainment, censorship, and society in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Worth The Time","review":"If there is one book that you read in high school that you should read again later in life, this is it.

In this case, lack of tolerance for differing voices led to no voices at all--democracy has eaten itself by misunderstanding itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dystopian classic","review":"Upon reading this book, it occurred to me just how much it gets quoted. The reasons for all the quoting is because of its continued relevance in spite of its age.The novel depicts a future filled with censorship and the \\"media\\" telling everyone what to worry about- and the worries which have absolutely no consequence.

This book repersents the amount of learning that the people will be doing in the future of our county it tv will keep going as it is. the book is a good book it has the posibility of telling people what we will come to if we stop reading. There are factors that leading to the general lack of interest in reading and factors that make people actively hostile toward books. Nature is presented as a force of innocence and truth with one of the characters.Blood appears throughout the novel as a symbol of a human being's repressed soul or primal, instinctive self.

I am a freshmen in high school and my whole Literature Pre-AP class had to read Fahrenheit 451 for an assignment. Now I know what you're probably thinking, well of course it's going to be confusing for a freshmen. But, I beg to differ. This book is written good I suppose, but the story jumps around too much and certain parts come up and it is just plain confusing (i.e. Dentham's Dentifrice). Well that is about all I have to say about this novel. I'm sure if I read it over again I would enjoy it more. But I don't think this book would be much more than 2 or 3 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alright, but sort of weird","review":"Ray Bradbury's book, Fahrenheit 451 is actually a pretty good book.

If you like a book that has many twists and turns, then you'll enjoy this book by Ray Bradberry. He tried to write about what he thought would be the worst future, with no books. They would set books onfire, because to read and poses a book is unlawful. The people believed that books made people upset, think up different ideas, and unequal.

This book is about the life of a fire fighter named Guy Montag who lives in a futuristic city where books are banned. The job of fire fighters in his view of the future are to set books and the houses they are hiding in on fire. The reasoning for this is that books are said to be evil and contain many different thoughts and emotions that are considered \\"dangerous\\" if people are exposed to them. This book pretty difficult to read based on its challenging vocabulary and its confusing situations. I would recommend this book to people no younger than 7th grade based on the content of the book, and I would recommend it to people with a strong interest in science fiction and futuristic books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expectations","review":"Not being a passionate Science Fiction reader, I did not enjoy Bradbury's writing ideas and form. I found this book to be a very slow read, not moving very fast. Some of Bradbury's ideas did not seem to fit into the story. I found this story to be too far into the future to relate to. I found the action of burning books to be very unreal in any society.

I didn't even need a teacher to tell me what Bradbury was trying to say. That is the strength of his message. When we finished discussing the book in class, I even went out and bought it. Not only is this book exciting, but it is thought provoking as well.

In a world where the government is afraid that people will learn (from books)and rebel, firemen no longer are called to the scene to put out fires, but to start them. In this warp society, burning books is a swift, fast way to take out all education, and people who strive for it. Guy Montag, a fireman, meets a young girl who tells him about a past where things were totally different, and once more sparks his intrest in books he had before. In this book, Bradbury tells us about censorship. It gets the reader thinking is it good or bad? Could Bradbury be forshadowing what our lives will soon become? Overall, this book was good. It got me to think about how our life would be like if I was in the book.

But his whole life changed when he met Clarisse. With three words, Guys life was turned upside down \\"Are You Happy?\\" Is he happy or has he been forced to be \\"happy?\\" Through the book, Guy sees the horrors of his life, and the lives of others. Everyone is oblivious to the torture they are experiencing. Guy wants out but society won't let him go. Guy has books, a fireman has books, books.

We understand about censorship and all that other stuff, but why are you telling us? We are the ones that want to make everything more open.

From what I understand, Bradbury sat in a library and wrote it in a few weeks, and it shows. Montag is introduced as a man happy in his job. The meeting with Clarisse blows his mind! But then Bradbury throws in numerous details indicating that his dissatisfaction has been mounting for some time. Although Montag is purportedly of a divided mind, the development of his character is very abrupt and unconvincing. But why develop what is essentially a mouthpiece for your own ranting? Blech. Bradbury's ideas have come to fruition in our time, but, ironically, his own work is not literature at all.

It was terribly disappointing--lots of hype over a cheesy science-fiction novel. There are two major problems with it. One is poor language usage--lousy descriptive word choices, lousy metaphors and similes that make inappropriate comparisons--and two, not enough attention paid to societal problems that give rise to things like book burning in the first place: the threat of the individual to the group; government control over the sheep-like masses; the modern epidemic of people's lack of interest in anything intellectual; the timeless epidemic of a fear of anything that goes against group mentality or upsets the status quo, and so on.

Over all picture quality, at least on the version we have, is pretty poor for DVD. It is more like an old VHS rental or something. Sound is average at best. The movie, or movies as it is, are rather confusing. The action seems to bounce all over the place and it is not entirely clear as to what is going on most of the time. The general idea of the movie (e.g. God and Satan bartering over souls) is interesting but this movie does not pull it off very well.

The text is poorly edited and in places doesn't make any sense at all.

This gives a very interesting perspective on the story itself when told as it's happening by the characters that are there. This book follows characters more than the plot, and that's reflected by a bit of a lack of direction to begin with but is tied together once the plot is worked up to. In much the same light, there's a fair amount of content to begin with that seems pointless at the time, mere plot filler, but much of that is explained once the plot starts to come into play. BloodRune ends with a dramatic twist, leading up to the series that was intended to follow.

Let me list the pros and cons:pros:*now cons:-combat is few and far between and when it comes about it usually takes 45 minutes for the enemy to run at you, attack, then run back to its spot (awesome)-not only can your character go of the screen and get stuck, other NPC can do the same! (real sick)-equipping and sharing items only takes about 400 years of your life, forget about all your goals and dreams.

You play as Frodo and you go through just about all the areas described in the original book while interacting with villagers and performing favors to get special items while also taking place in turn based battles with enemies. While this sounds good on paper (and like some old 16-bit RPG's that will remain nameless) there are so many glitches, bugs, and control issues (not to mention the battles take such an excruciating long time your head will spin in agony) that the overall feel of the game seems unfinished.

Boy, was I disappointed! First off the game is horribly slow. Combat takes forever, and is boring since your character miss all the time. You'll spend hours walking around looking for mundane items like flowers or Pippen.Add to that fact that the game is horribly buggy. Gimli turns invisible in one quest, sometimes the elves don't give you items you need, and I've yet to meet anyone online who found a way out of Moria without the game crashing.Don't buy this waste of a game.

And that doesn't mention all the problems with item cloning, invisible characters, music cutting out, and impossible quests.Even if the game was bugfree, it's awful. Combats take forever (and aren't any fun, since your characters never hit), and the best parts of the book are skipped over, like Weathertop and Amon Hen. Moving your character on screen is like steering a drunk elephant. Seriously.If you're looking for a good Lord of the Rings experience, buy the PS2 Fellowship version (skip the Xbox one), or EA's Two Towers games (either GBA or PS2)."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game really sucks","review":"I wish I could give this game negative five stars!

And I am not biased against Lord of the Rings games or anything like that because I enjoyed playing the Two Towers and Return of the King for the Gamecube. This game is fun for the first 15-30 minutes though. My final words are DON'T GET THIS GAME!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Slow Game with Terrible Glitches","review":"This game is more based on the book then any other lotr game. But the battles are terribly slow, some items don't work, things that the game promised are taken out, the graphics are awful, and there are some terrible glitches in the game, especially the Moria Glitch which made me go out buy another one (I thought the first one was a defect) and go through the same glitch again. Even if you are a huge lotr fan you should probably stay away from this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I am a huge fan of Tolkein books and lord of the rings especially. This was actually a pretty fun game for a while, I can't complain, I bought it in a bargain bin for $5 bucks, and I was thinking \\"What am I going to lose?\\" I lost 5 bucks and I want it back. I liked how it had aspects of the books instead of the movies in them, like Tom Bombadil and such. I would have more stars for it (1, mayyybe 2) if I didn't get stuck in Rivendell. I think I got Gimili's axe a step ahead of when I was supposed to and when I talk to him he says he needs it. Game over. There is nothing I can do to progress. And what really sucks is that I saved it before I knew that I was stuck. So its either spend another 3-5 hours replaying it and getting back to that part to progress, or quitting. I think I'll just quit and maybe sell it for a buck on Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Might be okay, but glitches are doozies.","review":"I could have made it through this game several x by now, but the glitches stuck me in trees in caves over drop-offs, etc., numerous times. I'm done... didn't even bother to finish and I was well past Morea. Someone said the ending sucks, so what am I missing anyhoo? I'll try the other two, heard they were better. I'm glad I logged on here to see the reviews (that perfectly match mine) or I might have gone out to buy another copy... thought this cartridge had been flushed and just stamped on the grahics glitches were so bad! But no they say, this game just stinks. Don't waste your money, borrow this one from a friend at the most and see what everyone means. Does not deserve the one point I had to give it."},{"rating":"2","title":"exiting but...","review":"This game is great! I could not stop playing it even when it was time for bed.

The battles are some what slow, but you have to admit that it is cool to have an invitory and equipping items. If you find glitches, return your game! My game is fine, and I'm past Moria. You can switch your characters, that is a really cool option. But the osund goes away in battles sometimes, thats not so fun. I like to have energy in my battles, but the battles are slow. That's why this game got a 7 out of 10. O' and I'm 14 years old, I'm just not signed up with Amazon.

I would definitely recommend playing this game before buying it. The story is fine and the graphics are nice, but the gameplay is so [weak]that it will bore your socks off. I used to play way too many hours of MUDs and other text-based adventure games, so I have a high tolerance for bad interface, but this game is potentially the worst I have ever seen. In fact, the game would be much better if they had replicated the character interface from \\"rogue/moria\\" and put it on the GBA ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't buy","review":"This game does not work. All of the other reviews about the game having multiple glitches are spot on. The gameplay itself is mediocre fun, but the fun only lasts as long as the first impassable glitch. I played through thrice, and had to stop every time at a pivotal point that the programmers forgot to actually play test. Because of this one major glitch that happened every time I tried to go through, I was not even able to finish the game.Please do yourself a favor and don't buy this title."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIFIC","review":"ATENTION ALL PERSONS!DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.I REPEAT DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.IT IS NOT FUN.You'd think that they'd have music and the game does,until you make a move pretty much.Poorly designed,Buggy,You could go on and on about it's flaws. final grade F ...NOT BUY THIS GAME"},{"rating":"1","title":"Would have been nice except all the bugs!","review":"This game could have been a nice RPG game.However, the large number of bugs makes the game unbearable.I've seen many computer games, and this takes the cakefor the number of errors, glitches, freezes, bugs...Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Horrible!","review":"Man this game is horrible!

I got past it, but there is another one! This game stinks!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY","review":"This is the worst Gameboy Advance ever I can not belive I wasted my money on this. Buy a good game like Golden Sun, Wario Land 4, Spyro season of ice, Crash Bandacoot, and Sonic Advance. If you buy it get it for a different gameing platform. Never buy a game after a book or movie for Gameboy Advance I bought Harry Potter for Computer and my friend bought it for Gameboy Advance and I was amazed at how much better the game was for computer. So I highly suggest that you do not buy this game for Gameboy Advance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun for Fans","review":"As a Lord of the Rings fan i was excited about the upcoming Game be Vivendi Universal. You can play as any part of the company of the ring, from the first book, \\" Fellowship of the Ring\\". The game follows the book very well, but the gameplay is a different story. In many areas you get stuck and find that the only way to get out of being stuck is by restarting the game. If you are willing to play, and play to finish the game, then you might find this a good game. The graphic are alright compared to others and you may find that it seems to have a dark tint. If you are a fan of the book you will enjoy this game, if not, i sugjest finding a different game to play"},{"rating":"1","title":"BUGS CANNOT FINISH GAME","review":"Do not buy this game it has bus bugs and more bugs. You cannot finish it. End of story. It gets zero stars. (0)*"},{"rating":"1","title":"burned 3 times!","review":"I bought this for my daughter last Christmas. She was so excited she started playing right away. Shortly after she said there was a glitch. 2 Frodo's would suddenly appear on the screen. I took it back, and since you can only exchange the item for the same item we did. Again the glitches. During battle the players would split and you'd have 2 Frodo's or Aragorn etc.. on screen. We threw it out. Later we found several on a discount rack, Spiro's, race cars and LOTR's. So I figure what the heck, third times the charm right? WRONG. The third one had glitches also. MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT. Especially because it wasn't an all battle game. It has action and puzzle solving too. It just should have had the glitches worked out before it was marketed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bad Video Game","review":"Don't buy this video game for the Nintendo Game Boy Advance. Vivendi Univeral's \\"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring\\" has too many glitches in it that cause it to freeze. So, therefore, it is imossible to beat this game becuase of the glitches. Skip this title and buy EA's \\"The Two Towers\\" and \\"The Return of the King\\" for the Game Boy Advance instead. Besides, \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" is a boring game for the Game Boy Advance anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This game is based on the movie but is not much like it as far as exciting goes. Don't waste your money on such a buggie game! It would be worth buying the two towers instead. The two towers for GBA starts early in the movie so you won't miss the some of the first seens in the Fellowship. My advice is NOT to buy this game!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Buggiest Game I've ever seen","review":"Is this the same GBA \\"Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Rings\\" that was produced by Vivendi? Now it is said to be by \\"Jack of All Games\\". If this is the same cartrige, and it looks identical, this is the buggiest game I've ever seen. I have never even been able to get out of Rivendell, because Bilbo won't drop Sting, the Elves won't drop Gimli's Axe, and Gimli doesn't show up at the exit to get his axe. Unless these things happen you cannot leave Rivendel. I have played through to Rivendell twice, and it just gets stuck there. There are numerous other bugs as well, the game freezes in the house where you fight spiders, and when you enter the mines of Moria, although I have never even gotten that far. This would be a good game, if it worked. But it does not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Many Glitches","review":"For those of you who are considering buying this game on gameboy advance, I recommend you change your mind. The graphics are great, but several times when I was playing it, my character would freeze up or get stuck in a corner, and I had to restart the whole game. And in the Mines of Moria, when you finally find the exit, the character freezes and won't move past a certain point. It may work on other consoles, but I'm not sure because I haven't tried it yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok game","review":"This game is Ok.

For instance, when in the Mines of Moria, the game will freeze at a certain point. It was very frustrating, but it is a common problem and can be worked around by going to the customer service website.The game ends suddenly when Boromir tries to take the ring from Frodo. It is very annoying having to wait for the next game before you can continue the quest!Other than that, the game is very fun & challenging. It is especially good for long car trips!"},{"rating":"1","title":"AVOID THIS GAME!!!","review":"I was shocked to find so many glitches in this game! Give me a break; shouldn't products like this be tested and retested? I am not even talking about the silly and useless actions I was forced to take to make certain events happen, I am talking about outright glitches! I totally gave up when I got stuck in Rivendell. I can't leave the place; the elves won't give me an item I need and there is nothing I can do except start over from the beginning. Forget that! I started Two Towers; it's much less boring and inane, and so far, no glitches."},{"rating":"2","title":"AVOID THIS GAME AT ALL COSTS!","review":"I was really looking forward to an RPG for the Lord of the Rings, and, well, this isn't it. It's really dissappointing--the story is killed with absolutely NO drama, the music is skimpy and barely playing, and there are almsot no fights. Not that it should be a problem because it's a bare-bones system, with extreme difficulty, slow moving enemies, and confusing mechanics. To make the game even worse, you wander aimlessly through repeating areas to look for an \\"item\\" that helps you progress through. Although that's not a bad thing for many GBA games such as Castlevania, you'll spend pointless hours searching for an item so you could pass to the next area with the same system. It's gotten old, and this game does it poorly. So get the Two Towers game from EA Games (for PS2, GC, and XBox) and get a much, much better game with an excellent amount of action."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was fun until Rivendell.","review":"This game was fun until I got to Rivendell and I couldn't find Gimli. I had read this was a bug and I thought I was prepared because he was supposed to be in a certain location that I read about online, but he wasn't there! I could not leave Rivendell and then I found another bug where if I dropped items and left the room they simply disappeared in Rivendell. I couldn't continue and was very frustrated. Up to then I thought the game was cool. Now I'm very unhappy."},{"rating":"2","title":"There's no glitches!","review":"I don't get what everybdy is talking about. I haven't had any glitches and I'm in Troll cCountry. This game has great graphics and sound. Well, sure, it's hard. But that's the point.

At $14.95 it is not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Title","review":"This book should be titled \\"How to Bend Aluminum\\". It is poorly written and even worse when it comes to the useless illustrations.

I for one think this games' graphics are great, especially through progressive scan. Awesome character designs and very unique textures. Where this game really shines are the awesome, huge worlds you traverse through. I found myself not being able to wait to see what new world i was going to unlock. Each level has 8-10 goals that you can tackle in any order, making it an extremely non-linear game. One area that this game really shines in is the PUZZLE DESIGN! Some of the puzzles in these levels are INGENIOUS! This game is truly for hardcore platforming fans only, if you can't handle your analog stick to perform precise jumping, crawling or maneuvering, you need to stick to your first person shooters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vexx Rules","review":"I read alot on this game and think it sounds great.

It displays his virtuosity on almost all tracks. With long, running lines, and fast technical playing, Tatum is truly a genius.

Even my 9 year old figured out that the song following the child's narrative, was in her words \\"completely random\\".I don't know why the narrative wouldn't have a strong(er) relationship to the song. That aside, the songs chosen are perfect for very young children, under age 10. But there is no way you are going to \\"learn\\" Japanese by listening to this CD. The best result would be that you and a child would improve listening comprehension, which isn't a bad goal, but isn't how I interpreted the CD as advertised."},{"rating":"2","title":"asking for an information","review":"Hi ,We are running a pub here iN Marmaris Turkey.Since long time we are looking for the production place on lite ice cubes to import here to Turkey to sale.If you would like to make business with us to sale this product here in Turkey to the clubs please ,inform us about the details...If you do not prefer to make business together would you help us where to find the production center of this product in china or in Europe...Thank youSincerelYBar SoydanZulal UyAnik"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a blast!","review":"These are a real hit with everyone, from kiddie parties to Bar-B-Q's!

The way Paley states his argument is flawless, and he uses all the resources available by his time. His arguments, of course, are no longer useful to creationists, this book was written way before Darwin and Wallace structure their theory, but at his time this was a must read. Even Darwin and Wallace read the book lots of years later, when they were students, and this book imprint (at least as I'm concern) a great prejudice Darwin had to surpass to establish his theory. It is so well written, and, again, so well founded, that dismiss it was quite a task. Recently Dawkins wrote a book \\"The blind Watchmaker\\" that was inspired by Paley's \\"Natural Theology\\", and solidly refutes his arguments (irrefutable in Paley's time, since no scientific evidence or theory had been powerfully establish as to do so).

Currently I have been able to get my system back to where it was prior to attempting this installation. If I could only get it to keep from locking up I would be there. To the writers of the latest code for this card, you shoud be hung from the highest tree.

It says this card is worth [$$$] give or take five cents. The new one, supposedly comming out in August or September, is much better, and is going to be at a retail price of [$$$]. Itis MUCH better, and definately worth the wait. HOWEVER, if you must buy a new graphics card now, you should get the NVIDIA ti 4600 by VISION TREK. Not, by PNY, their customer service is very bad, even though they give a very good warranty. (Even read other reviews about PNY consumers). The NVidia 4600 is much better than the ATI 8500, however again, when the ATI 9700 comes out, that will take the crown. Until than, the NVidia 4600 is proudly wearing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be aware of ATI products","review":"I agree with others opinion that if you get lucky and the card installs properly this product is great.

First of all, when I bought it, it said on a box that FREE VideoStudio 6.0 by Ulead is included. Well it wasn't, instead there was VideoStuio 5.0 which I wasn't able make it work. Secondly, when I tried to contact ATI by email I was getting stupid autoreply totally unrelated to my question why ATI company is cheating their customers.

The end result was video with vertical lines on both the DVD player and the TV software. Spent 4 more days trying to fix the problem but just gave up in the end and went back to my old ATI card.

Certainly not.The problem is, sometimes it happens. Hassell, Riley, Reich et al are usually in this situation. Now that their studies of non-Western music have been exploited and rampantly overused by anyone from hip-hoppers to electronica artist as well as avant-garders, their legacy is muddled by nay-sayers and not very knowledgeable folks. A shame indeed.Hence, the music of Hassel in Power Spot and Fourth World Music is what the latter day acolytes should be measured against, not viceversa.That said, the music itself is a thrill to experience for the first time (and well beyond).

He consigned it to what is a certain and inevitably obscure death."},{"rating":"1","title":"Finnegans Wake Me Up","review":"One wonders how many of the positive (4 or 5 stars) reviewers here are either (1) intellectual poseurs who say they've read the book cover to cover but actually haven't read more than a little; or (2) if they have read it in its entirety, whether they have too much spare time on their hands.One thing it is not (contrary to what some pretentious reviewers here would have you believe) is a \\"fun read\\" or \\"page turner\\".Despite some glittering word play and demonstrations of great scholarship, Finnegan's wake is a hulking mess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finnegans Wake: Not Just a Book, and Experience","review":"I'm 13 years old, however, I started The Wake when I was 12, and I must say, it is possibly the best book I've ever read. I think that Joyce's use of language, puns, allusions, and references other pieces of work,completely unlike the Wake, was amazing and better than Lolita, Pale Fire, and Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. His main theme is renewal and the fact that history is cyclilic. This is represented by an abundant number of things, such as the fact that he has exactly 1001 characters, and that he has the first and last sentences combine.

Thank goodness for the look inside features at amazon, so that people will be able to know what to expect when ordering Finnegans Wake. The novel has no plot and lacks the vivid descriptions of seemingly meaningless things that made Joyce's other novels so great. Here, he picks random foreign words and places them wherever he please just to make his book seem original and artistic.

Probably upset with the over analysis of Ulysses, Joyce must have set out to play a trick on the literary world.

This book is the bane of my existence. James Joyce must have self-inflicted mercury poisoning in order to write this. The only other plausible explanation is that he became severely mentally retarded from a lack of flow of oxygen to the brain. If you want to actually understand anything, you have to read explanations EVERY \\"sentence\\". This turns it into a f'n time vampire. It is terrible in every aspect - there are no plot, characters, situations, comedy, horror, storyline, or anything else that books usually consist of. If the author came back to life, became unretarded, and then read his own book again, he would instantly want to drown himself in Lake Michigan. I award him no stars and may God have mercy on his soul."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contemptious","review":"The pretence here is to say that if you don't think its brilliant then the you must be a vacuous superficial fool. Its the same stunt as pulled by 'modern-art', whose lack of popularity and understanding among most people lends it a perverse exclusivity among irrational psuedo-intellectuals.No one 'understands' this book because there is nothing in it. Its not hard-going because it is so mentally challenging, its hard going because it is so uttlerly uninspiring. A dime pulp romance novel tells us more than this book can.If someone crafted your house with the same 'wondrous perception' as Joyce crafted this book, it would be rubble sunk in cement dust."},{"rating":"2","title":"Iteration","review":"FW is not a piece of literature. It is beyond literature: It approaches life and non-life. Is life easily analyzed and coherent? Is non-life? Joyce recognized the dichotomy and tried to capture the incapturable in words. He taunts the reader with meaning and the critic with nonsense. Ultimately, both the divergencies converge and vice versa. Take a look at the Mandelbrot fractal: Numbers approach nil and infinity giving alluring patterns in a mimicry of life and non-life.

I think maybe a hundred or so people in the entire world might enjoy digging through this but the rest of us can put this one aside. Don't fall for that snobby \\"Well, it's not for lazy or stupid people\\" nonsense. This is nothing more than a self absorbed word puzzle for those who do not have lives to live but have plenty of time to waste deciphering this.

I think it's the biggest hoax ever perpetrated on a gullible literary world, and if James Joyce was sane (as I seriously doubt) then he must have had a huge laugh at its expense. However, I think he must've been totally nuts to write such garbed nonsense.I read the glowing reviews by other readers praising Joyce's \\"genius\\" and begin to doubt my own sanity. Is it possible I just can't read as well as I've always thought I can?However, I truly think they're just afraid to express their real opinion, after so many have called this thing a work of genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"In Defense","review":"this book is great for the very reasons it is hating. in response to the reviewer who noted that with a program he could write a sequel and that most Joyce scholars wouldn't tell the difference. Well, the important thing about this book is that Joyce sat down and actually did it. Art moves forward by a few souls cutting down what lie in front of them, and plant something new. Then others come, and hybrid that with the past, and so on. This work is important because he could down everything in front, and replaced it with something so different, hybrids are impossible. So what if its pure gibberish? In madness there is always an essence of genius, and in this madness, the stench of genius permiates throughout. i say that we can scorn it all we want, but if we do, it should be with a grain in awe in that someone had the audacity to go out, and hurl this challenge back at us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Understanding \\"Switters\\"","review":"In Tom Robbins \\"Fierce Invalids Home From Warm CLimates\\" the main character Switters is attempting to read this book and never gets though the first 5 pages.

But then a friend of mine tells me that people can get away with a lot more in books than they can in other mediums, because so few people read these days. Buy this book. Pick any page. Make sure it is daytime; reading late at night may cause insomnia. You do not have to finish or understand this book to enjoy it. It's like Joyce took all of human energy and made it into one huge handy random reference tome. Incredible. A sure cure for depression. When I discovered it I almost immediately felt like going out on the street and reading ramdom parts to random people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy This Version!","review":"This version of \\"Finnegans Wake\\" is the uncorrected version. Joyce spent the final years of his life correcting \\"Finnegans Wake\\", and this book omits all of those corrections.

Weak compared to his other works.","review":"While Joyce's Ulysses demonstrates his monstrous success with literary experimentation styles, FW does not. I find it poor by his standards. In academics (and among pseudo-intellectuals) the book is quite fashionable, and understably so - the style is unique. Its almost comical to listen to my fellow Joyce fans rave about it. But whenever I corner them, and beg them to dissect the work for me, the responses are as incoherent as the book itself. Perhaps it inspires creative thinking/translation from its readers, but nothing of the sort on my part, despite my repeated efforts to sincerely read it.I've read far worse, that's for sure, but someone thinking of dabbling with Joyce for the first time should seriously consider selecting one of his more substantial earlier works, or the frustration with FW may alienate them forever from an otherwise brilliant and often very powerful author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Houston...we have a problem","review":"I gave this book two stars because I admire anyone who can summon the sheer willpower needed to complete a novel of nonsense--particularly one with as much deadwood between the covers as this one. One must also admire the salemanship that must have been displayed when FW was presented to a publisher. If not for these factors it would have gotten one star. Please don't be sucked into the crowd that thinks a book is really good if they can't understand it.

Didn't he say he thought people would be laughing while reading it?But writing a book noone can understand..He must've been out of his tiny little mind. Couldn't he have written another play, or more short stories about the Eire he loved/despised.It makes no sense to me! Why would anyone want to read what is, basically, a mess.

And they can also write learned papers about it that they can publish in their academic journals. As William Goldman said in THE SEASON, \\"As long as there is a PhD. candidate alive, James Joyce will never die.\\" Joyce himself said something to the effect of: \\"The professors will be analyzing FINNEGAN'S WAKE forever.\\" John Lennon said, \\"All artist's are egomaniacs, whether they like to admit it or not.\\" And Joyce is indulging in egomania with FINNEGAN'S WAKE. He spent 17 years on this book because he knew people would spend (waste?) hours, days, years of their lives trying to get to the \\"truth\\" of FINNEGAN'S WAKE, and feel superior to the great unwashed who don't even know such a work of literature exists.

Possibly, this particular cooling pad works optimally with only certain laptops."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"Product is light weight, comfortable, and works well to provide a level working surface on your lap while allowing the laptop to get sufficient air flow."},{"rating":"2","title":"We like them","review":"I purchased two Lapinator's plus, and two Mousitizer's for my wife and I. These were shipped to New Zealand and arrived within a week.We both have Alienware 15.4' laptops that are quite heavy and get a little warm :) (hot). I am always in shorts and we have both found them excellent.We like the way it protects our legs from the heat and the soft padding on the underside of them. Also we like that they are strong and can easily take the weight of our laptop's when we move then from our lap to a table etc.As to the 'mousitizer' we think they should be wider, that is from front to back, not wider, as out from the Lapinator. We both find/found that the mouse was a bit to far away for comfortable use. But as a add on to the Lapinator, it works well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much, MUCH better available... I suggest you keep looking","review":"I am not at all pleased with \\"the Lapinator\\" product.

Love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It Works Great!","review":"It really works! This is my second one. I have the smaller one at my boyfriend's place. My laptop gets hot since it is a 12\\" with a touchscreen. And I can really tell the difference. I give it 4 stars because it isn't the most comfortable for a lap but it isn't uncomfortable. I would really give it 4.5. And the mouse piece is great. Don't need it with the plus and small laptops but definitely need it for the smaller lapinator. JustMake sure you put the border on or the mouse slides off. The border foam is included. I bought two so I do love this product. It may have a silly name but it definitely works!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Got a Laptop? You'll need the Lapinator/Mousitizer","review":"I got my wife one of these 2-3 years ago but I always used my laptop on a desk until recently. If I had paid attention to her use of the Lapinator with Mousitizer, I would have gotten one a long time ago. The lap table has space for my 17\\" laptop and a clip-on USB LED light. The Mousitizer is what makes this combo work so well. The table itself insulates from the heat, and the Mousitizer fits snuggly to the table. I think the optional rubber bumper border is a must to block your wireless mouse from falling off at the slightest tilt of the table. I tried another laptop table brand that folds for travel, but at home I don't use anything but the Lapinator."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laminator Plus","review":"I was really disappointed to find this pad is two seperate pieces; I assumed the mouse pad slid out, but it doesn't.

I wasn't expecting much but when the Lapinator finally arrived it became a must have for several people in my living area. It was light weight and the non-skid feet would allow you to prop the computer up a little without worrying about it falling over. Even after a marathon session of gaming on an off day my legs we're hot from the laptop and the feet allow a good bit of air flow to go under the computer so even my computer was cooler than expected.! My only complaint is the mouse part is rather flimsy and putting a lot of pressure can cause it to fall off and just using it causes it to slant downward.4/5"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Knife","review":"This knife was everything i expected and more.

I mean, they dont bother tagging those on unless it is a widely known band. Hatebreed are not fanpleasers, great live, and have strangely undertstandable vox on this album. They've got the emotion many bands with the same formula lack, and thats what set them apart from others. They've got the feeling of hxc and the temps of mxc. It's not so much a blend of the two, but their own interpretation of both. This is beyond mediocre, but its not going to blow you away. They have more talent but this is the sound they like and their slight maturing of their sound is what keeps them going strong. This is what people see as a defining album, but its nothing of the sort, it simply excels at what its set out for. Breakdowns designed for the mosh it seems, if you get into it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good metal.","review":"They are no doubt talented in their genre of music. Very fast paced music as always, this CD is full of hardcore guitar riffs. I can't help but to always picture a crazy mosh pit involved in every one of their songs. If I were to choose a single song to decide whether or not to buy this CD, I would pick the song \\"Last Breath\\". Some good metal. Rhapsody categorized this album as well as Hatebreed in general under \\"Metalcore\\". Remember that if you are going to buy this album, this is Hatebreed so expect a whole lotta screaming. Hatebreed to me is the official \\"head banging, mosh pit\\" band of today, and this album definitely shows it.

Martial is a lively, urbane poet with a razor-sharp wit; his language is precise and powerful. James Michie's translation is insipid as poetry, and often unrecognizable when set next to the Latin. A single example: Mr. Michie has a penchant for translating simple Latin words like \\"terra\\" into configurations like \\"turf and dew,\\" rather than the obvious and elegantly simple \\"earth.\\" In Michie's translation, Martial's more beautiful elegiac lyrics are made gaudy and his urban bullets of observation become flaccid.

It was kind of cheesy in places (like those stupid flashbacks that are supposed to be heartwarming and touching but are really just annoying) but the action sequences are really good.

Finally he has picked a movie with a decent supporting cast and a good story. Unlike previous films, Van Damme's kickboxing and martial arts skills are blended nicely with real life situations and drama. This movie deserved a theatrical release, the action is tasteful and the movie has a quick but meaningful pace. Some of the characters have some tired dialogue about being presecuted, but that aside the actors fit their roles. Overall the movie ranks among one of Van Dammes better emotional roles.

I would say that this is a major design flaw on a product designed to restrain your dog while on a walk.I wouldnt say that my dog is particularly bright so if he can figure this out within 5 minutes on his first walk I'm sure any dog can.

There was action, there were character moments, and there was drama. Richard Dean Anderson's return appearances are always welcome, and while he didn't dominate the episode, he had more than just a token appearance. This movie was a worthy addition to a dedicated fan's collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Continuum","review":"Good fun.

The story line and characters kept the action moving"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great job on this one","review":"I was a bit disappointed with Ark of Truth. The actors did a great job, but there were too many gaps in the story. This, however, was a really, really good film. It was fantastic to see so many people brought back for this one. The special effects were great, and the actors did a great job, too.It wasn't perfect, however.People vanishing from an altered timeline... That just doesn't happen. There are infinite possible universes out there, and when travelling through time, you create a new branch. You don't destroy things in the parallel universes. It's a fundamental part of the Stargate universe.Ignoring that, however, the film is terrific. If you need your SG-1 fix, with plenty of action, special effects, and cast members, this delivers. Great job by everyone.Sci-fi Channel, Please make more!Everyone else, Please buy this so they will!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Stargate Movie","review":"My thoughts on this are really simple. Go to Google and type in \\"SG-1 Movie Sneak Peak\\". Watch it. That's all you'll need to know. I sat through this DVD when the lights were out during Gustav. We'd been without power for three days and watched it from a laptop computer. The whole family loves Stargate and we were desperate for entertainment.During the movie...We. Were. Bored. To. Tears. I actually stopped watching at one point. Since I post my reviews on Amazon, I have to give it something. One out of five and again, that's only because I have to cough up something."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT story, BUT ......","review":"I REALLY enjoyed this movie. And bringing Baal AND Apophis back was truly inspired.ONE reviewer here said that he did not understand how Daniel got his leg back. Uhhh ... DUH!! OBVIOUSLY he got himself a PROSTHETIC leg.The reason I only gave this movie 4 stars was because in other reviews on other sites, it was said that there were going to be hints about a NEW PROPOSED SG series called STARGATE: UNIVERSE.I saw NO such hints. BUT, I suppose that it could be because, last I read, SG: UNIVERSE is still up in the air as to whether it will be produced or not. I really hope it IS produced, it sounds like a very unique concept in the SG franchise."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of SG-1","review":"This is a great episode. It was good to see Don Davis as General George Hammond for the last time. It was a parade of many loved characters, though Braytac and Dr. Fraiser were missing.

The twists in the end caught me off guard, because you won't expect what eventually happens to resolve the storyline. It felt a little bit cheap, like a 2 part TV episode more than a epic movie finale. On the other hand if, it didn't end the way it does, then it would have felt like a rehash of a previous episode. You'll know what I'm talking about if you see it.My biggest complaint is the time traveling and alternate timeline themes didn't do enough to capture your imagination the way \\"Back to the Future\\" films do. But if you are a Stargate Fan, this is a can't miss DVD/bluray."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"I love Stargate but both movies have been average at best,Continuum is just not very engaging the actors all seem like they would rather be someplace else, the core cast is woefully under used and the pacing as with The Ark Of Truth is completely off, worst of all the storyline has been done before and better in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I read all those wonderful reviews and then watched the film. I was disappointed and felt like another reviewer - let down.I have been a Stargate SG1 and Stargate Alantis fan for years. It was cool to see them together for a brief few moments but then it turned out to be another episode. Where was the originality, the interaction, the character development? This movie could have rocked the house instead I went and made dinner. Returning to realize I didn't need to rewind. Admittedly, I did rewind the first time but then didn't bother for the second and third. I was getting bored.I wish it was more and I think the disappointment was in I expected it to be more than just another episode. Everything was so predictable - a cash cow.I am so glad I rented. I won't waste my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stunk","review":"I am a die hard stargate fan...this movie was really bad....wish that stargate would stop taking advantage of its loyal fan base by making this straight to DVD movies....end the series or put in back on the air...(i would have much prefered to pay $10 to go see on big screen vs buying the expensive dvd.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously Disappointing","review":"The original Stargate movie was pretty good, but I apparently missed at least one in between, because this one seemed to be assuming I knew things about the characters that I did not know. And to be honest, I couldn't seem to care. For one thing, it involved time paradoxes that provided apparently random kinks in the plot. So much ended up depending on whether character 1 recognized character 2, and vice versa. Again, dependent on at least one movie I missed, or on seriously poor writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stargate SG1...Continuum","review":"I enjoyed the movie, the only complaint I have is.......please let O'neill and Carter get together....at last! They have come so close and still are bound by military regulations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent fun!","review":"The Ark of Truth was an o.k. movie. I liked it because it is Stargate and because I wanted to see the actors again. Continuum, on the other hand, is superb. The story is great, the actors are fabulous - that's what SG1 was all about a couple of years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stargate: The Review","review":"Slow at times, but overall an excellent and fun addition to the Stargate story. Over the years I've thoroughly enjoyed any episode that deals with using the gate for other purposes than just \\"going off-world\\" - intentionally or unintentionally. The way this story happened - as a result of Ba'al trying to manipulate an entire galaxy just to save himself from being destroyed (how self-absorbed the Goau'ld can be) - seemed very in-line with the Stargate universe and a natural adventure SG-1 would have.I like the treat at the end with the picture in the locker.From a strictly \\"Amazon.com purchaser\\" perspective, I pre-ordered the item and it arrived within 24-hours, even with 2-day shipping.

Ark of Truth was so much better, it served a purpose in the SG-1 time-line. Continuum, was just another episode of the show, rather contrived I might add. Seeing Claudia Black as Quetesh was one of the highlights. This movie really should have served to add more back story to the characters, revisit a storyline like (\\"2001\\" or \\"2010\\") or advance the SG universe like finally having full disclosure. Basically I'm glad I waited to buy until it was half price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Borrow, don't buy!","review":"A very predictable thrown-together movie to make a few more bucks from an otherwise outstanding series.

This is one of the best stories of the series. I've watched it twice and am eager for a third time.It's great to see Jack back, of course. The story line kept me guessing, and the action scenes were very good and not overdone. The CG is absolutely amazing and fits in without looking gimicky.This movie really brought me back to the feel of the first few series, yet we have characters that span all 10 series.

The plot was... different. I enjoyed it but it seemed to go by fast.Stars: *****"},{"rating":"2","title":"A feature length episode, but a good one","review":"With Continuum being the last entry into the Stargate SG-1 story, they do a good job of tying up the one real remaining loose end, namely Ba'al. He is up to his usual tricks of trying to take over the galaxy and the SG-1 team is again tasked with saving the day. Like a lot of the episodes, SG-1 gets itself into a pretty deep pickle before finally coming through in the end, but it's a good story and certainly worth watching. But, like all of the Star Trek movies that came out after the show's finale, this movie is just a longer version of an episode that might have aired on the SciFi network during the show's run."},{"rating":"2","title":"Miss the series","review":"I was very upset when they took this series off the air.

If you know a bit about Stargate but never really watched most of the episodes you can still really enjoy this movie as it is a self contained story. Unfortunetly it still has Ben and Claudia in it but this time they somehow manage to not be so dominating and distracting.I would have given it 5 stars if they could have changed the timeline even more so that Ben and Claudia where still doing Farscape and the SGC was back to it's orginal cast."},{"rating":"2","title":"StarGate Fan","review":"Stargate: Continuum is a good watch for anyone who has been a fan of the series. I've bought both this one and Stargate - The Ark of Truth, and enjoyed both. I think The Ark of Truth may have been a little better, but that is a personal judgement."},{"rating":"2","title":"In My World of Stargate Continuum","review":"It was a great deal and easy to order using Amazon. The seller was fast, the package was secured, and more important, I was happy when I got it. Once it arrived, I took it out of the package and popped it in the DVD player. When I heard the opening theme, I was in sci-fi heaven. I love Stargate SG1 and was sad to see it go. I am now starting my collection of the series since there are a lot of episodes I've never gotten to see. For me, I like watching the behind the scenes portion. I write screenplays myself and so I learn a lot from the director's and actor's point of view. If you're not into that stuff, it's still a kick to watch! I can even deal with the historical babble that Daniel rattles off. Enjoy the ride!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DisCONTINUUM immediately!","review":"The producers of this franchise know they have a great fan base, but now after several years of making an intelligent and entertaining sci-fi series I think they've given in to intellectual laziness. If \\"Continuum\\" is the new standard of what we (the fans) can expect to see in the future from this franchise, then they should just stop making these films now. The plot to \\"Continuum\\" is silly, the narrative (the story and how it is told) is completely bland and devoid of life. It was as though all these characters we have come to know, suddenly had their souls written out of the script."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Decent Story, But Minimal Budget and Lack of Action Drag Down","review":"I watched this movie hoping for closure to the franchise, and it delivered. But it still lacked that typical SG-1 zing to it that leaves a philosophical thought or critical sequence in your head for days. This movie shows great potential, but ultimately it acts as only a closer, giving no real satisfaction to the watcher. Hardcore SG-1 fans will enjoy this movie, but if you're not a long time fan or only watch the show occasionally, may as well give this one a miss. Due to a seemingly crammed together and rushed storyline."},{"rating":"1","title":"My least favorate episode,or movie of any stargate","review":"I've seen every Stargate SG1 and Atlantis Episodes and movie.The reason I didn't like it was the one thing I loved about the shows that for the most part, they were clean. This one had a couple almost goryscenes. Not to mention the swearing was like star trek 4 and 5, were all of the sudden your Heroes of many years start having potty mouths, it's so unnecessary. I was looking forward to an all new sg1 were they tackle something new, not a rehash of the same old thing. It seems like The industry is turning to the Dark side again with the success of an over the top Dark Knight being so succesful, the feel good adventure will need a comeback. Please bring the SG1 team back for a good adventure!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not satisfied","review":"I purchased Stargate continium and when I received it they sent me Steel magnolias instead I have contacted the company 3 times anf=d after 3 weeks I have heard nothing I will not purchasing anything through Amazon again or its partners"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun movie, bad Blu-Ray","review":"I should have gone with the DVD. The image quality on this is the worst of any Blu-Ray in my collection. It looks like a DVD, actually. That said, it bogs down my HTPC more than any other Blu-Ray in my collection. It stops, lurches, and the sound gets really out of sync. It also flips out completely for a few frames here and there and displays a randomly colored pixelated image.The movie itself is a good rompin' episode of the sci fi classic. But save your money and get the DVD.UPDATE: I upgraded the firmware on my LG drive and it solved most of the issues with this disc. The lurching/stuttering/syncing problems are gone. It still goes bonkers with the pixelated image from time to time. For the most part, the disc is now watchable. But it's still a very disappointing Blu-Ray."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Loved This Movie","review":"I really liked the story line in this movie, and I loved the fact that Richard Dean Anderson was in it as well.The only issue I have with the movie is that I would have liked to have seen Richard Dean Anderson in more of it.

It was not their best effort but it was still Stargate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old plots with very little action.","review":"Not for my taste. \\"Stargate: Continuum\\" has a very old plot that has been reused over and over again in both \\"Stargate SG-1\\" as well as in sci-fi stories in general. The first half is lacking in action, and you don't see much of O'Neill in this one. He shows up in the first few minutes of the film and the last few, but that's it. And the story is lacking in structure. The second half of the movie wasn't that bad, but still not worth wasting your money on.Not recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blu-ray quality same as upconverted DVD","review":"The quality of the image compression was the same as the up-converted DVD of Ark of Truth I just watched a few days before. There was no comparison in watching the Arctic scenes (so-so) vs Planet Earth Blu-Ray (great). Not sure why they'd even release this as blu-ray unless they're pulling a fast one.The story had holes in it bigger than the gate itself. When time changed, people were disappearing like Back to the Future style. poof? The paradoxes are ridiculous.. like why is Baal able to travel back and stop the stargate from arriving in the US. if he did that, he wouldn't know about Earth in the first place. where did Baal get Anubis's ship? how did Daniel's leg reappear? why make mitchell the hero? you'd think for a $7mil budget, they'd pull a better script together.I think the only thing I enjoyed was Vala as a villain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Close but no cigar","review":"This movie includes all of the traditional \\"Stargate\\" favorites, from Jack O'Neill to General Landry, but without the humor that made the series so enjoyable.

I wish I had heeded some of the reviews I saw on here. First of all, it is difficult to read the water level lines on the inside of the pot. I am young and thought it couldn't be that bad. It is. I have to hold the pot directly under a light to see the markings at all. Also, I often find that my rice is not cooked through when the cooker indicates it is finished. The final straw for me is that it is pretty cumbersome to clean. If it made perfect rice, the cleanup wouldn't be an issue, but I'm not sure that the rice in this cooker has ever turned out as good as the cheap one I used to have that I picked up at Target. I am now going back to a cheaper model - don't want to spend a bunch of money to end up with a dud again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect rice, every time","review":"This rice cooker is so easy to use: decide how many cups of rice to make, throw it in, put in water up to the line that matches the number of cups of rice, close the lid and plug it in, and you're done. Total cooking time for one cup of white rice, which is about right for two people, is about 15-20 minutes.

Here are the reasons:1) No handles for the pot. I can't take the pot for the rice out without using a potholder or towel. There are no handles for easy lifting in and out.2) Pot is not secure. When I want to get my rice out, I have to use a towel or potholder to hold onto the pot because it won't stay still when I'm scooping out my rice.3) No beep for finished rice. Why isn't there a beep or a noise to indicate when the rice is done cooking?4) Over-warms rice. I left the cooker on with rice in it overnight, and instead of being yummy the next morning, it was mostly dried out and hard. What a waste of rice!In retrospect, I should have shipped my original rice cooker back with me from Japan. It had all these features, and I got it third-hand.

This is so poorly made rice cooker, even it is said keep rice at least 24 hours fresh. I am wondering how this one get so much good review. This is another reason not to buy at the Amazon,if you are not sure about the item. Buy your local store, and return it when products disppointed in you. I had few cheap rice cookers, couldn't keep rice warm, at least it dosen't make rice dry and porridge at same time. Don't buy this products.

Not so with this one. I have major issues with the unit's cleanability. The lid is hinged and is not removable for easy cleaning. The inside of the lid had a scale on it after cooking and I was hesitant to clean it thoroughly because it seemed to be something of a mystery substance and I was afraid that I would scratch it. There is a trough that catches condensation and is also difficult to clean. Likewise with the extremely flimsy gasket.

The size is nice to have more leftover rice for the next dinner. It is easy to clean but the switch sometimes doesn't work and twice the rice wasn't cooking, just on warm.

This machine follows the \\"KISS\\" principle to a T. While the lid doesn't bobble anymore due to the vent, it works fine.

Honestly, pick up \\"Dwele - Subject\\" or \\"Kem - Kemistry\\" instead. This album is not hot, don't believe the hype! And whoever said that Musiq in on the same level as Maxwell, must be deaf! At any rate, the best song on the entire album is \\"forthenight\\" (for the night), which they play so frequently on the radio.

It definetly does not live up to the traditional Musiq style that I am used to. The lyrics are ok, but the beats are not as tight as the first album which was by far the best. Or even the second album which was not as good as the first but it was ok. It seems like with each album Musiq's rhythms start to wander off. Musiq is known for his beats, rhythms, sounds and mezmorizing words in his songs. Did he get new producers or something? If so he needs to go back to the original ones because this album is the worst by far. Musiq I know you can do much better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Chalk another good CD for Musiq","review":"Musiq's new CD is fantastic effort. Even though his music has generally maintained the same format, there are some slight differences with this CD than his previous ones. It seems as if he went for more of an orchestrated feel with this one. In many songs, there are quite a but of this. And it works out really well. There are a lot of strong tracks on here. My favorite tracks are \\"moment in life\\" w/Kindred and Cee-Lo, \\"womanopoly\\" and \\"infatueighties\\". There's pretty much only one song I can't stand and that is \\"miss you\\". And there's another song that I'm indifferent about, so this prohibits me from giving it a perfect 5 stars, but this is nothing but quality and I would definitely recommend it to most fans of R&B and Hip-Hop. At least those who aren't swayed by most of the mainstream trash that they hear on the radio."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Soul Star he is","review":"this album is so old school in its heavy hitting beats.

But we need more than just unclever words and same story scenarios. The only song worth listening to was the first one after the intro. I forced myself to listen to the rest. Womanopoly?

Also...stop remaking original songs if you DO NOT have the voice for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The second was better, the first was best","review":"I was pretty disappointed with this CD, and don't think I'll be buying another Musiq CD because he seems to be going downhill.

His playing on the Professionals \\"I Didn't See It Coming\\" record is incredible. The guitar tandem of Ray and Steve Jones (sex pistOls) on that record was, as far as I'm concerned, the punk equivalent of Keith Richards and Ron Wood. Tasteful, catchy, weaving guitar lines that are stuck in my head forever.There is none of that here. Like many industrial records, everything is so sludged in effects, you can't make out any style at all. There are also appearances by a few other artists I dig, but the same problem exists there.If you need another industrial record, this is better than Filter, or any of that nonsense, but it's nothing that's going to change your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five Stars For Children's Version","review":"This is an excellent adaptation that leaves out some of the more sinister elements/overtones.

Oliver has a pet toad named Squeakers, Fagin has a parrot that \\"parrots\\" back Fagin's words (even when it gets him in trouble), there are a few more birds in the thieves abode and a cat. Naturally the cat scraps with Bill Sike's dog Bullseye, providing a comedic break.Other than being somewhat disappointed/annoyed by the lack of \\"color\\" in Fagin's voice, I found this thoroughly entertaining. It follows the book quite well for a 90 min. version. It is for the young set, grades K-1 to 5-6.It will be more palatable to many families than the G rated Broadway film, Oliver Twist, The Musical. The latter is more touching, heartbreaking, and real for some sensitive youngsters. It is over the top wonderful for all... except ages 0-7 or 8.Addl Note---My copy says 1973 on the back."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think Scratch was exciting and romantic in this book.","review":"I feel Scratch had to have closure on the past as he had to find out the three men he first road with had in deed betrayed him and took his firs and left him to fend for his self.

And now Lola has 20 minutes to get 100,000 German Marks. The phone hits the floor and Lola starts running... Americans, who are usually not very fond of foreign movies, should not let the 'dubbed' stop them. Dare to watch it and a race is waiting for you. Tom Tykwer created a 90 minute video clip.

From the music, which fits this film better than any soundtrack ever has before (the visual to music rhythm sync job is incredible), to the break all the rules camera work (not a single cross-cut or quick-cut was superfluous!), to the flawless performances by all concerned, this is not just the best foreign film of the year, but simply must be included in anybody's Top Ten. For myself, I'd say it's easily among the top 25 of this decade. Yes, it's that exciting, amazing, and original.

Lola's extreme red hair and goofy outfit (blue tank top, white bra straps, turquoise pants, and black Doc Martin boots of all things) were distracting. The \\"driving music beat\\" (or however it was described), was fairly boring and repetitive.The commentary was only slightly more interesting than the movie. The two participants of writer/director Tom and lead actress Franka were a couple at the time, which accounts for the mutual admiration society feel of the commentary.There may have been a good idea for a movie here, but I could not find it. Close to being the least watchable movie (\\"Lost and Delirious\\", \\"The Smokers\\", \\"Black and White\\" and \\"Armageddon\\"). I nearly dozed off both times.I give the movie two stars for effort and concept, but I advise you to...\\"Run Away, Run\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible!

With all the hungry, talented musicians in the world, I would think this film maker could have found one that could provide decent music.Although I liked Potente in other films, it was difficult for me to find the characters interesting. Maybe I could forgive Lola for being in love, but her boyfriend seemed worthless.Yes, this film showed various futures that could have arisen from a single starting point.

Some of you have good points about the technical merits and originality, but I just could not get past the music, so for me it was not enjoyable. If the director and producer both had tin ears, there are millions of cheap, underpaid musicians in the world. Or just leave some of the more obnoxious music out.Germany/Austria has given so much great music to the world: Mahler, Brahms, Schumann, Beethoven, Haydn, Mozart, Handel, Bach, to name a few. It's a shame that this movie from Germany could not do better.The characters were difficult to identify with. Maybe that was intentional. It was difficult for me to understand why Lola cared about her worthless boyfriend.I have never rated a movie this low before, but there are some worse films than this.

Franka Potente is absolutely hypnotizing as Lola and the overall feel of the movie is romantic and fun.

I couldn't possibly think of another movie with such sheer cinematic buzz, it's cut like an MTV video: blink and you may miss a visual gag.The theme is doozy but interesting -- a slicing of the same reality in time into three perspectives. Blending an innovative mix of animation, still photography, slow motion, and normal cinematography, it illustrates how the smallest change in what a person does can alter the rest of their life, not to mention the lives of others, including complete strangers they pass on the street.Ironic, creative, and simply riveting -- a fabulous kinetic pleasure of a rental.

It is anything but interesting: the story is childish and shallow and the much talked about cinematography and the music are nothing more than cheap attempts to decorate the silly plot. For those of you who want to buy the movie, rent it first! If you are not a fad-driven kid who actually thinks MTV is a music television and Jewel a poet, then you'll surely dislike it.

So what?Watch him get on the phone to her and freak out. Repeatedly.Just tired of films about drugs and users and that entire scene.Shot in that annoying MTV music-video style.When will directors learn to stop swirling the camera and allow the actors to do what they were hired to do?Not a complicated concept at all, filmmakers. Leave the actors alone. That's right: point the camera at them and let them show that they can act. How about that? If they can't act, hire someone who can--but please stop the idiotic camera tricks. Tony Scott does it, Tarantino does it, Robert Rodriguez does it... Why? Because they don't trust their minimal talent. That's exactly why.You're giving us a headache, man. Get it?

Unfortunately, the running does get a bit tiresome, though it is interesting for much of its running time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Asolutely fantastic","review":"\\"Lola rennt\\" is definately one of my favourite films ever made. I especially love it because it is none of the typical German Hollywood imitations which have flood the video market for years. Indeed I have never watched a similar film. It spreads hope and makes us realise that we ourselves are responsible for our own destiny and that we always should think before we act."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dazzling German Cinema!","review":"This fast-paced, innovative and extremely entertaining German film features an inspired techno soundtrack and great use of editing, camera and sound to tell the story of Lola (Franka Potente) who must figure a way to get 100,000 marks in 20 minutes. This is the excellent premise that shoots off an extremely clever and modern piece of foreign cinema. Great performance, great story, kinetic pace, excellent techno soundtrack and attentive direction make this film and it's filmmaker one of the most promising things to come out of Germany in the 90's. Highly Recommended. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film an 8!"},{"rating":"2","title":"RUN To The Video Store and Buy This","review":"This has to be one of the finest foreign action films I have ever seen. Kudos to the Germans on making this a fast paced, edge of your seat fantasy-action, soon to be cult- classic masterpiece. It puts forth intruiging circumstances. What if you didn't miss the bus or what if you bought that lottery ticket? In this film Lola and her boyfriend get to play out three different outcomes to almost identical situations. The dubbing to English is annoying at first but you get used to it. It is slightly off emotion. This is a great addition to your DVD collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"German Film returns with a smash...","review":"Run Lola Run is a visually stunning film. It is a fast paced heart pounder which leaves you lterally breathless afterwards. The film is set to the backdrop of Berlin which the director shoots beautifully. The idea is fresh and unique and the effect is achieved quite well. The soundtrack is apporpriate, and the scenes well coreographed. this is definetely one of the best movies of 1999. Run Lola Run is a superb movie putting Germany back on the map of exquisite filmmaking countries. i hope to see more great exports soon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I must add my voice","review":"to those who are praising this movie. It is fun, it is profound, it is whimsical, it is confrontational--everything that Hollywood movies are not. It is the kind of movie that demands repeated viewings. A MUST BUY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Direct Hit","review":"This is the best action movie I've ever seen. I've never been a big fan of techno music before, but it is used so effectively in this movie that I found myself drawn to the soundtrack afterward. If you can appreciate cinematography like a fast-paced music video, you will absolutely love this film - guaranteed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous acting & soundtrack...you must see this movie!","review":"I saw this movie this summer, and I was absolutely blown away. Not only is the acting fantastic (especially by Franka Potente) but the subject matter was enthralling. Think \\"Sliding Doors\\" with an overdose of adrenaline. The concept of the movie (how would life be different if I hadn't run into that person?) encouraged hours of discussion among my friends. Besides the intellectual part, this movie is highly entertaining and there isn't enough dialogue for the subtitles to detract from the action. A must-see!"},{"rating":"1","title":"All style, no substance","review":"There are so many good things in this movie that I really wish that I could've liked it more. But, as it is, it felt like the cinematic equivalent of a video game. If you really do want to spend 80 minutes watching some chick running then I'd suggest waiting for the next Olympics. For a German movie with some depth, rent anything by Fassbinder, Herzog or Wenders."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Different\\" kind of movie!","review":"I bought the dvd of this movie after I read all those positive feedback from other viewers. However, this is not the type of movie that I'll be willing to wait for more than a month for viewing. As an overseas buyer,the movie, shipment waiting time, and the cost of buying it all doesn't meet my high expectation/anticipation level of the movie. I was expecting something more like \\"Le femme Nikita\\" not a story of 2 youngsters having three different ending of their problems. The only good thing from this movie, for me, is the music! Two thumbs up for the music selection..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time & money","review":"I never watched the entire video,I became disenchanted watching this style of German movie making.The use of cartoons takes much away from the story.

What if you had done things just a little differently, or what if you had done it a second earlier? What would the outcome be? How would it change? Find out just how much change there can be in Run Lola Run, where our heroine relives the same high-paced, action packed 20 minutes three times, each with a different outcome. Awesome heavy German dance music - great soundtrack. Available in both English dubbed, and original German format with subtitles. I love this movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Non-Stop Thrillride!","review":"Run Lola Run was recommeded to me when someone found out I was a German teacher. I rented it right away and was taken on a thrill ride! This movie is fast-paced, including a great soundtrack. Lola's character overcomes a lot in just twenty minutes and you get a sense of her life as you live out three different scenarios with her. As a German teacher I would love to show this movie to my students simply to point out countless aspects of German culture. The only downside for non-German speaking viewers is having to keep up with some quick subtitles from time to time when things get really fast paced! All in all, an excellent movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"innovative piece of cinema","review":"this is not the perfect film, however it is engagingly inventive and intelligent. the reality bending techniques (animated scenes, split second montages, and three separated sequences) expand the dimensions of cinema. no film in recent history has been able to break the norms of standard film so gracefully. if anything, it's worth renting, however it's not for everyone. it has a distinct taste that won't appeal to everyone. which is part of it's magic, it doesn't pander to what audiences want, it gives the audience what it needs: creativity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Lola Fun","review":"The plot is simple: Lola's boyfriend Manny gets dropped in the grease when he loses a fortune that belongs to a gang of thugs. Of course, they want to kill him. Of course, he knows his cool and devoted girlfriend, Lola, will figure out a way to get ahold of the money. And of course, she realistically doesn't have enough time to do it.What to do? Get the cash from Rich Banker Daddy? Steal the money? Win it?This is a Euro-slick film, shot like a music video. It asks, \\"So she failed that time...but what if she tried it ANOTHER way?\\" The audience follows Lola as she chases down the money...she does it again and again.Even though Manny is no choirboy, and Lola is not exactly Mother Teresa, you cheer for her and urge her on as the action speeds up. I liked Lola because she faces the problem head-on and then does what she's gotta do. The movie is a pleasure to watch, with none of the heavy-handed angst European films so often get slammed for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating Indie","review":"Lola is a girl stuck in a dilemna: how to save her boyfriend from being killed. So, in the spirit of Groundhog Day, she keeps repeating the day over and over again until she gets it right. But unlike Groundhog Day, this indie film has an edgy style, mixed with a punkish Lola and cartoonish pop culture animation. Without giving away too much, she somehow ends up solving her dilemna but after several crazy attempts that shed light into her own seemingly average, but soon-to-be complicated life."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most unlikely scenario . . .","review":"This is a good movie for learning German, since phrases are repeated from scenario to scenario. As for the plot:Supposedly, the third and final scenario is the true one. However, this is the most unlikely one. Somehow, in a city the size of Berlin, Manni is able to find the same homeless man who has his bag of money, and Lola gambles and wins 100 thousand DM, all in less than 20 minutes. The first two scenarios, in which Lola or Manni resorts to robbery and Manni or Lola is injured, are actually the more likely ones. Perhaps RUN LOLA RUN is poking fun at how neatly things usually turn out in movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a fun movie!","review":"I liked it. It was real fast paced, the actress was sexy and interesting to look at, the camera angles were cool, the director employed just a hint of animation, the production was artsy yet gutsy, there were cool plot twists and manipulations and the story was good. Most of all, with all of this innovative filmmaking, the ending was satisfying.I give this a big thumbs up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't miss Lola !","review":"This is a whole new experience in film. It's brilliant, innovative, and so much fun ! Fast paced, with a great pulsating score, it plays with time and shows you how a few seconds can change your life..the editing is a marvel, as well as the cinematography. (Love the ambulance/glass shot !). This incredible movie will still interest you after many viewings. It's a keeper !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie!","review":"Great Movie! Really makes you think. It is based on the theory that every second of every day determins your ultimate fate and even if one second was different, it could change your whole life. There are twists and turns in this movie as Lola races to protect the destiny of her lover. Run Lola Run!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Run Lola Run","review":"This film is amazing... not only is the cinematography masterfully done, but also the many layers of the entire film. I especially love it on DVD because I can hear the director and Franka's opinions about the film. Also, wide screen... need I say more?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Had a blast!","review":"This is a great, fast-paced movie. I was initially skeptical of watching the same 20 minutes depicted three different ways, but this movie won me over from the beginning. Run Lola Run has style and energy, and I really did have a blast watching it.The music, the photography, the editing--everything contributes toward a very fast film experience. After watching it I felt like I needed to do everything as quickly as possible. Loads of fun.One of the great things about it is that it stands up very well to repeat viewing--watching it the second time was just as rewarding, possibly even more so, as the first. The interconnection of all the events in the film is much more clear the second time around (though not being as clear the first time doesn't hurt the film in the least).Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"One word: TRIPE","review":"I see a lot of glowing reviews for this movie and I just don't get it. It's not \\"deep\\", ingenious, brilliant, or anything else that I've heard it called. Anyone who thinks this movie is thought provoking probably thinks Barney the dinosaur is a great philospher (seriously, get an education). This is a gimmicky, kitchy film that is a combination of concepts that have all been used before. The funny part is that they weren't great concepts the first time I saw them in other films. But hey, nothing suceeds like excess...so lets bring it all together and make a really really bad movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"This movie doesn't even deserve one star. The script was horribly written, and they kept on playing the SAME thing over and over and over again. Little parts changed while they replayed it, but I knew I couldn't stand to watch ANOTHER rerun again. I had to watch this movie for German and I'm certainly not watching it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"I don't get it\\" \\"Nothing thought provoking\\" \\"Nothing Philosophical\\"","review":"I give this film 5 stars. This and The Princess and the Warrior are in my top 10 all time favorites.This is less a review than advice to those that may be influenced by the 1 star reviews. The reviewers all tried really hard to sound intelligent while at the same time admitting that they \\"don't get it\\" and claim that there was nothing thought provoking.They say that it was just the same thing three times showing three possible results. These reviewers said it themselves- they didn't get it.During the movie the song What a Difference a Day Makes is played both to create atmosphere and to send a message. One of the main points of the movie is to show what a difference precious seconds can make..Cheers.P.S.Hopefully this sheds some light for the 1 star reviewers as well, but I doubt it."},{"rating":"2","title":"European Film At It's Best","review":"Run Lola Run is an intense suspense film. When Lola's boyfriend looses 100,000 DM from a drug drop and has to have it by noon he calls up Lola in desprate need of help. After suggesting to rob a grocery store, Lola pleeds with him not to and the movie kicks into three senarios of what may happen. Every time Lola gets the money, but it's a question of if she gets it there too late or if her or her boyfriend might even die first. The soundtrack is also amazing adding for an even larger on-the-edge-of-your-seat sensation."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent ....","review":"Original - fun - breathless ...

The base of the story is Lola's boyfriend must get a whole lot of money in 20 minutes. HOW??? well thats the whole plot.It starts out with this wild cartoon and then turns into the \\"real life\\" which it is the most of the movie. The movie is a non-stop whirl-win of fun. The excitment and action (not explosives) is great.I own this movie and although i dont watch it all the time I do find myself going back and watching it whenever i want to see a good action/excitement movie. It has a good plot and the way the movie was put together is new and vibrant. The music supports the film very well also.I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes to talk about doing stuff but doesnt because then you can dream you are Lola on this journey but you never really would be!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply spectacular!","review":"'Run Lola Run' was one of the best movies of 1999, IMHO.

Deeper Underground (Chillington Mix) tries to have a more darker sort of industrial sound which sounds pretty mushy and terrible, as the vocals do not fit in one bit with the music.Overall though if you want all the songs, be sure to get the jewel case version as the cardboard slipcase with trays get annoying and damaged easy and its easier to have 1 cd with all the songs on it rather than 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worldview grounded in scripture","review":"\\"Creation Regained:Biblical Basics for a Reformational Worldview\\" is not your typical worldview book. It comes at this issue from a particularly Reformational angle. What does that mean? He grounds his thesis in the way of looking at the world rediscovered during the Protestant Reformation: creation, fall, and redemption. When we consider life everything is considered from this biblical viewpoint. What Wolters presets is a great introduction to three points that can radically change the way we think and live. If you are looking for a worldview book that is heavy on applicable, biblical content rather than a rant about how the world is going to hell in a hand-basket this it the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong book was deliverd","review":"I received the wrong book in the mail.

A useful feature is you can learn using YOUR native language as you have choice of over 70 languages. I tried Chinese as I know it reasonably well and it worked just OK - I feel they designed it primarily for those with English as their 1st language. So if you American, Brit, Aussie, or Canadian this is a good beginner's guide for you.It's best feature is it's pronounces the words in both male and female voices as many Tagalog courses do not pronounce the words for you :-( You will enjoy the games and tests to measure your progress and it allows you to print your own dictionary for handy reference.

Why, I can't say. They write dynamically for a given period and then off they go into putting the holy bible on stage or some such epic. They become mystics, like Allen Ginsberg. Shepard wrote plays for a while and then, I think, Hollywood put the zap on him and he was gone. His occasional pieces today are weak imitations of his former self. Money and fame may be responsible. Who knows? Here gathered in a single anthology are the key works, on which his life's reputation rests. \\"True West\\" sets the stage: we have real dramatic conflict, exciting dialog (of the sort last heard in Albee's \\"Zoo Story\\"), and high theatricality. The rest of the anthology is well worth reading, but for my money Shepard wrote a fine short play but his long and longer pieces are less interesting. Shepard has said in interviews that he sees plays as an outlet for ideas. The problem as I see it is that he has none."},{"rating":"2","title":"an incredible collage of beautiful plays","review":"This collection of plays is extraordinary.

Kalinnikov & Arensky came to mind as I listened to this piece for the first time, and as I listened more and thought less of Russian comparisons and more of De Boeck, the music still strikes me as Russian in the shapes of the melodies, the style of the orchestration, and in the development of the themes. I haven't as yet spent enough time with the violin concerto to feel adequate to advance an opinion, but can assuredly say that if you enjoy late romantic symphonic music you will probably enjoy the symphony and rhapsody, and the adverb 'probably' has no place in this sentence if you enjoy late romantic symphonic music from Russia.

Apparently the product is only \\"direct fit\\" if it bolts onto another aftermarket Walker product (Requiring me to buy more parts than I anticipated).

It contains no information that a reasonably intelligent man (or woman) couldn't easily figure out on his or her own, or discover on internet dating sites for free. The authors are believers in astrology, and devote a substantial chunk of the book to providing astrological information. As you can probably tell, I do not believe in astrology, but despite that, the astrological information in the book would also be very quickly available at no cost to any minimally proficient Google user."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much of value...","review":"The closest to valuable information this book has is: The % of emails you received compared to the number of times your profile is viewed. There is nothing else here that isn't already listed on most dating web sites themselves. Don't waste your money, just read the information provided by the site(s) that you are a member of.It also appears that this book was sponsored by two specific companies (3 sites) as their name appears all over this book, and the 100's of other sites are ignored.I was surprised to see that this book was only written by two people. It has the disjointed feel of being written by a large group of people. It jumps from talking down to people only looking for sex, to praising how easily you can get sex, to talking down to people whom consider religious compatibility important. And that's just one example. I truly thought that it was written by at least five different authors, and edited by people who didn't speak to each other."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money","review":"This book is little more than a pamphlet.

The remainder of the book dispenses fairly obvious advice like woman types: \\"some women are after money\\" and \\"if you marry a women with children, you will be a step father\\" duh! Also a chapter on how to date when you are already Married, nice. This book mentions NOTHING AT ALL about the Internet. They just slapped Internet on the title to peddle an existing book on dating, except that it is useless as a general dating book as well! I got this at the library so I didn't pay for it, but I still feel like I was CHEATED, out of the hour of my life I wasted reading this garbage.

The French lyrics add a sweet touch to the ear, and each song is exquisite and unique. Tout l'or des hommes is unique in its hard rock theme. Apprends-moi seems a bit too pop ballady. My favorite on the album, Le vol d'un ange, is a emotionally touching and a beautiful-tuned song. Je lui dirai is very funky, and Ne bouge pas is hilarious. Get the CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Céline is at her best in French!","review":"Whenever people criticize me for being a Céline Dion fan, I always tell them to listen to her in French because it is so much better than her English recordings. While I like many of those as well, 1 Fille & 4 Types is of the same quality as D'eux and S'il Suffisait D'Aimer. The melodic quality and intimacy of these recordings really makes her vocals shine without the overblown aspects people tend to dislike in her English songs. Give it a try!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The girl simply shines with the 4 guys!!!! wow","review":"Okay, let's be objective, A NEW DAY HAS COME was a fine album, ONE HEART was simply the crappiest Celine album ever, but now she brings us this piece of art for those who appreciate her french music .. her roots. This album was targeted mainly for french and Canadian people, but it's topping the charts all over Europe, because of its quality!It is a musical piece of art which combines folk with blues and some irish shades. With tremendous guitar arrangements played by the amazing Gildas Arzel each song turns into a living nostalgia.Her voice is relaxed as it's never been, and she doesn't try to force it to hit high notes.. she just sings with her heart.even if u don't speak french, u'll love this album for its musicality!!!!!!!!!

Maybe by slave labor in some 3rd world country. I should have read all the reviews more carefully. The only \\"exotic\\" thing about this purchase is probably the chemicals used in gluing the cheap paper onto the chest. There are glue splatters all over the top, and scratches on the inside. The paint on the corners looks like it was done by 3rd graders. I purchased this primarily for the chest, and could easily forgive the poor selection in flavors if the chest was worth more than $10.

There's a nice variety of tea inside and some really good flavors of green tea.The one downside of the chest? That the company pastes a label on the bottom of the chest and it is NOT easily removed. The label covers the entire bottom of the chest. It would be nice if they at least made it so you can remove it without leaving the wood looking worse for wear. I realize a label isn't a big deal; I just prefer to give a gift without the unsightly label."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good tea/cheap chest","review":"The tea assortment in the chest is excellent, vey tasty.

Most of the tea flavors are decent (I especially like the Peach Tea, but dislike the Orange Spice Tea). Recently these Bentley Tea Chests have been on sale at Amazon for quite decent prices. Don't expect too much from the box though. It's a paper covered pine box with a couple of handles and a front catch. It does have a very thin velvet lining inside, but I wouldn't count on the inside box cells to isolate flavors or prevent oxidation, so foil or paper covered tea bags are a must for this tea chest. Overall a decent value if you buy it on a good sale."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Selection of Flavors in an Attractive Box","review":"This is a wonderful assortment of absolutely delicious tea.

Not real sure why anyone would buy only 2 when it makes for since to buy all 4 when servicing your auto. My bad I guess.

YOu do a set of bicep curls, then lateral raises, overhead raises and tricep kickbacks. Then you do 2 of each all together. It was fun to do them that way.

The season started a little slowly, but it picked up pace toward the end. Mostly it was the same-old, same-old, just with grown-up clothing and with more serious consequences for actions. Still, I recommend it to anyone who has followed the series, because the last half of the season left several dangling threads for season 4. And from the promo, season 4 should pick up right where 3 left off, which I think will be better than the gap between 2 and 3."},{"rating":"1","title":"The promos for these episodes are a lot better than the actual show.","review":"Gossip Girl - The Complete First Seasonis the perfect example of a great show to watch. It was guy friendly too. After January 2009, when the show was heading in to the second half of theGossip Girl: The Complete Second Season, the storylines were rushed and repetitive and this pattern has continued in to the third season. Aside from the last disc, the entire season is a waste of money but the cover art does look tempting to buy. Let's face it, even Blake Liveley would like to leave the show.

Most of it, however, is contained on the front cover. Other than naming the thirty colleges, \\"Of excellence,\\" the book does little to differentiate between the schools.

Overall, this guide is useful for listing thirty colleges named on its cover. If you're looking for more information than that, look somewhere else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good Enough","review":"I did not find this book particularly useful. The college descriptions are more like advertorials written by the colleges themselves rathen than objective and independent analysis with pros and cons.

Throughout my time there, I was surrounded by people who couldn't care less about the name on their diploma, and couldn't care more about the quality of their education. Anyone who would be interested in a book titled \\"Hidden Ivies\\" does not have the sort of personality suited to my school - the name is nothing, the labels are nothing. The professors and fellow students are everything.

The other book, and in my opinion, the most important, enables you to create an absolutely magnificant resume. If you loved the book, then this work book is an absolute must.However, I must caution you that the workbook is, indeed, a lot of work. And so to really use the book, you must use the workbook.

Very little point to the game on multiplayer, some of the levels I (a gamer of many years) can not figure out the moves to and in the end the case makes a great coaster. My daughter is a much bigger fan of Cel Damage and Rayman Arena. XBox needs more kids games, but this one was a waste of money.

These are great episodes to be sure, but why did they put them in a compilation of Christmas episodes. Two of them have virtually nothing to do with Christmas at all. Just because you set a scene in the winter time does not make it a Christmas episode! The other two mention Christmas only as the jumping off point of their story, but never return to Christmas at all as a topic. No tree, no presents, no Christmas like fiascos. Once again, wonderful episodes, but they don't belong here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless","review":"Wow, how would you like to own a DVD of 4 Simpsons Xmas episodes? Even though half of said episodes are utterly NON-Xmas.

None of these are from the old seasons, so they are all new to DVD. But their not from the best years either. They're the cynical, classless episodes from recent seasons.Yes, they are funny. But the laughs are incredibly cheap and their targets too easy to hit. For the price, it's hard to argue NOT getting for a single watch on Xmas eve (despite the fact only 2 episodes are about Xmas), but for misers I'd wait for the full complete box sets of these later seasons. Crap as they may be.The DVD presents all shows in 1.33:1 fullscreen, as drawn with Dolby 2.0 surround. One brief extra, an animatic, is included."},{"rating":"2","title":"the simpsons christmas 2","review":"I love this dvd.

I would recommend reading it prior to reading this book. In contrast to the first book, I agree with one of the other readers in that the author was much kinder toward organized religion this time which made it a little easier to swallow. However, Joshua was much more open and obvious with his working of miracles which made the book much less believeable. In the first book most of the characters were left guessing as to who Joshua truly was and his message was expressed in very subtle ways. This time his actions made his identity obvious and the characters either believed immediately or were fools.

Blooms of bicycle bell, musical box and every manner of metal chime, grungily recorded in an up close and personal fashion.

Almost ecstatic, like medieval religious music."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"Altman has moments. Early in his career, these moments came often: \\"M*A*S*H\\" and \\"The Long Goodbye,\\" \\"Nashville\\" and \\"McCabe & Mrs. Miller.\\" But he also had disasters and disappointments. This lackluster, tedious picture belongs in the latter folder. There is an utter lack of narrative momentum, Carradine and Duvall are a real bore, and the use of radio bits fails to add much.

The quality is not great; the fabric is harsh and the cups of the bra are very stiff. When I tried it on, the bra separated my boobs very far apart. It made me look like a 1950's housewife with cone boobs. No cleavage, total separation, very pointy. Just not attractive.As for the sizing, I didn't feel that the cups were too small. I am a 32 G in other Le Mystere bras and the fit was proportional. The cups just made my chest look unattractive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Look, Not A Great Fit!","review":"I have to say I love my Le Mystere Dream Tisha Bra and its perfect fit. Sorry I can't say the same about the Carina bra.I agree with a previous reviewer, the cup size is off, not true to size and that results in \\"spillage\\".

It's pretty but poorly engineered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sizing a little off..","review":"I love the shaping this bra gives, but the straps sometimes pop out when I'm putting it on -- so annoying. It's also cut a little smaller than other Le Mystere bras in the band and the cup (think spillage).

It was stiff and the edges were so pronounced that even my thickest sweater couldn't hide them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing compares to Le Mystere bras","review":"During my search for the perfect bra, this is the best I have found so far. It only gets 4 stars because despite the high cost of this line of bras, the underwires do eventually break even if you care for them appropriately. The entire Le Mystere line offers unparalleled support for large busted women. Note that the cups aren't true to size. I normally wear a 40F, but wear a 40G in this line of bras. I highly recommend getting a professional bra fitting before buying this or any other bra."},{"rating":"2","title":"My son loves this game!","review":"I wanted to say that I just bought the Rugrats game for PlayStation 2 for my 10 yr old son. Although I have not played it, he enjoys it if I sit in the family room and watch him play. I must say, every time I glance at the TV he is playing some new adventure. He is hooked to say the least! He likes it because it has the real Rugrats Nickelodeon characters and I like it because it is not obnoxiously violent like some other games. Two thumbs up from a parent!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably for Little Little Kids Only","review":"Maybe I didn't give the game a chance, but I couldn't because I would get motion sick too quickly. Maybe it's the very bright colors or the high-pitched music or the constantly going around in circles, but I was hanging over the side of my TV, turning green within 15 minutes every time I tried to play this. I was on the Baby Easy level, too, and I didn't find it all that easy, but I'm not a kid. No doubt it's probably a lot of fun later on when you get vehicles and stuff, but I couldn't even put together the snowman in the beginning levels. To its credit, the Baby Easy level does let you win even when your skills are horrible because I was a huge failure as far as navigating a river, and the game still applauded me and advanced me to the next level.

After checking it against my Starrett and Mitutoyo squares I was surprised to find out that it was very accurate. Surprisingly, it is also pretty durable. While I am not a big fan of the zinc heads on most consumer grade squares, this one is well made, accurately machined and so far, durable. The etched and painted blade is easy to read although not as easy as the Starrett or Mitutoyo \\"satin chrome\\". Granted, you can buy 8 of these squares for the price of one of the Starrett or Mitutoyo units.While I would never consider replacing my 6\\" Mitutoyo square with this one I will not hesitate to run out and buy another, or two or three Swanson squares when my current one finally does get bent or disappears.Overall, I would give this square five stars for value and four stars for quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this little guy!","review":"I already had a larger combo square which I used like crazy, but for many applications having a smaller square is easier to use.

I watched it over and over, and really clicked with the symbol and image of the magestic bald eagle. To this day, the Eagle evokes in me an image of character, perserverence, courage, fortitude, strength and nobility that I aspire to in my life's roles.

Serious Sam SE plays like a dream and actually looks better than my GF4 MX card! Aliens vs. Predator 2-ditto.

Actually, the scariest part of the movie is that they didn't allow a good actor who played a bit part ( Bruce Dern )to be the main character in the film.

All the subtler aspects of the first are thrown out in favor of the mind numbing CGI effects. The result is one big dud of a \\"thriller\\".

Ghosts, skeletons, and live statues jump out at you just when you're not paying attention. What makes the moving all the ,ore enticing is that the ghosts are children. The music is especially creative as it pulls you into the story further. An outlandish storyline provides an entertaining trip through an old \\"haunted house\\". This movie is mild enough to be viewed by children, as it maintains the amusement park \\"fun house\\" type of theme. Taylor delivers a stellar performance while Zeta-Jones could have done better.

It isn't long before there are attacks. Such as when the stairs one person is on collapses when he is over a story up, and when a mysterious oversized hand reaches and tries to grab one of the occupants. This movie starts out well because it's scary like it's supposed to be and is very unique, but you quickly notice it's also very repetative."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm haunted by the memory of seeing this sorry movie","review":"This movie, despite having a truly excellent sound design, is just another hokey Hollywood special effects show. Shirley Jackson's novel, quite possibly the finest haunted house story ever written, is tossed aside in favor of easy to communicate cliches and stock shocks (I guessed the BIG SURPRISE TWIST ENDING about three minutes into it and was waiting for all the other stupid characters to catch on).

I can only say that I was extremely dissapointed in this film.Not only did the movie insult Shirley Jackson's classic book, but also made fools of the great actors in the movie. By me saying that the movie made fools of the actors, I mean look at them , Liam neeson, Lili Taylor and Cathrine Zeta Jones , theyre all very talented but all you can do is laugh at them in this movie because the script is terrible and also very over exagerated.Donnot be fooled by this movies name. The occurances of \\"hauntings\\" in this movie look like they came out of a disney movie.Now the only positive thing I can say about this movie is that it has great visual effects, and does make you say wow when you see the house itself.So think of this movie as disneys rendition of Shirly Jacksons book. And if youd like to see what her book is really about rent the original 1963 classic with Julie Harris and Claire Bloom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultimately, this one's a failure (though not without merit).","review":"Four people are placed in a gigantic mansion as part of a study in fear, but they don't realize the house is actually haunted. Effects-heavy thriller features a decent beginning and a so-so cast (Liam Neeson and Catherine Zeta-Jones are fine, Owen Wilson and Lili Taylor are spectacularly awful), but eventually falls apart in the last half-hour, with a barrage of cheesy special effects taking over. Add to that the predictability and the sappy conclusion and you have a movie that went from promising to big dud. It might, however, hold appeal to non-horror fans looking for a quick, undisturbing thrills (and it seems that that was the crowd this movie was aimed at). For everyone else, either stick with the original or see House on Haunted Hill for a real coaster ride of a haunted house thriller (Which also actually features better CGI effects, a surprise considering it only had 1/4 the budget of The Haunting)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Numbingly bad.","review":"Only in this, the age of mediocrity, could a piece of rubbish like this get made.

I read the book before I went to have a background of what to expect, but the book and the movie are not really that similiar. I loved this movie because I love haunting movies, scary stuff that makes the audience scream. This one does it, though at the end it is a little far fetched I have to admit, but overall I thouroughly enjoyed this movie. The acting leaves something to be desired on many occasions, however, but a movie like this you don't go to see because of the acting. Four Out Of Five."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad horror movie","review":"The effects are pretty well done on computer but they do not succeed in making The Haunting much scarier.Catherine Zeta-Jones is not only acting poorly, she is also a complete misfit in this movie. It's as if she has just been asked to be in The Haunting because the makers want some chick on the screen. But you don't even see any of her sexiness in this movie.Furthermore, there are several ridiculous movie mistakes in The Haunting.There are a few relatively scary scenes and even some good laughs here and there. Apart from that, only Lily Taylor's acting is worth mentioning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Writer and director witoout souls","review":"I cannot imagine a writer and director so soulless that they could read The Haunting of Hill House and come up with this drek.

But making a bad movie with good material must be easy---Jan DeBont proves it with this turkey. Shirley Jackson's story was a spooky classic. Robert Wise's B & W version was excellent and one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. And HE did it without special effects; just sound, shadows, and camera angles. This movie could have been so much better by relying on the original premise and forgetting all the comic book special effects. Mr. DeBont is proving that he's better as a technician than a director. Liam Neeson must have lost a bet to go along with this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"I seen this movie too many times to get scared. But I enjoy it each time. I also enjoy watching the special features. The house that they filmed this movie in was really haunted. The movie crew kept seeing, feeling, and hearing things. They also talked about different haunted places in the special features. If you are into haunted movie's you don't want to pass this movie up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Promises alot. Delivers little.","review":"I was really stoked to watch this movie. And I honestly enjoyed the first half of the it - the setup. I love the actors here. The look and feel of the picture was great, dug the vibe. A bunch of strangers come together for an insomnia experiment in a haunted house in New England. The Dr, Liam Neeson hasn't told them that he wants to study their reaction to fear. They stay in the house a couple of days and it begins to have an effect on them. Lili Taylor's charactor in particular.That's about as far as I can go w/o spoilage. I'll just say it becomes predictable haunted house story after that. I didn't get the thrills I was expecting. Such interesting characters. Such potential. I've rarely seen a movie that was such a let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Microwaved horror","review":"Hollywood reheats a classic, but this cheap serving is hardly very appetizing. This remake throws some heavy morsels of CGI down your throat and will give you indigestion.Same basic story, some people volunteer to stay in an extravagant mansion. This time they aren't told about the house's dark past. They believe they are part of a study on insomnia. The truth is they are part of a controlled experiment on group fear.Now I thought this was a nice alteration to the story. But unfortunately it starts to get extremely ridiculous. Nothing subtle here, there are plenty of cheap scares--like ghostly images or moving statues. As it turns out this house is basically a holding cell for dead children's souls. The evil landlord's spirit keeps watch over them in this purgatory. Great, a perverted pedaphile ghost.This turns into more of a goofy adventure flick. No spooky atmosphere or mystery. No suspense. No reason to bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably Putrid","review":"Stay away from this putrid piece of decaying mouse droppings! This is just another fine example of taking a large budget film and creating various computer generated images which look \\"COOL\\" and write some dialogue and a very weak story line around it. When will people stop being oohed and awed by special effects and appreciate writing content of a movie? The old Julie Harris movie is so superior, see it! You will see what a good movie is! Why remake some a classic with some screenwriter first credit for a movie. I feel the writer rented 20 horror movies, sat and watched them and took notes. \\"Hey I like that and that.\\" If this film comes anywhere near you, use a crucifix or holy water, anything to save 2 hours of your life!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NEGATIVE 100 STARS. WORST FILM OF THE DECADE.","review":"This is a travesty, not only of Shirley Jackson's creepy, intelligent, incomparable \\"The Haunting of Hill House\\", but of the original \\"The Haunting\\". It's a ghost story for video-game-addicted morons. I've lost all respect I may have had for Neeson, Zeta-Jones and Taylor. This will be a permanent blotch on their resumes. If they were smart (ha ha) they might want to consider just whiting this one out! I won't apologize for sounding spiteful, either; when one of this century's best 'ghost' stories was turned into an excuse for lots of gimmicky, asinine computer graphics, instead of being crafted into the eerie filmed masterpiece it deserved to be, I was angered and even more disgusted with Hollywood, its crummy formulas and lowest-common-denominator scriptwriting than I ever was before."},{"rating":"1","title":"CGI no substitute for story","review":"This re-make fails to evoke true terror, trading for easier shocks thanks to easily distinguished CGI effects.

May I suggest that those who love ghost stories read Shirley's Book. The original Movie titled \\"The Haunting\\" that was released in the early '60's, stared Julie Harris and Claire Bloom. It was done in black and white and was very effective for it's time in moving it's audience. I highly recommend seeing this version also. Now, this new updated version has hit the screen with great effects, great scenery and vivid color for the modern era. Yes, it to stands alone and is very effective for it's time. I don't feel any of the three medias should be compared. They all stand alone on their own and all should be enjoyed.

However, it is a good movie where you can spend 108 minutes. The critics listed above were too harsh, and I almost did not buy the movie. I am glad I did, and will watch it a few more times.

Just awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why re-make a great classic as a horrible expensive \\"b\\" movie??","review":"OK, I have to say that the original movie made in the early 60s is one of my favorites of all time. With very little in the way of special effect and all the crap now available to Hollywood, it manages to be a truly engaging and frightening film.So I had hopes for at least a reasonably good movie, I mean why re-make a great film if you're not going try to at least make one that is at least half as good?? Especially with the promise of the great talents of Liam Neeson and Lili Taylor, I expected a lot.What I got was crap. CGI assisted crap. Liam Neeson was sort of not there, and Lili Taylor was NOT good. In fact she was really horrible which was quite disappointing. Her work in other films is wonderful, but it may just be that Sci-fi/Fantasy is really REALLY not where she belongs.All around disappointing.

Its a waste and an annoyance!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch the original instead","review":"Being a fan of the haunted house genre, when I first saw the teaser trailer in the theater, I was extremely excited. That excitement didn't last long. This movie was a ridiculous remake of one of the classic haunted house films, and I'd never recommend this. Special effects are not scarry. What you don't see but know is there is what will make people remember the story and come back time and time again. Rent or buy the original instead, it's much creepier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of Evil Capitalists (and ghost movies about them)","review":"Some day Lili Taylor will land that role in a film which will show the world what a high-calibre actress she really is. THE HAUNTING is not that film. What a thankless part for Ms. Lili. What a thankless film. The scariest thing about this movie must have been the bill for the c.g.i. effects that the studio received. I mean, the movie had a moment or two of tension, but on the whole, I was bored.There was nothing new here: the fury of an evil, dead capitalist and the pain inflicted on his mostly children workers--and his family--just can't seem to get out of the house. So! The evil men do does live on! How original! I'm reaching for sarcasm which is never pretty, so I will end here. This movie was the pits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Must I even give it one star?","review":"Crass, vulgar, ridiculous farce of a film that regrettably retains none of the keen psychological portraits in Jackson's novel. Believe me, I am no stickler for slavish literary adaptations. When changes need to be made for cinematic purposes, I utterly support a director's choice to do so. Here, however, Jackson's work is not even on display in spirit; instead, this juvenile, special effects laden mess is marred by a juvenile screenplay and lousy performances from good actors. Even Liam Neeson publicly declared his utter disgust with this production. If only the filmmakers had taken the Robert Wise film version as inspiration; it is by no means faultless but is a masterpiece compared to this dreck. Only those folks who adore CGI will appreciate this film, and to them I say \\"enjoy.\\" To those looking for characters or true chills, try \\"The Innocents,\\" \\"The Changeling,\\" \\"The Legend of Hell House,\\" or the original \\"The Haunting\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE HAUNTING","review":"ALL I CAN SAY IS SEE THE ORIGINAL WITH JULIE HARRIS.

And no, Catherine Zeta Jones didn't save the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a horror movie.","review":"This is not a horror movie- it is an interesting science fiction movie. However, it is a science fiction movie with bad special effects and a bad dialogue. The acting is good, but that just doesn't make up for it. I didn't buy this movie- I went to see it once in the theatre, and that was enough for me. If you want a real horror movie, check out The Sixth Sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Studio Executives Seriously Out To Lunch","review":"I do believe that the studio executives who a) thought the remake would be a good idea and b) allowed it to be made the way it was should be forced to work at McDonald's for the rest of their lives. This movie was laughingly bad - particularly if you've seen the timeless and still very scary original. Once again Hollywood chooses FX over everything else (plot, character development, etc.). If you are the kind of person who needs to be spoon fed your entertainment - having everything explained to you every step of the way and can't believe in it if you don't see it, you will certainly enjoy this video. If you want to see a classic haunted house story and be scared, then get the original movie with Claire Bloom."},{"rating":"2","title":"A funhouse of special effects.","review":"This DVD has superior picture than the video version. Its a good film of effects and the audio is far superior on DVD. I thought it sounded smooth and clear and dialog is easily heard.

It had an array of good, if not overly impressive, actors, good special effects, and a good basis novel. Unfortunately, the acting skips around from histrionics to casual acceptance where there should be histrionics to just plain silliness. This is a neat movie to watch for some brainless eye-candy, but it really lost a lot of energy in the translation from big-screen to video.And completely unrelated, but the ending scene sounds like an anti-Russian lobbyist. \\"I won't let you kill any more children, Ukraine!

I am a big fan of the book and I'm just writing to tell that there is little simularity's between the movie and the book. Only the names are the same and 1 five minute scene is taken from the book. The rest is from the imagination of the screenwriter. I would think that if you are going to change that much of a plot, then you shouldn't be allowed to advertise it as from the book. However, the special effects are amazing, the acting is well done. They should have put another title to it and changed the names of the charecters. Then it could have been there own work. Very disapointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good special effects, lame otherwise","review":"The special effects are the only thing that saved this movie.

For the first hour of the movie, it's creepy and fun as we explore the house along with the actors. But as the second half begins to roll, \\"The Haunting\\" loses steam.

The elements -- including the cast, from a pouting, bi-sexual Catherine Zeta-Jones to an achingly sincere Lillian Taylor, and the plot, which takes a classic Shirley Jackson story and actually takes away the terror -- are each so bad that the end result is one of those movies you watch and say -- how did this ever get made? Redeeming qualities: the set, which is so massive and full of detail that it is interesting to explore, and a few of the special effects, which unfortunately do not help you to understand the absurdly diluted-and-then-regurgitated plot.

If they were intended to be a distraction, they didn't work.I have to admit, my review is based only on the first 30 or so minutes of the movie.

In fact, so many things in this over-the-top special-effects fest fly in the face of what Ms. Jackson wrote, it's an insult to say it's based on her work.The first film from the 1960's is one of the best ghost stories ever put on celluloid and is about 90% true to the original story, which is why it was so good. Special effects are virtually nonexistence in the first film -- and everything that happens is believable, which is why it's so scary.In this new \\"version,\\" all the effects are so ridiculous and heavy-handed, I could only laugh! And the way it ends is just totally not right! Read the book! See the first version on film! Avoid this new one like the plague.(It's telling -- as of the today, the DVD of the remake is selling for less than the DVD of the first film!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie stinks!","review":"This movie proves that hollywood is trying to dismantle every great film from it's past.Like every movie made today it has tons of stupid special effects,no acting,and a lousyscript. I think of all the hard work Robert Wise did on the original film only to beflushed down the toliet by the no talent crap we have in hollywood today!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgrace","review":"Shirley Jackson's novel The Haunting of Hill House is the greatest haunted house story ever written, and the 1963 film version is one of the finer examples of the horror genre ever committed to film, but this illegitimate 1999 re-make is a disgrace to the memory of the author, an inferior descendant of the original movie, and an all-around bad (bad bad bad!) motion picture. Alternating between groaningly, achingly terrible and downright silly, 1999's The Haunting loses its threadbare plot in a special effects quagmire, obliterates any of the greatness it could easily have inherited from this predecessors, fails to make use of the magnificent understated creepiness of the novel, and squanders a talented cast. Not only is it offensive to witness what was done with Shirley Jackson's work, this is just a rotten waste of time to see."},{"rating":"1","title":"this movie sucks!","review":"This is one of the most horrible movies i've ever seen. It starts off promising with a creepy house and an old story of how the house is haunted. From there it gets worse and worse and worse until the ending, which might be the dumbest ending i've ever had to sit through. This movie only deserves one star but Catherin Zeta Jones looked very very attractive in the movie (like always) and i had to give it an extra star just for her.P.S.what's up with her and Micheal Douglas, that's just a shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creepy","review":"Being a huge fan of the original, I was just waiting to hate this film.....however I must admit that the atmosphere of the orginal has been reproduced by some great effect and some superb camera work. The actors perform quite well, however they do tend to play second fiddle to the effects - and more importantly the house itself (which is breath-taking). As the film progresses the feeling of dread builds to a good climax, which is slighly more upbeat than that of the original! Nevertheless this film does not deserve the slagging it got in the press and does well to keep up with the black & white version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not that bad after all","review":"Okay, the story isn't very logical all the time, and there's not much suspense either, but the amazing dolby 5.1 soundtrack blows you away ! Add to this the fantastic special effects and a few perfectly timed shock-moments -\\"The Haunting\\" is filmed like a classic horror movie, but it uses state of the art technics to give it a modern look. Not my favorite movie of the year, but definately not the worst one either -give it a chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"ABSOLUTLEY HORRIBLE","review":"How any sane, intelligent person(perhaps that explains it!) could recommend this overblown crap-fest is beyond me.

Whenever a cliche' scare comes up, I fall asleep....and this was often. I saw the original 60's version and, sorry, but that one was a snoozer too. I think this story could be phenomenally scary, but the right party has yet to make it.The only really scary thing about this movie is looking like Lily Taylor and having to share the screen with Catherine Zeta-Jones.

The movie was supposed to concentrate on a group of 4 people (all insomniacs) who were going to stay in an isolated house, to test their reactions to pressure situations.Was it the lack of direction, the lack of story line, or the lack of interest from the actors that led this movie to become a flop ?Watching this movie was a chore. It was about as exciting as \\"The Avengers\\".There's not a lot that can be said, apart from save your money and get a better movie (The Sixth Sense was made on a cheaper budget & was far more exciting)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie Ever Made","review":"If you've ever seen the original you'll know that this film is anything but good. The story arc is poor, there is a total lack of character motivation, and the script seems as if they wrote it as they went along.

I want my two hours back."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE ATTEMPT AT GOTHIC HORROR","review":"\\"The Haunting\\" is certainly one of the worst films I've seen. While it starts off promisingly, the sets and special effects become so mind numbingly overdone that the thread of the original story is lost completely. It is replaced by a story that is not only derivitive and banal, but laugably contrived as well. This movie proves that even with a classic novel and a classic movie, a remake can totally botch its rendering beyond all recognition. Recommended for the film audience that prefers style far above substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Got Carried Away with Special Effects","review":"I thought this movie was really cheesy. It got so carried away with the special effects, that there wasn't enough room for a real story. This new version of \\"The Haunting\\" was terrible, and it could have been a whole lot better. I don't reccomend this film to anyone who has seen the original, they would be very dissapointed and frustrated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go Haunt Yourself!","review":"This movie stinks. It's like watching a WCW Pay per view from that time. This film was ruined by cartoon ghosts,dumb subplots and a Disney-style good vs evil storyline. The acting is not that good. It also has too many pointless cast members & moments. The effects are laughable to the 4th power. The story is childish like See Spot Run. It's buildup is soo backwards. The worst part is when Owen Wilson gets his head cut off by that lion's head statue swinging by. I give this film a -0 out of 10."},{"rating":"1","title":"99.9 FAILURE!","review":"The only thing in this \\"horror\\" film that made it was the house and Lili Taylor, Catherine Zeta-Jones, looking good!, but the story was so forced, it never caught any horror, the special effects were cartoon like, not one bit frighting, the original movie and the short story will scare the pants off you, and why?, because your mind can conger up all the horror you want, your minds eye will take you to all those dark corners you fear, oh, and another thing that ruined the movie for me is, Owen Wilson, can't stand him!, how he ever got in movies is beyond me!, ignore this cluttered up movie and go to the original black and white one and get set to be terrified!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Some movies are just born bad...","review":"To say I was disappointed in this movie would be an understatement. To classify this as a horror film would be just plain wrong. While it achieves its goal to tell a good story, the chills and thrills just aren't there. I cannot recommend this movie to anyone with a serious yen to be scared out of their wits. If you want a real frightening tale, I recomend Rose Red. That's how a haunted house story should be told."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible...!","review":"Since this movie had plenty of razzle-dazzle eye candy special-FX, I will not count it as a classic B-movie. Instead, it's just a tragic failure that's not even scary with bad acting, boring characters who have absolutely NO character development, and a plot that may sound original at first, but gets REALLY boring later. After reading some of these reviews here, I decided to watch it anyways even if everybody else didn't like it cause I might have. NOPE. I now know what everyone here was talking about. I think that this is the MOST crappiest Haunted House movie in a long time that should have only gotten a straight-to-video release because it's very dull! TRUST ME, I know horror movies! If you're looking for a good haunted house flick, then watch \\"The House On Haunted Hill\\" (1999) or \\"Thir13een Ghosts\\" (2001) because they are at least scary and intelligent!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Film Ever Made, ever!","review":"It's just bad.

The experimen takes place in a haunted house. Doesn't make any sense to me. The story is bad, the screenplay is bad even all the performers here are bad.

The acting is horrible besides Catherine Zeta Jones( she is excellent). But I mean the other girl in there was so dull, 1 word comes to mind when I think about this movie LIFELESS. Cant these producers waste 10 million on a movie that will be eerie or scary, because in my opinion this was just horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boredom personified!","review":"This movie, supposedly a journey into terror, lulls one off to sleep most of the time. The pace is so slow that I thought the exposition would never end. There wasn't one fear producing moment in the entire movie. I believe \\"Bambi\\" was scarier.This movie is dreadful, especially when one remembers the 1963 version with Julie Harris. I wonder how much money was spent making this dud!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific!","review":"This movie is great! The story is interesting, and I love the superb acting and special effects.

Compared to the 1963-movie, this one is quite different, at least the story. But I like it. I like the characters, they're quite similar to those in the original movie. The insecure, nervous Nell (Lili Taylor), self confident Luke (Owen Wilson) and Theo (Catherine Zeta-Jones). The actors are good (I forgot to mention Liam Neeson as Dr Marrow), also the supporting actors, for example Marian Seldes as the creepy Mrs. Dudley.The special effects are impressing and the music is also very good. One thing that feels unnecessary is that the filmmakers seem to have tried to give the movie a creepy, 'haunting', feeling too early, even in the end of the first scene, in Nell's bedroom.I like this movie and I think it's quite underrated. It has a number of good scenes. The scene with the photo album with the pictures of Hugh and Carolyn Crain is a favorite... It's nice to see a good new haunted house movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"To sum up this movie takes one word and one word only...Terrible. If this is your first foray into The Haunting stop now and go back 36 years to the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I could give it 0 stars","review":"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen! It was absolutly stupid, boring, and a time-waster. The movie seemed to take forever and I couldn't wait for it to end. Plus, the ending was absolutely terrible and stupid. The main character in the story was such a bizzare character you really couldn't relate to her at all. The other characters were pretty weird too, but they were just funny. The special effects were OK, but it really annoyed me that those stupid statues kept coming to life to make the movie go on and on. There were so many many comedy aspects of this movie that it was hard to tell sometimes whether it was a comedy or a horror movie(such as the fact that all the characters had problems that were very obvious). I don't know about the old version of this movie, but the new one really sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst possible remake","review":"I can't understand how anyone could get behind such a bad script. Everything is bloated, the original story by Shirley Jackson is unrecognizable, save for the names of the characters and the house. But the one thing that I did learn from this film is that Lili Taylor could play Mary Poppins -- her take on Eleanor is pure saccharine. I gave the film one star, and that was for the set of the house."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of valuable money!","review":"I saw a commercial for this movie. The special effects looked great. I was expecting to see a great action-packed movie. A friend and I anxiously stepped into the theater. The movie started with a little action, but then it was gone. Nothing. That was it. I actually fell asleep during it, something I never did before! This was one of the STUPIDEST movies I have ever seen in my life. It doesn't even deserve one star, but I've got to give it something. If you think that this looks like a good deal, think again. Your money is worth something much better for the same price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tell me a story","review":"This film suffers greatly from having nothing at all to say.

This remake focuses on the children trapped in the house. The original movie focused on the house and how scary and evil it was. That was what made it scary.

We are huge fans of the original, and went to see it with high hopes. It seems that most of the rest of the viewers felt the same way; people were restless, chatting and getting up to get more snacks. When Owen Wilson lost his head, instead of screams, the theater filled with sardonic laughter. Neeson phoned his performance in, Lili Taylor was wasted, and Zeta-Jones, well, as an actress, she is very pretty."},{"rating":"1","title":"skip the movie","review":"If you enjoy a decent cast overwhelmed by unnecessary special effects, this is the film for you. The pleasure of Shirley Jackson's novel is its graceful understatement and its exacting psychological examination of fear. The film has neither of these virtures. Instead, it simply washes over one with all the subtlety of a large bucket of over-sweet jello."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL!","review":"I was so furious by this piece of trash that I could barely speak. They hijacked Shirley Jackson's novel and made a mess. The film misses all of the fine characterizations of the novel and just crumples them into cardboard caricatures that you could care less about. The building suspense and the sense of dread are jettisoned for over the top CGI effects and cheap scares. This movie was just an excuse to show off computer generated effects.Too much 90's psychobabble finds itself in and reduces the end to an Opera episode: Ghostly old patriarchs who abuse kids and the women who confront them. Get the 1963 version of \\"The Haunting\\" and read The haunting Of Hill House by Shirley Jackson and discover what true horror is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sue me","review":"I'm doing something risky here -- I'm giving this movie one star and I haven't even seen it. I'm doing this because the original 1963 movie was not in need of a remake, and nothing in these posts or, more importantly, in any of the professional reviews that came out last summer, has convinced me that I might be even the slightest bit wrong. You can't take a previously filmed story, throw money and technical wizardry at it (not to mention Technicolor), and expect to improve on it. And if you tell me that improving on it wasn't the intent, then why touch it? Are filmmakers supposed to do a *worse* job than their predecessors?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best and Most Realistic Horror Film of the Year!","review":"The entire family had a wonderful evening wathing \\"The Haunting\\" tonight.

One of the best parts is the Special \\"Behind the Scenes\\" portion on the DVD. We really enjoyed this part of \\"The Mummy\\" but this was even better. A movie in itself!

Of course if you are like the majority of clueless americans...this might be right up your alley."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not frightening, not anything","review":"There are 2 good things in this movie-(1) Bruce Dern, who plays the groundskeeper and who, in about 3 lines and 20 seconds, out-acts everyone else in the film, even though they get hours. Bruce Dern should have been the star of this film. He's got more talent in his left nostril than the rest of the cast have in their whole bodies. He's of the old school like Donald Sutherland, and he is squandered in this film. The director is like a prospector who puts the mud in his pocket and leaves the gold behind.(2) The mansion itself, which is extraordinarily beautiful, but probably only a bunch of sets. Still, it's lovely.Nothing else in this movie is remotely interesting or frightening. The screenplay reads as if it were written by a junior high student."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Haunting","review":"Before I saw this movie I didn't expect much.It looked like another cheesy horror flick,and I have never enjoyed watching cheesy horror flicks (excepting JAWS,which I think is a triumph-did I say that out loud?) But anyway,my older brother started to rave about THE HAUNTING so I agreed to watch the copy my Mum had rented. From the word go I was hooked.The superb acting really struck me,the fear that those actors portrayed was splendid.The special effects had much to be desired,unfortunately,but the gripping storyline made my day.In fact,I was close to tears at the end when Nell and Luke died.The movie provoked so much thought and emotion in me that I had to watch it again,and when I did it was even more clear that THE HAUNTING was an exceptional film."},{"rating":"1","title":"there was no entry for zero stars....","review":"Bad, bad, stupendously awful!

In the end of the movie, it is just a concept that has swallowed a little bit of its own lunch, and some bad acting as well.No. The effects are so so.

A real QUEST!","review":"Perhaps, this video is the best film (or gift) for those who like playing computer games and, particularly, computer quests. Visual effects and decor are so real that you can forget you are at home in your favourite armchair. Acting is perfect (and casting is well thought-out); music is very nice - the whole video demonstrates it is an organic whole. A very good job of professionals in every field. And I don't agree with those who think it is too slow - otherwise, you wouldn't be ready to understand and feel the idea and course of action.

This movie was neither scary, nor mysterious or thrilling.The scariest part to me was probably when Liam Neeson got the class stuck in his hand and had to pull it out. I found myself wondering why good actors such as this would actually agree to take part in this sorry excuse for a horror film.The movie has next to no plot, none of the stuff that happened was explained, and the stuff that was supposed to be scary wasn't. Oh My God it's a statue...let me scream in fear and trip over myself while I'm trying to run away!Skip this tripe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Haunted House CGI I've Seen So Far","review":"I like haunted house movies and this film is no exception. Yes, it is a \\"reimaging\\" of the original film and the plot differs a bit from that film. So what? That is what reimaging is all about.I'm also interested in paranormal phenomena and how they are depicted in films. The original film was scary because of the sound effects. There are also sound effects in this version AND now we get to see the spirits of the children and the evil Hugh Crane. CGI makes this possible as we see ghostly children outlined in curtains, weird morphed reflections, and a Hill House that literally comes alive and undergoes threatening distortions.I've watched this film several times since it arrived and have not been bored by it. Liam Nielsen portrays the deceptive scientist well and Catherine Zeta Jones is perfect in the part originally played by Claire Bloom.If you like spook house films, you will not be disappointed by this effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"in the crappy tradition of houseonhauntedhill and 13 ghosts","review":"there are some pretty crappy haunted house movies out there like 1999's House On Haunted Hill and 2001's 13 Ghosts, people who find those scary and intelligent should be shot because their a heap of junk. this one is alittle bit above both but the story and characters drop it in some parts. Lili Taylor at the end is horrible but Liam Neeson and Owen Wilson add some spark and some comedy to it especially Wilson and Catherine Zeta Jones is ok as well as the bisexual. strictly a horrible remake done by DeBont after the classic original"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"And not in an acceptable sense of the word!They took an excellent ghost story and tried to do something with it.The problem is that they relied way way way too heavily on special effects.

I don't get it.If Hollywood is going to rework a masterpiece, then play it straight. Just because you can do all sorts of things with special effects doesn't mean you have to try to put them in remakes, especially if the original is perfect!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty scary-not so swift ending","review":"I think that The Haunting is a good scary movie(as opposed to movies like \\"Scream\\"). Instead of dealing with pyscho people running around in masks, it actually deals with the supernatural which is always fascinating. The movie was cast very well and the special effects are incredible. The ending however, twisted the movie into a theme of bliss, contentment, and nurturing. A good scary movie should leave you with a sense of \\"what will happen next?\\". On the other hand, it would be hard to have a nightmare about it! All in all, it is a good movie that really screams the theme \\"good vs evil\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL, AWFUL, AWFUL","review":"To say that this version of \\"The Haunting\\" lacks all of the understatment, subtlty, and nuance of the book is obvious. To say that it lacks logic, coherence, character, and good directing is even more obvious. Unfortunately, the film is not aimed at the intellectual crowd who are fans of Jackson's book, or the classic horror fans of the original movie. Instead, the filmmakers (one of whom is, in this case, the gloriously misguided Steven Spielberg) have aimed the story at the video game/music video crowd, sacrificing every nuance and plot element to the whirlwind of uninteresting and unmotivated special effects. In a house where anything can happen, nothing is frightening when it finally does."},{"rating":"1","title":"ABSOLUTELY DISMAL, DISTRESSING FILM","review":"Despite this movie's impressive pedigree (classic novel, classic sixties horror film) \\"The Haunting\\" manages to foul the entire story up with dreadfully over-the-top special effects and a contrived, ridiculous story.

Special effects buffs may enjoy it, but wouldn't they enjoy a well thought out story laced with intelligence and wit better?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific apologetics novel explains Catholicism from Bible","review":"I want to mention a charming and compelling book I read over the weekend. It's hot off the presses! It's a novel about a young Catholic man (age 17) who spends the summer working on his uncle's horse-powered farm in KY. His uncle is a fundamentalist minister who tries to convert him away from the \\"Roman\\" church, which he believes is unbiblical at best, and at worst, evil. Young Michael doesn't know his Faith very well, but he studies Catholic apologetics and then very charitably and humbly, is able to counter his uncle's Bible-alone arguments and defend the Faith. This is not only a good read, it would be perfect for teens or adults. It presents the reasoning on both sides very effectively and realistically. Because the defenses are in the context of an interesting novel, I found myself more able to follow the line of reasoning. It also shows how prayer is crucial in evangelism. Great for either Catholics or non-Catholics. Five stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A marvelous, splendid gift on the Catholic Faith","review":"The book \\"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court\\" is marvelous, a splendid gift for setting forth the truths of our Catholic faith clearly and precisely.

After the death of his father, Michael and his family go to live with his Uncle Les, his mom's brother, in Kentucky for the summer. Down in Kentucky Michael is forced to defend his religion against his Uncle Les and church elders such as, Luther, George, and Jimmy. I enjoyed this book, but the only thing I disliked about it was that it was hard to get in to. The beginning was boring and wordy to me, but I finally got into the book during the Bible Studies.

I thought that it was a very good reading experience for me. As i got deeper and deeper into the book, it just started getting better and better.

Other than it was agood book and educational."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review For Mr. Puntel","review":"Having read \\"A Philadelphia Catholic In King James' Court\\" I received a better picture of the Catholic Church. I saw how different groups view the bible, and the contradictions that become present in the Fundamentalist interpretation of the bible. I found it hard to stop reading. At some points I found myself laughing at the arguments being made by Luther and Pastor Brown. I realized that there really are people in the world who act like this. Mr. Kennedy wrote a great book that taught me a few things, and inspired me to read more about the Catholic faith. I really enjoyed the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An online review!","review":"This book was a very good story, considering it was written within the bounds of a comparison of the Protestant and Catholic interpretations of the Bible. Kennedy takes ideas from both sides of the \\"conflict\\" that many people face in their lives, and molds them into a wonderful tale of a young man and the struggle with his uncle's faith. From the death of his father to the \\"questioning\\" and mocking of himself and his faith, he takes on the challenges that are presented to him and prevails, while at the same time creating a will to change in his cousin, Eli. I feel that anyone having unanswered questions with their faith should read this."},{"rating":"1","title":"APCIKJC by White","review":"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court was a Catholic vs. Fundamentalist Christians story. Michael, the main character who went from Philadelphia to Kentucky, defended Catholic views and procedures. He tried to explain new ideas to the Fundamentalist, but they where not open to these ideas. I personally felt it became better towards the end of the novel. At first it was slow-moving and hard to keep track of all the characters. The description became hackneyed, along with the plot. Also, reading about the farm life was hard to relate to. After the heated bible discussions began, the story was easier to read. Overall, this book was better than I had expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Untitled","review":"This book was a school reading assignment. When I first began to read it I anticipated that it would be rather dumb. It turns out that i was correct. I could not become interested. It had the worst plot and why anyone would read it for the purpose of personal interest it is umm oh yea stupid. Summing up my review I think it never should have been written."},{"rating":"1","title":"PCKJC Review by Kelvin Lam","review":"This novel shows the struggle of a young boy troubled by his own faith, with problems within his own family from his father's death, to his uncle's fighting against his faith. It shows his struggle to find out what Catholicism is, the flaws of it, and which religion he should follow. It shows the heresies against Catholicism, along with its strengths. It has a sheer lacking in the amount of entertainment in the book, yet it can either strengthen or weaken your faith. It is tends to be utterly dull at times. Not a good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Religion Review - LSCHS Student","review":"After reading A Philadelphia Catholic in King James Court by Martin DePorres Kennedy, it got me to thinking more about the religion I practice, Catholicism. As the book starts out, Michael, having just tragically losing his father, is thrown into a world; it would seem he is not ready for. As he gets to know his Uncle Les's fundamentalist view of the bible, he begins to realize not everything they practice does follow the bible. He begins to see arguments arise and he himself is challenged on the ways of the bible. The most significant change seemed to be his debate with Pastor Brown. Though Michael had seemed cornered he slipped out of harms way once again. In my opinion, this book gives an excellent overview of the issues that people have disagreed on and also why there was a split within the church. Overall, the book may have seemed boring to some, but the depth of knowledge it provided made me get a deeper understanding of what we really practice at mass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mr. Puntels Class","review":"The Book a Philadelphia Catholic in King James Court was a good Novel. The Book had a good story and premise. Based in Kentucky it talked a lot about the Aimish and farm life. The only thing that was remotely bad about the book was some unrealistic events. Overal it was a good book. The book looked and was boring at first but as the plot and storyline started to develop it got a lot better. If any one was wondering about or having doubts of the Roman Catholic faith, I definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Catholic aproach against Fundamentalist views","review":"Although unrealistic at times, this book still got accross the Catholic aproach of some major misunderstood topics. The book also presented how and why fundamentalists contradict the Catholic view of these topics. After facing a devastating situation early in the book, Michael overcomes it and defends the Catholic faith against fundamentalists and their interpretation using good apologetic arguments mainly from the Bible. Overall, I thought this book was very interesting although it had many unrealistic parts. This is a good book for people who want to know about the Catholic faith. It shows different aspects of Catholiscism in a well written fictional story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Erik Haney Book Reveiw","review":"I thought that, A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court was a very good book. It was very well written and had a good plot. It is the first ever apologetic novel, and it has done a good job in clearing the way for others. In this book, there were many good discussions on the differences between Catholics and Protestants. My favorite parts in the book were whenever, Michael was in the Bible study sessions, and these chapters were very exciting. In the book, there were many good characters that really helped to make this book a lot more interesting for the reader. I especially liked that Michael succeeded in bible study and convinced hid cousin Eli, through his teachings and discussions of the Catholic Church. I thought that the story was well written, and I would love to read a sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lschs student review for five points extra credit: by Rcase","review":"The book A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court was a book that had some things I liked and some things I didn't like. The things I like in the story outweighed the things that I did not like. For example, I liked the intense Bible discussions between the fundamentalist; Les, Luther, Jimmy, etc; and Michael, the lone catholic. Another thing I like was the fact that I learned so many new things about Catholics while I was reading the story. Some things I didn't like were the lack of reaction from the fundamentalist during the Bible discussions. Also, I didn't like how they ended the last chapter of the book; I don't think a pastor of a church would just kick someone out of their church for making a good point about something. The author makes that up in my mind when he writes the epilogue. In the end I think this was an above average book, t would give it four out of five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading entities...","review":"While Morison does admit to the genocide of the Indians lead by Columbus and his henchmen, it idolizes him for the duration of the book. A brief admittance of guilt, for Morison, is a surefire way of allowing a much more bias, idealistic portrayal of a man with \\"questionable\\" character traits. Bartolome De Las Casas, a European minister who lived in the same time as Colombus, gives a much more realistcally bleek look at the Spanish invasion of the Americas. Because Morison's focus shifts so rapidly from the bad to the good, it loses major points for realism. The book reads more like a 3rd grade textbook; Morison would have us believe Santa Claus and the toothfairy exists along side a saintly Christopher Columbus."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Scholarly Book for Serious Students of Yiddish","review":"Too many books that purport to teach you Yiddish treat it as either a joke or a relic. Prof. Weinreich's \\"College Yiddish\\" treats Yiddish as a living, expressive and literary language, not as a compendium of phrases to say to your bubbe when she visits, or as a collection of cursewords. The book consists of 30 graded lessons, each based on a text which covers some aspect of Jewish life, culture and history, and especially of the Jewish communities of central and eastern Europe for whom Yiddish was a bond. At the end of the book is an excellent precis of Yiddish grammar. But this book isn't \\"dry as dust,\\" either: Prof. Weinreich takes Jewish humor as seriously as he does Jewish culture and literature! Very highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Urban Bushmen: The Art Ensemble in top form","review":"Urban Bushmen is a thrilling record. The AEC's trademark percussion ensembles, jocular takes on marching music, etc., are surrounded by inspired playing. \\"New York is full of lonely people\\" is one of Lester Bowie's most enduring and beautiful melodies. Long enough to allow the group to do its characteristic stretching of time on long improvs, this is still, in my view, an accessible record. A great place to start exploring the music of the full quintet version of the band, along with their other ECM albums, and a pair of their live sets from early 70's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great - doesn't cover SQLite 3.0","review":"This is an old book, and doesn't cover the newer SQLite 3.x information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very useful","review":"As far as I know, this is the first book on SQLite and for that Chris Newman deserves a compliment.Beyond that, this book is not very useful though:1) It explains some basic SQL syntax but I didn't buy this book to learn SQL.2) Very little information about the specifics and pitfalls of SQLite syntax, I rarely find what I'm looking for.3) Being a PHP developer I don't need the chapters on C++, Perl, TCL and Python (about 25% of the book)."},{"rating":"1","title":"sound quality ??????","review":"the songs are good tunes but the sound quality is not very good. on some tunes you can hardly hear the guitar that is muffled by the bass.in fact the entire cd sounds muffled. i would go with raunch & roll before this one"},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks good, but not for mobile applications.","review":"I was hoping this unit would work out as a transmitter/receiver in my race car.

Half the phone numbers were disconnected and no response on the e-mails either.The product might have worked fine if I had a little tech support from the company.

Even at a very short distance of 10 feet, the signal continously drops. I even tried adding the \\"optional\\" Rf Link output booster. However, any movement near or between the transmitter and receiver (still at 10 feet) causes the signal to drop out.... totally unacceptable and unusable.

We've tried it on chicken and ribeyes thus far - it allowed the marinade that we use on ribeyes to permeate much better than before, which cuts down on time and makes a better steak! On the chicken, it easily turned standard grocery store chicken breast into restaurant quality tenderness.The handle is great, it's nice & comfy. The shape of the handle overall is ergonomically friendly.The tweak it needs: there are 4 disks in all, and all are stored in the head. The problem is that you MUST store the 3 that aren't in use in the head in order to hold the one disk you're using in place, effectively meaning that all must be washed, even though you're only using one. The benefit to this approach, on the flip side, is that you're less likely to lose a disk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent tempo","review":"I love doing this workout, and sometimes the breathing portion at the end is all I do, as it leaves me feeling great.

This book excelled in this task and made my visit to Rome even fuller and more enjoyable. If you are looking for a book about Rome, its people, their habbits and a little glimpse into their rich history, this book is a rare find. The pace is calm, the subjects are simple, but the experience is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally! A Travelogue About the Real Rome","review":"Paul Hofmann writes about his hometown the way any native would, with equal parts admiration and frustration. Sure, he describes the great trattorie, touches on the sordid histories of Rome's luxury hotels, and is continually mesmerized by the city's ancient ruins. But, anecdotes about such topics as the irregularity of the postman's visits, motorino pollution, municipal strikes, and lousy restaurant service, make the book come alive. Thank god this isn't another tired, old, tourist piece about how great it is to live abroad (\\"A Year in Provence,\\" anyone?) Hofmann's grouping of chapters by month is also innovative and helpful to travelers who want to know what goes on in the city the REST of the year. The book tends to be a bit dull in some places, owing probably to the fact that Hofmann wrote this book in his 70s or 80s. He knows little about hip, modern Rome. Nevertheless, his \\"diary\\" makes for a good read and a good history lesson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eternal City","review":"The word \\"journal\\" is part of this book's title, and it doesn't pretend to be anything else. After all, Paul Hoffman is a journalist. I've had the great good fortune to visit the Eternal City a few times, and reading Seasons is like taking another stroll along back streets and famous venues. It brought back happy memories and also reminders that Rome is a huge, noisy metropolis that is difficult to traverse. Hoffman also highlights that fact that Rome is populated by, well, Romans, as well as millions of other Italians, and conveys a sense of what it is like to live an ordinary life in an extraordinary place. The city described by this author is modern and genuine, and Hoffman's essays are devoid of the self-congratulatory tone of many other travel writers. This book is real."},{"rating":"2","title":"Babies LOVE this book!","review":"We actually got this crinkle book as a gift from a Disney set (from Sam's Club, I think) and our son LOVED it as a baby. It was one of two toys we always gave him when he was in the car seat. When he was really young (3-6 months or so) we would hang it from the car seat handle, and now that he's older (6-13 months), we just hand it to him. We just love hearing the \\"crinkle crinkle\\" from the back seat when we're out and about. He plays with it and chews on it and it still looks almost brand new. I agree with another reviewer that it's more of a toy than a book, but I still can't wait for him to be able to read it!

Through real-life annecdotes John Heelis conveys what should be obvious but isn't - Beatrix Potter was not a perfect human being, she had tiny flaws just like the rest of us. Sometimes she got cranky, occasionally she was absent-minded with her head in the clouds but mostly she was wonderful - although quite strong willed and opinionated.Those who are fascinated by Beatrix Potter will find the little book a great addition to their library. However, be forewarned - those who are buying this book for a voyeristic look into the intimate details of Beatrix Potter's married life will be sorely disappointed. This very private woman's private life remains private."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Mrs. Heelis than Beatrix Potter","review":"This is more a Heelis family history than a bio of Beatrix Potter. There are occasional mentions of Ms. Potter (or as she preferred to be called, Mrs. Heelis) but it does give you a relative's view of the well-known author.

The book is worth buying for Diary of a Madman or the Nose alone. These are both great stories that really show the uniqueness and talent of Gogol which seems even more amazing when thinking he was writing in the 19th Century.

It's a real kick in the pants to hear some of the pop tunes as they are interpreted here. The tuba player rocks! Forget the oom-pah!

Magnificently orchestrated pieces, they have an immediate and direct impact. As much as Falla's Nights in the Gardens of Spain or Ives' Three Places in New England, they describe a place, in this case, a city in Latin America circa 1905. Ricardo Castillo's tone poem Xibalbá evoques a world of magic and legends of the Mayan world.

In one chapter it actually states that most people who try pot don't feel any difference at all and wonder what all the fuss is about. Give me break. I'm not anti marijuana, but I do feel there is a time and place to use it. The author seems to shove her opinion down your throat that all the cares in the world would be solved if people were to stay stoned as much as possible. Of course the economy as we know it would collapse but we would be too stoned to care. I thought the book would give a more factual account of the pros and cons I was dissappointed that it turned out to be such a fairy tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Fiction","review":"One Hundred Years of solitude is close to perfection as fiction can get.

The characterization lacked depth but the writ-ing ha a beautiful quality of magical realism like inother books by Marquez. Again, Marquez's focus on pedo-philia was disconcerting.How can I like a writer so much yet dislike his book?The answer is that beautiful writing is not enough tocreate a good book. Their needs to be excellence inform and content. Marquez is excellent in form but heis very low in content. I found this book more confus-ing than any other book that I completed. If it hadnot been written by Marquez, I would not have finishedit."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't understand all the hoopla surrounding this book.","review":"This book has been extoled over and over to me throughout the years. I tried it about 5 yrs ago and quit after 30 or so pages, but this time when my book group chose it, I was determined to try it again. After all I'm 5 years older. I read it slowly, tried not to analyze it too deeply and become immersed in the flow of the culture. About l00 pages into it, I thought this is really creative and interesting. Fifty pages later, I was bored with its redundancy of characters, names and magical events. It picked up again in the last 50 pages, but it NEVER did for me what so many of the previous readers exclaimed about. I was disappointed. This is one book that didn't live up to its hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's all the fuss about?I had to force myself to finish it","review":"This is just a warning to those of you who think you may have found a new, great author to read: forget it.

I had to fight to finish this novel - I thought that at the very least, it would be as magical as Allende's House of Spirits, but I was severely disappointed. Unlike everyone else (or so it seems everyone else), this book did not change my sensibilities. The best part of the book was the last 40 or so pages, which ALMOST, almost, made the other 400 pages worthwhile.

It follows the lives of a family that deals with wars, tragic love, and mysterious dealings. I thorougly enjoyed reading this book and I recommend it to anyone who wants to enter a magical world filled with vibrant characters taking on all sorts of political and social issues to heart and then bending them as far as they can go. Think Dali."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Lovers of Latin American Literature","review":"I was pleasantly surprised to find this on Oprah's list. I read this book in college and it was my first exposure to magic realism. Such imaginative narrative is hard to come by and who could forget such events as the discovery of a dead angel, the whole town suffering from insomnia, or the beautiful Remedios (one of many)ascending to heaven? Just as a sidenote I find one of the characters toward the end is disturbingly like Michael Jackson with his lifestyle of decadence and his penchant for the company of little boys. It's a book that is very sensual and colorful, I would love to see it transferred successfully to film. But this book is not for anyone. Just for those who love truly imaginative literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Naptime","review":"Horrible! Boring and could not keep my interest.

I had to read it for a world cultures class in college and not even the teacher could tell us how it was relevant to what the class was about. The repetition of the men's names makes for a very confusing story line, and the son that was born with a tail? Weird, to say the least.

Asphyxiation.","review":"In what appears to be a stab at Western values this Prize winning author has created a confusing mess.Many people take this book and wade through it seeking some sort of enlightenment from such a prestigious work (Nobel Prize 1982). When, in reality, this book is a sophomoric slap at US and Western European anti-communist policies of the Cold War.I am not saying the Western policies were sound, but I will say that communism and the system it supported have been proven to be morally bankrupt and fiscally unsound. Perhaps the politics of the time pushed the Nobel Committee into giving an award that could have been given elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"What is the point of this book? It doesn't have one, in my opinion. The author himself said that the reason for writing it was that he wanted to write a book about incest!

I wouldn't have read past the tenth page if I hadn't been required to for my English class."},{"rating":"2","title":"A timeless classic","review":"The One Hundred Years of Solitude by Gabriel Garcia Marquez is one of the most interesting novel I have ever read. First it starts with a married couple who are counsins, afraid that they will have a child with a pig tail, a myth about what happens when you marry close relations. This novel has the most confusing set of characters with the same name carried on from generation to generation. And this novel has some of the most interesting events that you will ever read. As you read this novel, you can actually see each charactrer falling into their life of solitude, one by one.This novel is very good, and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book ever","review":"When reading is a chore and makes absolutely no sense at all, what is the point? I could not have made it through this book at all without the family tree in the front since so many of the characters have the same or similar names. I read on and on thinking it was going to all start making some sense or there would be a big ending, but in the end I put it down and felt like it was a huge waste of my valuable reading time. I re-sold the book as fast as I could unload it. It is really interesting and amazing to me how so many people love this book....I'm a reader in general but this one I just don't quite grasp. It is a nightmare of a read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe I just don't get it","review":"Not sure why this book has been so raved about. When I bought it, the book store clerk told me it was his \\"favorite book ever\\". That's quite an endorsement.I found it to be really uninteresting. It's almost all exposition, with little dialogue. The characters may be \\"memorable\\", but only because they're \\"boring\\". None of them have any personality (although one is well-endowed, which is nice) and is the author just *trying* to be difficult when he gives them all such similar names?This book felt like the authors parents told him lots of stories and fables when he was growing up, and he tried to cram them all into one long stream on consciousness tale. I abandoned it half-way through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started out good..","review":"I read this book before it became an Oprah pick- and was almost appalled that she had chosen it as something she deemed worthy for others to spend their precious time reading! It started out good to me, I didn't mind the magic realism. I actually thought it was quite charming. But after awhile it seemed that the story just went on, and on, and on... with no real end in sight. Most of the book just seemed kind of like page fillers to me,with no real significance to the story. I was ready to put the book down before I got even half way through, but forced myself to trudge through it to the bitter end.

However, I found the book extremely hard to follow, and without any identifyable plot line. Yes, it is interesting to see how a city can develop over 100 years of time, but all the characters kept dying off, and I found myself not being bothered by it, as nothing made me connect with them through the book.

I kept waiting for the story to generate even a spark of interest but it just never happened for me.

As I continued to read, waiting for the plot to kick in, or for something to persuade me to keep reading, I realized the moment would never come. This book represents some of the worst writing I have ever encountered, and it seemed like Marquez was trying too hard to sound poetic. Oh, and after hanging on to witness the full plot, I discovered that there really isn't one. I would not recommend this book to anyone because it is a complete waste of time-- so don't be fooled by people who claim this book is beautiful, like I did.

Indeed, it's easy to get tangled in so many Jose Arcadios and Aurelianos, but this is really a great story.

Only in the final pages does it become clear that all which has transpired over the generations was foretold as the rise and fall of the Buendia family by the mystical gypsy Maquiliades.

I really enjoyed it, tho it took me 3 weeks to read it. Everytime I opened it back up to continue where I was I felt like I was stepping back into Macondo. There's no place like it nor is there a family like the Buendia's either. The story and the words used by Marquez are so deep in meaning and a sentence can mean so many things.

The prose is lyrical and flows as smoothly as a river. That is, sometimes there are rapids and other times calm. The genre is magical realism, and it is fascinating watching the magic evolve with the family and village. After finishing this book, I'm not 100% certain what Marquez meant by it, though.

Years from now, when this age in art history is named Magic Realism or something like that, this book will be its definition.

I promise that if you pick it up, finish it, and think about it, you will realize that it has the most wonderful, important, and intelligent endings ever written. The realization of it for the reader is almost overpowering. I'm only 17, and I know I will read this book many more times in my life.

It is not really all that long, never dull, and clearer than the most transparent crystal (although, taken at a deeper level, the book offers much more than what appears on the surface). In many respects, the book tells of the rise of, and predicts the fall of, humankind. In this sense, it is allegorical fiction at its finest. Along the way, it tells a cornucopia of stories about love, war, peace, remembrance, time, joy, pain, and many other emotions beyond description in this small amount of space."},{"rating":"2","title":"Written with the intent to CAPTIVATE !!","review":"One of the few books of AP English that I actually finished, this book held me spellbound. It created that thirst that took over 400 pages to satisfy.desc I've read the reviews of others on this site, and most either loved it or hated it. (Which is the usual responce when a book this amazing is written.) The slow, destined, circular descent of the Buendia family promoted the view that time does not travel in a straight line, but twists and turns and repeats itself. The family represents mankind (i think), and many of the occurences and metaphors of the story remind the reader of historical and psychological truths. And the little tidbits of \\"whaat!\\" kept the book light-hearted and fun to read, as all 400 page books should be. Those who didnt like it probably mis-directed their attention, avoided the depth but critiqued the purposely shallow ends of the book. In conclusion, a beautiful read, definitly should be required reading for all of humanity!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Opens up worlds","review":"Unfortunately for Marquez, this is the title that is most loved.

It wasn't until college and when I read Garcia Marquez's 100 Years -- that the American novel took on a new and wonderful meaning. A work vibrant and unique, with undertones of the old world, but one still wholly and distinctly a creation of this side of the world. 100 Years is as impressive as Moby Dick, Gatsby, Huck Finn -- and a novel of uncommon beauty, vision, and style"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fantastic Story","review":"100 Years of Solitude is an amazing story where reality and fantasy meet in the lives of the Buendias.

Every sentence reads like poetry and soon you are entranced, finding yourself drifting dazily into the town of Macondo, and imagining hanging your cot with the rest of the Buendia family. I have read this book three times, and notice new glimpses of Marquez's genius each time. And if the lyrical passages and poetic descriptions aren't enough, there is lots of sex, war, jealousy, violence, passion and love. Only the brilliance of Marquez could combine all of this into one book.

This seems like a great story!\\" I found myself growing more depressed and disgusted with every page. Although the style and Marquez' technique are unquestionably wonderful, the overlaying themes of lust, lack of self-control, and immorality outweighed the good. The goal of nearly very character's life is the same; to please him or herself. Very few characters are in the least bit caring of self-sacrificing. The only way I could reconcile myself to reading this disapointing work was the fact that it is a lesson in man's depravity. I realized that every person, without God's intervention, is just as bad or worse than Marquez' perverse characters. The book is not without its high points- I loved the ending, the mystery of the Segundo twins, and Ursula's strength. There are some passages where the language is incredible. Marquez is a mastery of imagery! I only wish that there had been more positive images to remember...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzz ...","review":"One hundred years of characters and you won't care about one.

It was just boring and confusing, pure and simple."},{"rating":"1","title":"Classic?","review":"I'll come clean first. I stopped reading after 100 pages. A lot happens in this book, with deaths and spirits and insomnia and marriages, and it's all fairly easy enough to figure out what's going on. Yet, nothing happens. So much plot takes place that the characterization suffers. I simply didn't care what happened to the characters, or anyone in the town. If a bomb had levelled Macondo, I would have simply flipped to the next page to see what happened next, not to read on about the characters. If you're interested in a classic worthy of its praise, where characterization is king, do yourself a favor and pick up Sound and the Fury by William Faulkner. You'll work to read, but your mind and soul will be enriched. Faulkner's novels are like movies you watch in slow motion to get every nuance. Marquez, on the other hand, is like a movie you watch in fast forward. You get the plot and action, but when all is said and done, nothing sticks in your mind that is worthy of the space it occupies."},{"rating":"1","title":"100 Years of Absolute Torture!","review":"This book is long, dull, boring and confusing. It lacks the passion that makes Love in The Time of Cholera so beautiful. It make \\"Tess of the D'Urburvilles\\" look like a fast-paced romp. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone"},{"rating":"1","title":"A skilled rapist","review":"The acrid smell of sweat, dung and animals, coupled with the stifling heat, permeates the village of Macondo, where the novel takes place. Incest, murder, and suicide are everyday happenings, especially the first. Marquez pushes a dizzying and horrifying picture of the human condition, which left me feeling as if I had been raped. My options here seem to be either to dismiss Marquez as an extraordinarily skilful madman or to go mad myself. I choose the former. An ugly novel, not the less ugly for the undeniable talent with which it is executed. I do not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"All tell, no show","review":"I read literary fiction, \\"smart\\" books, and could deconstruct an eggplant if I needed to. And this book is a chore to read.It is all tell and no show. One long narrative.But that is not what I consider to be the source of the problem. Here's what is: the book is not compelling.Many people assume a book that has won prestigious awards must be great, but awards can spread like a virus, wiping out independent judgement along the way.I just finished reading Cities of the Plain by Cormac McCarthy. It is smart and beautiful and compelling and much more worthy of your reading time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a fun read","review":"I can see this is an unpopular but not unique opinion, but this is one of the very few books I've stopped reading halfway through. And I have no intention of ever finishing it. Despite the fact that I horde books, I gave this one away.While the prose was beautiful, the story tended toward the dull and was difficult to follow. The fact that there were only a handful of names reused by dozens of characters did not help much. Most of the characters were unlikable and hard to relate to. After awhile I decided I just didn't care anymore.Is this book a masterpiece? Perhaps it is, but that doesn't mean it's a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my best reads","review":"A hundred years of solitud depicts a bygone era of South America. The uniqueness of this book is the portrayal of \\"small town Latin America\\". This is a book you should read in Spanish, something is always lost in translation. The frame of mind of Latin America is well described and trasnports the reader into a world, that has been later explored by other Latin American authors.His writing style is widespread and well known worldwide.His \\"Novel Prize\\" in literature was well deserved."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Important Novel","review":"One Hundred Years of Solitude is one of the most fascinating books I have ever read ( and I have read thousands).Marquez is a giant. His skill is like that of a mythical creature, like a Phoenix combined with a hundred great authors.The pure fact that this book was written by one man is amazing. I don't want to say anything about the story. If you care about great literature, do not let life pass by without reading Marquez' masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"100 years of slow reading","review":"This highly overrated book indicates the havoc that overweight talk show hosts can wreak upon the literary world. Garcia's most juvenile and frustrating book is now being yammered about by book clubs the world over who suddenly think they know about South American authors.The book is overly long and repetitive; themes are repeated ad nauseum. Characters (some of whom have the same name) are one dimensional and unbelievable. By the time you reach the halfway point in the book you are praying for something different to happen. Then Garcia introduces a new character, has him act just like all the others, and die within 3 pages. It's amazing how quickly he mows down his creations, as if he is as tired of them as I was.In the end there are no surprises, and you feel exhausted from the repetition. Underwhelming, and nowhere near as good as \\"Love in the Time of Cholera\\".Give it a miss and try \\"Blindness\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"big disappointment","review":"I bought this book four years ago and finally forced myself to read it from cover to cover. I can't believe all the \\"5 star\\" reviews people are giving it. This book was one big disappointment and has been exiled to the bottom shelf in my collection. The characters are meaningless, the text is scattered and awkward. Perhaps something was lost in translation, who knows. I've never been one to give up on a book but I considered it many times with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"one hundred years of futility","review":"This book is pernicious. LIfe is predetermined, plotless, circular and meaningless. Why bother to write a book at all, if in the end, this is the grand message. How sadistic."},{"rating":"1","title":"At page 250 I'm still struggling and am an avid reader!","review":"I read constantly and although I've only read a few books that I feel warrant 5 stars, I am amazed that this best seller IS a best seller. Most of the characters have the same or very similar names. The family tree at the beginning of the book is no help since the men seem to sleep with the same women. If you want to read a latin magic themed book read Blindness. This book is difficult to get through, but has an absolutely amazing premise and once I got used to the narrative style, I couldn't put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"100 years of boreitude","review":"I can count on one hand the number of books in my life that I have been unable to finish. I am oftimes mocked for my reading, the rate at which I devour books being astronomical, but I could not drag my weary brain kicking and screaming through more than a few dozen pages of this book.I love a good fantasy novel, or anything that gives you a sense of the magical, but I could not find anything interesting in the random and inexplicable bizarre occurrences in this book. Mix that with the dry, long winded prose and I find myself doing something I have NEVER done; sitting with a book in my hands, looking around the room for something else to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing, Long and Boring","review":"Was this story lost in translation? I almost gave up on this book half a dozen times, but kept on reading thinking it could only get better. Boy was I wrong!The dozens of characters blur together in an entanglement of crooked, incestuous limbs on a family tree. Even the family chart (yes, a chart) provided at the beginning of the book wasn't enough to keep the members of the Buendia family straight. Look elsewhere!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to stab my eyes out...","review":"This novel was painful for me to finish. I'm sad that I devoted so many hours of my life to reading this book...hours I will never get back.It is a \\"preferred book\\" for my son's 10th grade AP Language class...I read it and told him to stay far, far away from it.

I like a fiction book to be entertaining and thought provoking; with a point, I did not at all enjoy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"So many Buendias","review":"This book was everything it is billed to be. I picked it up as a \\"classic to read over the summer\\". This is one of the better choices I've made in this annual quest. Although I must admit to getting very lost at times trying to keep all of the Jose's, Ursula's and others straight. I often found myself re-reading chapters to figure out exactly who was involved! That said, the re-reading was not unpleasant, as it can often be when you get lost.This is a book that you should add to your \\"things to read to remain well-rounded\\" list (just make sure you have plenty of time - this is not a quick read.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"It\`s hard to read it but u will be amazed by it","review":"It was the first great book i\`ve read and i must admitt it took me a while( i was 16 then)but this book is great.It\`s just perfect.i love GGM and his style.He just manges to express feelings so easily and everything in this book seems perfectly beliveable even if some things are magical and don\`t get in connection with reality.This book is hard to review.One must read it to understand it.It\`s just that one cannot resume this book here.This book must be experienced."},{"rating":"2","title":"The World Repeating Itself...","review":"The Story of Macondo and the Buendia family. What a wonderful story full of imagination, sorrow, laughter, solitude, and reality in the same time. How the wars changed the mentality of people, change their behavior, traditions, and it makes them lose the respect for any human relation. How the founded city went from being the most simple, and peaceful place, to this horrifying, deserted city that the technologies ran through it, and its own people stopped caring about what's best for it.How being solitary was the response to many answers, how the Buendia men acted to their defeats, to their pleasures, and how far did they go in order to explore what was out there.The story could be slow at times, but the end has its own unique twist that shows how important history is, and how sad it is when we waste time not doing what we always dreamt of.Such a classic worth reading by Marquez, what dreams, deaths, madness, war, and what pressure has this life on us."},{"rating":"1","title":"GET YOUR SLEEPING BAGS READY!","review":"CUZ THIS BOOK IS A \\"SNOOZE FEST!\\"ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE IS RIGHT CUZ THAT'S HOW MUCH TIME YOU'LL NEED IF YOU EVER WANNA FINISH THIS!I HIGHLY DOUBT OPRAH MADE IT PAST CHAPTER ONE.ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ"},{"rating":"2","title":"Magical Realism at its best","review":"I guess that is where this book is usually categorized in. Apparently, Gabriel Garcia Marquez popularized the genre. I loved the book and would put it in the top five of my list. There are people who I've talked to that thinks it was confusing or complicated. That was not the case for me. It's true that there were many characters (and it does not help that a lot of them are named similarly). But, I think each of them is distinct and was developed very well. The book is not about the town of Macondo...it's about the people who lived there. And, you will be able to relate to the book because of its very human characters set in an environment that is often very real but occasionally eerily surreal. That's magical realism for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Among My Most Common Recommendations","review":"As an author with my debut novel in its initial release and an educator in an impoverished border-area high school with a student population usually 99% Latino, I can safely say that Gabriel Garcia Marquez's ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE is among the most common book recommendations I make to my most gifted students. ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE rests near the top of last century's literary works. It is the perfect example of magical realism, and it practically introduced Latin American literature to the world scene. This book is tops. If you haven't read it, do!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Qualifier","review":"There appears to be a good many who support this book, but none that actually ilustrates explicitly its hidden gem or genius, if there is indeed any. personally i don't see why it's so fantastic. the suspension of fixed parameters and a \\"realistic\\" framework in general seems to be an easy way to avoid the more prosaic elements and ensuing entanglements in life, and may also be construed as a rather cheap method to beguile readers into a seeming style and artistry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for chickens","review":"This book is not for those who only loved the Chicken Soup for the Soul series. No, this one's for the strong individual. If you have trouble living outside the block - don't touch this one. This one will take you through a journey, with a family through a period of hundred years. The characters are real,raw,blooded,bold,beautiful-people as they should've been before the great civilizations marred our brains with less significant worries. This one is a fantasy with characters you're only dreamed of , if ever. I would recommend it to those who have done a great deal of reading already and not someone checking out on some classics."},{"rating":"2","title":"An exceptional book; Beautiful!","review":"There is so much about this book to comment on that it is better for me to keep my comments simple. Yes, it is a difficult book to read and many times I felt myself very confused over who was who and about what was going on. I suppose if you are someone who doesn't want a challenge and you want things very clear and uncomplicated, then this book may not be for you. However, the magical realism does not take away from the absolute beauty and emotion of this book. After reading the book I was in awe of how anyone's writing could be so complicated and so beautiful! I honestly think it is one of the best books ever written and I have read a ton of books! I recently purchased Marquez's newest book (I believe it is his autobiography?) and cannot wait to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't think of a good title at all","review":"The negative reviewers here seem, more or less, to want this book to move faster, or get to some kind of specific point, and are upset that it doesn't. So I'll make this suggestion, if you are reading to get to the end of a book, don't read this book; you won't deserve it. Read a Michael Chrichton book or something. On the other hand, if you are willing to be swept into an epic story that is written (and translated) with style and grace, plotted with a mature sense of wonder, and will make you weep, laugh, and seethe with anger, then read this one.No matter how many times I reach the last page of this book, I never feel like I've \\"finished\\" it. it always pulls me right back into it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough is Enough","review":"Just recently, I decided to give this book a second chance. Like other reviewers here, I hardly ever give up on a book. But about 30 pages into the SECOND attempt, I am feeling exhausted. All of the bright and shiny books on my bookshelves have never looked so good at this point. So I came here, read the reviews and feel better. I think I can put this book away and be at peace with not appreciating it. I will say, some of the words Marquez uses- his descriptions, seem to have been created especially for the world that exists within this book. But is the trip worth it? I have decided that it is not. Thank you all for helping me be at peace with NOT completing this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nobel Prize?","review":"So if the Nobel Prize is for the author's body of work then again it does not say much about his work because his most famous work (100 years of solitude) is CRAP (that's in capital letters). If this is his best work and most famous work and it is a labor to read then his other works must be capital punishment!!!Much like the best book of the century by James Joyce - Ulysses.Again another book to be placed in Solitary Confinement!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty stupid","review":"Starts off good, but after about 200 pages, it gets pretty stupid. Lots of repetition, and very trite. Totally unbelievable too; some of the stuff that happened in this book would NEVER happen in real life, such as a girl floating up into the sky, or people living into their 120s. Ant the book didn't even have any pictures!!! OMG!!! Check out the General and his Labrynth if you want to read something good by Garcia Marquez (or \\"Call of the Wild\\" by Jack London, perhaps the best book ever)."},{"rating":"1","title":"pointless","review":"This is one of the hardest to read most pointless books I have ever had the misfortune of trying to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read for everyone","review":"It took me until I was 21 years old until I finally read this novel. It was well worth it, and I have read it again since then. It is a little hard to read, but it is a classic. I suggest that you use the family tree in the front of the book. It is nearly impossible to keep track of all the characters. It may take you a little while to become completely imersed in the story, it starts out a little slow. But, it will be well worth it to keep going."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still reading, but definitely a keeper","review":"This is a classic that I've heard so much about. I enjoy a good fiction novel and thus far, am liking this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my Favorite Books of All Time.","review":"If you're truly looking for a book to \\"get lost\\" in, this is it. This particular edition is completely fine, no better or worse than any other, but honestly - it's all about the book itself. It's one of those stories you can read a dozen times, and still enjoy, and find something new in."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Absolute Good","review":"I stumbled upon this book quite by accident and without meaning to, rediscovered the world around me. That's what truly great literature can do; transcend its status and color a person's view of the world like some life changing event, a birth or a death.Clearly I have personal feelings towards this book, but, to put it simply, this is the novel that made me love literature. In the past I appreciated good writing. I had my degree in English, was prepared to throw down over Moby Dick as needed, but I never loved literature until I discovered the Buendia's and Macondo.What I had been missing was what so many modern writers fail to get across-the mystery of life. Garcia-Marquez solves no riddles and answers no questions. In fact, he doesn't really ask any questions. That's not why he writes. On the contrary, Garcia-Marquez is just a simple storyteller, plying his trade, lolling around in the melodrama of life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magical Blend","review":"Gabriel Garcia Marquez weaves a story of a hundred years of love, lust, tumult and downfall in this chronicle of the rise and fall of the Buendia family and the settlement of Macondo. His lyrical prose makes family curses, fortune-tellers, magic carpets and levitation as real and alive as civil wars, passionate and reckless men and women, and banana company plantations. Foolhardy and powerful men, their wives, and mistresses match the tempestousness of the times as they contribute to the fated doom of the family. Marquez creates an atmosphere of languid fatality where old men and women do and undo their chores in an unending spiral till death relives them from their solitude.The translation by Gregory Rabassa preserves the musical qualities of the original langugage.Certainly among the finest novels of the 20th Century."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oprahs may be the devil...","review":"But dont let that stop you from reading this book. This is the a must read for everyone. As I finished the last page of this book, I flipped it over and started it again. Mr. Marquez takes literature to a new level. This book is seriously clowning on a lot of other recommended and required books throughout history. To not read this book, is to not ever truly experience a great story. Whatever sad excuse for a book you are reading put it down and pick this up. You will never forgive yourself if you dont."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank goodness...","review":"... that Oprah chose this book for her Book Club. Because, you know, that Nobel Prize endorsement is just so overdone. (Does anyone know if she has reviewed the Bible yet? the Torah, perhaps?)As a fan of 'stream of consciousness' (or to quote a fellow poster, \\"rambling'), I actually enjoyed GGM's style. It was a struggle at times, though. But I would recommend it to anyone wanting to expand their streams of consciousness. I suppose if anything positive may be said about the Oprah Book Club, it's that it at least encourages people to read GGM's work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some of the best writing ever","review":"I wish I were more proficient in Spanish so as to be able to read this novel as GGM put it to paper. I can't even begin to compare the prose, the images invoked, to any other writer I've been exposed to; they just don't compare to Marquez. I'm reading it for the 4th or 5th time and can't put it down. The words just seamlessly fall into place in snyc with my thoughts and imagination. That part of this novel is a wonderous experience. As to the content, the Buendias are a family I've become familiar with and increasingly revolted by. Behind all of Marquez's dense fog of magical prose is the sick reality of this family. I understand the intent, but didn't really pay it any attention until the 2nd reading or so. It's animalistic, barbaric, incestuous, and callous; it's a fairly tale on heroin. If you enjoy the style and prose this will be one of your favorite books, but you'll only know if it clicks with you if you give it a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all-time favorites!","review":"The first time I finished this book, I tried to tell all my friends and family members about the story, but could not find the words. I am so glad my fellow readers have the same difficulty in describing this wonderous tale!The second time I finished this book, I was no closer to having a description than before...and so it goes into the 4th, 5th, and even 10th reading.However, you would have to look long and hard to find more beautiful fiction. Trust me on this one...read it and enjoy a once-in-a- lifetime experience...you will be glad you did!"},{"rating":"2","title":"sensational and invigorating","review":"\\"One hundred years of solitude\\" is incredible for many reasons, including its cyclical portrayal of the Buendia family. The family is being torn by the desire for solitude, as the Colonel becomes very aware of, and the need for love. Many characters repeat history, doing what theyre ancestors have done. This is a splendid book that was and easy read, but had alot of messages underneath the explicit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Use of language","review":"I was surprised at how little was lost in the translation of this book. Garcia writes this novel as if it were poetry, he has a wonderful use of language that seems to braid mystical as well as humurous aspects into his writing. This is a novel that I won't forget and recommend readily."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best I've ever read.","review":"Even though this became one of the best classics in modern literature, it's not really \\"classical\\" or dated at all. If you like mystery, you will like it. If you like Sci-Fi, you will like it. If you like psychological novels, you will like it. If you like picturesque novels, you will like it. Anyway, you will difinitely like it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"I simply could not finish reading this book. The characters' lives and their family lines twist in and out of each other until the tangled mess is too difficult to decipher. The magical, surreal quality of some of the stories felt \\"cheesy\\" and not very convincing. I do not understand what the big fuss is about this book. I quit after about 100 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the few books I have stopped reading","review":"I even finished Brothers Karamazov and Bleak House, but this one I quit. I felt like I was wasting my time trying to remember the characters and their relations and what in the world is occuring in this make believe town of Macondo. Marquez may be a skilled writer and storyteller, but this book confused, bored and frustrated me without offering entertainment or insight.So what if Oprah picked it and if it has been labled a classic...it is not enjoyable or remarkable to me. I think I made it to about page 150 or so.With so many books to read, why waste time trying to decipher this one?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Discussion Book, Bad Airplane Book","review":"I think that Mr. Marquez is a far superior story teller than he is a writer. It is too bad you can't sit around a fire listening to his stories instead. This book basically has no overall plot, but many smaller plots for each little story within it. I thought the sheer number of characters who names were similar (if not the same) was very annoying. I had a hard time connecting with any of the characters due to the weaving in and out of other characters. I know that there was a family tree in the beginning, but I just got tired of flipping back to the point that I just did not care.To the average reader, without a discussion group or a literary expert, many of the \\"hidden gems\\" will be missed if there are any. On the whole, I just couldn't shake the vibe that I was reading an extended version of the Old Man and the Sea.It was interesting from the point of reading a Mexican writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"Disturbing! This is the only single word that I can use to describe this book.Although definatley unique it the composition style, the book is dark and depressing. The theme of incest and child porn appeared to be the primary focus in the book instead of creationalism as eluded to in other reviews.It had an interesting ending but not worthy of the time spent leading up to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book doesn't need anybody's blessing.","review":"I read this book ages ago, and since I can remember it's been considered a masterpiece worldwide. It seems like in some places a celebrity's blessing is needed to get the attention of those who instead of reading good literature are connected to the television watching crappy stuff. Well, if you fit the glove, then don't even bother leaving a review, carry on watching your stuff and leave the reviews for the ones who really enjoy good literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"100 years to read, a bramble of impenetrable verbage...","review":"It takes a long time to learn about over fifty characters and this novel's meandering prose and run-on sentences don't make it any quicker. This is gritty, offbeat stuff for the serious Garcia-Marquez enthusiast. The reward readers must feel at the end is that they've endured a tedious, difficult novel, but not an enjoyable one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, my.","review":"I recognize that lots of people think this book is wonderful. However, as an extremely well-read English major, I think Marquez must be laughing. Without repeating the comments of the other one-star reviewers, I'll just say that I was more than underwhelmed. It's nonsenical, and (am I the only one who noticed?) misogynistic."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just don't get it...","review":"After reading the reviews for this book, I was excited to read it. I am a huge fan of magical realism, but this novel...I just don't get it. I have about 100 pages left, and this may be one of the first books I do not finish reading. It just seems to go on and on and on...with nothing exciting or engaging. I feel like I am missing something about this book after reading the overwhelming majority of GREAT and moving reviews, but it just isn't my cup of tea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Struggling","review":"I agree with the other reviewers that say this book is tedious and much overrated. I read quite a bit, and I usually enjoy everything I read. However, I just cannot get in to this book. Yes, it is rambling, confusing, and all those other adjectives someone else used. But I don't want rambling and confusing. I don't want to be spoon fed, but it would be nice if there were an identifiable path for the book. I wonder how much is lost in the English translation, and if it would be a much better read in its native language.I am a few hundred pages into the book. I'll keep reading -- and keep hoping that it improves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would've taken me 100 years to read","review":"I read a ton of books, and have no problem with long or \\"difficult\\" reads. But it was just plain excrutiating to read this book! I got about halfway through and, after speaking with others who finished it and was told nothing really ever happens, I gave up. It's the same boring stuff over and over again. The characters' names are all so similar it's impossible to keep track of who's who, but who cares, because the author doesn't give you reason to care about any of them anyway! It's business as usual for a long time with regards to realism, then out of nowhere.. a flying carpet. (I'm sure at that point in the book, I resembled my dog tilting his head to one side over something perplexing and unexplainable.) There are sooo many captivating and enriching books out there.. I don't recommend wasting your time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most painful reading and I did finish it.","review":"My wife loved this book. I belong to a book club at work and they chose this book. I finished it. It was painful. Other members in the club also agreed -- It was extremely tedious, repetitiously annoying and not funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"The emperor has no clothes","review":"Boring, boring, boring. After 120 pages, I gave up. What is the point? I guess I don't get it. What was this guy smoking? How many characters need the same name? How many absurd tortures do we need to read about? The fantasy appears to be thrown in just for the sake of making incidences wild and imaginary and do not seem to be relative to the story or themes. Maybe something was lost in the translation, but if this is the next best thing to Genesis, we're all in trouble. Read The Red Tent --- it comes a lot closer to that billing.Sorry, but I have other books to read, and many yawns before I sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rambling, boring, and confusing","review":"Some interesting parts to this novel, but it drags on much too long and does not translate into a good American read. Sorry, Oprah!Paragraphs can last for pages and everyone has the same names--Aureliano, Ursula, Segundo, Aradio, and Remedios. Heck, one Aureliano had 17 sons who were ALL named Aureliano. so, often times the reader cannot tell who Marquez is referencing without looking at the family tree graphic in the front of the book.Maybe I am not a deep thinker, but I found this book to be ponderous. And the story lines that are somewhat interesting are never are made clear as to their importance to the overall tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"ARRRRRRRGH","review":"I forced myself through this because someone told me it would be good. Every day I read this I expected to be blown away. Alas, I was disappointed. After several hundred pages of unoriginal dribble and disgusting incest, I finally came up for air. About every three lines in this book I felt like having an aneurism. The \\"magical realism\\" crap that everyone rants lovingly about in this book is a load of garbage. No, it's not creative. It's boring and annoying. The author randomly throws supernatural phenomena into the story at random points and doesn't have enough originality or creativity to explain it or make it interesting; he just moves on. No, sorry, I won't explain why this person is psychic. Oops, this person just snapped. Sorry. Hey, whaddya know! It's raining flowers. Oh why not I'll throw in some ghosts... maybe some magical gypsies... and we've got an inane bore-fest. Useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I read it halfway hoping that a plot line would develop, it never did. Too much incest and I hated how everyone had the same name. I love thought provoking books that you have to work at but this is just plain silly. This book is for the phony intellectuals who want to say they read it and feel cultured. This book is just awful, there are way too many good books to waste your time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't like it","review":"The story is about a family of inbreds told over a few generations. Most of the characters in the story have the same name , who suddenly die and get replaced with another character with the same name. It becomes confusing after a while to track who is who, who is dead or alive or who is the parent of who. I stopped reading about half way because I was lost and confused. The book is not a light or fun read, it requires great concentration and mental effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Appalling. . .","review":"I checked this book out of the library after reading rave review after rave review.I wanted to like it, I really did, but I honestly cannot understand all the high marks. To me the book reads as if it were written by a 6th-grader. Characterization and storyline aside, the language itself is what turned me off. It seemed stilted, contrived, lacking in fluidity, and devoid of any real color; an amateurish effort at best.Perhaps this reads better in its native tongue, but the translation I read was atrocious. I promptly returned it to the library, shooting it soundly down the return bin with a force that it so richly deserved."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude","review":"This book has one of the finest desriptions and analysis of literature one can find in any author on its highly desciptive work of the Buendia family and, so called, Mocondo.........but really, the nobel prize for literature for 400+ pages of such bore and repetitiveness. I have also read some of the reviews on this page and must conclude that either readers have terribly boring lives, that this kind of literature can be so compelling with the surreal and completely over exaggerated descriptive material. Nobel Prize..huh..make a good soap opera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad I'm not alone in my opinion","review":"I came back to read the Amazon reviews because, after reading half of this book, I've begun to wonder when/if it's going to get good. I hate to put down a book I've started- even if it bores me- so I wanted to be reminded of how great this one is supposed to be. Now I know I'm not alone in my confusion. This book came very highly recommended, but I've just been waiting and waiting to enjoy it. I think I've gone far enough and I can return it to the library. I'm really glad I didn't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"very bad paper quallity","review":"very bad paper quality. some of them torn on side. papers had different size!!! so some were popping out of book!!! not happy with my purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good qualities, but no cohesiveness or overall point","review":"I am an avid reader, and I don't mind a challenging read. I started reading this book at the suggestion of some colleagues, and a woman in my book club. I know it is considered a \\"modern classic\\", won the Nobel Prize, etc. - but I couldn't even pretend to like this book. To the author's credit, his imagery and descriptions are beautiful. I admired the magical world that was evoked by the style of storytelling. But the plot was next to nonexistent, and after about 100 pages, I really felt like I was on a road to nowhere. The story went off on tangent after tangent with no real, identifiable purpose. Reading this book gave me the feeling of being locked in a room with a very creative, yet nonsensical crazy person that won't shut up. After a while, it gets old."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can see its appeal to some, but I didn't like it....","review":"I picked up this book to read it because several of my friends were reading in from the Oprah book club. It is a complex novel with many characters and a very mystical feel to it. The writing has a stream-of-consciousness style to it which makes you feel like you are listening to someone tell you a story with lots of side remarks. My issue with this novel was not the mystical feel or the writing style, though they do take some getting used to. My problem was that the whole thing just seemed to be about war and sex, and although both things have their place in life and literature, they weren't things that I wanted to read an enormous novel about. Also, this book is really quite tragic and I just prefer to read things with a more positive spin. I can see how this novel would appeal to some people because it is so complex and meaty....there is a lot to the stories in this book! It just wasn't for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining in short doses, funny in observation of people, hard work","review":"I enjoyed it mostly although it was hard going. I'm not sure what it was about except I think it was partly about how we can live very close to other people and still not understand each other at all. This was a group of people leading lives of solitude although they were supposed to be family and community. I grew to like the weirdness like the ghosts, and the bizarre happenings. I think the author was writing as if what goes on in your own head was actually real. The cover said it was enthralling - I did not think so. It also said it was supernatural, magical which it was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"I took this book up twice before I could go through with it. First time I got confused by the character names. Second time I couldn't really understand the plot at all, because it was so strange and fantastical and dropped it 100 pp in. The third time I could not put it down. I think you need to have a strange sort of patience and level of acceptance for things that can't be easily categorized or named. Strange things happen in this town and to this family. Yet, in all the strangeness you can see real history, sad as it is.This book is one of very few that changed my life, my view of people, families, life. I think you need to be ready for this book in some way or another and be accepting. I saw a few people complaining that the book is immoral because it depicts incest. How can a book be immoral? Incest may be immoral but it happens in life and the book doesn't promote it in any way."},{"rating":"2","title":"******It Has It All********","review":"Thank you Oprah for selecting this book. I absolutely loved it!I owned this novel for a few years before I actually sat down and read it. I often read the first page and felt it was dull - I was wrong. Solitude has become one of the best novels I've ever read. Garcia-Marquez not only includes vivid descriptions but also incorporates everything a novel should have from sibling rivalry, to war, loneliness, magic, humor, drama, incest, sex etc. Solitude is often mysterious and delves into all of our dark thoughts, while also showing our desires. I often found myself frustrated with the decisions the characters made yet understood why they made them.I cannot say enough about this wonderful novel, except I just regret waiting so long to enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rewarding.","review":"This book is written with a meticulos particularity that is hard to grasp. Following the bloodline requires a geneology chart that was provided in the front cover of my copy.Gabriel Garcia Marquez captivated me with his realistic characters and the mystical events that shaped this area. Noticing a parrallel between the expansion of human beings from the beginning of civilization and the progress of the town of Macondo is essential to understanding the book's promise.The book is difficult and causes many people to put it down. However, after reading this book I placed it on the top of my bookshelf and admired its brillance. It is rewarding."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful Translation","review":"This book was beautifully translated, there was nothing that was lost. Every generation blends together so well that it's amazing. I know others find it boring at times, but I found that there isn't a moment of boredom while reading it. I loved this book. It was so very well-written, and the characters truly shine and come alive. I think everyone should read this classic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"This is absolutely the most wonderful book I've ever read. I read more than one book every week, so what can I say!! A must read, which you will not want to put down. There's so much to this than just the story.. Beautifully written and wonderously haphazard presentation!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The purest novel describing the human condition.","review":"This is not a happy book as many other readers have said in their reviews. It is a novel of depression and introspection showing both the saddest and brighest sides of solitude. But the characters' solitude is not like me locking myself up in my room to read this book. It is deeper, describing something existential, a way of life that is disciplined in the joyous festivities and in the deep mourning. My lasting impression of this book is not that of beauty or wonder, but shock in the speaker's accurate description of the human condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"100 years of solitude","review":"Garcia Marquez is the best writer in Latin America. He show to the hole world our pains, our fantasies and our feelings and nobody can make the same like him. He is so sensibile like his own people but he have the great chance to tell things in beautifull and wonder words (I hope you can understand my english)"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a drag!","review":"I have to read this book for a Great Books meeting in two weeks, but I don't think I can finish it. It took me six weeks to get halfway through it because it is so incredibly boring that I have a hard time motivating myself to pick it back up after putting it down.The characters range from unengaging to infuriating, their multitude and the fact that most of them have very similar names is confusing (especially since the story jumps back and forth in time), and their actions are often revolting (what a bunch of spineless, brainless women, and let's not even think about the macho men!).I find the book thoroughly unentertaining and pointless. What is the author trying to say? Is there a message somewhere? What kind of story is this supposed to be? Since it contains surreal things like flying carpets and quasi-immortal people, I'm guessing it's some sort of fairytale. If it is, all I can say is that the Brothers Grimm wrote better fairytales than this guy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This books should be banned for 100 years in SOLITARY","review":"This book won the NOBEL Prize? I just can't help it, I need to write another review.This book should be placed in Solitary Confinement for 100 years. This is to save both time and trees used in printing of this book.Do not even dare buy this book even from a 2nd hand bookstore. Believe me, do not waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best book ever","review":"My High school english teacher swore that this was God's gift to literature. I tend to disagree. I understand what Garcia Marquez is trying to get at with his symbolism, but the reptitious names and slow plot make a good book lag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, bad, bad","review":"What a horrible book; hard to read; too many characters; I never did figure out what the whole thing was about. I can't believe this won a Nobel Prize. Definitely a waste of time reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I give it -9999 Stars instead?","review":"Yawn. 400 some pages of nothing but incest and death. Characters with the same name throughout the book. Non-linear time, too, it's very hard to follow. How could this \\"book\\" change your life? I have come to fear love, it's like your emotions are being dragged through the mud and everything you hold dear and ethical are just pushed away like its nothing. It was about incest, personally, maybe something was lost in the translation. It was so depressing and disturbing. I could not sleep without lights on after I finished reading it. I would never suggest this book to anybody who has a weak constitution or is easily emotionally disturbed. NOT good reading for a highschool student. Even Faulkner's The Bear was not about incest (it was bad too)."},{"rating":"1","title":"babbling","review":"Consider the following situation:A really old lady-bawd is trying to stall a policeman that has come to shut down her 'business', while her 'girls' escape through the back window.Her incoherent, unstructured, filth-prone, 400-page long gibberish-babbling whas then written down and served to you in the form of this book. End of story."},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried really hard....","review":"I expected that this book would be wonderful. Many friends urged me to read it and so I did - up to page 168. I think I just don't get it. I began to get sea sick from being at times engaged in the story to next wondering what the point of reading it was. War after war, sex after sex, baby after baby.... it got old and so I gave up. Hooray for all who get the beauty of the story and enjoy it. I wish I had been able. Next....."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH...one of the most confusing books I've read to date","review":"This book would have been easier to read and understand if all the characters had not been named the same or been given similar names. If I didn't have to endure chapter after chapter of people sleeping with each other who shouldn't be, incest, rape, pillaging, death, destruction, more incest, then maybe this book would have been as great as everyone makes it out to be. I understand the last chapter was supposed to explain everything in the book and it does to a point but it doesn't excuse the fact that this is NOT the next best thing to GENESIS! We reviewed this book in our book club and out of 20 women, only 2 liked the book. I think this book is way over popularized due to Oprah giving it a thumbs up in her book club. Maybe it reads better in Spanish..maybe more than one chapter in the book was mistranslated (yes, there are 2 chapters that are mistranslated). I'm not sure. ... Disappointing and a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book","review":"This book is confusing, it jumps around to much, to many generations in the book. I could not understand this book at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too melodramatic","review":"This novel is written in very interesting and compelling prose, but its characters are hardly worth the effort. The charaters are obsessive bores that can only be compared to day time soap opera characters. After reading through half of this novel, I was so numb from the constant tragedy and melodrama, that I simply did not care what happened to the characters anymore. To make matters worse, the plot is extremely complicated and very difficult to follow, with new characters added every chapter.The most amazing thing about this book is its popularity and that it helped its author win the nobel prize."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing read","review":"I was expecting a consistent story or at least an engaging narrative that takes fantastical twists. Instead, so many characters are introduced (many have the same name) making it very difficult to care about any of them. Also, the struggles between the rebels and whoever it is they are fighting (and why, come to think of it) are vague and uninteresting. I can't imagine what about this book is so transfixing to so many people. Count me out, I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time if you don't absolutely have to.","review":"I read this for a college course. If this is the best the world had to offer at the time (Pulitzer Prize winner), then I fear for this nation. It was confusing at the beginning (conflicting ideas presented - it speaks as if it were the beginning of the world, but the characters find ancient items). And the story line is jumbled.Personally, I found no enjoyment in the reading of it. The symbolizism that we were supposed to find was buried so deeply that I had to research it on the internet. I finally found a few things written on the symbolism, had to re-read most of the book to find it, and consummed quite a bit of headache medicine to get through it.It was far too long for what it had to say...which wasn't much. Never have I burned a book in my life. I took special joy in planning an overnight camping trip for the sole purpose of watching it burn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-written but very graphic","review":"100 years of solitude is an extremely well-written novel. The town of Macondo is personified through the Buendia family. It was the Buendias who founded the town and their lineage that is followed in the story. The town (like the Buendia family) is a desolate and solitary place that rapidly matures until it is destroyed. From the founding of the town, to the installment of the banana company, to the town's destruction, Macondo is destined to remain in solitude. Like the Buendias, the town never really reaches its full potential. Although the novel is extremely graphic and somewhat depressing at parts, from a literary point of view, 100 years of solitude is a fantastic novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine, if you're that way inclined","review":"Pretty easy to read, but a load of tosh, drivel,whatever you call it. I see the comparisons with Rushdie here. If you're into this sort of writing then fine. Read Rabelais instead, at least you get a bit of a chuckle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drawn Out","review":"100 Years of Solitude is a dense, confusing novel that is seemingly endless. Most of the characters have the same name - either Jose Arcadio or Aureliano for the boys and Amaranta or Remedios for the girls. The chapters are long and have large amounts of action. Most of the chapters are very similar: incest occurs, a child is born, named Jose Arcadio, he studies Melquiades, fights with some people, has a mistress, several children, and then dies. I do not recommend this book for anyone that wants a quick/easy/interesting read. It is well written and conveys many themes and such, but is purely painful to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Emperor's New Clothes","review":"Is the first thing that came to my mind when I saw the raving reviews here.

I will bet my bottom dollar that most people only read this because it was on Oprah's reading list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creative but boring and aimless","review":"Though this story was written in a unique voice, it is not the great classic that everyone claims it is. It often wandered and was full of characters who's personality and dialogue (not to mention names) were all so similar that you could hardly tell them apart.Let's be honest, it's only trendy to read this right now because it was featured on Oprah's Book Club. Don't believe the hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"I DON'T GET IT","review":"I don't understand why Gabriel Garcia Marquez will get such great reviews on 100 years of solitude, I thought it was one of the worst piece of Magical Realism that I have ever read.Don't waste your time or money on this terrible piece of literature, Sincerely, it is a pointless, mediocre and most definitely not Nobel Prize material."},{"rating":"1","title":"One hundred spastic pages","review":"I tried really to follow the story...the names are all the same,I kept constantly referring to the family tree to figure out who was who...it's more science fiction than believable...insominia disease of the entire village?!, Just too difficult for me to enjoy.

If you hurry through it you will miss the beauty of this mesmerizing book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get the tape","review":"I loved this book although I admit that I was confused a lot while reading it. I choose it for my book club and purchased an audio tape - I think I got it from amazon.com - that really helped me make sense of it. Everybody in my club hated it-several were forced to read it in college and didn't want to read it again. I was captivated by the magical realism and the idea of the perpetual cycle of life. I'm surprised Oprah selected it - it is really difficult. I also read Love in the Time of Cholera and thought it was much easier to read. Marquez is an author everyone who loves reading should attempt. If you can just stop insisting on instant gratification and keep on reading even it it doesn't make sense and even if you can't keep track of all the characters-just keep on reading and let the story get into your blood. It truly is magical."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was surprised!","review":"I was surprised that Oprah picked this book. Perhaps she chose it to challenge her readers, but it is definitely not the spiritually uplifting material that I would associate with Oprah. The book is memorable to me because of its difference in style and because it is depressing. After this one, Oprah's readers will be yearning for something much more \\"light\\" in both style and heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"look, have any of you actually written a paper on this book?","review":"well I have, and this book has got to be one of the stupidest things I have ever tried to write about. It is basically about nothing, and I had to write about that for a school paper! you would hate it too if you had to write about it for a flippin' school paper! Really, need I say more? I bet the people who loved it never had to write an essay about Amaranta's repeated refusal of love, and in about a week! Just ask everyone who's a junior at my school! It is a torture manual! Far too beastly a book to be dealt with, even for most english majors and teachers!I give it two stars because it has more substance than the stuff Allende and Amado put out."},{"rating":"1","title":"more stars than the firmament....","review":"I wish I could have given this book \\"no stars:\\" it's a book that deserves every star that man, god or science has created, and nothing we can put here on the internet (or in any review in any medium) would do it the eternal justice it deserves. A dream of a book: I would pick it up the day after having read forty pages, start the next chapter, and wonder where it was I had left off the night before. A book that gives off narcotic fumes, that gives off disembowling violence, love, and indifference. A book that deserves more awards than humankind can bestow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Super dissappointed","review":"I have not yet read this book but am looking forward to doing so as I have heard from friends that it is wonderful story.

But after 150 pages and three generations of Aureliano and Accadio, in which almost anything happens, in which you hear love stories and war stories and fantastic stories and so on,suddenly I didn't feel curious what's next.First time I abandoned this book because the magic realism wasn't my cup of tea at that time. This time I quit because the book wasn't catching me , didn't make me feel any emotions about the characters, didn't make me curious about their fate.Someone said about this book that you either love it or hate it, well, to be honest, it left me indifferent.In another 30 years I'll give it another try and I will let you know if my perspective changed..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely overrated","review":"I can't understand the buzz about this book.

It was fun in parts, but oddly repetitive, with a style that seemed half magic realism, half Freud. And, of course, the standard enervating anti-American diatribes were thrown in. I guess a Latin American author even in magic realism mode can't overcome his predilections.And speaking of predilections, Marquez, along with some other of intellectualdom's best and brightest, recently decided to weigh in on the Klinton-Lewinsky scandal (New York Times, Sep 26, 1998). I think this is entirely appropriate. When it comes to judging contemporary sexual mores, who better than Marquez to judge our beloved Bill?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"Marquez book's have always amazed me, the way he has to transport you through the pages of the book to a world full of imaginative, mystery, laughs, its a book to read more than one time.

Many things were even quite good (I was particularly pleased that they kept Alfredo's father's second aria, which is usually cut out!), but there were more that were simply unremarkable.If this was the only video of La Traviata available I would be well pleased with it. It is satisfactory and, on stage, it was probably excellent. The only thing about it that really bothered me was that Alfredo, his father, and Violetta all looked about the same age and that would not, I think, have been apparent from the audience.However, there are several versions that are considerably better. This version is well worth seeing if you are interested in multiple interpretations of this opera, but if you wish to see only one, let it be a different one. There are three that I think are equally good: the version with Placido Domingo and Theresa Stratas, the version with Anna Moffo (though it has no subtitles), and a fairly new version with Jose Cura."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Dream Version of La Traviata","review":"This the best La Traviata I've ever seen/heard on DVD. Gruberova sounds like a blend of the best of Sutherland and Caballe. She sings the most difficult coloratura as if it's childsplay. The timbre of her voice is gorgeous! This is vastly better than Zeffirelli's (sp?) latest version that features a listless Violetta and a cramped staging. My only critique is that Shicoff (Alfredo) looks rather goofy and unattractive. His voice if fine - just not the kind of man women dream about ...Gruberova makes Sills and Angela G. pale by comparison. Her gowns look like something Garbo would have worn. The sets and ambience (the world's most gorgeous opera house)add a special magic to this fantasy version of one of Verdi's masterpieces."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I bought this book as a naive, newly-diagnosed Type 2 Diabetic last December. My experience with it has been significantly negative. The basic dietary premise that a diabetic should consume 50-60 percent of their daily diet from carbohydrates, just doesn't pass a sanity test. The very idea that I'm supposed to control my blood glucose by eating mostly foods that seriously elevate blood glucose is not eating away diabetes; it is eating your way into higher blood glucose. I had to abandon this eating plan early on, and have found a better solution.Look carefully at the glowing reviews; many were written by other \\"professionals.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A book to live by","review":"Kristine Napier is obviously an authority on diabetes as well as a nutritionist-- and we could probably cure a national epidemic (Type 2 diabetes) if we would all follow the advice in this book.

Lifestyle changes, including diet and exercise, are necessary to prevent complications (heart disease, stroke, vascular disease, blindness) in those with Type 2 diabetes and prevent the disease from occurring in those at high risk. Medical advice regarding diet often leaves patients confused and therefore unable to follow their advice. Kristine Napier defines Type II diabetes and the steps needed to control this disease in a way that is easy to understand. She provides advice and examples to help the reader incorporate her guidelines into their everyday life. Her 28 day guide of menus will help those get started and as always, Kris's recipes are easy to follow and delicious. Last, but not least of importance, is that all of Kris's advice is based on scientific evidence and conforms to national guidelines."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eat Away Diabetes: Beat Type 2 Diabetes by Winning the Sugar","review":"I have been to SO many doctors and diabetes educators, but nowhere have I found such helpful hints and great recipes all in 1 place.

The Myth! The Hair!","review":"This disc captures the first 1950s recordings of wild blues harmonica man Kid Thomas. These Chicago recordings predate the timing of his most well-known song \\"Rockin' This Joint Tonight\\" (if you can call it that, because I acknowledge Thomas is pretty obscure to begin with), but are great nonetheless, due to Kid's intense approach to 1950s-era Chicago electric blues. The overall feel is rough and tumble, and if you have any appreciation for Chess Records, this probably takes it a step further, as far as rocking goes.Be forewarned though - There are different takes of the same song, and several false starts on others, but the disc was such a rush upon first listen for me because of Kid's approach to the blues that I immediately played it again - it's been a while since a blues cd has done that to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Planning for elder care from a family point of view","review":"Nothing could be more overwhelming than making arrangements for your elderly parents in a time of crisis.

What makes this booklet unique is its focus on the emotional issues that your family will be facing when trying to make end of life decisions for your parents. Long-term Caring for Your Parents includes information on talking about money, negotiating the health care and government bureacracy, and dealing with family dynamics. The booklet contains practical tips, resources for more information, and a place to write notes and do research. I would recommend this booklet for parents and adult children, work/family resource professionals, and companies who provide resources for their employees on balancing work and family."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Of The City Watch Books","review":"In my opinion Men at Arms is the best of the Watch novels.

This is an abridgment of the original book, and a bad one.

As well, in my opinion, Tony Robinson is a horribly bad voice actor, but that may simply be a personal preference.

I am often reminded of Douglas Adams' Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy series when I read a Discworld novel. Excellent prose, and the dry, witty, British humor you can't get enough of.Men at Arms is the second Discworld novel featuring the Night Watch (the first was Guards! Guards!)The Watch features the crew from the previous book (Vimes, Carrot, Colon and Nobby) and some new recruits. Someone is murdered in a most mysterious way, and it's up to the Watch to get to the bottom of it.What I love about Pratchett is he doesn't settle to just write a witty satire. It's actually a great mystery/fantasy story with great characters who have excellent believable relationships.Men at Arms even has some scenes that I found emotionally stirring. I loved Guards! Guards! but I personally enjoyed Men at Arms more. This is an excellent and brilliantly imagined story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terry Pratchett is a great author!","review":"This is another book in the Discworld series, and the second book in the Sam Vimes/Watch story-line.

I had heard that Pratchett was \\"satirical\\", \\"devious\\", \\"irreverent\\", \\"magical\\", \\"entertaining\\" and \\"above all funny\\".Sadly \\"Men at Arms\\" is none of the above. Pratchett is trying to be Douglas Adams and fails at it miserably. This story in particular was trite, condisending, and supremly unfunny. His use of footnotes to make a joke that had no bearing upon the story was...lame, for lack of a better term.The jokes, reeked of \\"ho ho ho see how clever I am!\\" rather than actually being funny. The characters struck me as pale shadows of characters who only grow and change in set and sadly predictiable ways so that they can advance the plot and story rather than being changed by the plot and story.I can't even say the story was silly lame. It wasn't. It was just lame."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Abridged?","review":"Men at Arms, the second A-M Night Watch book, is most likely the best Watch book of all.

Come to find out these are 2.5mm headphones. It does come with some sort of adapter, but I think that's for even larger headphones, so it didn't work with what I had. All in all, it's a nice little player for $25. I suppose it's probably better that the volume doesn't get so loud (better for your hearing), but I still like my music kinda loud.

Not for someone who needs to select which song to hear - it has two functions: random or order you loaded the songs from your computer.

I read all the reviews and thought it sounded like a good first mp3 player that he could use to work out. At first, I couldn't download his music onto it at all, which turned out to be a simple thing: there is a button on the side that locks the player, which is not mentioned in the enclosed guide. The headphones started to cut out within a day, and if you wiggle the wires it goes in and out. The control buttons are loose and move in different directions, sometimes getting caught under each other. After 2 uses, it quit, and only works randomly.

A well-balanced halfway-house between intelligent techno and ambient, 'Accelerator' is frequently gorgeous, and extremely nostalgic.

No Swede would ever say \\"Var s god och ge mig resväskan\\", which translates to something like \\"You had better give me that suitcase\\".

Chaucer, born in the early 1340s (the exact date is unknown), lived a most notable life and had a profound impact on English literature. Much of his works are influenced by love and his distain for the Church in the form of satirical humor.

I disagree with such a sweeping statement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle edition formatting is horrible!","review":"The paperback version has the original text of the tales on the left hand page and the modern translation on the right. The publisher does not provide any cues in formatting of the Kindle edition to show difference between the original text and the modern. The two texts run together making reading almost impossible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy the Kindle edition","review":"This is not easy to read in Kindle format. In paperback, it has two translations: one in Middle English, the other in Modern English. These are displayed side by side, with the earlier English on the left, Modern on the right. When it comes to the Kindle edition, there are no breaks between these translations. It switches back and forth without any notice, making it really difficult to follow. It would be alright if we could view it page by page (in it's original format), but without that option it's harder to understand. (Yes, it's obvious which part is which, but finding where it stops and starts takes away from the reading experience. It's too choppy.)In short, buy the paperback or perhaps a different Kindle edition. The format makes this a challenge to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Narrative poetry at its best very comical","review":"Although the original version is somewhat difficult reading given that it was a poetic narrative in middle english this version is accessible to the average reader.The book is a collection of tales told by a group of travellers on their way to Canterbury. Each tale has some moral underpinning and develops themes of courtly love, morality and corruption of the religious establishments.The book is rife with symbolism especially in the description of garments facial features and scenery.Some of the tales are so tawdry that Danielle Steele would blush.Regardless, the book was very amusing and explored problems many of us face daily."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good translation.","review":"The Canterbury Tales is my very favorite book. I personally enjoy the original Middle English version and would highly suggest it to all who are interested in it. (I purchased a 1929 copy of Everyman's Library Series The Canterbury Tales from my favorite used bookstore.) Though I have read my Everyman's Library version so many times I can repeat many sections word for word, I also own Nevill Coghill's translation and it is delightful. It is one of the best translations of the book which I have read. I, of course, would suggest reading it in Middle English, but if you are frusturated or confused by the language then I would recommend this translation. It sticks closely to the feeling that you get from Chaucer's original text. I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 because the Middle English version will always hold the number one spot in my heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Review","review":"The Canterbury Tales was a notably written book,with much discription and nice tidbits of information interweaved into a perfect story. It was very interesting to read this book and I reccommend it for any others who like to read short little tales as are in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Children's Version! Not for the literary afficianado...","review":"I was trying to find an illustrated version of the original Chaucer as a wedding gift for a friend of mine, and found this one. I didn't realize (my fault--it's in the Publisher's Weekly review) that this was a child's version of the classic. The illustrations are nice, and, quite frankly, I haven't read the author's interpretation, but I wanted to make it clear to folks that it's not the original text, nor even an unabridged translation."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Canterbury Tales: Illustrated Prologue","review":"This is a great edition of the prologue, the illustrations really accent the story very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommend this seller","review":"I recieved this book on time and in excellent condition. I'd definitely recommend this seller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chaucer appeals to everyone","review":"The Canterbury Tales is so appealing due to it's diverseness. Chaucer was involved with every level of society during his time. This is shown with how the characters are so well-rounded. The short, but insightful description of the travelers is also helpful in picturing this group riding on thier way to the shrine of Becket. A great book everyone should read, but one of those you have to be in the mood for. Also don't expect a continuing theme or story, but short stories that sometimes leaves you hanging."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Canterbury Tales by a modern hack poet","review":"This set of CDs is a fraud! Nowhere does it say in the ads that it is not Chaucer that is being read but a \\"translation\\" by some hack poet. So, if you are only interested in the stories but have no sensitivity to the sound and rhythm of the second best poet in the English language, then this is the stuff for you. But it is definitely not Chaucer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is Chaucer so great?","review":"Umm... Did not enjoy this book. Characters were almost all lewd and bad people, crooks and the like. One dimensional characters, all. The stories they told were sometimes interesting, at least."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait long enough and anything becomes a \\"classic\\"","review":"Here is the lesson to be learned: write a few dirty stories, wait a few hundred years and everyone will say you are a genius and that what you wrote is classic. Really, there is nothing in Chaucer that I don't hear in any locker room of any local gym. Why is this stuff taught in classrooms? Because tenured professors think if it is written in middle english it must be some revelation into life. The same could be said of any anecdote told by any average joe, if only they would take it just as seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Simpsons fans.","review":"If you like the television series \\"The Simpsons,\\" you will probably like Chaucer's Canterbury Tales. They reflect the same vulgar approach to entertainment which, instead of making us rise above the gutter of everyday life, brings us to the lowest level of crudity. There are some redeeming tales however, such as the Knight's Tale, but as a whole, this book should be avoided by anyone with a sense of honour and decency."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read by Martin Jarvis and a full cast","review":"At the Tabard Inn, thirty travelers from a diversity of classes and occupations are planning to make the annual pilgrimage to Becket's shrine at Canterbury. It is agreed that each traveler will tell four tales to help pass the time, and the host of the inn will reward the best storyteller with a free supper when they return. The Canterbury Tales is a sometimes bawdy, sometimes spiritual classic, skillfully translated into modern English and presented in an unabridged audiobook format. Read by Martin Jarvis and a full cast, The Canterbury Tales reveals the trials and travails of daily life in late fourteenth-century England through stories, conversations, jokes and arguments between travelers. Truly the most memorable way to experience this literary classic, The Canterbury Tales is especially recommended for public library collections. 17 CDs, 21 hours, tracks every 3 minutes for easy bookmarking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"In order to understand English litterature and the English language, many have read, or at least tried to read, Chaucers \\"Canterbury Tales\\". I too did begin (and sort of finished) the work in Middle English, which is not as hard as one might be lead to think, but is quite labourious and painstakingly slow at times. With this version, a great compromise has been found, translating it as true to the original as possible yet in modern English. I know that every time you make a rewrite or translation, things are lost, but sometimes it is necessary, or just quite convenient. This is one of those times.It is great fun reading the Canterbury Tales. The structure of the work makes it very accesible and easy to pick up after some time away. You could treat it as a whole entity or as a collection of short stories centered around a group of persons on a pilgrimage. One of the books that any decent home library shouldn't be without."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a very through pocket book that can guide you in Laos","review":"This is an excellent book for those who wish to travel to Laos, or even those who wish to begin learning lao in small steps. I purchased this book in order to learn the language at a quicker and more simplified pace. It contains not only basic phrases that one might need to know in order to conduct ones self in the main parts of Laos but also be able to learn some of the country's culture as well. Even though studying an entirely new language can be laborious, Mr. Cummings has made it easy for anyone to be bilingual, even multi-lingual."},{"rating":"1","title":"transliteration makes lao even more complex than it is","review":"The Lonely Planet phrasebooks are usually a great help travelling around the world. This one however turned out to be creating more problems than solving them. The transliteration is so weird that you actually have to learn two new languages before pronouncing anything closely right. I tried the book with several english speaking lao persons and lao speaking native english speakers while travelling around the country and all had problems with the transliteration. Nothing is like you would naturally pronounce it. For example who would say Khoj if you see Khawy?Helpful is the lao bit so you can point, in the end its how I got around. A pity, there are much better transliterations around."},{"rating":"1","title":"insufficient to teach this tonal language","review":"this is just a jumble of sentences without audio that is needed for htis tonal language. It's a shame that there is no decent method or grammar for Lao. Several other books have similar problems.Teach yourself methods have recently become very flimsy because few of the buyers actually get through them, so an author can sell a lot of substandard books. But for those who want to learn this is rather cruel punishment. It would be useful if the authors tried to learn a language from a book like what they have produced."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Lao-to-English!","review":"This phrasebook looks reasonable in most respects, but it has no Lao to English dictionary. That means, if you are trying to communicate with someone who does not speak english, they cannot respond to you with words, even if they are motivated and patient enough to try to carry on a conversation.The description of this book said it had a \\"comprehensive dictionary\\". Unfortunately, it only has half of a comprehensive dictionary. If you want a book that will make it possible to actually converse with a Lao speaker, this is not it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn De Florette","review":"This film is a BORE. A beautifully produced, sumptuously photographed, beautifully designed, absolutely suffocating BORE.This is the kind of film that gives art films a bad name. It is the kind of literary adaptation that people just love to watch because it takes place in pretty locations, and is based on a book that no one has ever read but is acclaimed as a classic in the advertisements, and is very very very very very very long, and takes itself very very very very very very very seriously, and is just generally so very busy being so very ARTISTIC that is forgets little things like plot and characterization. I did not care about anyone or anything in this pompous load of nonsense.I was not really expected to, of course. The filmmakers are more interested in attracting tourists to France than in creating a living work of cinema.Avoid this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and touching","review":"I must say that this was one of the most touching, tragic and beautiful film/book I've ever seen/read. I love this story so much because it is so absolutely realistic and that it is human nature to do what a lot of the characters in the film did. There were so many human flaws, which I love it so much. It wasn't one of those movies where one character was absolutely perfect while the other one was downright horrible, but the flaws were evenly placed like real humans. We all have flaws, only different. We're all different.Once again, I love the film, although I loved the book so much more. It was so much more touching than the film had been, although the movie was great! The letters in the book were a lot more touching in the movie, maybe because I can actually see the spelling mistakes Ugolin and Papet makes. I wonder if they have spelling mistakes in the letters on the English version of the book? (I read the French version)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Feast for the Eyes and Ears","review":"Jean de Florette is a beautifully made motion picture. This poignant tale is set in Provence in southern France. The beautiful scenery is truly breathtaking. Heard throughout, the haunting score will stay in your mind for days after viewing the film. Yves Montand is superb as the aging, greedy Cesar Soubeyran. Gerard Depardieu is never better than in the title role as the hopeful and yet tragic hunchback hero. The English sub-titles in no way detract from this cinematographical delight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story !","review":"The performance of all actors, especially Gerard Depardieu is top-notch. The story has a sad ending, but thought provoking. The excitement, energy and the fierce determination of Jean de Florette is inspiring. This city dweller is so determined to succeed as a farmer that he will give up under no circumstance. Beware that the French spoken in this movie is not the Parisian French, the Provence accent makes it very hard to understand, in case you are a student of French. (There are French subtitles too, besides English, so that helps a lot)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful Movie...Bad Transfer","review":"Since purchasing a DVD player a year and a half ago, I have often come across reviews that bemoan the \\"transfer quality\\" of a particular title. Now...I know what they are talking about.While this is one of my all-time favorite movies, I was extremely disappointed in the picture and sound quality. Film grain is evident throughout and at times the highlight values of the picture seem overexposed.I give the movie 5 stars. I give the \\"transfer\\" 1 star. Since this is not likely to be re-released as a \\"Special Edition\\" I would reluctantly recommend buying this title, only because it will have a longer shelf life than the VHS edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely worth watching, although the lesser of two parts.","review":"Although new to French Cimema, this film has introduced me to some wonderful acting and cinematography. The set is impressive and the music is memorable.Having watched Jean de Florette first, I believe it warrants five stars of it's own accord. Manon des Sources is far superior, but there aren't many films that hold a candle to Manon, foreign language or otherwise.I certainly agree that this has to be seen to appreciate Manon. With these two films being one of the rarities in film making, where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"As I sat and watched this movie I first thought of having first seen Manon of the Spring but it didn't take long for me to get entirely wrapped up in the storyline of the haunchback and all of his misfortunes wrought at the hands of his wicked, jealous neighbors.When you watch this movie you'll spot people in your own life who play the part of the covetous next door neighbors. You may even see stories in your own life play out concurrently while you watch this story.The French certainly do know how to tell a story. I like how they take their time to let the details of the story unfold and don't rush too much or skip entirely over interesting details. This movie is a must have for any foreign film buffs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Space Program, Rather Mecury, Gemini and Apollo","review":"I was greatly disappointed in this book. It is not about the space program, but rather about the MANNED space program: primarily Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo. There is still a need for a short overall appreciation of the space program. Planetary exploration and space astronomy are missing, as are the applications: communications, weather, and remote sensing. T.A. Heppenheimer's recent book may be the best general work on space."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too expensive to not offer carry handle/strap","review":"Jacket is good to just protect your portfolio, but a handle and/or strap would be helpful to carry your portfolio."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it","review":"Thank you for making my baby happy, he is very into this type of music. just waiting for the next cd"},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY COMPELLING DOZIER ON ATTITUDE ,AND CHANGE","review":"MILTON ROSENBERG,THE AUTHOR OF WHOM I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH, DOES A OUTSTANDING JOB OF EXPRESSING FACTORS,IN THE CONSISTENCY,OR LACK THREREOF CONCERNING HIS PHILOSOPHY OF CHANGE,AND THE VARIOUS ATTITUDE'S,LEADING UP TO THAT,FACTOR OF CHANGE.......THIS BOOK STRICKLY FOR THE VERY INTELLECTUAL,OF WHICH I'M NOT IN THAT CLASSIFICATION,STILL MADE INTERESTING READING,FOR A LAYMAN...."},{"rating":"2","title":"The closest thing to time travel","review":"This is the first book since \\"A Night to Remember\\" that actually carries you back through time to the decks of the sinking Titanic until you actually feel it yourself. You feel the emotions of the people that night - and then you are yanked forward in time to the expeditions that first discovered and explored the Titanic, and then Pellegrino moves you back and forth in time again and again from the night of the sinking to the expeditions until at last you become, like James Cameron's Rose, unstuck in time. It is easy to see how Cameron was so moved by Pellegrino's morphings through time. A reading of this scientist's other books reveals that he seems to be unable to tell a tale in linear fashion. In both \\"Unearthing Atlantis\\" and \\"Ghosts of the Titanic,\\" he unfolds archaeological investigations by telling the whole history backwards! It is difficult to imagine what he will do with time next. But I'll be there for the ride. You can bet on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looking for a great book on Titanic? Don't look here!","review":"I study Titanic and try to get every book possible on Titanic,( I've been studying Titanc, way before the movie was made). But when I bought this book and read it, I regreted it. It's a good book, for... how shall I say it, Beginner readers for Titanic. I give this book, in my opinion, 1 STAR because of it's lack of thought. The book seemed like it was made for new Titanic fans. Since I've been interested in Titanic for a long while, this book wasn't at all great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interested in the great ship? Don't look here.","review":"I've read many of the works published on the sinking of the White Star liner, Titanic, and I have to say this is, without doubt, one of the poorest yet. Pellegrino obviously is trying for emotional meditative discourse, but failing that, ends up making up out of whole cloth entire conversations and scenarios. Titanic was *not* the first ship to use the SOS call. The inclusion of the Frank Towers myth is a dead giveaway that Pellegrino picks and chooses his myths, without bothering with such inanities as fact-checking. If it's entertainment and an emotional response you're after, go see Cameron's movie. If it's history you want, better to stick with other, far better, far more accurate works."},{"rating":"1","title":"1986 NOT 1912","review":"If you're interested in the Titanic, this really is NOT the book for you! Pellegrino seems more interested in his own history, along with Bob Ballard's, than he does with the Titanic's. There are a few interesting passages jammed into a lot of rambling about machinery, sea exploration, ant SPACE EXPLORATION? If you want to read about the equitment used to find the Titanic and its many uses and missions beforehand, you MIGHT enjoy this book. If you want to read about the tragic story of the Titanic and what happened on that fateful night I would recommend \\"The Night Lives On\\" by Walter Lord."},{"rating":"1","title":"False facts and over-emotionalism detract from the story.","review":"Charles Pellegrino, while providing interesting insight into the finding of the sunken liner Titanic, obviously neglected to do his research on that which haunts him so. As a member of the Titanic Historical Society and a general Titanic enthusiast, I know much about the dreaded night of April 14th 1912 - in both fact and myth. Pellegrino draws from neither for his book, instead creating unfounded dialogues that, unfortunately, shed a bad light on some of the heros of that night. His extreme emotionalism - he takes it almost to the point of being farcical - distracts the reader from the events of both the 1912 sinking and the 1985 finding of the Titanic. This book had the potential to create a fascinating discourse between the two main events in the life of the liner, both academically and emotionally, but unfortunately it doesn't. Luckily we now have James Cameron's film \\"Titanic\\" to build what Pellegrino couldn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"The only reason I give it 2 stars is.......","review":"The fact that this book is about Titanic (well sort of anyway). This book is not a true work of history. The research is faulty, the words and thoughts of the various characters is bogus fiction. After being a student of Titanic history for almost 40 years, this is a book that I have dismissed lightly, very lightly. If you want to know Titanic and the disaster that befell her, this is not the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful book","review":"This book was horrible.

Many of the \\"facts\\" presented in this work go against those given by tons of other authors and explorers of Titanic. The author seems very full of himself, trying to give himself credit where he doesn't deserve it.

She writes elegantly and truthfully. The setting for Vein of Iron is an area of rural Virginia where I spent much of my childhood. I don't think it has changed much! In this novel, there are wonderful passages about the impact of Christian beliefs on the life of the people who settled in the region (which can surely be generalized to many rural settlements throughout the U.S.). Glasgow creates a fascinating character in Ada's father, who struggles with his spirituality. Ada is strong, faithful, optimistic- just as I imagined our female predecessors to be at that time. This is a character-driven, setting-driven novel, and I loved it. My daughter surprised me with it for mother's day.

It should be noted in her bio here that she won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 1942 for In This Our Life.

I saw that some say her books are \\"overwritten,\\" but you must take them in the context of when they were written.

It is basically a story of a naive girl from New Jersey who comes to New York to persue her dream as a singer/songwriter.When she realizes that she isn't going to be an instant success, she takes a job in club with the title name. Her dancing skills improve and her fear of perfoming in front of crowds starts to diminish. She incidentally meets a nice young man whom she starts seeing, and though there are troubles, her move to the top is going strong by the end of the movie.The plot is very predictable, but the acting is well above average. It was nice to see of movie of this genre with relatively little foul language. I don't believe the \\"F\\" word was used at all. All in all, a nice and enjoyable movie that is suitable for most members of the family. I recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie was trite.","review":"The storyline was cliched and the one-liners weren't even funny. The Australian accent from the cute boyfriend was annoying. Piper Perabo can NOT act (even though she's hella cute) and all the coyotes were too pretty. It was distracting. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can&#65533;t fight the moonlight&#65533;","review":"Okay, I'm a sucker for John Goodman, and he's by far the sexiest in the cast. I'll admit that I enjoyed the movie mainly because (a) I did not actually pay for the rental, and (b) I was consuming large amounts of alcohol at the time. To the film's credit, even in my drunken stupor I could tell that the scenes in which Piper pretends to sing were incredibly corny. I think I remember falling off the sofa and landing on my head from the extreme cheese-ness. You know? The kind that makes your skin crawl?In true Bruckheimer form, Leanne Rimes organizes a high-speed train robbery which results in a spectacular car wreck involving two commercial airliners and the Seattle Space Needle... but I don't want to spoil it for anybody. See it for yourself (read: do not see this for yourself). Two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"pure formula junk","review":"This is the kind of film I get stuck watching on long plane rides and would NEVER seek myself. It is such silly schlock that I marvel at how the Hollywood mill can churn these things out and make money - it's really an industrial production process, geared to superficial viewers.This is one of the basic plots. THe others include crippled boy, whose love of a dog or pony allows him to walk, love, or talk. Why do we keep watching this junk? A video game at least offers some chance of a variation in outcome.OK, here goes: beautiful girl with a dream, seeking big break, gets gig in a bar, handles it, meets boy who doesn't fit into plans, shakes it, shakes it more, shakes it a lot more, flirts with corruption, stays course, makes real friends, gets to know real self, grows. Oh, and then succeeds on her own terms.Not recommended. Admittedly, the acting in not abysmal, but what a waste of time about lives that could never exist."},{"rating":"1","title":"EXTRA SHARP CHEESE!","review":"I'm all for a light entertaining movie but this thing was painful to watch. Mix Piper Perabo as the lead role, a bubble headed blond who couldn't act to save her life, add an old hashed to death storyline embedded with every cliche in the book and you have Coyote Ugly. This thing was horrible, just horrible. After the first five minutes I got sick of watching Perabo's only acting skill making those sad puppy dog faces. But guess what it goes on the rest of the movie, must be a record for that annoying facial expression. It's a good thing this is a rental so I can send it back tomorrow, if I was suckered into buying this disc I would have to drench it with gasoline and set it on fire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coyote Ugly Is da bomb!","review":"Coyote Ugly is the best film i have ever seen.

My favorite scenes, dance on the bar, all you can see is their middle, not faces and feet at the same time. It's not the same would rather have a TV cut format."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my money back","review":"This movie is Flashdance with no flash, a Saturday Night fever on a Wednesday afternoon happy hour. The main character is cute, but annoying. The bar atmosphere with all the dancing is stupid, and the plot is written for some afternoon school special.

A good story","review":"This film deals with two different plots: An aspiring singer and a bar named Coyote Ugly. The story is a very good one about a young and inexperienced women (Violet) trying to make it as a singer in the Big Apple, but the problem is she has Stage Fright- that's where the bar comes in and the movie really takes off.Violet ends up getting a job in the bar as one of the women who serve drinks while dancing on the bar. The scenes in the bar coupled with the great music really gives the film energy and keeps the pace from getting too slow. They do not take away from the story, but hold it together. Working here helps Violet acquire the confidence she needs to make. There is also a love story between Violet and a guy she meets which completes the whole movie and makes it well worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"Don't know why but can't stop watching this movie.

This was bad. The only redeeming quality was the babes in the tight leather pants. Take those scenes and those girls out of this clunker and you quite possibly have the worst movie ever made. But Tyra did look good.....Would I recommend it? - sure, if nothing else for the visuals, which is really the only reason this film was made. It's sort of like Maxim magazine on film. Just watch it with the sound off, maybe while listening to a good CD. Believe me, you won't miss anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just another pretty face","review":"This movie deserves every harsh review it gets. However, if you want plotless mush and adore watching the heaving, bouncing chests of model-esque women, then you will probably love this movie. If you have a brain and like to use it, this movie is probably not for you. What little plot it has is overdone and you can predict what each move will be.Nothing but fluff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greg's Review","review":"I bought this to replace my DVD copy that was stolen. I liked that fact that it was on Blu-Ray so I could play it on my PS3 and get the most out of the movie. Overall there were not a lot of additional scenes to the Blu-Ray than the DVD editon. Some scenes are longer on this edition than on the DVD. There is a nude scene which has to be a body-double of Piper. I don't want to spoil this edition of Coyote Ugly for anybody because in my opinion the extended scenes are worth it. Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A unique torture-technique","review":"I saw COYOTE UGLY on an airplane from Germany to the United States three times, in English, in French, and in German. By the third screening, I wanted the plane to crash.Without a shred of revealed flesh, the film teases, tantalizes, and seduces without ever gratifying. There is nary a thong in this picture!This is eroticism without the eroticism.It's a bit like a soft-core film made for Nickelodeon."},{"rating":"1","title":"If only I could convince my wife","review":"I was forced to watch this movie with my wife, who insisted we rent it. Normally, we agree on the movies we watch and the ones she forces down my throat are never as bad as I thought they were going to be. This movie changed all of these notions.It starts off like another \\"Flashdance,\\" which was a decent movie. But then it becomes a long music video, with dialogue thrown in to keep you from falling asleep.Well, it didn't work for me. Even the brilliant John Goodman could not save this movie. Nothing but T & A for the teeny bopper crowd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unnecessary...","review":"Hoping this \\"unrated\\" version will show something the original version didn't?Don't get your hopes up.As with a host of other recent \\"unrated\\" editions of theatrical turkeys (The Girl Next Door, Club Dredd, Eurotrip, The Chronicles of Riddick, etc.), there's nothing in this version to give it a \\"harder\\" rating -- it's unrated simply because the studio didn't submit THIS cut to the MPAA.Unless you really, REALLY want to see all the deleted scenes from your old DVD copy of \\"Coyote Ugly\\" re-cut back into the film, don't waste your time or money on this trick."},{"rating":"1","title":"These chicks think they're so cool and tough","review":"Yeah, let one of 'em spend a day with Ted Bundy... let's see how damn tough they act after such an experience.

The characters are empty, the plot is thin, and the cliches are in abundance. Buy/rent this movie only if you want to laugh at the money you just wasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"men are pigs","review":"This is one of those movies that really disgusts me in the way it depicts women stutting their stuff and men drooling over them... I absolutely hate these type of flicks. Hey, with a little imagination you can pretend that you are at a strip bar and that they are taking 'em off just for you. I found myself looking for women in the bar. NONE. this is just Pig S#*T. You are a jerk if you think this is cool. Needless to say I did not care for it, and I very much appreciate hot women, don't get me wrong. This just sucked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sexist film","review":"Okay this is just another film for guys to watch hot girls strut around. There is supposedly some kind of moral to this story. The only moral I can see is ...when you don't have a big enough brain, use your bod to get ahead. Screw college, screw learning there is more to you then your looks... looks don't fade, they last forever! (right) My boyfriend doesn't understand why I don't want to watch this movie every time it comes on tv. Because it perpetuates a thing women have been trying to get away from for thousands of years; being judged as people who will use their looks instead of their brains to get what they want, being judged as nothing but a body and no more. Any THINKING woman will not like this film and will not want any young girls she knows to watch it, either. It is not a good example for the young women of today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth buying...a renter at best","review":"A plot and story that has been done before, better.

The only person that would be interested in this movie is a thirteen-year old boy. Tyra Banks should stick to her day job.

It is a great movie that I would be glad to compliment on."},{"rating":"1","title":"How pitiful","review":"I consider myself to enjoy a wide variety of movies. When some friends of mine suggested we rent this movie at an outing to Blockbuster Video, I wasn't very excited about it. But \\"what the heck, I'll watch anything once.\\" First of all, the main character was a bit annying. All the little things she did to help out the bar in an attempt to get back to work with Cyote Ugly made me want to upchuck all over the television. This movie is VERY predictable and a cliche of many others. I'm sure many of the younger generation cherish this film and that's about the only audience I think this is going to achieve except cleavage hungry boys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Movie!","review":"When you saw the previews for this movie, you probably did think it was a bunch of pretty woman dancing on a bar. It's NOT. It's a sweet story about a girl trying to seek her dream of being a songwriter. She needs to move to a new place to try to have her songs be heard, and ends up working as a coyote. Also with this tale is lots of fun and enjoyment. At the end, you can't forget when LeAnn Rimes comes in as a country music sensation (herself) and performs Violet's song she recorded. I highly suggest anyone should by this, and don't forget to pick up the soundtrack too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this movie","review":"This product is really great for my trip. It also came in early and I am enjoying the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best movies I Have Ever Seen","review":"I have watched this movie with my daughter about a million times over the last 5 years, and I can honestly say that it never gets old! The acting is top-notch, and I do believe that this is defintely John Goodman's finest performance. The movie will leave you feeling warm at heart over and over again. The soundtrack for the movie is also of high quality and most of it is integrated into the movie at the right time. A few people have been giving negative reviews on here about this film, and I can just say that I don't agree. On the contrary, what more could you want from a film that doesnt try to be too much, and is mainly just a down to earth story about a small-town girl trying to make something of her life in a big city. There is nothing in the movie that has a WOW factor to it, but that doesnt retract anything from the story to me. If you haven't seen it, you could do a lot LOT worse than to buy this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Wonder How FUNKY This Is Gonna Get?!!!!!!!","review":"I Have Seen The Original Coyote Ugly And Rate It Four And a Half Stars!Wonder How FUNKY This Is Gonna Be?It Is Probably Gonna Have Boobs,Butts,Nakedness,And LOTs More!So Definately Not Reccomended For Ages 1-9!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More true than most people realize","review":"As an aspiring singer, I found this film to be closely related to the struggles that musicians go through. Unlike Violet, I don't have stage fright, as a matter of fact, I love being on stage. However, taking 'odd' jobs is something that I'm very relatible to. Even tho I've never taken a job at a bar quite like Coyote Ugly, it shows that when you are trying to achieve a dream, you do whatever possible. So far when it comes to dancing on a bar, I've only ever done it for fun, but it just goes to prove that we don't have an easy time of it trying to make it in the music business, and this type of scenerio is incredibly possible because when you're desperate, you do whatever it takes, even if it means sacrificing a little bit of dignity...even tho you can still have a hell of a lot of fun doing it. Over all this film is easily a 4 because it's not just about girls shaking it on a bar, it's about getting what you want."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much gyrating and not enought interest for me","review":"Now, this is my mind on this movie. Too much focusing on women dancing on bars and not on story and characters, hence this is a boring movie, but the women are good, but this movie is boring. Now see you wouldnt get me on a table and dance and take it off, nope, not my thing. John Goodman as Piper Perabo's father is a treat though. This is Tyra Bank's first big movie breakout and see does it nice. As far as i'm concerned the thought of Coyote Ugly 2 would be more of the same, except that Piper Perabo, not Maria Bello trains the new recruit and it would be more of the same but new moves, but more of the same. Also starring Adam Garcia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Iz love Tira but this is still abd","review":"really boring dull cjhick flick that is awful. i lov u tira but this isn;'t a ggod movie. i didnt wantt o watch thers people at all. but i do want to go into this club."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Inspiration!!","review":"This movie is one of the best movies i have ever seen.......and i do not care what you other people say about it!!

A dopey looking girl who happens to dance sexily like never before and got everything going in a big city New York? That'll never happen. This film explains the reason why I have nightmares from taking, eventually dropped out of, Women's Studies in college. I don't need to be manhandled like that by a film like Coyote Ugly, telling me that women like those depicted in the film are the bomb and everything. I rather watch true films, touching realistic issues that surround females such as Hoop Dreams, My Left Foot, and The Miracle Worker, not crappy movies like Coyote Ugly. What's up with the title? Really, what's up with the concept? No, really...what's up with the actual realization of this movie being made? Maybe I should open a bar, have women wooing the male patrons, and face the music of being deported to prison for numerous of pimping violations."},{"rating":"1","title":"sticky sweet, predictable...","review":"I am so glad I waited to see this movie on cable. 30 minutes into it, I almost changed the channels. But, just like an accident or police car chase, you have to watch. Overall, the movie was just too sappy. And every \\"twist\\" is not surprising. Also, I don't understand why the movie switched between color and black-and-white -- I'm guessing the decision was made in a very late editing session because it didn't seem to have any context. In conclusion, I thought the bar scenes were the best...I can't believe I'm agreeing with the guys. I encourage you to check your cable listings if you're curious about this movie and spend your money on something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Make it Stop!","review":"My roomate bought this dvd, thinking that it would be fun and mindless, along the lines of Bring It On or such. It was a terrible disapointment. We were prepared for chics dancing on bars and related craziness, but it was actually a slow-moving story about a country girl who moves to the Big Apple to become a songwriter but is afraid to sing in public. By the end you will be begging her to sing the (explicative deleted) song! In conclusion, make another selection at the video store!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A nightmare!","review":"I rented this poor excuse for a movie and couldn't help falling asleep the whole time.

Being a 26 year old male, the only thing about this movie that was enjoyable were the nice looking girls. The guy in this movie does one of the worst acting jobs Ive ever seen, and nothing ever really happens. If you have a good taste for movies, then you shouldnt like this movie. Again, if I were a 14 year old girl, I would probably like this movie because it was geared towards 12-17 year old girls. To give the movie some credit, it was kind of a \\"cute\\" story, but thats about it.

I went three times to see this moive. It was exectly every time I saw it. I even bought the soundtrack which was wonderful. The movie was Awsome. It shows how you should never give up on anything that you really want -boy or girl- becuase it can be acheived. I belive that everyone should see this movie!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"excruciating...","review":"I had to add my two cents because reading the good reviews about this movie blew my mind. They had to have all been written by 13 year old teeny boppers. I only sat through this movie because the people I went to the theater with needed a ride home. I was really looking forward to this movie too. The commercials made it look like it was going to be hot chicks doing wild and crazy stuff at the bar through the whole thing but I'd have to say that only about 15 minutes of this movie took place at the bar. Piper Perabo annoyed the crap out of me. She was always making these puppy dog faces like she is saying, \\"Look how cute and adorable I am.\\" The story was trite and cliche'... I actually felt insulted that the director thought I might be stupid enough to buy into this ridiculous crap. If you aren't a 13 year old girl don't go see this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coyote Alert!","review":"I thought this film was great, especially as there is a real bar in NY like the one in the film.

If you dislike this film, then why are you looking at buying it anyway???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good intentions... Horrible execution.","review":"Piper Perabo is a great new face in Hollywood and I look forward to seeing what she does next. That said, I believe the director and editor (more on that later) should be taken to a public place and caned with a bamboo pole.What starts as a cute girl-coming-of-age-in-the-big-city movie begins to fall apart the moment the girl who's too shy to sing in front of anyone starts working in a bar that requires her to dance on the bar while getting buckets of water dumped on her. \\"Oh I'm too shy to sing one of my songs in front of my new date, but I'll strip for him!\\" What???There is a spasmatic sequence with a phone call, a trip to a club, a family reunion and a performance that had to have been spliced together by an MTV editor that drank way too much Mountain Dew while eating pixie sticks. One character even repays a debt that was cut out so she couldn't have even known that she owed it!Hopefully Piper will have better luck with \\"Slap Her, She's French\\" this year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Girls with a thin plot","review":"The movie stars Piper Perabo who is a very likeable actress. The only problem is that she is stuck with boring dialog and a weak plot. If you are going to make a movie about a crazy bar and the lifestyle of a young bartender in New York City why would you make it PG-13. How wild and crazy can you get. Its kind of ironic that the cover of this movie reminds me of a Spice Girls poster. Stay away from this one if you have any interest in a plot and charachters."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of plastic and metal....","review":"This is without a doubt the most brainless movie ever made. Created for the \\"Frat Boy\\" demographic, Coyote Ugly is packed with scantilly clad hoochies dancing around on bar tops and acting very badly. The hoochies are impressive but that is the only halfway worthwhile aspect of this dreadful film. The plot is a stupid retread of the \\"small town girl goes to the big city\\" story ,the producers did'nt even try very hard to make a decent film around all the \\"T\\" & \\"A\\".Why would anyone want watch Coyote Ugly at a theatre or buy it on DVD when movies like this can be seen on late night cable seven days a week? At least the \\"acting\\" is better on those cable shows."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't go there","review":"'Coyote Ugly' often gets compared to 'Flashdance'and sort of falls in the same genre, but it lacks both the charme and the choreography that made 'Flashdance' a success. It is hard to blame the actors for the failure to maintain the audience's interest, they simply didn't have anything to work with. The plot is entirely predicable, and all the characters (how did they do that?) remain without any depth. As a result, the different plots running through this feature appear strangely unrelated, maybe because as a viewer one just doesn't get engaged. Easily one of the worst offerings in the last 12 months, maybe ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coyote Ugly ROCKS!","review":"Coyote Ugly is one of the best movies i've seen so far. When i walked out of the theatre after watching Coyote Ugly, i was like \\"WOW! That was a really good movie\\". The actors are fantastic, cinematography was good, on top of that, the SOUNDTRACK is really really cool. I immediately went to the stores to get the soundtrack to the movie. Some people think that this movies has a lot of \\"sexual\\" content, but i think it's nothing more than just a few pretty ladies in nice looking outfits having the time of their lives. This movies is a MUST-WATCH and certainly worth the money to get it. Trust me, it's really fantastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"i hated this movie","review":"I had the misfortune of paying my hard earned allowance on this movie. It was so pitiful I had to walk out before the half way point. How did I know it was the half way point? Easy I was checking my watch every 2 minutes. The plot was so thin and cliched...Oooh I wonder if she is gonna make it as a star? .... It was horrible, it was a waste of money and resources, if you want to save the environment, make sure movies like these don't get made. There are no redeeming qualities to this movie, if you want a good romantic story this is not the place to find it. There are so many other good movies for you to watch. I don't have a personal thing about it, but it upset me so much I had to tell the world. Please, please, please don't watch this movie and if you know someone who liked this trash then slap them upside their head, they deserve it and perhaps need some kind of shock therapy as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Picture-Great Audio","review":"I was not so impressed with the video quality. It was a bit grainly, but better than the DVD copy. Blu-ray gives you the newer lossless sound that will rock your world.

I can only assume he had a contract with the studio to produce a certain number of movies and this was one of his 'fillers'.An unlikely plot to say the least, the acting was substandard and John Goodman, usually a decent actor, looked embarassed to be associated with this, seemingly hanging about in scenes waiting for his check to clear before he could leave.I've no doubt this movie earns at least 4 stars from many people who use this site; the teenage girl and mid 20's male I'm sure think this is an 'awesome' movie. Utter dross; Hollywood really needs a fresh injection of writing talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont make me laugh, no really dont bother.","review":"I was forced to watch this film with my girlfirend. I admit to being a film snob, and ask alot of the film i watch. But when it comes to mindless Buckhiemer stuff i really dont mind them. Then i saw this. Badly acted, scripted and directed. This film represents the kind of mindless stagnation that hollywood seems intent on sticking with. Films like this are a disease on what sould be and is ( sometimes) one of the most creative and efective media forms of the modern day. Please for your own sanity dont bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Sexy Movie!","review":"All the reviews said bad acting but beautiful women. I think both were great. This movie is based on a girl that wants to be a singer but has terrible stage fright. She goes to work in a bar, \\"Coyote Ugly\\" and this is where the beautiful women come in. They get their money by dancing on the bar. She makes the cut, but then has to make up $300 to stay. She does it and also makes her first singing appearance here. There is also the love story that is tangled in. She gets caught up with a guy that says he's a producer, but he isn't. But they make up and end up together. Despite her fathers disagreements, she continues to stive for her goal to be a singer. She ends up with the guy and the ability to sing on stage in a happy ending. Overall, this is a very sexy movie with an interesting plot, including Leanne Rimes giving a private concert at the bar. The dancing and singing is great and I recommend this as a good date movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Entertainment, Folks","review":"I am so tired of reading reviews from people who think every movie should be an artistic masterpiece, or at the very least, should have a poignant message. This is one of the most entertaining films my wife and I have seen in a long time, and none of the people involved with its production have anything to apologize for. It unquestionably delivers exactly what Bruckheimer, et al intended, and it does not pretend to be anything else. If I wanted something artistic or meaningful, I would have looked for word \\"Miramax\\" on the outside of the box - a studio that has made many wonderful movies, but not the type of high impact, SIMPLE fun Jerry Bruckheimer and the late Don Simpson have delivered so well. Sometimes, it's just what the doctor ordered.Turn out the lights, turn up the volume, break out the popcorn, have a few drinks, and enjoy..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Howlingly Horrible","review":"This was one of the most embarassingly bad films I've seen in recent memory.I watched this because there is a 14 year old in the house who is understandably amused by girls in their early twenties dancing on top of a bar....and is willing to watch a non-plot for a half-hour between those scenes. Short of a pubescent male, I have to think that anyone who enjoyed this movie is either miguided (hopefully) or an idiot.If this is really what a person looks for in a film, let me recommend saving your money and watching nearly any television sit-com....they're just as bad and it won't cost you four bucks a pop. Take that extra four bucks and donate it to the library. That way, people who are dragging the human race intellectually down to such a depth can at least offset the damage they do by hopefully lifting someone else up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bruckheimer Should Stick With \\"Guy\\" Movies...","review":"I'm usually not disappointed with a Bruckheimer film, so this was definately a first. The plot was cheesy and slow: All-American, apple-pie, girl next door goes to \\"The Big City\\" to make it big in the music business...Meets good-looking orphan who helps her overcome stage fright in the most romantic of ways. The movie would have been better if it was, indeed, about the women of Coyote Ugly. The bar owner's story would have resulted in a better movie and a less misleading title. This movie will most likely be a hit with teeny bopper Backstreet Boys fans and junior high school age boys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coyote Aint So Ugly","review":"Thsi movie delivers with a little of everything, action, romance, and a little something extra for the guys. Violet, a little town girl, has roamed into the big city in search of her dream. To be a professional songwriter. The only way to make the money she needs to support herself she has to get from dancing on a bear at a local pub, or so it seems. You should see this movie if your looking for a love story, a little fun for the guys, or a laugh out loud riot, in all i give this flick 4 stars for greatness."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the most unbelievably vapid things I've ever seen","review":"I was trapped on a bus recently, and forced to watch this movie. An excuse to put hot, young Hollywood PG-13 girl flesh all over the screen. The fact that this movie has a high average rating is just another indicator that the pundits are right when they say the educational system is failing..."},{"rating":"1","title":"really weak Film","review":"nothing really happening with this Film.the Girls were Looking Good but as far as the Film Goes not much Happening.it's one of those films you watch when you are in Pure T&A type of Mood.it's fairly a Air-Head Film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stage Fright Is Not Genetic","review":"Coyote Ugly is a movie about a young woman who moves from her father's home in New Jersey to New York City to become a singer/songwriter. To make ends meet, she finds employment at a bar and dates an Australian orphan. In the end, she succeeds and produces her own album. She stops working at the first bar because she's financially secure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like the first, but withoutt he dark edge.","review":"This album still has the great vocals, and the rock and techno combination. So whats the big difference between this and their self- titled album? The songs on this one don't have the same dark edge and I don't think that Shirley's vocals work as well. That being said its still a good album and worth a buy (after you've purchased their first). Best songs:Temptation Waits- Seductive.I think I'm Paranoid- Has a pretty dark vibe to it.When I grow up- Being a teenager I really relate to the lyrics.Medication- It does for this album what \\"Queer\\" did for their first.Special- Catchy.Push it- Interesting lyrics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garbage Sharpen Their Sound With Version 2.0","review":"Garbage continues in the tradition of their debut on Version 2.0. They never really break new ground, but at the same time, really don't need to. Their brilliant formula of avant-pop rock with dancefloor beats works all the way without sounding recycled or stale. Shirley's voice polishes the assault of instantaneously addictive riffs, both even sharper than they were on their self-titled debut. After bingeing in the dark, Garbage contrasts with flickers of light on Version 2.0, without losing their intensity or our attention. A fantastic follow-up to a wonderful debut. Best Tracks: \\"Push It,\\" \\"The Trick Is To Keep Breathing,\\" \\"Temptation Waits,\\" \\"Special\\" Rating: 8/10"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"Definitely my favorite band. We saw 4 hits come off this album, and I can't believe they didn't release any more."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't get enough of this 'garbage'","review":"Another collection of the hypnotic Shirley Manson tunes. This album is equally entrancing and rocking. I didn't think they could top there 1st cd but they clearly are exceptional musicians. If your a Shirley Manson fan (lover), you've got to get Version 2.0. She will take you away....(again)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-Not-Miss for Alternative/Rock Fans","review":"This album is an unexpected hit from the world of aternative music. A band that was overlooked by most now have an album that any Alice in Chains, Nirvana, or Smashing Pumpins fan should not leave on the shelf. Such, direct and bold songs as \\"I Think I'm Paranoid\\", \\"Pust It\\", and \\"When I Grow Up\\" hold a certain power of Guitar and Keyboard combined, and the results are explosive!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as the first","review":"With version 2.0 Grabage tries to relive the newness of the first album by upping the techno and yet they fall into a very pop like atmosphere in a series of their songs. But as always the are at the head of the pack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is anybody here rating the Tab book instead of the album?","review":"Great album. Always was, always will be, one of my favorites. Went looking for a guitar tab book on Amazon. Found one that said it had 542 reviews for it. Opened a review; not about the book, about the album. Opened another, and another, and another, you get the picture. Nice going Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of best pop/rock cds","review":"Garbage is here again!!!!

The 12 excellent songs on this cd never get old, no matter how many times you listen to them. Shirley Manson is one of the best, if not THE BEST, artists out there today. As far as it being one of the best albums ever i agree! Its right up there with my other favorites: Hole \\"Live Through This\\", Rage Against the Machine \\"Evil Empire\\", Live \\"Throwing Copper\\", Smashing Pumpkins \\"Siamese Dream\\", Beastie Boys \\"Paul's Boutique\\", Pearl Jam \\"Ten\\", and, of course, Garbage's Selftitled Debut album!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"garbage is my favorite band!garbage is like alot of bands,","review":"kind of like hole, and kind of like sheryl crow, but personally i like garbage much better. If u buy the version 2.0 cd, make sure u listen to \\"the trick is to keep breathing\\". Garbage is a one of a kind band,they have a way with expressing a story with their music. Sooo...make sure u check out the version 2.0 cd, and the the soundtrack to \\"BIG DADDY\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best C.D.'s I've heard in a long time!!!!","review":"This is the best C.D. on earth!! I listen to it all the time. I like this one better than their self titled because it's got more techno in it, so you can really dance to it. Also, it's a little more upbeat than their last one. There's more of a variety in the music. It goes from soft(8&12), to cowboy(11), to payback(5), to angry(7), to head pounding techno(6&9). Every track is a good one, and there's some meaningfull lyrics as well. Do yourself a tremendous favor and BUY THIS C.D.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I want to be Shirley Manson!","review":"This group has become my favorite. The music just rocks and Shirley and the boys are just fantastic. I love every song on this album and that is a rarity for me. I don't always agree with what Shirley has said off the stage but their music is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this CD!!! It's awsome!!!!","review":"I love this CD my fav song is Special it is the best song!!!! I cant believe the price either on Amazon it is so chesp if your gonna bye this CD bye it here!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best CD's of 1998!","review":"Version 2.0 is a GREAT CD. It's one of those rare CD's where almost every single song is incredible. It is high energy power driving music that instantly puts me in a good mood and makes me want to thrive!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Garbage is the best band in the entire Sol System.","review":"Garbage rules so much, it's impossible to describe in words. Every single CD of the four I have of theirs(Garbage, Version 2.0, Special, and Only Happy When it Rains) is to the point where I like every single song they've ever had. EVERY SINGLE ONE. There are over twenty-five so far, and still much more to come, I'm sure. I don't need to use the playlist function on my CD players--I can listen to each. Besides Version 2.0, buy every other one they have out! \\"I think I'm Paranoid\\", \\"Only Happy When it Rains\\", \\"Stupid Girl\\", and \\"13x Forever\\"(\\"13x Forever\\" is only on the \\"Special\\" Single import from Britain)are in my opinion Garbage's best songs. You have to hear them. GUFFYPUP'S APPROVAL RATING (1-10): 26"},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD ROCKS !!! This CD is GREAT GARBAGE !!!","review":"Listen folks, you want a GREAT CD ! Garbage is version 2.0 is IT! This is one of thje BEST CDs I have purchased in a long time and my very 1st from AMAZON ! What a great price and service ! I work for a company involved in the design and creation of home and commercial theater, etc. I took this CD in the day I received it and let me tell you, what a demo ! We were all ready to party ! 500 QUALITY watts, 2 SUBS,5 Channels ! Thought we would crack the cement floor ! I have never purchased a CD like this with such cool tunes on ALL TRACKS. Keep on a rockin Garbage !

There is only about one song that totally does my head in as it is really repetitive, but don't let that put you off!! My personal favourite on the album is 'When I Grow Up'"},{"rating":"2","title":"version 2.0-newer, faster, better","review":"after the fanstatic acclaimed debut album, garbage had a rough second album to make.well, version 2.0 is the perfect second album. More pop-electronic and yet with the same dark obscure feeling the first album had.shirley's voice is more adaptaded to the songs and they seem to be more a band than they used to. one of garbage's best caracteristics is that all musics are very good. here you can't say that one or two songs are below the average, because they're all excellent. please listen to this album, that confirms that garbage are one of the best (or why not, the best!) band around!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD rules!","review":"I love this CD. I listen to it at least 5 times a day. It's different form the first CD though. They have a lighter attitude, with songs like \\"When I grow up\\" and \\"Special\\" this band knows how to keep you wanting more. If you didn't like the first CD( You really sould though) you will feel different about this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The trick is to keep being a child","review":"When some dull reviewer wrote somewhere in some Yugoslav quasi-intellectual pop-rock magazine that the new Garbage album isn't worth a penny, I was really eager to hear it. And not only to hear it. I bought it immidiately. It is one of the last (or perhaps, the first?) bands that successfully mix the punk influence with pop melodies and some techno sound. Sometimes they sound like a new-wave band, sometimes sing the beautiful ballads (\\"The Trick Is To Keep Breathing\\" or \\"You Look So Fine\\"), sometimes they sound angry (\\"I think I'm Paranoid\\"), but all the songs that are here get along really well. In spite of all the differences between the songs, the album sounds consistent. Energy, joy, sadness, tenderness, love, hate. What else does anyone want from music?"},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it much more that the first CD...","review":"I've enjoyed this CD so much! I bought \\"Garbage\\" and really liked it. Then my friend bought me \\"Version 2.0\\". I'm really impressed with the instrumentation and the lyrics. I think it flows better than the first CD too.Great music!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new here, just a Curve [copy] band.","review":"Save your money and just buy any Curve album. Garbage won't sound too original anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak...","review":"Garbage is an alright band. I'd heard them live BEFORE they became huge. Still, this album fails to match their true potential... this is really weak."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage is exactly that......","review":"I dont know what many people saw in this album, but i feel a rethink is due for. Appaling melodies, pathetic excuses for a beat. And the whining of some over privlaged rock stars who obviously feel as though they deserve more. Any attempt to throw in the odd tune is discarded for some strange attempt at \\"art rock\\" BORING"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ditch the Producer","review":"Garbage's first, self-titled, album was extraordinary. \\"2.0\\" is an overproduced, watered-down, record-label-spawned creation that's not worthy of the band. It's not that it's bad - it's that it's not good, and you'll be better off listening to the first album a hundred times rather than the first fifty times and this one fifty times.My advice to the band? Ditch the big-name producer and get back into a studio on your own, playing on your own. There, hopefully, you'll find what you lost in between the first and second albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Although to call it garbage is a bit harsh","review":"Songwriting lacks creativity, almost all straight major chords. Singer has good voice. There's much better electronica available."},{"rating":"1","title":"one star","review":"I give this effort one star--for ambition. The rest is just blank air. The lead singer emotes like a tin can and the music is a good reason why grunge is dying. This album gives us good reason why the band is named GARBAGE."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Betta Buy This!","review":"What a great album! I count 9 good tracks, which is a lot better than most albums these days. Skip over #6, #9, #11, and concentrate on the good stuff. Wonderful melodies, brash sounds, singalong hooks, and you can dance to it too. Great concept: Rock + Techno + Pop = GREAT ALBUM!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Outstanding","review":"I must admit that I'm addicted to \\"Version 2.0.\\" The entire CD is listenable -- not one track gets skipped on my CD player. Described by Shirley Manson herself as \\"mongrel-esque,\\" the band's style is a unique compendium of diverse musical genres. The result is a tight, masterfully-crafted audio experience. Pure listening enjoyment."},{"rating":"2","title":"warning: this CD is extremely addictive","review":"All I had ever heard of Garbage were a couple of their music videos until my friends persuaded me to buy this CD. Now I listen to it at least twice a week. I usually go for music with lighter lyrics, but I've fallen head-over-heels in love with all these songs, even \\"Medication\\". As much as I love the whole CD, I do have favorites: I listen to \\"When I Grow Up\\" and \\"Hammering in My Head\\" so much I'm bound to wear the CD out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Great Instead of Excellent","review":"Perhaps it's the thrill of discovery wearing off, or perhaps this album is a half-step below their debut. Nothing horribly new on here - the electronic effects are turned up a tad, and I found there to be fewer catchy songs. There's no real bum track on here (in itself an amazing job) but fewer songs jumped out and grabbed me. \\"Special\\" (displaying the band's amazing pop sense), \\"Push It\\" and \\"The Trick Is to Keep Breathing\\" are the ones I turn the volume up for. I'd slightly suggest the first album over this one, but this one's no slouch - if you want it, get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like them a lot-- one of my fave CDs","review":"I like their first album too, but this one has a more electronic-oriented tracks, my favorite is \\"When I Grow Up.\\" The even better part is that last fall they were on tour with my favorite band, Lit, and it turned out it was of da hook."},{"rating":"1","title":"I expected more","review":"I expected a lot more from Garbage. I bought this cd in hopes that it would be really great but only found satisfaction with four songs out of the rest of the 12 tracks. Three of these four songs are out on the radio anyway. My rating? I'll give version 2.0 a C+ for a good attempt"},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed","review":"Garbage has great potential, but honestly, I expected something better than this. The first disk was wonderful: every track was great, and you could listen to it forever. However, I quickly tired of this album. It doesn't have that many good tracks and you quickly tire of the ones that are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garbage-Version 2.0","review":"This is a great album. Some of my favorite songs on there would be \\"Special\\" and \\"I Think I'm Paranoid\\". \\"When I Grow Up\\" is also pretty good. This is a great CD to travel with. They've definitely out-done themselves with this album. Great job!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm a Garbage addict.... and this rocks!","review":"This is the best CD I've ever heard! Once again, Shirley rocks on with those dark tunes. But this seemed a little happier-especially \\"When I grow Up\\" and \\"Special\\"-than the first album. Probably the best song is, well, all of them are great! This is certainly \\"Special\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Good Piece of Work from a Great Band","review":"An all around good album good album with a good sound, but the disappointment is - is that only the first hlaf of the album is GREAT. The second half is good, but usually after \\"Push It\\", I hurrily change to the last song before I turn it off. \\"Medication\\" and \\"Hammering in my Head\\" are the best songs on the album, but the whole thing is well - worth listenin' too. Give it a shot - you won't be disappointed - especially if you're a garbage fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Temptation Waits...","review":"After a great debut, garbage made an album that made pop world better. With the songs like \\"I Think I'm Paranoid\\", \\"When I Grow Up\\", \\"Push It\\", \\"Special\\", \\"Temptation Waits\\", and a slow ballad \\"You Look So fine\\" they conquered the music world. Shirley Manson's voice was so great although a sad one...and a little bit creepy. The lyrics are quite creepy too. Much better than the debut was.Stars: I Think I'm Paranoid, Push It, You Look So Fine"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all-time favorites","review":"This CD was my introduction to Garbage, and it could be that bias but I think that Version 2.0 is much superior to the debut. The singles that attracted me were \\"I Think I'm Paranoid\\" and most of all the sparkling \\"Special.\\" This album has a mood-swinging way about it, while the first one was mostly consistant, so you're getting both energetic pop songs and brooding, more rock pieces. I remember that I got tired of songs like \\"Hammering in My Head\\" on the first listen, but now it's my favorite. The best thing about this album, though, is it's emotional impact-- it plays like a story, and it never fails to move me. The best example is You Look So Fine -- absolutely haunting. Of course it probably has a lot to do with the time of my life when I discovered this CD, but it's made an impact on me that will stay with me forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT GARBAGE.","review":"This CD is a wonderful outstanding effort. My only worry is that they put all their eggs in one basket....How can they do better than this one? Every song is a wonder of its own. My favorites \\"Special\\", and \\"Temptation Waits\\". In my opinion this should of won as best CD of the year at the grammies over Lauryn Hill handsdown. Don't miss this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great followup, but I like the debut better","review":"This is now doubt 1 of the best albums of 1998. It is very reminiscent of the debut, but the more I listened to it, the more it was a little too much on the techno side. Shirley's voice saves that, though. The 1st track \\"Temptation waits\\" reminded me a lot of the power that \\"Supervixon\\" had, & \\"Special\\" was better before radio started killing it. And just like the 2 slow songs in the debut, the slow tracks 8 & 12 have the same hypnotic effect. I overplayed this ALMOST as much as the debut, & even though I like the debut a little more because of the slightly darker tone, I wasn't disappointed with this cd. Garbage just plain rocks."},{"rating":"2","title":"OH MY GOD GET THIS ALUBUM>>>ALMOST AS GOOD AS THE 1ST!!","review":"It's hard to top the first album that I got when I was 9 but this one almost does it.

This album really cemented that fact! Both Garbage albums are 4 stars and I recommend owning both! Verson 2.0 has a great guitar sound! And with songs Like \\"Special\\" and \\"Push It\\" Shirley Manson embodies the meaning of the phrase \\"hell hath no fury like a woman scorned!\\" Buy this cd! I won't steer you wrong!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More mature look at Garbage","review":"Seven words: \\"I want Shirley Manson to adopt me.\\"Why? Because she exudes the powerful, seductive, and charismatic character that makes Garbage a force to be reckoned with. In addition to the radio-friendly \\"Push It\\" and \\"Special\\", Garbage shows a similar but more mature scope of musical stylings in this, their sophomore effort following their self-titled debut. My personal favorites: \\"Temptation Waits\\", \\"When I Grow Up\\", \\"Medication\\", and \\"You Look So Fine.\\"Seeing them live made me just love them more, and I think first-time listeners will immediately appreciate the mystical powers of this electrically-infused band by just listening to this album. If everyone listened to it and heard Shirley speak to them the way she speaks to so many through music, I think everyone would want Shirley to adopt them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD!","review":"I loved the first CD, but was doubtful about the 2cnd, since I'm used to the first CD being the better one.

Though \\"The Trick...\\" was the only good song with their new sound, \\"Hammering...\\" and \\"Sleep Together\\" seem to be overusing the guitar sound, ruining two of the twelve songs.If Garbage wants to adjust their sound a little bit, they should stick to the elements of \\"Special\\" and \\"The Trick...\\" and go from there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paranoiac...","review":"This record gives one a nightmare.

Like a lot of really good groups, there are a large number of truly great songs on this CD that you won't hear anywhere unless you buy the CD. Songs like \\"Temptation Waits\\", \\"The Trick is to Keep Breathing\\", \\"Sleep Together\\" and others really show off the quality of this group in a way you would otherwise not know.

I'm totally convinced that every year Garbage just gets better and better."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS CD JUST PLAINLY ROX!","review":"This CD is the bomb. GET IT!

I know, I was a stupid boy. \\"Version 2.0\\" is when I realized this is an amazing band. I'd be shocked if any fan of techno, pop, alternative, or girl-fronted-rock-bands didn't love this disc. In itself it's almost the best of Garbage. They all sound like singles. Other than the obvious 3-4 hits, I was most impressed by \\"Temptation Waits\\", \\"Medication\\", \\"The Trick Is To Keep Breathing\\", and \\"You Look So Fine\\". If you've ever thought about getting some Garbage, especially this album, do it. Don't be a stupid boy/girl."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garbage is great!","review":"Garbage's first album was a without-a-doubt 5 star, probably my favorite album ever. Version 2.0 is really good, but just a notch under the first. Still it is pretty darn good! The album doesn't have super hits like \\"Stupid Girl\\" \\"Queer\\" or \\"Only Happy When It Rains,\\" but it does have good songs. My favorite, which sounds like the Garbage most people know, is \\"Temptation Waits.\\" \\"Hammering in my Head\\" is great, too. The most popular ones, \\"Push It\\" and \\"I Think I'm Paranoid,\\" are popular for a reason, too. Overall, it is a great album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just when you think it couldn't get any better.","review":"I waited and waited for v2.0, it's the first product in sometime that hasn't shipped with bugs.

Another colletion of talented songs which sticks to your cerebral cortex and keeps you singing in the shower."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't forget to take out this Garbage!","review":"I was unsure as to how Garbage planned to mutate their music to produce a whole new CD. I loved the first album, but feared the upcoming release would simply be more of the same. Fortunately, it was! I am not sure how to explain how Butch Vig and Co. manage to keep me interested from song to song other than pure magic."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!","review":"Let's face it,Garbage's self-titled '95 alblum was increadable, but with Version 2.0 they have outdone themselves (and in my opinion they have also outdone most all of the other top bands out there.) V 2.0 is by far the best CD I own. So, for anyone who is a fan of unique lyrics and song stylings and the angry demeanor and personality of lead singer Shirley Manson, buy this alblum now. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved every minute of the cd","review":"I feel that version 2.0 was one of the best cd's of the year. It should have won a grammy. as well as the first cd 2.0 delived great vocals,gutair and a good beat. there is no need to skip tracks because all of them are well tuned to the point of profection. 2.0 is a must for anyone that enjoys rock or alternative. 2.0 the bands second cd shows improvement from there first album which was also a great album."},{"rating":"2","title":"this CD rocks!","review":"This album is wonderful.I must tell you the first time I listened to it, I loved every single song on the disc.The lyrics are catchey and the beats are incredible!Buy this CD and you will NOT be wasting your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Now THIS is music!","review":"Wow what a prize to come out of the late nineties. I own many CDs and there's new stuff I like out there but Garbage and their album Version 2.0 are too awesome. Butch Vig, Duke Erikson, Steve Marker, and of course, a role model I really admire, Shirley Manson-- really kick serious a$s! I also recommend the acclaimed GARBAGE debut and obviously, a trip to the official website. Needless to say, VERSION 2.0 blows me away. Seductive, sexy, music, man. I'm so happy I have it + it exists."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best albums ever made. Garbage Rocks !","review":"Truly the best album I've ever listen to.

Its definitely worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Special\\" CD","review":"This is a wonderful CD, Shirley Manson has a great voice, and the lyrics make you want to get up and dance. I was hooked the first time I heard them, the songs are great."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing CD. . . the best of '98-'99","review":"Wow, this is the best CD I've ever bought! The haunting melodies, hooks, riffs, and tempest refrains are incredible. It follows the same formula as the 1995 debut but polishes it, and makes it much catchier. The standout songs are (practically all on the CD): Temptation Waits, I Think I'm Paranoid, When I Grow Up, Special, Push It, The Trick Is to Keep Breathing, Dumb, Sleep Together, Wicked Ways, and You Look So Fine . . . and all the other songs are nearly as great. Really you MUST buy this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid album","review":"Most of us lost our virginity with Garbage on their first album, so it is kind of hard to top that one. But Version 2.0 comes very close to the thrill I got from the first CD. It's less \\"spooky\\" than their freshman effort, but more \\"powerful\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the type of 'Garbage' you don't throw away!","review":"Hello = )if your looking for great music, then you need this CD , you won't be dissapointed by it. 'Milk'is my personal favorite, it makes me want to cry..tears of sympathy (and of joy) for this great song, i don't care who knows it..it's wonderful, and Shirley Manson has a great voice for all who appreciate great voices, she can really sing, and touch your soul. Have a nice day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adds new fun to the track","review":"The mechanical switches are a wonderful way to add new fun to my son's Brio track. It seems easy for him to operate the switches and it adds a new dimension to his layouts since he now can redirect trains as they move about. They are a little pricey, but appear durable and well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good addition to your Brio collection.","review":"Even though it's a bit pricey for what you get, it's a fun addition to your collection. It gives the little engineer another interesting way to manipulate a train, especially battery operated trains. I would recommend buying more than one set/box if you have alot of track - it's fun to keep changing the direction of the trains to make them follow the many different directions of track. I have one set now and plan to buy another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not PCI Port","review":"I did not realize that I needed a PCI Port card and the web site did not indicate this requirement nor that this card was AGI. My son pointed it out to me after I ordered the card. When I contacted Tiger Direct, they did not know that it needed an AGI slot. They told me to call the Distributor - Diamond, who after a 35 minute wait on hold, said it was not his product (it was). When the card arrived and I confirmed that it was not PCI, I was able to return it and get a full refund. It was a hassle taking the box to be returned.

I have to say that I'm not as passionate about the show as I used to be; the characters Lucas and Peyton left and I thought that would ruin the show. However, that just lead to the show growing and getting to know smaller characters more. Season seven of One Tree Hill is amazing and the actors/actresses are great. It's a good show and the dvd allows for episodes to be watched without commercials. It's also the smallest and most compact dvd case out of all of the seasons (I have all 7). I would recommend this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible season. Terrible stories.","review":"First of all, Peyton was my favorite character. Second of all, Haley, Mouth and Millie are unlikable characters, in my opinions. Does anyone care about Skills and his girlfriend Lauren, or Mouth and his job? And YET again, Nathan and Haley's marriage is on shaky ground. Everything seems recycled. Fortunately, Clay is the beacon of the light. A likable guy who seemed unable to commit, he found his love in Quinn. Yet again Schwahn decides to kill someone off, this being Haley and Quinn's mother. Yet again, Schwahn uses the plot line of a crazy stalker. Unfortunately, the character of Dan is not in much of the season. Attempts to be funny were made, such as the girls getting high of pot brownies. Attempts failed. Terrible season. The only reason I will watch season 8 is because of Clay, and because I've been watching since the beginning. The show should have ended after season 6."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheaper at target","review":"I purchased this set in early december paid over 40.00 -- the next week target had it on sale for 23.00 returned it ... also bought another dvd set(house) and also found that for over 20.00 cheaper at bjs ... the week before christmas amazon put this on sale .... check your prices look around...

This season was pitiful There were points that you laugh out loud from it being so stupid and corny. Nobody acts like they do and Jamie's character which was good in the 5th and 6th seasons has become stupid. The show isn't the same without Lucas and Peyton, it's just dumb. The writing is just terrible, worst show of the year. I've never seen anything so corny. The new characters are ok, but this show shouldn't be surviving without Lucas and Peyton because it is so pointless and stupid without them. Even without them, it's too bad the writers and producers couldn't make it interesting and dramatic. Instead it's full of games, messes, snowball fights, and stupidity. Don't waste your time or money. Try some of the shows like 90210, Gossip Girl, The Vampire Diaries, and others which would be way more worth your time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Tree Hill Season 7","review":"This product was delivered at a reasonable amount of time considering it was international.Package was not damaged in the slightest and ive enjoyed watching every second of this season as it has not yet been released on DVD in Aus yet.Good work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"very satisfied","review":"The quality of the product was perfect.

If you haven't played the first one then your out of luck because it's sold out(lucky me, I have a copy ^_^)The story may be confusing if you missed out on the first GH because the people who are being assimilated into the main character are actually from the first game!

I was pleasantly surprised to see her name on the CD after hearing her shiver inducing track. Why did Sting get all of that attention? Bell's song blows doors on his.

I found it disjointed. There seemed to be a lot of time spent shouting down the telephone and smoking cigaretes which would be fine if the conclusion satisfied me, it didn't.The main Character, played by Jane Fonda, seemed naive and hopeless, the title character, played by Vanessa Redgrave was such an enigma that she was unbelievable in substance and played far to minor a role in the film.

It's hard to follow the poses when you can't see the instructors feet b/c they're buried in the sand and unless you have a decent knowledge of yoga there are a lot of important details about many of the poses that are left out.

I tried pretty much everything -- physical therapy, tons of stretching, chiropractic care -- and nothing really provided nay lasting results.A friend of mine recommended trying yoga as a remedy, but I never took it seriously until I saw the Yoga for Surfers video. I figured I'd buy the tape and give it a try (heck, I tried everything else!). And after two months, I was virtually pain free! I've been doing it for 6 months now and it has been an amazing turnaround. I also picked up Yoga for Surfers II and I'm working my way into that routine.When my dad told me he had back pain, I also got him this dvd, and I know he'll love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy the dvd, and don't buy into the fabricated 5 star reviews","review":"I purchased this as a video, and was not that impressed.

Particularly if you are not familar with yoga already. The poses are not explained as well as in most not-for-surfers DVDs. Often times, you can not see the feet of the instructor, so you do not know how to place your feet unless you already know the pose. I think Peggy is probably a good instuctor, but this DVD isn't a good example. The best part of this DVD is the advert for Rochelle's surf camp, which includes a cameo appearance of Minnie Driver. I found this portion of the DVD to be inspiring. If you are looking for some instruction on yoga poses, this is not a good choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing especially helpful for surfing","review":"This is a generic, cheesy yoga video with plenty of 'namaste' B.S. to go around. The poses are fine and good, but the video doesn't really offer up any yoga that is different and specific to surfing.

Even though I've practiced yoga for some time, I learned a lot from this program, especially from the post-surf session which has unique and effective rejuvenating poses.

Buy the book if you want to get killed on the street. Otherwise avoid it, unless you're a student of the author, of course. I'd hate to see what the \\"Basic\\" book is like, and as funny as this particular book is, it's not worth the money to buy it, even for a good laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Knight","review":"The legend of King Arthur finds new meaning in this powerful romantic novel. When Guinevere, Lady of Leonesse, finds herself desperate for protection for both herself and her people from an ex-Knight of the Round Table, she turns to King Arthur to save them all.Guinevere's decision - to marry the king, leads her into danger and intrigue as she begins the wildest journey of her life.When Lancelot saves an unknown lady in the forest, both their hearts become engaged. Lancelot becomes a friend and trusted confidant to the King, and Guinevere becomes Arthur's wife. While fighting to keep their love at bay, war threatens to tear them apart forever.Chadwick's love of re-enactment becomes apparent in this wonderful story of forbidden love. She describes everything in such striking detail; the reader can almost smell the stench of burning straw or feel the adrenaline and fear accompanying battle. This book is a must read, though not quite as powerful as many of Chadwick's other novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Knight (Cassette)","review":"Excellent service, prompt delivery, excellent conditonas described, packaged well.Would use again."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all time favorite books back in print!","review":"A dog-eared copy of this book was read over and over at our house when I was growing up.

I looked this up in the book, and immediately found inaccurate information. The author claims that only 10 crews made it to Switzerland in March of 1944, yet when my grandfather was shot down on 18 March 15 other crews were interned by the Swiss on the same day, the highest number in the entire war. The author also claims that many of the bombers landed with little or no damage, insinuating that they were intentionally getting out of the war. This is also false- the AAF conducted an extensive investigation during the war, and found that almost every bomber that landed in Switzerland had extensive damage. I'm not sure where the information in the book came from, but it is incorrect. Any crewman interned in Swizerland could have set the record straight in that regard, and there are plenty of them around who belong to the Swiss Internees Association."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not real history","review":"This guy does not check his facts with primary sources and has many axes to grind.

She helps us to realize that, as we have more and more choices in our lives, there are always repercussions to our choices.

There is nothing that really forces anyone in this story to stay where they are at, and as the death toll mounts and creepy goings on get more sinister, it never seems to cross any ones mind that the simplest solution would be to find a nicer neighborhood. It is like there is a Masterton IQ Reduction Chip (tm) lodged inside each character's head!And as silly as that sounds, had the author used a gimmick like this to explain the stupidity of his characters, I probably could have enjoyed the narrative enough to have given it 3.5-4 stars instead of 1."},{"rating":"1","title":"HPL would be spinning","review":"This book is okay, but Brown Jenkin is not what I saw when I read HPL's \\"Dreams in the Witch House.\\"It's not a good Masterton book, either.

If you are tired of buying watch batteries get a citizen eco drive. Amazon saved me a tonnnnnnnn of money because I have seen these watches in the department stores selling for $300-500. Amazon does fast shipping and the watch came in a beautiful green case with green velvet on the inside. By the way when you first get the watch make sure to expose it to light for about 2-5 minutes if it isn't working right out of the box. two to five minute charge should last 4-6 hours and a full charge should last 200-250 days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer BEWARE","review":"This item is cute and sturdy.

It is just a matter of time before a more extensive guide is published, (I would still recommend because of the great illustrations!) The only problem I have with this book is the layout which can be annoying if you are trying to find info on one of your cards. You have to search through several sections of the book. (e.g. Jackson's chewing tobbaco card in the \\"Exploration and Travel\\" chapter instead of the \\"Tobbaco\\" chapter). More expensive cards are usually only discussed in the chapter rather than illustrated, which I find kind of strange(Maybe he didn't own any of those to get the photo?)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lavishly illustrated, marvelous reference...","review":"This is a great book. It's a definitive reference on the somewhat obscure subject of Victorian Trade Cards, but for those of us who love them, it's a feast.

Be prepared: the top jaw slams down on your finger, and while my son doesn't cry (it doesn't really hurt so much as it surprises you), he does yell \\"ouch\\" ...And then continues playing with it. The tooth that makes the crocodile \\"bite\\" is random so you never know which one it'll be. The game goes quickly and can be fun for the entire family, which is nice when it's so hard to find games that not only appeal to the whole family, but can be played by families with age ranges from preschool children to older adults.

The top jaw has fallen off a few times but I think this was my girls' fault - too rough with it - and each time, I've snapped it back on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun but short lived","review":"I think this is best for 1-3 year olds. I have three boys ages 2, 4 & 5 and I thought they would enjoy it more than they do.Instead of playing with it like the game it's intended, they like to put cars in the croc's mouth! Which is fine. This is a good toy for car trips or plane rides because it's small, lightweight and quiet!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Travel Toy","review":"I was VERY disappointed with this toy. This is not a full size toy but rather a travel toy. I could not believe how small this was for the price I paid (around $13.00). I will be checking to see what the return policy is on this item.

However, she is scared stiff of the clamping action and refused to play with it. She started removing the sticker-eyes and -nostrils instead. Toy is durable per se but stickers can be easily removed. I had to glue them back with superglue, which is better lasting. I came to a conclusion that she is still too young to play with the crocodile dentist and I intend to keep it for her later on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken right out of the box","review":"At first the jaw didn't close even after I pushed all the teeth in.

Ours arrived with the top portion of the head warped and unable to stay attached to the body which makes the game useless.

This is what I would expect at a dollar discount store or flea market where you expect it to either not work, or only work a few times before breaking."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't live up to expectations","review":"Since this game gave no dimensions, I had to guess at it's size. From the photos that I saw, I assumed that the toy would be bigger then it actually was. It is small, about the size of my fist. The idea of the game is to keep pressing teeth until you reach the sore one, at which time the jaw will snap shut. However, the jaw very frequently pops off completely when snapping shut and requires an adult to put it back together. The teeth often do not reset after the jaw has snapped shut and have to be manually pried back into position to be able to play again. All in all, a disappointment and not worth the money it would cost to send it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"piece of junk","review":"We played this game twice and it broke.

This version is smaller than a softball. I really expected it to be the size of the gator golf like mine was growing up.the flaw im finding in this is with the spring they use to make it shut. often the mouth only shuts half way, or and sometime syou have to open and shut the mouth 3+ times to get all the teeth up. Now it worked perfect for about 15 min. My daughter is 3, and she has already gotten annoyed with it becuase of the number of times weve played it and known it was supseod to bite us, but it didnt.

He knows 1 mistake and the crocodile will grab his little fingers. You play it by pushing down 1 tooth of the croc for each person's turn. Each time you set the game, the tooth that will make the mouth closes is selected at random. The croc's mouth closes but is not that hard enough to hurt their fingers. 2 or more players. Does not require batteries to operate.I have seen this toy for years, it is a classic.

It's very obvious just from looking at the game box, which is cheap, says \\"CrocoDileDentist\\" on it, and is full of oddly-phrased sentences with typos, punctuation errors, and grammer mistakes. The toy does work, but it is VERY cheaply made. If I wanted this toy, I could have gone to alibaba.com and ordered one from China myself for 1.75. Instead I paid 11 dollars for the REAL toy, and got this one. As another reviewer said, it does have a \\"used\\" look about it right out of the package. Especially on the bottom of the toy.

I'm a college student on a budget which is why I went with the Sony's in the first place but these cross overs definitely stayed in budget and were worth the purchase.I was contemplating making my own cross over but gave in to the simplicity.Also wanted to note that these shipped very quickly, arrived 3 days after ordering and they made a very far journey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful music, lousy packaging","review":"I was glad to see this disc reissued, even as a CD-R, but despite the beautiful music, I cannot recommend this disc because of the lack of any information other than the track listing.

Unlike the double-vinyl release of the same show, this DVD rendering sounds like it was recorded thorugh a telephone. The DVD is, in fact, an excellent document of historical stuffs, but it suffers as a source of entertainment. The sound is simply terrible (although dated, one would think better sound could be mixed in here). Purchase only if you are a die-hard Bowie fan (like myself). If you don't know Bowie, don't start here!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bowie and Ronson - nothing more need be said!","review":"I have to chuckle at the perfectionists that diss this DVD because of the video quality. Folks, it was filmed in 1973! Nothing was as technically good then as it is now. And the style of filming IS dated, I agree. But take this for what it is - the ONLY film document of one of the major moments in rock history - Bowie performing with the original Spiders From Mars as his gender-bending Ziggy Stardust persona. Add the fact that it is maybe the only recorded document of Mick Ronson live, and what more could you want?! (OK, I'm a guitarist, and Ronson is one of my guitar heroes, and so I guess I am biased). But really - what an incredible performance! Bowie and Ronson - it just doesn't get much better than that..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Bowie and Ronson","review":"This is one cool but dated video. It contains some of the only video of Mick Ronson, deceased, available. It also chronicles the Ziggy Stardust tour which was huge for Bowie in his cross dressing era. It's really good if you excuse the fact it was shot with less than top of the line gear. It still gives the vibe and I do recommend it to anyone who loves Bowie during this time. This is really some of his best work in a time when many people didn't know what to make of him.Get it, set back, and wonder."},{"rating":"2","title":"glam rock at it's best","review":"A great representation of the era of glam rock as created by Bowie. Overlighted, fuzzy images create an aura of the days of raw punk music whose power has endured long after it was created. The sound is pretty good considering the recording prowess of the seventies. A necessary addition to your video music catalog."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm a hardcore early David Bowie fan BUT","review":"This concert film stinks! The camerawork is worse than clumsy--it looks like something a spastic with a Handicam would have done. And the sound quality is horrible.

It appears to be a pathetically low-budget production, a pity considering that it was done by the same man, D.A. Pennebaker, who wonderfully documented Bob Dylan's 1965 British tour in \\"Don't Look Back\\" (1967). As it is, the sound quality of this Ziggy Stardust performance is quite poor, as if all the mics were positioned 250 yards away from the stage. Moreover, the camera work is at times annoyingly erratic and inappropriate. The whole production, strangely, reeks of amateurism. If this movie would have been made with, for example, the production quality of Led Zeppelin's \\"The Song Remains the Same,\\" it would be well worth watching. Unfortunately, the bizarre sight of Bowie himself in action is its only saving grace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where in the world is the original mix?","review":"I have not seen nor heard the DVD release of this work but I have the VHS version. What a terrible injustice to the concert! I remember watching the concert on \\"In Concert\\" way back in the 70's. I even audio taped it on cassett, as it was aired on radio at the same time. No, the stupid echo effects were not on that version, Mick Ronson's guitar work (I miss that guy), was in front and smokin'! Who thought of mixing Ronson's ax just about out of the concert in the first place. To top it all off, Jeff Beck came out near the end of the show and played Jean Jeanie with the band An unbelivable walk on, just blew the roof off the place, you would never know it though since it is left off all video productions.Does anyone know when the REAL VERSION (What was released for the \\"In Concert\\" show on ABC) production would come out. It must be somewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice DVD","review":"I have this on both DVD and video and there isn't that much difference. DVD you can skip the guitar solos though and get back to David... or pause perfectly. If you do buy a DVD though, make sure you don't have the surround sound on. It sounds much much better when it's just flat together. Although this isn't a concert like you'd see today, it's still entertaining, definitely a classic. Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders just go together. I've got friends that don't know Bowie, but do know Ziggy Stardust. This is a great band, wonderful character, wonderful songs, it all comes together despite the picture quality. You can definitely just put it on and watch it, or work on something and just listen to it. It is worth the buy, especially if you love David Bowie."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"One of the first DVDs I ordered and of those first few, the one I most looked forward to.

No one has ponies, the other girls are rude and the owner is snobby. Her daughter is secretive and always upset. Then the pony pals find out that Shelly (the lady's daughter) once owned a pony, but everyone always pressured her to trade her pony for a horse and go to lots of shows. Then the pony died and no one was upset but her. Angry with everyone, she decides not to ride again. Can the pony pals help her and her mother? Read the book and find out!!

Then it dawned on me, my friend was one of the authors of the series of interconnected stories which make up this book.On boxing day I sat down and read the book and I can say - and this from one who is steeped in Scottish folklore - that I enjoyed it immensely. All of the different authors jell together so well that the tale seems seamless. Of course I enjoyed Janet's contribution, but also I thought that that 'The Inheritance' episodes were very well done, and held the book together, and I also very much enjoyed 'The Corbie's Nest' and 'The Luck of the Sixpence'.I thoroughly recommend this book to all readers with a love of Scotland, and a bit of mystery, intrigue and romance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as expected","review":"Don't be fooled by the title this book has nothing to do with the Stock Market. It is about how to add merchandise to a store. If your intersted in the stock market stay away from this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Color is not expresso!","review":"We ordered the expresso - but the color is quite different. The lighter shade is greenish grey! and the darker in almost black. Will do better in a black/grey scheme rather than expresso scheme. - So upsetting!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful music","review":"Christopher Young is an amazing composer and performer. If I had not seen the movie, I would never have heard his compositions. This album would be loved by anyone who is moved by Celtic music.

I watch it over and over! Some of the scenes are a little bit gruesome, but they are somewhat necessary for the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great performance!","review":"This is a great performance by the one and only Babatunde Olatunji! If you are familiar with his music, you are probably a fan. Many of his well known tunes are performed live on this DVD. I gave it four stars instead of five due to the fact that there seems to be a manufacturing defect on many copies of this disc. I ordered it three times from two different sellers and each time I had to return it due to a disc defect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adds very little to the online docu","review":"This book adds very little to the online documentation provided by the tomcat team and seems to be published in a hurry just to be the first tomcat book in place. E.g. on p.103 at the end of chapter 5 you can read: \\"In the next chapter, we cover securing a Web application using the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).\\" Well, there is no such chapter in the whole book. The same at the end of chapter 12, where Goodwill promises a Chapter on integrating the XML Apache Soap project into Tomcat. Again, no such Chapter.Covering the basics, the book does a good job, but as said, the provided ducumentation does it as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls far short of expectations.","review":"The author in the preface says that he expects this book to be a complete reference for Tomcat. I would say that it falls far short of the objective.I had expected a meaningful look at Tomcat. Most of the information presented is already available with the standard Tomcat distribution. There is no attempt to go beyond the surface. It seems the author was in a rush to get a book published, rather than spend time providing some insight into Tomcat.There is no proper introduction to the terms or concepts related to Tomcat. I don't expect an introduction to servlets or JSP. All I ask for is clear concise definitions of the various Tomcat components and a breakdown of the config files.If you are intrested in finding more about Tomcat stick to looking for the information online. It will be time well spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money.","review":"Talk about being disappointed! This book took a very superficial approach to some very basic concepts and the result is a book that might be useful if you are brand new to deploying servlet-based Web applications but useless if you want to learn about the nuts and bolts. I bought it to make sure that I'd know how to correctly configure Tomcat in a production environment but this book added very little to what I'd already learned from reading the documentation."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book could have been something special...","review":"It's a shame this book was so poorly written, and misleading in its title. The Java/Tomcat community has been struggling for some time with Tomcat, trying desperately to gain some sort of useful insight from the horrid online documentation. Then along comes this long-awaited manual that could have easily saved the day for thousands of sysadmins.Problem is, this book provides next to no useful information on the integration of Apache and Tomcat. It's bad enough that this information comes at nearly the end of the book. What's worse, the integration chapter is only a few pages long, and goes no further (in fact, doesn't even go as far) as the documentation that's provided online.This book is a huge disappointment - you are far better served by picking up a good O'Reilly book on servlets/JSP/etc. and figuring out the Tomcat installation/webapp deployment issues on your own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good only for the beginners.","review":"This book is good only for the beginner. It scratches onlythe surface for most of the topics. At times, I thought itwas a work in progress, and for some reason, the author wasin a hurry to get the book published. The diagrams are awfulis many places. The total content of this book could be easilysqueezed into less than 70 pages.Most of the stuff explained here is easily available in theform of articles written for OnJava.com by the author himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scott","review":"While this book does not dive into the details as some other reviewers have pointed out it does provide concise and easy to read chapters. I bought it specifically for the chapters on integrating with Apache and Struts. I found both chapters excellent not to detailed views of how each worked and what I needed to do to use it.This book will not hold your hand but is an excellent guide along the way."},{"rating":"1","title":"forget it for linux","review":"The book seems to give a detatiled example of how to install on a windows platform, but who care's, I want to install it on Linux!

However, almost all the information I found in it was available, sometimes verbatim, online."},{"rating":"1","title":"this should be titled \\"An introduction to Jakarta projects\\"","review":"If you are new to JSP/servlet development or want to know more about Struct or Log4J, this might be what you need. But for those who wanted to get in depth detail on Tomcat, forget it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book on the subject","review":"(...) this is by far the best book on Jakarta-Tomcat. I learned more in the few hours spent reading this book, then I did in the days(weeks?) spent reading existing documentation and newsgroups. The book covers all of the newest features, and provides practical examples. All in all, a very useful resource."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nearly enough detail","review":"It seems as if the author tried to get the book out the door as quickly as possible. If you are totally new to Tomcat, then you can read the book, but there is not much substance at all for anyone trying to actually implement Tomcat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Text.","review":"Finally a text that goes beyond the high school like documentation packaged with Tomcat. I found everything I needed. I especially found value in the Chapters on deploying other Jakarta technologies into the Tomcat container.Great text."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good lord! one of the WORST books out there!","review":"I've read a quite a few technical books and by far, this one tops the list as being THE worst book I've ever read. Too much information missing, makes many assumptions that you know what you're doing. (If I knew what I was doing with Tomcat, why would I need the book?) Unbelievable. HORRIBLE is a word that comes to mind (among many others that would be \\"bleeped\\" off of here.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"I bought this book when it was first printed hoping for some insight into how Tomcat worked, design decisions, architecture etc. etc.What I got was nothing more than a rehash of the online documentation.A complete waste of money then and utterly worthless now. If you have a copy hang it on a nail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomplete and not thourough","review":"This book is very, very superficial. Only a small part of the configuration of Tomcat is covered. Plus, it is certainly outdated today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book, Especially the Apache SOAP Integration","review":"I really got a lot out of this book. It covers many of the more useful Tomcat subjects. There is a focus on the use of Tomcat as it relates to the developer, but that is what I am so it was perfect for me.One of the more useful chapters was the chapter covering Tomcat and the Apache SOAP project.Great Book James."},{"rating":"1","title":"too expensive","review":"The price for these 22 packets was several times more expensive than buying it in the 4 count package in a grocery store.

I put it in a little bit of water then wash it down with a whole lot of water, every evening. I notice a huge difference in my sleep, among other things. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cinematic satire is dead","review":"Tom Lehrer once said that political satire died the day Henry Kissinger was given the Nobel Peace Prize. Thus it is with cinematic satire as this film won the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay. There is no story of any worth here. It adds nothing to our understanding of the human condition (which other reviewers seem to imply is where its value lies) per se, it is merely a series of sketches in search of a coherent theme which fails qua entertainment. McKellan and Redgrave do their best, but with such prosaic material to work off they cannot save a very boring film whose raison d'etre escapes the ever increasing somnolent viewer. That it won an Oscar for the screenplay says far more about the Academy's often appalling decisions than anything else. Perhaps, like the American Presidency, lobby money can buy anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes, this is a lame=weird movie","review":"1. one may try to impress others by talking up this artsy fartsy movie, but the intellectually honest will realize that this movie is just... lame.2. the acting is stilted and so unrealistic and of course--> the storyline is just bizarre. but of course, the self-indulgent and narcissistic love unusual storylines so as to fool the general public.3. at the end of the day, dismiss the high brow critics and realize this movie for what it is--> an odd / bizarre movie with surprisingly lame acting."},{"rating":"1","title":"God, This Movie's A Monster!","review":"Yawn, yawn, yawn! I was forced to sit this this pile of crap. Who cares about an ageing homosexual who lusts after his hunky, straight gardener? I didn't care about the characters, and found them to be extremely annoying....especially Redgrave. What was she trying to mumble all the way through the film....who really cares? What a waste of two hours. Academy Award nominations? PLEEEEEEEASE! For what? If you run out of sleeping tablets one night, hire this sleep-inducing movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"ridiculously overrated campy trash","review":"Only actor worth a hoot in this thing was B. Fraser -- McKellen and Redgrave's performances were pitiful. Redgrave acted like she was a skit character on SNL; I've seen McKellen's effeminate, snobby British character a zillion times. If you want to be bored out of your gourd, watch this claptrap."},{"rating":"1","title":"YYYYAAAAWWWWNNNN","review":"What in the hell was this???? I rented this mostly because of Brenden Fraser and based on the few reviews I read. I guess I should have read more of them, and I'm glad I'm not the only one who found this movie a total bore.I was hoping it would get better, maybe a surprise scene in the middle or the end of the movie but it never happened!That's two hours of my life that I'll never get back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, bad, boring, bad","review":"I couldn't believe how bad this movie was. I was ready and willing to be proven wrong about my negative impression of Brendan Fraser's acting ability, based on what others had said of this film, but ended up with further confirmation that he is a lousy actor. I ordinarily like movies that are slow moving and antithetical to shoot-em-up blockbusters, but this picture C...R...A...W...L...E...D..., and suffered from dry dialogue, to boot. On top of everything else, this film was predictable, and I continued watching only to see if a fantastic surprise ending would redeem it. No dice- the end certainly did not justify the tedious means.In addition to a badly written script and substandard acting, the actors' accents seemed overdone (too theatric) and fake. It was a real drag to watch this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!","review":"I never would have bought this except that I lost the copy I naively borrowed from the library, and I needed a replacement copy. I tried twice to watch it, and both times quit in disgust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"It was a waste of money. In my opinion, it was just shy of being labeled a porno film."},{"rating":"2","title":"GET THE DVD BY ALL MEANS","review":"The DVD has one of the best director's and actor's comments I have ever seen on a DVD.McLellan's performance is beyond positive description (did I spell his name right?)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning and brilliant","review":"I must echo some sentiments in saying that Ian McKellen was robbed of the Oscar by a hyperactive goof. He broke my heart in his portrayal of James Whale, and not in an emotionally manipulative way. Brendan Fraser was incredible as always, and Lynn Redgrave cracked me up. This movie was ingenious, and if you liked it, definitely read \\"Father of Frankenstein.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Tender, wonderful movie","review":"I can't go on & on in quadruple paragraphs like some reviewers do, but I can say that this movie touched me & brought tears to my eyes several times. Ian McKellan is just wonderful. The scene where he talks about the loss of his friend in WWI is so moving. The ending is bittersweet...you felt that the Brendan Fraser character would never know such a friendship again."},{"rating":"2","title":"An intense and powerful Drama!","review":"I purchased this movie because I am a huge Brendan Fraser fan, but the movie is so moving that I somewhat forgot that Brendan was in it and became so captivated in the story, that I ended up watching it again a second time. It is wonderfully acted! I think it's Brendan's best work ever and Ian Mckellen is outstanding in this movie. For anyone looking for a movie that will move you and having you wanting friends and family to see it, this one will. It's such a powerful drama. One that I will watch over and over. I'm glad to have it in my Collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ian McKellen shines hauntingly.....","review":"What a movie. I was so tremendously moved by the characters, both haunted by their past, tortured by the present and yet still eager to experience, learn and enjoy life..... an affirmation for living a life that's full and making your mental baggage work for you. Loved it !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ian MacKellan was robbed at the Oscars!","review":"He gives a TERRIFIC performance as faded movie director James Whale (directed \\"Frankenstein,\\" \\"Bride of Frankenstein\\" and the 1936 \\"Showboat\\", among others) - droll, witty, effeminate, intelligent. Instead of being turned off by his penchant for young boys, you felt sorry for him. Sir Ian was more worthy of the Best Actor Oscar than Benigni. Also excellent work by Lynne Redgrave and even Brendan Fraser. I would recommend this video to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie","review":"Good movie, especially if you enjoy the old Universal horror movies.

Academy award quality-definity not. Interesting story ? Well its different ?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"I often Buy having not seen a movie, especially when the reviews are glowing. Thankfully, I rented this first. I just don't see what was so special about this movie that was not family friendly, boring and drifted. My tastes go more for the movie that i can watch with my large family. This one doesn't qualify.Moreover, I don't see any of the usual devises that make you sit back and say, \\"wow, well written\\". I only rented this because of the academy award. I don't agree that it should have gotten the award over some of its worthy competitors.Rent it first as I did, maybe you'll agree with the professional reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring,,,","review":"Mckellen does such a poor job in this movie..ofcourse it is easy to act gay when you are in real life..Brendan Fraser is the only decent actor in the entire movie and to think that he was in Encino Man..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A gay old man chasing a straight young man. That's it.","review":"First, forget anything about \\"Frankenstein.\\" This movie is nothing more than a story of a gay old man chasing a straight young man. And it dragged on and on...If this movie had been about a straight man chasing a younger woman, it would have been reviewed as garbage.I agree totally with the review titled \\"God, This Movie's A Monster!\\"For what it's worth, the cinematography was good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tender, Beautiful, and crack-me-up funny!!","review":"This is a great movie. All at once, I saw that, yes, Brendan Fraser does deserve to be in a movie with McKellan and Redgrave. This movie is tender, beautiful, and crack-me-up funny--all at the same time. The photography is excellent. Script--wonderful. SEE THIS MOVIE!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Character Study, Fascinating and Expertly Acted!","review":"This movie has a great script and wonderful acting by all the cast, I was surprised that Brendan Fraser did a good job with his role. If you know something about James Whale or liked his movies then it will prove more interesting. The movie starts out a bit slow but then grabs you and doesn't let go until the end, but fascinating throughout. I was surprised that the gay subject-matter did not make me feel uncomfortable (as with other similarly-themed movies). Expert performances by Ian McKellen and Lynn Redgrave make this all the more rewarding. See this movie. From a scale of 1-10 I give this movie an 8!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I know I was supposed to be impressed, but....","review":"This movie just didn't grab me, at any point. I am usually a tremendous fan of McKellan's work, and like Fraser's style. However, neither really clinched it in this film. The scene stealer in this blasé film has to be Redgrave, playing McKellan's Hungarian housekeeper. The film covers the recollections of the director of the original Frankenstein film. McKellen finds a confidante in Fraser, the yard/pool boy. While the recollections could have been riveting, somehow the delivery is flat, and you find yourself saying \\"who cares?\\" most of the time, without forming any affinity for either character's plight. Yes, McKellen is an openly gay actor, and yes, Fraser does a bit of a nude scene, but that's no reason to run out and buy this film. Rent it on a slow Saturday afternoon. It's watchable, but you won't want to re-watch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly poignant, touching film","review":"This is a fabulous movie adapted from a wonderful book. Both are worth purchasing. The novel is called \\"Father of Frankenstein,\\" by Christopher Bram. I read (and loved) the book before seeing the movie, and initially, I was hesitant to see the film version at all. So many film adaptations of great books excise the heart and soul of the original. But I was convinced to see the movie and was very pleasantly surprised. It is subtle, touching, and poignant. To sum it up: this movie is simply well written, well directed, well made, and especially well acted. Do yourself a favor and see this movie -- it is truly touching. But first, read the book. Both will impress you."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than perfect","review":"This movie is a masterpiece. IMHO, it is flawless in every aspect. Words cannot describe how wonderful these actors are. Ian McKellen has definitely dominated the show. He is like a beautiful centerpiece that is made of diamond. I couldn't move my eyes away from him. And Brendan Fraser is equally good; his strength is not a bit weaker than his counterpart. That is admirable. Finally, Lynn Redgrave, she has shone through the whole movie. She's perfect. The story telling is magically, the director, the screenwriter, the musician; the whole production team has done an incredible work to bring this tragedy story to live. These people are brilliant; they know their stuff; they know life; there is no doubt about that. What amazes me is that they also have a loving heart and that makes this movie extra special."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Synergy of Pure Talent","review":"This film is as poignant now as it was when I first saw it in '99, and am very glad to own it on DVD as one of my favourites. The settings, costume styles, and score make it worth seeing second from the brilliant script and performances by such great actors as Sir Ian McKellen, Brendan Fraser, and sadly missed Lynn Redgrave (RIP). This is a truly correct blend of talent that is reminiscent of another film released that year, \\"The Talented Mr. Ripley\\", as well as many of the classics. Great art makes me cry, as this film's end did in '99, and still does today. If you are interested in classic films, and high intellectual art, this DVD is for you. I should like to have it on Blu-ray."},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"I have to say the movie was much better then I expected it to be..I really enjoyed the ending and the meaning behind him befriending a \\"strong type \\" guy...get this movie..u wont be disappointed!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kevin Bacon","review":"As usual, Kevin Bacon does a great job playing someone who is not such a nice guy yet he manages to give his character some humanity. You can tell he researched his character's profession.Brad Renfroe does a good job too and it's so sad that his life was cut short by his life choices. He was a promising actor.The story itself was entertaining enough. I didn't get the boy's attraction to Callista Flockhart's character.

It moved quickly, but thoroughly...a very enjoyable read. Although the term \\"page-turner\\" is cliché, that's what this is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Biography","review":"An engrossing, informative biography of baseball's greatest player. Some biographers make the mistake of rattling off facts and statistics, as if to impress you with how much research they've done. Creamer wisely focuses on the story, including descriptions of important games that make you feel like you're on the field with the Babe. Comments by Ruth's contemporaries add to the realism. \\"Babe\\" gets off to a slow start--a chapter dealing with Creamer's feelings about writing the book, and more details about Ruth's childhood than you probably want to know. But once Ruth starts playing baseball, the book grabs you and won't let go. One caveat: the discussion of Ruth's womanizing, while necessary and not extensive, makes this book inappropriate for young readers. If you like baseball and want to learn more about Babe Ruth, this is the book to get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still The Best","review":"Originally published in 1974, Creamer's book was the first \\"serious\\" biography of Ruth and remains the standard work on the subject. The first few chapters are a bit slow as the author painstakingly chips away at decades of apocrypha and rumor to reconcile the many conflicting accounts of the Babe's youth. The pace picks up once Ruth reaches the big leagues and really takes off after he's sold to the Yankees. Creamer is frank about the Babe's ravenous appetites and the effect these had on those around him, notably his first wife. Ultimately, Ruth comes off as a jovial, well-meaning but rather selfish man who was fun to be around but not someone you'd want to depend on.This Kindle edition has a hyperlinked table of contents and index but contains no photographs save the cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Babe: The Legend Comes To Life","review":"As author of the yet to be published \\"Babe Ruth: The Man Behind The Legend,\\" I have read every book I can find on the subject of Babe Ruth. The more I read, the more I appreciate Creamer's exhaustive account of Ruth's playing career. This one is, by far, the best of all and I keep it with me at all times when I am in need of reference material. It is the most thorough and comprehensive. It is easy to see why this book has endured the test of time - an amazing 33 years in print. Thank you, Robert Creamer, for your truly wonderful contribution, and may you enjoy many more years in print! Sincerely, Rebecca Rau"},{"rating":"2","title":"Babe Ruth learned","review":"As being a Generation X-er, I always heard stories of Babe Ruth being the best slugger and his 714 home runs. I did not really know to much about him, even being a big American League baseball fan.It is amazing to read some of the stories how he was difficult, may not have said things the way he should have, and how he was not always a good player, well little mistakes. But then on the other hand, how he was kind of like a big kid.The author I feel did an excellent job in writing this book from beginning to end. At some points he might not have the whole story for earlier years, but he did use newspapers, ect for play by play of some of the games.It is interesting to learn about how he interacted with other players and owners. It is kind of sad how his later years ended up and I believe more modern players are taken care of a little more in their later years.So much info in this book and well written. I learned a lot and highly recommend this book.Mike"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still the Sultan","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

But even worse, there are huge psychological flaws here... Flat characters.. Unrealistic portrait of a mother's grief .. and an ending that is so out of touch with the mother's reality.. It's just too light and doesn't , as so many books seem not to, deliver on its initial promise... Yet, on the positive side, the scenes are vivid, memorable and ditto some of the characters.. But that beginning was SO promising.. that the rest drops you into sadness.. not about the death portrayed but about the value of a great story that doesn't begin to meet its promise."},{"rating":"1","title":"This wallows in lameness!","review":"The title of the review says it all.

However, I would have loved to have know Sarah more before her accident. Her character was not fully developed. I liked her best male friend the best. I found the other characters self-absorbed and often annoying. The overall plot was interesting and often heart-wrenching. The author really made you think about your own mortality and how we can touch and be touched by others people's lives...and the affect we have on each other.

Meg Wolitzer's writing is all-American, a reflection of life here and now. I love it. She's just deep enough to be very interesting, and literary enough to pull you along, but in this book, every word counts. If only every women's author these days was so spare and so talented! It was such a relief to pick up this meaty but relatively short book - 240 pages - after having to plow through big, fat, 500-page, comment-on-every-color-and-nuance-of-thought \\"women's literature\\" books for my book club!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring,Boring,Boring,,,","review":"How an author can create such great characters while writing a novel free from compelling circumstances is surprising. Ho hum, I can't believe she's dead, let's pour ourself another drink. I can't believe her mother showed up, ho-hum let's pour another drink and watch her clean the house. One big secret does surface, but it is rather mundane in it's telling. At the end everyone gets better, while the Mom who is easily the most exciting of the group, realizes life does go on after the loss of a child. Even if'ts is a miserable and shallow existence. Color this whole novel as grey and bland as a grief stricken day in the Hamptons. I was disappointed because I really looked forward to this book, and intead could barely muster the energy to finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"funny and heartbreaking","review":"I loved this book -- it's among Wolitzer's best.

When one of the humans fell prey, I thought 'so what'...when one of the vampires was being high and mighty, I thought 'whatever'. Having the vampires turn into a grotesque, ugly beast is orginal, but actually rather distasteful. It did have a lot of surprise twists to the plot, which saved it from being awful, but I won't read it again, and I won't keep the book. My biggest complaint is that no one could resist the draw of vampirism...what absolutely no one? Come on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reflections of a Vampire ROCKS!","review":"Horror lovers everywhere, be prepared to crown another King. Damion Kirk is a master story weaver and first class writer with tremendous style. Mr. Kirk's vampires are so vivid, they crawl off the page. One even followed me into my dreams! St. Laurue is a vampire that shocks as much with his violence as his sudden outbursts of mercy.That Mr. Kirk has created such memorable characters is wonderful, that they share such a rich story is incredible. Reflections of a Vampire entices us on a wild romp from the back alleys and clubs of NYC, to the Holocaust Museum in DC.I'll put it this way - If you're looking for a great read; if you love horror, mystery or suspense -- buy one for yourself, and one for your best friend - so they don't keep yours. Why did I love Reflections of a Vampire? Because it's a tale so very, very human."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Chill in Little London","review":"A word of mouth film. In turn sordid, fascinating, voyeuristic and sensational. The filmmakers take the wake theme and give it a new twist. From beyond the grave, Jude Law narrates and shows a film of his friends to his friends. They are shown as cowards, cheats, petty criminals, adulterers and ultimately murderers. The end is a shocker. The acting superb, in that \\"fly on the wall\\" documentary style. Ray Whinstone steals most of his scenes. Check him out in Sexy Beast and Final Orders."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little disappointed...","review":"Am I the only one who didn't like this movie? Sure, it was an original idea and the revelation of how Jude died was surprising, to say the least. Still, it was very slow-moving and even though Ray Whinstone was very good and Jude Law looked as hot as ever, there wasn't much else to hold my attention. The female leads all acted as if this were the first time they had read their lines - Sadie Frost, in my opinion, was terrible! Surely they could have found some actresses who would show a little emotion and seem sincere when they did show a little emotion. So, I give this film kudos for such an original idea and the unique way in which it was filmed and presented, but otherwise, I have to give it two thumbs down :-("},{"rating":"2","title":"For those who like word of mouth cult movies...","review":"and especially British underground cult movies, check out \\"Final Cut\\" - and then \\"Love, Honour & Obey\\" (the sequel, written by the same two guys, and featuring the same set of actors). The first time I saw \\"Final Cut\\" back in 98 I was gripped by the edgy, rawness of this \\"reality movie\\" format, and the shear thought-provoking nature of the film. (I mean, who can you really trust..?) One of the reasons I think the film works so well is because the actors (in both movies) are all friends in real life and part of what's called the \\"Primrose Hill\\" set. Note too that the characters all take the names of the actors. For those who are Ray Winstone and Jude Law fans, these early performances helped launched their careers and rightly so. A great movie (if you don't have to be entertained by non-stop action, special effects, etc. and you can understand the dialogue and accents!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash Pure and Simple","review":"This is one of the worst conceived, plotted, edited, or acted films it has ever been my misfortune to buy.

Each of the bears are rattles and are not only interesting to watch but noisy too. However, the suction cup doesn't work very well, even when moistened. I used to put it on our baby's swing tray, and then her high chair tray, but it never stuck for long and would fall over. Obviously it's quite top-heavy, so it's not a toy that is made to be HELD and played with.Occasionally I will still try it on her high chair tray but now she's strong enough that (because it doesn't stick well) she can knock it to the floor. Mostly it just sits in her toy box and doesn't get any play.My recommendation? If you're looking for a suction cup toy, try something else.

What I got was disappointing, to say the least. At minimum, this book is mistitled, because the reader is led to expect a comprehensive description about how executive teams function and create the same kind of magic we find with teams elsewhere in the organization. Instead, we are treated to page after page of exhortation, warning against a) calling an executive team a \\"real team\\"; b) encouraging CEOs to create \\"real\\" executive \\"teams\\" and c) permitting \\"undisciplined\\" teamwork at the top, lest senior executives suddenly drink the kumbya-flavored Kool-Aid of too much collaborative behavior.

It held such promise of addressing one of the most important barriers to building collaborative behavior in organizations---the behavior of the senior people.Throughout the book the author seemed to defend the hierarchical behavior of senior executives and diminish team benefits. And it completely missed the essence of teams which is collaboration. Phrases such as \\"amorphous groups with overlapping responsibilities,\\" \\"disrupt the natural order of things,\\" \\"seldom the best way to get normal work accomplished or routine problems solved,\\" \\"seldom the fastest way for a group with an experienced, capable leader to get where they are going,\\" \\"time-consuming 'forming, norming, and storming' stuff,\\" had me wondering if the author really understands collaboration.This book may do more to maintain the traditional topdown, hierarchical decision making model than to foster real collaboration and teamwork."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Godowsky.","review":"These are good performances, but I prefer those of Carlo Grante on Music & Arts.

I can't imagine why this wasn't constructed with thicker fabric and industrial stitching. The bed is heavy and awkward to move. Inside are 2 cedar bags and 1 foam pad, so that when you move it, those cedar bags will overlap each other, then the bed has a big lump in it. You have to get those cedar bags side-by-side in there.

Just listen to the organ improvising theme of OYE COMO VA, EVIL WAYS and SOUL SACRIFICE, and you'll understand what I mean. No underestimation of other band members.. All of them are great. I rated the band 5 stars, and Arista company which produced the DVD 3 stars making a mean of 4 stars for the item. I can't believe how to produce a music DVD on the end of 2005 without a 5.1 channel sound format.I think that great Santana deserves to be listened at his utmost,and the DVD shouldn't be produced with only stereo sound.

I can leave a spare copy with one of my grocery bags so that I can pick out a new recipe or two while at the grocery store. I find that this lets me find the freshest foods available.What I like most about this book is that with a little preperation and fore thought, you can do much of your cooking for meals in advance, and just combine ingredients and heat when meal time comes. This can be done because many of the recipes call for \\"cooked rice\\" or \\"cooked peas\\". I find that this also allows you to use leftovers up quickly, in new recipes.One note, though, is that this book is not Vegan by any means. Many of the recipes call for dairy products and eggs.Overall, it is a lovely lovely book and a must for those trying to live lightly on the earth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recipes for a Small Planet","review":"Great book for vegetarian recipes.

A well-meaning relative gave it to me when I first became a vegetarian 16 years ago, and it's a good thing that I didn't start to try recipes from this book early on, because I would have given up on vegetarianism. There are some decent bread recipes here, but the remainder are almost uniformly terrible. Nutritious, perhaps, but also tasteless without a seeming thought to presentation or texture. This book represents the worst of early vegetarian cooking in America, and I have yet to prepare a single recipe from this book that I found to be truly appetizing, or that I would (heaven forbid) serve to guests. I didn't sell my copy because I wouldn't inflict this sort of thing on an unsuspecting victim - I recycled my copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought it again for our second child!","review":"These Carters baby albums are very cute, high quality, and easy to use.

After discovering she is pregnant with Brother Jackson's child, she turns to him for help, and he takes her to a spiritual redemption camp to find guidance.

We took them to a lagoon with some friends and the kids all took to it right away.It's a water canon, a bullhorn, a funnel, and even a strange device that the kids rigged up to pull a body board around. This is durable, with a lot of play value for toddlers up to teens. Well, if you want it played with as intended (pull cone down large side first and water flies out the other end), they'd have to be at least 6 years old -- younger kids have problems doing it.

When I was reading, it was sad to picture how hard it would be then for not just teenagers but everyone,especially when they talked about how they didn't want to die yet and the shame and humiliation they felt as jews. I liked how Boas described their lives and events so well that I didn't feel I missed out anywhere. I also liked how he would compare the teenagers lives and choices with the others.

His ideology is readily apparent, and throughout most of the book influences his discussion of the issues. Instead of taking an objective and critical look at our social problems, he embarked on a one-sided journey of his personal opinion.

The film is quite entertaining if you take into consideration the inclusion of a fictitious German agent, added because, when the film was made, the fact that the allies had broken the German Enigma codes was not public information. The film had to give some explanation as to how the allies knew that the Germans swallowed the deception and relocated their defences away from Sicily.

Clifton Webb as Montagu did a credible job portraying the mastermind of the plan to sidetrack the Germans. It was a clever plot to plant a body with rank, papers, and identification in a location that was backed by information of tides, sea currents, etc. There was the usual anxious feelings of being discovered especially when the Germans decided to send a spy to England to verify whether this person really existed.

Why can't movies be made like this anymore? Recent World War II movies are not accurate and place too much emphasis on effects. In my opinion, the more \\"special effects\\" a movie has, the more fake it is. Anyhow, \\"The Man Who Never Was\\" describes the true events of the British trying to confuse the Germans as to where the Allies will invade - Sicily or Greece. By arranging to have a dead body wash ashore in Spain with top-secret documents, the British cause the Germans to alter their defenses, thus saving the Allies from suffering even more casualties. How the British found a body, the details that they had to come up with to make the Germans believe the body was for real, and the subsequent German effort to determine whether or not the information found on the body was accurate, all make for an exciting story which moves at a swift pace. This is really a great World War II movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly slow, boring thriller based on a fascinating true story","review":"I couldn't make it past the first ten minutes.

It really is too bad, because the section concerning how to prevent sexual addiction in their child is very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"False Intimacy has false determinations about God & sex","review":"This book was a complete turnoff. Instead of relating to scientific, psycological explanations of sexual addiction, the author blames everything on lack of closeness with God and not being saved by Jesus Christ. This author could use a good shrink. Take respondsibilty for your actions. Is God or the absense of him respondsible for everything. What a crank. Buy this book and go to seminary school. What a waste of time and money. Pure garbage. Now I need to buy another book to find out about my sexual addiction (psycologically) not spiritually."},{"rating":"1","title":"An abomination","review":"I'm a Stanford-trained MD and practicing psychiatrist and I have to say that this book is worse than terrible.

Dr. Shaumburg is definitely serving Jesus Christ with this book and is following Christ's calling in his life. From the original sin of Adam and Eve until now, man will always deal with sin hear on Earth, but Dr. Shaumburg offers wonderful Christian insight into the specific topic of different behavoirs we become involved in trying to fill a place in our heart that only Jesus' Holy Spirit can fill. The key is be submissive to Jesus' Holy Spirit.Awesome book!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Average sound and vision , music slick but involving","review":"Most of Roxy's fans will buy all their DVD's as each of them offers a different lineup of the band and different songs .This lineup had an exceptional rhythm section , who help give the songs a lift and they make me want to watch and listen again and again .One gets a good idea of how mellow Roxy could be as the ballads are convincingly done , with stirring lead work by Neil Hubbard on MY ONLY LOVE being the highpoint of a standout version .A good release - maybe one day they will be able to clean up the picture .

I first came across this group in the flamenco movie \\"El Amor Brugo\\" - the original classic music is composed by De Falla, a Spanish composer. Via Amazon I was able to purchase 4 albums by Azucar Moreno. The Exitos Originales album has the true Flamenco pop music - it also features the song \\"Azucar Moreno\\" that appears in the movie I spoke of. The other tracks are similar in nature and could have been part of that movie.

Also they are bound in the book so you can't take them out to photo copy them without tearing them out, or you just leave them in there but there is no customization at all. They're all the same.

The authors have definitely done their homework in studying the culture of late 16th century Japan. They've also got a great filmography and bibliography at the back. As far as content is concerned, Sengoku sets the bar quite high for historical RPGs. The actual conversion of this historical information into a playable game is, however, a bit awkward. The book is also seriously hampered by the amateurish artwork and layout reminiscent of RPGs of 30 years ago. Still, I've worn the cover off my copy of the book so its obviously a worthwhile read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor scholarship","review":"This book is another example of \\"hands-off\\" scholarship in that it appears as if the editor never visited Montgomery but rather relied on secondary sources. Though there are numerous excerpts, the editor did not perform the necessary research which would have revealed (a) that the Boycott had its roots within the American labor movement and, more specfically, events which happened in Birmingham, Alabama, during the 1930s and (b) there probably still exists in the archives of the Montgomery Improvement Association or in at least one other place financial and other records not taken to the King Center which would have told an in-depth story using primary sources.

Most of the authors are pastors, and most of the chapters were originally published as articles in Leadership Journal. Various chapters discuss deciding when you should look for a new position, how to candidate (with very helpful questions to ask a search committee) and how to get off to a good start at your new church.

They are a little apprehensive about their admission to Good Cheer Hospital, because there seems to be a rash of deaths of basically healthy people who have recently had surgery at the hospital. There is a rumor of a takeover of Good Cheer and there are plenty of quirky hospital employees as well as relatives of the deceased which gives Judith a long list of suspects. Her husband is working on a case dealing with homeless people and Judith suspects that there is a connection to the case she's working on.

I kept hoping that Mary Daheim might get back into her groove. Not so. Somewhere along the line, the books have lost their charm. Renie has developed a severe overbite, with prominent front teeth, which is heavily focused on in the last few books. She has also gotten quite an attitude, making it difficult to get along with anyone. Added to that is Renie and Bill's ridiculous storyline of dressing their pet bunny, and in other books, being obsessed with their stuffed gorilla. They even go so far as to have Oscar the gorilla held hostage and have to negotiate for him! PLEASE!Gertrude's acided tongue has never entertained me, as realistically no one would put up with the verbal abuse heaped on throughout the years.

Cause the only good songs on any of there albums are typically the singles. Stacie's lyrics are uplifting, but never cheesy. The beats are too hot! She sounds nothing like a 14yr old.

This is a great song with an awesome message. \\"O O Baby\\" is a really fun song with a good beat. My personal favorite on the album is \\"Dear Friend,\\" the final song on the CD, which Stacie wrote herself.

Much like his early work (Into the Purple Valley, Boomer's Story, etc.), this song cycle recreates the dust bowl era in modern sonic terms and musical language. It combines folk, jazz, blues, and protest songs into a charming, intelligent and entertaining mixture. If you are a fan of classic American music and clever storytelling, then this is the CD for you. It's the aural equivalent of some of Steinbeck's novels (\`The Grapes of Wrath' and \`Travels With Charlie' come to mind), crossed with \`The Wind in the Willows'. That may sound like an odd mixture, but the results are wonderful.As in the best American folk music of the era Cooder is recreating, these songs are political motivated, socially aware and purposefully accessible to a wide group of people. His take on this form would do Woody Guthrie proud. This is the best musical purchase I've made in quite a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ry Cooder","review":"As an avid music fan with an abiding interest in the origins of popular music, I was again astounded by Ry Cooders ability to depict graphically the mood and sounds of the 30's.

My Name Is Buddy is only available on import in Australia and not for general release so I am proud to have my copy included in my collection.

Buddy and his friends journey across a dusty and violent America and try to find work. The pictures on the story book are priceless.

It does make my skin feel soft, and the scent isn't too heavy. For a similar price,though, I think I prefer the Olay Pro-X or Regenerist line. Primary reason?

I don't understand it and I guess I never will. The bottomline is--> if you tend to like neutral, tepid music (ie background music)--> this will be fine. Otherwise, skip this effort via Larry and pray that he comes back to life and puts out a good album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should put his talent to better use....","review":"Larry Carlton is one fine guitarist, and fails to show off his talent in this latest release.

Mr. Carlton's latest effort is so lackluster and unimaginative that I frankly can't believe it! He has been a wonderful player over the years and my library is full of his work. This album appears to be dedicated to the proposition that a raised pulse is risky. It is almost a forced melancholy. Riffs are dull and the whole work seems stifled by a desire to be background music to a car ad or something. What a drag!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What's with all the complaining?","review":"Ok, after reading some of the reviews here, I have a few things to get off my chest. To you guys who panned this release because Larry isn't 'shredding' like he did 15 or 20 or 25 years ago - please note that Larry is growing up, you should take notes. If you want crunchy riffs and monstrous dexterity, go see Steve Vai or Joe Satriani. Larry's playing has matured into a warm sound that envelops like a 10 year old Cabernet or the arms of a familiar lover. Guys like Peter White could take a lesson here and there. And the nicest thing is the use of all REAL instruments, no annoying drum machines.With that said I have one beef about this release. Larry, and all other purveyors of 'smooth jazz', please take note: NO MORE COVERS, NO MORE COVERS, NO MORE COVERS. It reminds me too much of Muzak, ok? That's why you don't get 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Larry's Careful New Album","review":"I've been a fan of Larry Carlton for quite some time, and I still listen to the \\"Sleepwalk\\" album and find it to be just as vibrant now as when it came out. Larry has always been a tasteful player but with just a bit of edge to make things interesting. This new album sounds much too carefully drawn. The guitar is too far down in the mix and Larry seems to be playing session man on his own album. The 2 selections with vocals don't really add anything for anyone looking for Larry Carlton. I hope his next album finds him reaching a bit and taking some chances."},{"rating":"1","title":"The obligatory contractual album","review":"It is unbelievable that Larry Carlton could churn out such an album that is bereft of ideas and imagination.This album has plenty of sound but no music; sort of \\"talk a lot but say nothing\\". The performance is uninspired and lifeless and the music (I mean sound) is dreadfully tedious. The only good thing that I can say about this album is that it has a great album cover and excellent sound for testing hi-fi systems. But, I'm sure we Larry carlton fans do not buy his albums for such things. If there is one Larry Carlton album that you should avoid, this is the one. I can't think of any other album he has done which is as bad as this one. If you expect some magical moments like we always use to when we listen to some of his other albums, forget it.The next time I see Paul Brown's name on Larry's new album, I'll pass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chrysler/Blower","review":"This product is exactly what is pictured and fit perfectly.

The director thinks that he is being morally ambiguous by presenting Bardem as a villain who rapes and plunders all form of human decency but actually he is being silly. The film never knows if it is being a slasher film or a comedy, but by the end, who really cares as long as this disaster is over?...."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Piece of Trash","review":"This is the worst Bardem-Perez movie that I have seen.

He is also very underated as an artist. Your Saving Grace is no exception. The title track is heavy with emotion and while not writen by Miller, shows off the talent of Tim Davis who was the backbone of the early stuff. The forcefull lovesong \\"Little Girl\\" and the civil rights motif \\"Don't you let nobody\\" are solid rock tracks with a hint of blues and a lot of attitude. \\"Baby's House\\" shows off the piano skills of Nicky Hopkins as well as Miller's strength as a vocalist. If you have Miller's box set you are missing out on the full version of this awesome song. \\"Motherless Children\\" has a blues twing and a solid emotional base that makes it a classic. While the album is short, it is a good buy. For the Miller enthusist it is well worth it.

I was also intrigued by all the body-snatchers and read more about them .

By doing this she betrays her uncle's trust and loses her friend Annie. Annie, in Emily's eyes, has grown cold and heartless since they found evidence that her mother was involved with President Lincoln's assassnation. But since this is after the civil war they wouldn't hang a woman, would they? I thought this book was very discriptive and mysterious, so in my eyes it was a good book.

It is worth reading, whether you buy it or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark is right!","review":"A fan of Rinaldi, I was looking forward to reading this book. The original plot was set up well, but as I read on it became more gruesome and frightening with every page. Its title says it all: the book is just plain dark.

Plus, the players involved are quite good. This book could be useful for helping a beginner (to jazz) develop feel, at least in playing melodies.However, the flaws are pretty severe. Most songs have only 1 chorus of improvisation, some less. On \\"Harlem Nocturne\\" and \\"Desafinado\\", the solos are less than 12 bars TOTAL. Next, some arrangements are poor. \\"A Night In Tunisia\\" does not include the interlude before the break. \\"Harlem Nocturne\\" does not include the interval pattern at the end of the bridge.Again, this title might have a little value for a beginning jazz player to follow the melodies in an appropriate style. I can't recommend this to anyone else. There are better play-alongs out there.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor!","review":"I bought this to listen to a sax play better than me. No sax playing!

The characters, mostly Bess, were somewhat superficial and shallow, but this got better as the book progressed. As far as I am concerned, the only problem was the author's tendency to write page-long narratives of Bess's slightly maundering thoughts, which were fairly uninteresting and repetitive. But, as I said, it got much better by the end, and the final conclusion was very emotionally moving (I cried), even though anyone who's read Alfred Noyes' \\"The Highwayman\\" knew what would happen.The author is excellent at writing dark, emotional endings, and she used this ability to the full in this book. While there are the aforementioned problems, it's most definitely a page-turner, and if you like \\"The Highwayman\\" at all, you're pretty much guaranteed to like \\"Watch by Moonlight\\". It's not the sort of book you keep under your pillow and memorize, but it's a very good read even the second and third time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Necessity for any Lovebird Owner","review":"Do not purchase a Lovebird until you read this book! This book is filled with important information. There is so much that I would have been completely ignorant to if I had not purchased this book.

This book talks about things you would never think of, it is truly a wonderful and informative book. You can tell that the author loves lovebirds, and cares for their well-being. I am so impressed with this book, that if I decide to get another bird one day, I will turn to the same collection.

It goes over feeding, health, and all the other things a bird would need. It doesnt talk about breeding though. It goes over the different species which is nice..

The install was pretty simple, and then we downloaded the drivers. The PC recognized it fine, and recognized my ireless signal, but for some reason, the computer didn't recognize the wireless internet it was providing. We were unable to figure out why. About a week went by of fiddling with different things, like disabling the ethernet card, on the hypothesis that it was still somehow trying to draw internet from that, but even that didn't work. Finally, my brother found some way to install new drivers for the PCI card. After he did this, it worked fine.

It is faster than my brand new Dell that I got last year. I am recommending it to my parents who bought similar surplus computers after seeing how fast the internet was on this computer.

The interface of the software is also good. However, the cable connecting the antenna and the card is too short, making it difficult and often impossible to find a good location for the antenna to have stable strong signal. This is especially true if the PC is located under a desk. The cable is too short for the antenna to reach the desk. My desk has metal legs, which may interfere with the wireless signals. I used this card for a year and was often irritated by the need for tweaking the position of antenna to get stable signal. Since PCs are not to be moved around, if possible, installing a network cable will be a far better solution than wireless. I finally bought an RJ45 crimper, connectors, and cat5e bulk cable (for about $80 total) to connect several rooms to my router.

I saw some users complain about the short antenna. Yes it is pretty short but long enough to get on top of the computer and that alone can make whole lot of difference.

All you can do is click on the small state map and hope it is near the town you are looking for. If you know the trail name then it is OK.

The tactile feel of the product sucks. The buttons should click or at least depress nicely.2. Murky, hard to read numbers. Even when I push down all the way some numbers are still barely legible and I wonder if my daughter will be able to depress the buttons all the way.3. Some of the math is wrong! 1 + 2 = 3? 2 + 2 = 3? This isn't exactly advanced vector calculus and it's THE ONLY THING this product is supposed to do. At least do it right.

At times he shows us his humor - not very funny, but the most readable part of the book.He spends too much time bashing C and C++. (Does he think it makes him look smart?) I want to learn Java, not compare it to other languages and think how great I am for using it (like he does). One has to know C++ to understand what he's saying.

It goes too fast over topics that should be covered in more depth, lacks examples, mentions concepts never explained before, and the teaching style is horrible. If you want a thorough introduction to Java, with plenty of examples, and a well-organized method of teaching, do not buy this book, instead get \\"Beginning Java 2\\" by Ivor Horton. \\"Just Java\\" seems like was written to simply let you know that the language exists and it has this and this feature, but it doesn't teach how to use them.

After reading other books and references I found that explanation in this book about streams character-based and byte-based is totally confused and mixed, there is no explanation about high level or low level streams and everything is so confused if you have not done anything with Java. Other subject is Exceptions, how come 10 pages of text (with listing examples) is going to explain exceptions, just showing a chart of the class is not enough.

The best example they have is displaying a jpeg file extracted from a jar file. When am I ever going use that? Try putting together an useful applet for your web page from reading that chapter -- I know I couldn't. Fragmentation and lack of good examples occur through much of the book.Don't be fooled.

Only after reading this book, I understand a lot of authors either don't know what they are talking about or don't really make an effort to make their books useful. Mr. Linden knows exactly what he talks about and make it as simple as possible to understand. Einstein used to say that everything should be as simple as possible but not simpler. Mr. Linden has achieved that. If there were an award for writing good programming book, he certainly deserves one. Thank you Mr. Linden for writing such an excellent book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Java 2","review":"Excellent book, especially for those who have some knowledge of Java.I found the way the author explains topics very thrilling.

The examples are simple and easy to follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as his book \\"Deep C Secrets\\"","review":"I believe Peter Van Linden is one of the best authors out there, and his book titled \\"Deep C Secrets\\" is one of my favorite. However, this book doesn't quite live up to the standard set by his previous books. There's a lot to cover in Java 2, so I'll cut him some slack. Some topics are given a topical treatment e.g. the difference between package, protected and private scope was poorly explained. On the other hand, his explanations on threads are one of the best - especially the diagrams.

It is mostly a comparison of C/C++ programming to Java, heavy on the C part. But that is not the only problem. The author's writing style is more aimed at puffing up his own image than simple exposition of the subject. On page 91 he states, \\"In 1993, I coined the term 'Bubbabyte' to describe 2^64 bytes. Just as 2^10 bytes is a kilobyte, [...] so 2^64 is a Bubbabyte.\\" He should have coined the term 'BubbaBrain' to describe himself. A much better book is \\"Core Java, Vol 1\\", by Cay S.

As a student that has studied a few other languages, including OOP languages, I felt that this was the least helpful of all starting books that I've picked up. The code examples do not give you any inkling of how a real Java program may be used. The features of the Java language are introduced without explaining why they are needed and how they are actually used in real programs.

Trust me. Unless you have already read another book on Java, you will have a hard time understanding it. The examples are fragmented and never complete. The author assumes that you know Java already and did not even bother to provide examples for many of the concepts. This may be a good book for intermediate level JAVA programmers, but it is definitely not for beginners. If I didn't know C++ at all, I would have thrown this book into the trash can the first day I read it.

It gives you half baked ideas, and keeps them that way. Before a concept is fully grasped, the author goes on to say something else in an equally vague manner. If you can find even one single concept clearly explained in this book, you are lucky.Bottomline: This book is great for you if your ambition is to drop a few heavy-sounding technical terms in a gathering of programmers who are not so comfortable with Java.

I'm not sure why they did that, especially since the reverse of the cover is the first page of the book. The rest of the pages (and back cover) are all thicker than even the sturdiest boardbook.

Well, I brought them home with low expectations, and I am not saying that she doesn't still have accidents, but I am amazed at how well she is responding to them! Maybe 75% of the time she seeks out the puppy pad on her own accord and uses it. I am about to run out; so I might buy regular pads and see if there is a difference.

The Tozer quotes are good, of course, but they are much better read in their context. The compiler's have seen a way to make a quick buck on Tozer's popularity and the page titles are crass, tasteless and irrelevant. The Bible verses that are supposed to associate with each quote bear little relevance, and add nothing to the quote. This is a waste of money at any price! We find on the back that this booklet is part of a series. Others in the series include Moody, Wesley, Luther, and ... Larry Burkett (whoever HE is!) Please save your money and time.

It's abridged -- the packaging doesn't make this clear; it's in fine print on the back.

My advice is have a copy of the print version, and listen to this one in the car or at bedtime, knowing it isn't complete.

I would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Sherlock Holmes -- And That's Saying Plenty!","review":"I have read and enjoyed many a good Sherlock Holmes story (e.g. \\"The Red-Headed League\\" is a winner), but at the very top of the book stack I would place \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\". Who could ever forget the atmosphere that Arthur Conan Doyle evokes by his use of those misty moors!In teaching English (Literature) to a class of 7th & 8th grade boys, I was at first a bit hesitant to introduce this novel as our text. Would a group of squirrelly junior high boys find anything of interest in a book written in 1901? Answer: I needn't have worried. They loved it (and so did I)! The fog from the moors drifted right into our classroom.First-rate mystery tale with one of the most famous fictional characters ever created. ENJOY!

This is probably the best known of all of the Sherlock Holmes stories and it it really deserves it's classic status. It is a gripping tale mixing crime investigation with a touch of the supernatural and is after 100 years still a page-turner. Arthur Conan Doyle helped start a genre that continues to entertain as evidenced by the countless crime novels and detective shows on TV. Despite the potential overexposure Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson still seem relevant and the deductive reasoning Holmes employs to solve the mystery of the Hound Of The Baskervilles is so entertaining that I read this in one day, unable to put it aside. Crime solving raised to a high art form never gets old."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lasts a Lifetime","review":"Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES is one of the best.

I'm so glad my English teacher assigned this to read (I wrote my paper on the male only space Doyle created, not megatively or anything). The book was pretty creepy at times, shocking! I was never bored, but then again it was so short. I loved the legend of the hound mystery and all of Holmes' deductions to solve the crime. Good times."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hound of the Baskervilles","review":"The Hound of the Baskervilles was assigned as a high school summer reading selection. We ordered the book on CD, which made the assignment somewhat entertaining and more easily accomplished given the length and tone of the book. The book itself is, of course, a \\"classic\\" Sherlock Holmes murder mystery. However, by todays standards, the mystery is rather tame and, in my opinion, the writing style is cumbersome for young people. The CD is delightfuly read/performed and I highly recommend the CD vs. the written text."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top Rate Holmes..........","review":"Ah, to settle in with Hound of the Baskervilles was pure delight. I had read this many years ago in an almost obsessive pursuit of reading all things Sherlock Holmes and have only recently taken up my obsession again with the wonderful series by Laurie R. King featuring Sherlock Holmes and Mary Russell. I digress, back to Hound of the Baskervilles. One of the best mysteries in the series. What more could you ask for? A spookylegend about a gruesome phantom dog, murder most foul, the English moor and an ancient creepy mansion. In this story, Dr. Watson has never been more delightful as Holmes' foil and confidant. The mystery evolves to an exiting climax which leaves the reader fufilled but wanting to get their hands on the next Holmes case. Well done!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Hound of the Baskervilles","review":"This is a classic mystery by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Unfortunately, this free version lacks several sections vital to solving the mystery.

These omissions render this version useless, and force me to delete it from my library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing substantial passages on Kindle version","review":"I would give this Sherlock Holmes story 5 stars, the low rating is due to the poor Kindle formatting.

Also I like this book because it's got non-other than Shelock Holmes the greatest detective in book history.In the beginning it does get intresting. But like I said before 14 or more pages in a chapter. Trying to find out the mystery is the best part.I'll pick characters because the characters are weird. The cool ones are Sherlcok Holmes and Dr. Watson. But then you get weird ones that Sherlock Holmes thinks are the suspects.

I really felt for Watson, who did not come across as the dumb, stumbling sidekick. I had a hard time slogging through the book, and it didn't make me want to pick up any more Holmes anytime soon.

I would not recomend reading the book. I found it very dry and hard to read. He uses textbook-like discription and his 1850's English language conflicts with the 2000's american language. The first 50 pages are rather boring and unimportant to the rest of the story. The book only starts to get some what interesting after that. There wasn't much of a twist in the ending beyond telling you who was responible for the crime.

Deliberate, never rushed and always a gentleman.The story is carefully woven and the presentation of the characters by Timson is masterful. I've listened to it over several times and each time I appreciate a little more the complexity and the detail. The Musical interludes are brief and sparse, but definitely compliment. If you like Sherlock Holmes, Timson is the right reader for the job.

It's more or less readable, but the frequency of errors is just inexcusable... even if it is less than a dollar. There are random breaks in mid-paragraph and mid-sentence (random meaning there is no apparent reason for it; they actually show up pretty consistently), missing words at the start of chapters or paragraphs, and several typos (typos that don't exist in the print version I also bought).The story itself is an easy 5 stars.

But there are something about this ring and it's center stone that i think i should let other buyers know in advance. I highly doubt the material is CZ(Cubic Zirconia). Through carefully observing under the x30 jewelers scope, the refractive index of the center stone seems to be very low, about 1.6, which is very close to glass but not CZ. Typically, a CZ has a refractive index around 2.15. And diamond is 2.4. For those who does not know what i was talking about, let's put it this way: The center stone does not sparkle at all and it looks cloudy...I guess i wont return it since it is very cheap..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning!","review":"I plan on taking some pictures of this ring because the one picture for the description is beautiful but leaves a lot to the imagination.The blue isn't as green as the picture shows, and it's a little lighter, but it's otherwise very close to the color shown. It's a very beautiful ring! The silver is stunningly bright and shiny. Size is perfect. The stone is very high, though, which is hard to tell from the picture. But I've never had a solitaire ring with a rock this big, so I bet that it has to be this tall.All in all, it's an absolutely beautiful ring, especially considering the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Where is the Jazz?\\"","review":"I keep reading the reviews here touting this disc for it's \\"jazziness\\".

I finally take showers with clean non poisonous water and gases and I'm thrilled. I also got a counter top water filter and its wonderful also since I had been purchasing bottled water before that. Just note that after a while the shower head will start to not remove the chlorine as much so you have to start thinking of replacing it but its a gradual process depending on how often the shower is used and to be expected, so I order a replacement and hold onto it until I feel its ready to change out."},{"rating":"2","title":"great shower filter","review":"It was easy to install, and does a great job of removing the chlorine/chlorine smell from my water.

The first time I used it I saw a considerable difference in the texture of my skin and hair. I was so pleased to find out there was a replacement cartridge available for less than half the price of the whole filter. What I don't like about this product is that it leaks. Even after several attempts to reinstall it, it still leaked. Finally, we patched it up with some type of shower tape. And guess what: it still leaks.So I would give five stars for the whole filter but not for the replacement product although it does such a good job of removing chlorine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money on this one!","review":"While this DVD will, in fact, be playable on a computer or a Region 1 player, the image quality is very poor.

Joanne Dru is far superior in a similar type of role in the follow-up \\"She Wore a Yellow Ribbon.\\" The screenplay to \\"Fort Apache\\" could have been tightened up dropping about 10 minutes and giving it a more streamlined result. \\"She Wore a Yellow Ribbon\\" is a superior film because of a better handled script. Having said that, \\"Fort Apache\\" is still very entertaining. Its strength is in its opposing characters played by Henry Fonda and John Wayne. It's easy to focus on Fonda's martinet of a commander, but Wayne is excellent in his somewhat secondary role. He's almost an observer on equal footing with the supporting players and that generosity pays off with a very likeable, heroic character.

For example, the engineering and hard work it was to build the roadbeds for the trains over mountain passes even before many of the roads were built. Some of the routes followed rivers or covered wagon trails. This video series sure beats a lot of the programming coming to my TV.

Many couples recall when they were first dating and it seemed that they were constantly touching each other. At time wears on that touching becomes less and less and sexual activity also declines. Author Darcy Cole discusses physiological and psychological factors in this change and how to get back the sexual fire. She notes that it takes very little to get men in the mood for sexual relations but men don't generally understand what is required to get a woman in the mood. This book details the various factors involved and how they work together to get a woman interested in sex. \\"Seduce Me\\" is very detailed in its descriptions and provides a wealth of information for those who want to understand the process of female seduction. While many parents would have a big problem with this book being included in a high school library, it is a very appropriate book for those wanting to increase their partner's sexual desire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was disappointed after reading this book.

The title cut \\"Computer Games\\" is as crazy as the artist. LOL. However, this album has a Funkadelic overtone. With musicians like Bootsy, Bernie, Mike, Junie, Eddie Hazel, Garry Shider and ect ect. it's worth buying. I think this is the best George Clinton album of all time. It's a R&B; Clssid and for the life of me I don't understand why it did not make the national top 40. Even the title cut went to 80 something on the charts. Go figure.

Computer Games showcases his talent for squeezing archetypal beats and riffs out of his ever-changing cadre of musicians. Even though it was released in 1982, it still feels as fresh as tomorrow's flavor du jour. Try to keep from playing \\"Where did I hear that sampled?\\" and just let the funk wash you up and away to Clinton's psychedelic, sexed-up Disneyland.

I enjoy the book, but this ugly, drawn-out thing bored me to tears; this production proves how important it is to *adapt* a book to the screen, rather than pedantically act it out scene-by-scene, word-by-word.The sets are bad, the sound is worse, and I've seen better-looking costumes at high school productions.I enjoyed Donald Eccles as Mr. Woodhouse, Fiona Walker as Mrs. Elton, and Debbie Bowen as Harriet Smith, but loathed Doran Godwin as Emma. Emma is supposed to be 21 and beautiful, not 31 and weird looking. I know that that sounds a bit shallow, but movies are a visual medium, and poor Godwin has a long, scrawny chicken neck and is slightly pop-eyed. She just creeped me out.Austen fans should probably watch it, just so they can say that they watched it, but I recommend borrowing it rather than paying money for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"You will be rewarded if you stick with it","review":"The production values of this early 1970's BBC adaptation are interesting to see regardless of the show itself. The style and differences between its production and what a modern day version would be like is striking. Almost entirely shot in a studio with very little accompanying music make this version almost a stage adaptation. Emma's father is quite brilliantly portrayed and is very amusing. The first episode is rather dull if truth be told but the remaining five episodes more than make up for this opening. In fact I would have given this five stars if the first episode was as good as the rest. Well worth spending the money to enjoy this classic adaptation of Emma."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Emma ever","review":"Doran is the worst Emma ever. She's completely cold and looks like a preying mantis. This was distracting because I kept expecting her to rip off Mr. Knightley's head and eat it. There is no chemistry at all between Emma and Mr. Knightley in this film. This version was very close to the book, and many of the other actors are quite good, so it's a shame about Doran. Watch A&E's Emma instead, with Kate Beckinsale. This version is not be as true to the book, but Kate does a much better job of portraying Emma's complexities than does Doran or Gwyneth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Emma as a deer in headlights!","review":"While this version of Emma is probably the most faithful to the book, the Emma we get is a woman whose face is frozen in what seems to be a perpetual startled stare. What a distraction every time she was on screen. And Harriet Smith was a cowering country bumpkin who was simpering and cloyingly annoying...ugh!

At this point, I should have stopped the movie, which went downhill until the end, which was the most disturbing scene.

It wasn't and it isn't. And yet, Barbieri's score and Storaro's cinematography are still a delight to both ear and eye (although you can see the camera's reflection on a window pane at the last scene!).Regarding sex, there's not much to be said. In fact, there was a lot said and little to be seen. Brando gives \\"the performance of a lifetime\\", which in his case, after seeing \\"Superman\\", is probably true.

The dialogue is simply absurd. Who talks like this? The relationship between Brando and the young French girl is very S&M;, but in my opinion, these themes were explored better and more attractively in \\"9 1/2 Weeks\\". If you're looking for nudity and graphic sex, you won't find that here either. The sex scenes are few and far between, and when they do occur your reaction will most likely be \\"OH!

Virtually every aspect of the film is risible. In fact, you can probably enjoy it purely for its innumerable unintentioned laughs. Marlon Brando gives what can only be described as one of the messiest and shameful performances that any formerly great actor could conceive (worse even than Vito Corleone or Kurtz). And clever Bertolucci shovels on enough pretentious artiness and pseudo-eroticism to steam up an academic's glasses. Everyone else will merely catch themselves yawning most of the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be A Dear And Pass The Butter Please!!!","review":"In this movie we see Malon Brando as an ageing oversexed man who embarks on a liason with a young woman played by Maria Schieder. That is about the whole plot and storyline for this movie. In this film Mr. Brando finds a very inventive use for butter which does not involve making a sandwich. He is once said to have remarked that \\"acting is a bum's life\\" so if you want to see a bum at work I suggest you watch this movie. I give this film 5 stars because Maria Schnieder thankfully went into movie obscurity after making his film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Last Tango In Paris","review":"I though the film was terrible.

It still seems like an indulgent, boring mess. Yes, Brando can act.Yes, Maria Schneider has a fantastic 20-year old body. What does it all add up to? Nothing! A 2 hour waste of time. A movie with a totally emoty story and emotional core. I like a lot of stufffrom the late '60s and early '70s, but if sitting through tedium like this in the name of art was indicative of the era - thankGod we've moved on.

That, in my view, is the beautey of this film: Nobody is for sure, yet most everyone knows that it's a classic.Brando gives the performance of a lifetime. For those who want to know what real acting is, I recommend they see the scene with Brando and his dead wife's body. It's majestic, to say the least.In this film, Brando lets himself go and seems to let the viewer inside his mind - if not soul.The musical score is passionate, lustful, erotic and majestic all at once. It's wonderful.Bertulluci was creating a sure winner here when he was directing. He shows what a talented director he truly is.I advise anyone to see this film 3 or 4 times. With each viewing, the viewer will get more of an insight into the mind of one terribly lonely man. It's a masterpiece!"},{"rating":"1","title":"trash masquerading as art","review":"Don't waste your precicous time on this pretentious tripe. The acting is self-conciously artsy and overwrought.

Brando gives on of his best performances (see also Streetcar Named Desire, On the Waterfront, The Godfather and Apocalypse Now). Without Brando this film would have been utterly boring. It's the kind of film you have to watch a few times in order to make sense of everything. The film just starts and you have to put the pieces together--and character motivation is rather difficult to figure out. In fact, although this film is a good film, it's confusing as to why the characters do what they do. If you love Brando and Bertolucci, I'd recommend seeing this film. If you want to learn technique and style of acting--this is a very good film. I don't think we'll see another actor like Brando who gives memorable performances such as he does in this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth seeing","review":"While this is not exactly the great movie it's reputation suggests, it comes close. It is a must-see for Brando fans, in particular. It is hard to seperate his performance from the movie itself - he is the movie; the director intended it to be that way. Almost all the details of Brando's character were modeled after him, which makes it all the more facinating. Gato Barbieri's music is also great, making the movie even more effective."},{"rating":"1","title":"A movie that redefines tedium","review":"Feeble, inarticulate and struggling to be deep without knowing what it wants to be deep about.

I've seen many films that could fit this description such as \\"Happiness\\" by Todd Solondz and \\"Romance\\" by Catherine Breillat, but unlike those films, I failed to see a point in this one.The sex scenes were extremely grotesque in their graphic and perverse nature, especially the scene involving sodomy.I can't say I would reccommend this film to anyone. The reason that it gets 2 stars out of 5 is because I think Marlon Brando was very convincing and entertaining, I just failed to see the point in this film as a whole and therefore I cannot give it a good rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing of value","review":"It will make me unpopular to say this, as if I am not already wildly unpopular, but this was a terrible and totally overrated movie. In light of Marlon Brando's semi-recent death I thought it high time to see some of his best known works. Cited as a classic in many cases, at least for being raunchier than anything else at the time of its release, this film was flat, left me dazed, it was useless. I hated it. It was strange, mumbling, sleazy. The acting-particularly from Maria Schneider-if you could call it acting, anyway-was mediocre at best. Where's the story? This just strikes me as a film made at the time to push the envelope of what was considered \\"art\\" and \\"decent\\".

Its not like me to get amneisia about a film, especially if it is trully a great work of art.

Its amazing how many people say how great this film is and Brando, but to me he was just a mumbling psycho that terrized a young woman.

If you are watching it to see the controversial steamy sex scenes, you'll be disappointed. There is nothing erotic here. It's a film devoid of emotion or excitement. It's mind-numbing and boring. It may have been praised at the time it was first released, but it has not aged well. Surprising that it was ever determined to be a film with any value even when first released. Pointless film with characters that don't seem to have any direction in their lives and don't seem to care about anything important. The viewer doesn't care either.

Talk about No Exit.I guess some of you will like this film but unless you're one of those bleeding heart, artsy farsty people I suggest you save yourself the pain of trying to watch this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointing","review":"This movie fails horribly at living up to its reviews. They seem to be based solely on technical merit; it is indeed shot well. Unfortunately, that does not make it worth watching; the plot is lacking, the sex alternates between disappointing and disturbing, and the characters are despicable. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 stars out of 4","review":"The Bottom Line:Why Bertolucci thought it was a good idea to cut away from Brando and Schneider in order to focus on the latter's boring boyfriend I'll never know, but when Last Tango in Paris focuses on the main couple (and Brando in particular) it's a powerful, if somewhat formless, film that is no less candid and raw than it was 30 years ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Materpiece that needs an overhall","review":"faded color and millions of artifacts are only some of the problems this DVD. Hopefully it will be remastered soon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing, Despicable and Down-right Disgusting","review":"Marlon Brando was one of the most overrated actors of all time. Anyone who knows about his personal life and still thinks he was a respectable person should have their head examined. The fact that he was comfortable with this awful role says enough about the kind of man he was. Everything he said and did in this movie (especially to the unprincipled French tramp) was too savage, sick and pathetic for words and his fate at the end was much-deserved but didn't come soon enough. The story and soundtrack couldn't even come close to saving this trash either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite possibly the worst movie in cinematic history","review":"Finally saw the much-vaunted Last Tango in Paris. On the DVD case, a reviewer squeals: \\"The most erotically powerful movie ever made!\\" Yes, oh, so erotic. Marlon Brando uses a stick of BUTTER to prepare his girlfriend for... well, let your imagination soar. Its clear to me that every single reviewer who gave a good review must've been paid off handsomely. To me, words like \\"vacant\\", \\"nihilistic\\", \\"empty\\", instantly and effortlessly leap to mind. Quite possibly, the most over-damn-hyped, contentless, worthless film in cinematic history. I'm appalled beyond words."},{"rating":"1","title":"what's the big deal?","review":"This has to be the most overrated movie ever made. Even by 1970's standards, I don't see what all the hoopla is about. Marlon Brando is just his usual brooding self. The girl is extremely beautiful, but even if she was naked through the entire movie, I cannot understand why anyone considers this a cinema masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bindings, good commentaries","review":"We all know about Shakespeare, so a review of his writing is not required. However, I would like to say that the Everyman's Library series are worth getting. Unlike omnibus editions (such as the Riverside Shakespeare), these are actually portable so you don't need a table to hold them up while you are reading. The Everyman's Library series have good hardbindings, are conveniently sized to carry around, and have illuminating and extensive introductions. The typeface used is old, but the letters are large and easily readable (something that is a concern with some other editions).Tragedies, Volume 2 contains: Titus Andronicus; Troilus and Cressida; Julius Ceaser; Anthony and Cleopatra; Timon of Athens; Coriolanus"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle Edition Tragedies Without Notes","review":"I have greatly enjoyed reading the hard cover Everyman's edition of Shakespeare's Comedies, Tragedies and Romances. The hard cover books, which come in multiple volumes, are portable, have a nice type face, have excellent explanatory notes and excellent introductory essays about the plays. I strongly recommend this edition for anyone who is not already familiar with Shakespeare's plays.I recently bought a Kindle edition of three tragedies. The type face is very good but there are no notes or essays whatsoever. I would not recommend any of the Kindle editions that I have seen for anyone who is not already fully conversant with Shakespeare's language. Many words have changed meaning significantly over time and a modern dictionary is only modestly helpful.It would be great if Amazon could get the Everyman's edition formatted for the Kindle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great composition","review":"Everybody knows the tale of Romeo and Juliet, but reading the real, written work is another world. It is a different way to think of the story you know. I bought this compilation to read all of Shakespeare's works and it is truly great. One thing I'd advise is that you know how to read scripts. This book is written as Shakespeare wrote his plays. Though, every work is prefaced with the characters names and role they play, it can still be a bit difficult to get through because of the way it's written.Jul. Then, window let day in and let life out.Rom.Farewell, farewell! one kiss and I'll descend.[descendsJul.Art thou gone so? my lord, my love, my friend!It can become a bit much.I gave it four stars because it has such small font: around 8 or 9 px font you'd find on MS word."},{"rating":"2","title":"An heirloom for every American","review":"As the Library of Congress marks our country's history as the U.S.'s continual time capsule; this tome offers a glance into her walls.

I was very suprised when I first listened to this album. To find Sufist teachings hidden in a funk/house album, was really a new thing. Mercan Dede, did not only use the background and rythm from Sufi Music but also the teachings. Especially the song \\"Mevlana Celaleddin Rumi\\", named after the famous Persian Sufi, is a 5 Star song of the album. Without using words Mercan Dede manages to show that life is a circle. \\"Walking on the Red Sea\\", is a good example of how Mercan Dede is succesful in mixing Sufi Rythm with other backgrounds. In my opinion these points helps this album become universal and reach audiences far beyond any other etnic funk album would do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting Action and Adventure","review":"I came upon this book by chance, and was overwhelmingly surprised. It's been years since I read a historical novel that was so well written. But do yourself a favor, read Into the Wilderness first. I found myself wondering so much about references to things that happened in the first book that I just had to search for it to read. And I wasn't disappointed. But I do actually think Dawn on a Distant Shore is better written. There's so much action, every time you think a matter is resolved, another one pops up right on its heels. It's like Elizabeth can never catch a break. I am now eagerly awaiting the paperback printing of Lake in The Clouds. I plan to pass these books on as a set, to anyone I know who is into historical novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast paced sequel, great additon to wilderness series!","review":"This sequel to Into the Wilderness was fast paced and adventurous, but somewhow found time for us readers to see a bit more of the characters.

It's a delight!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Into the Wilderness It's NOT","review":"I picked up Into the Wilderness by accident and thought it was one of the best books I'd read. I counted the days til Dawn on a Distant Shore was released but found it to be, at best, disappointing. Truth be told, I found the story farfetched, the characters(who seemed so alive in Into the Wilderness) flat and, in some instances, just plain unlikeable, and the sea voyage boring. Absolutely nothing in this book caught my interest . . . strange, because I found the first book captivating both in terms of the developing storyline between Elizabeth and Nathanial and the book's historical context. I still look forward to the next installment, primarily because it's set back in Hidden Wolf where this story belongs, but I won't be counting the days until its release and I won't invest in a hardback edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great series","review":"It can be a little slow at times but I have enjoyed this series and fallen in love with many of the characters.

I only discovered her this year. - Fran"},{"rating":"2","title":"DDS...a roller coaster ride!","review":"This book is different from Into The Wilderness, but that doesn't detract from it's worth! From the beginning to the end, the pace is breathless, wild and hectic. This is a chase novel, through and through. Ms. Donati keeps the emotions running high as we travel from New York to Canada to Scotland and the tension doesn't let up for a minute. She is able to convey the emotions and nuances of family ties and keep us interested in her characters. She comes up with a spectacular new villain and some protagonists that end up very sympathetically. While I admit I missed Hidden Wolf and the characters there, Ms. Donati has left many dangling threads that are sure to be dealt with in her third novel in the series and we'll see all these wonderful and not so wonderful people again. I really liked this book. I read it one sitting...long into the night!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"I found \\"Dawn on a Distant Shore\\" to be colorful and also a look into how life was in the late 1700's in America and Ireland.

I loved following the budding romance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth My Time","review":"I was hoping to find another series that would be similar to Diana Gabaldon's books, but I was very disappointed. I still have not found anyone who writes like Gabaldon. I'll make this short and sweet in that I do not think that Donati has developed her characters as well as she could. I wanted the story to be wrapped more around Elizabeth and Nathaniel, but instead, much of the story came from Hannah's point of view. I realize this is probably due to the fact that Hannah's character is being built for an upcoming book, but I was not interested. Elizabeth's character was developed well, but I felt in both Into the Wilderness and Dawn on a Distant Shore, that Nathaniel did not have as strong of a character and hero image as I would have liked. I just did not feel the passion between these two as I had hoped. Even the ending was very weak to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Strong 4.5 Stars","review":"This is a great sequel to Into The Wilderness, just slightly weaker. Being with these characters is delightful. Sara Donati writes smooth and forms great visuals with her choice of words. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore","review":"I was hoping that this would be a great sequel, but was very disappointed. The characters, except for Hanna did not develop at all. Nathaniel and Elizabeth had the beginning of a relationship in the first book and their characters were well developed, but they were very two dimensional in this book. That said I await the next book because I trust Ms. Donati will continue the story without destroying the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm glad I didn't spend the money on it.","review":"I got it at the library and boy am I glad I didn't waste my money by buying it, which I might have done based on Donati's first novel.

This time around, the characters bordered on boring, the plot lines forgetable and Donati's sweeping prose sadly absent. I thought this was an overall tough read. Hopefully the next one will be more of a page turner like the first one was."},{"rating":"1","title":"The story falls over","review":"The story falls over before it ever gets started. It doesn't convince me that the only course of action possible is for Nathaniel to try to rescue his father, or that any mother with the sense God gave a goose would take newborn babies on such a dangerous trip. I know Sacajawea went on a much harder trip while pregnant, but this book needed to convince me, and it didn't.The adventures and dangers are thrown at us too fasst and furiously. We are not given much chance to enjoy the peaceful spots or anticipate or fear the next obstacle. It's boring the way any laundry list of problems is boring if a reader don't care whether or not the characters get through it. Or if they don't really believe the plot in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn.","review":"I loved Into the Wilderness! This cannot be the same author. It was boring. The characters were dull and the whole book dragged. I will definitly borrow her next book from the library!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Into the Wilderness was absolutely top-notch so maybe my expectations were too high for Dawn on a Distant Shore. This story contained little action and far too much gossip. These wonderful outdoorsmen (and women) were confined to rocking in ships for 300 pages! I was as homesick for the mountains as Hannah was. I love Ms. Donati's characters but I was as uncomfortable as they were in their oversea adventure. I do hope she brings them home for the next installment. If I hadn't read the first book I would never have finished this one - the plot was too much of a stretch - but the Bonners are terrific and I had to know what happened to them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as her other books","review":"I enjoyed the rest of the series, but I found this book boring compared to the rest.

The other books in the series are much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much Better than the first","review":"This follow up to Into the Wilderness was very enjoyable. I was not too thrilled with the first book, but thought I would read the next book anyway. I was pleasantly suprised and got a better feel for the characters. I will buy the next one with interest!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but I expected more","review":"After falling in love with Nathaniel and Elizabeth in Into the Wilderness, I was thrilled to continue on with the series. Much to my dismay, this book did not live up to my expectations. Is it a coincidence that Gabaldon's Voyager and this book, both set mainly upon the high seas, were my least favorite out of each author's series? Hmmm. The only thing that kept me going was the promise of the third book Lake in The Clouds. The book is worth reading, don't get me wrong. Especially for those who continue on with a series. The Scotland thing seemed unnecessary to me. I would have been happier if they'd stayed in North America. Oh well. Artistic license."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent read!","review":"For all those Diana Gabaldon fans, Sara Donati does not disappoint. Well written and researched, Donati's books are a must read. Her characters are multi-layered and three dimentional, and the plot intricate and captivating, to say nothing of educational. Anyone reading these books will not be disappointed, but especially those with high standards. Into the Wilderness, and Dawn on a Distant Shore kept me burning the midnight oil many a night. I highly reccommend this series, for which there is a third soon to be published. If you want depth, and hate \\"fluff\\", then these books are for you.

Definately not Sara Donati's best work."},{"rating":"1","title":"A boring disappointment!","review":"Her first book was a real page turner and I couldn't wait for this one to come out. This was a sleeper. The ocean voyage went on forever. I felt like I was actually on the voyage with the voyage never ending. I couldn't wait to get of the ship myself. The story line at the castle was a pick-me-up, but you had to read several hundred pages before you got there. I was extemely disappointed in this book and the only reason I finished it was because I didn't want to see the money I spent on the book wasted. The scottish dialect was also very distracting and I had to keep reading passages over and over to get the just of it. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dawn on a Distant Shore-Sara Donati","review":"I was extremely disappointed in this sequel.

Despite the usual loudness of the rain on the fly, this was a pleasant experience. No rain got into the tent, and thanks to the ceiling vents and well designed fly, we stayed cool and happy the entire night.Easy to set up, easy to take down. Easy to shake off after a rainfall to pack up immediately.1 adult and 4 kids was no problem, everyone had PLENTY of personal space.

I purchased because I wanted that bottle that was pictured that would stand upright and not leak all over. Instead, I got a tiny tube with significantly less threadlocker than was anticipated. Toolfetch doesn't charge much for the tube, but quite a bit (almost 3x) for shipping, so you won't return it if, like me, you weren't paying close enough attention and relied on their picture to be an accurate representation of what they were shipping. Based on the fact you can't blow the picture up enough to read the printing on the bottle to confirm its volume, the marked-up then marked-down pricing and the disproportionate shipping charge, I can only conclude that this was intentional on the part of toolfetch."},{"rating":"2","title":"In a cave, but not The Cave","review":"At first look, this movie would seem like a rip off of The Cave, and does have a similar concept, but much better done. It's not often that a movie grabs your attention within the first 5 minutes, but this one does and keeps it until the end. Lots of things popping out should keep you guessing.

Every so often a film comes along that accomplishes this and 'The Descent' is a prime example. The film is a departure from the clutter of junk horror films that have been released over the past few years by not merely infiltrating you with just startle scenes. The sheer fear factor of being trapped hundreds of feet below ground with the prospect of death at every turn is simply the cornerstone of the aural terror you feel throughout most of the film.The Blu-ray presentation is immaculate from the reference quality video to the PCM 6.1 lossless audio track that is amazingly immersive.

I even had low expectations going into this. A horror movie about monsters in a cave. Geez, there's an original idea. Anyways, maybe it's because it was all about women only that women reviewers are giving it such high remarks. I don't know. Maybe the ten minutes of actual action at the end made people forget about the 90 minutes of BORE you had to sit through until that point. This movie was stupid and boring. Maybe I was not as impressed because I watched this movie the same day I watched SAW IV.

The first half of the movie is scarier than the rest, because it involves a group of six women exploring a dangerous underground cave. Being extremely claustrophobic, that alone was scary enough for me! However, then the women start being hunted by evil Gollum-like creatures who live deep within the cave, and the film takes a turn for the worse. If you're a fan of horror films, you'll probably enjoy \\"The Descent\\" because it's gruesome and relatively scary, unlike most of the ridiculous films that currently pepper this film genre. However, if you're like me and don't care much for these type of movies at all, definitely skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring movie with good Blu-ray features","review":"THE DESCENT is an ugly, boring film about six ugly, boring women with a curious mix of accents who explore a cave and are stalked and eaten by a group of Gollum wannabes. The film looks ugly and boring on Blu-ray with over staurated colors and high contrast levels. Lionsgate has packed the disc full of impressive special features which further enhance the ugly and boring nature of the film. You can watch the ugly and boring director in \\"behind the scenes\\" footage in a PIP documentary while watching the film. Loads of extra and extended scenes, interviews etc. do nothing to alleviate all the ugly boredom this film invokes.

It's basically a chick flick with mutants in it for the last 25 minutes or so. A Horror movie? Suspense? Right. I guess this is the new style of \\"horror\\" I'll stick with Halloween, The Exorcist and Texas Chainsaw Massacre.Basically, 6 young women go to the mountains and romp around together trying to help their one friend through the loss of her family, this consists of the first 50 some minutes of the movie. THEN they FINALLY go to this cave and after another 15 minutes you see what's chasing them and wanting to kill them.. The mutants are actually pretty neat but you don't see much of them as this is more like \\"Sweet Home Alabama meets The Gargoyles\\".

Dog Soldiers was OK, but Descent is by far and away superior in every way.Like the lackluster American version called - THE CAVE - the British version - The Descent - is written bettter, with less special effects. That should teach and show directors out there that special effects ain't everything. A solid plot is first. Good actors is 2nd. Special effects comes 3rd. Not the other way around.Although both movies only touch very little on the hugely sucessful, bestseller novel, The Descent, by Jeff Long, both movies could have greatly benefited if they could have done the movies much more closely to the novel. Would have cost much more, but would have been a gigantic blockbuster at the movie houses.But if you like gritty, scary movies, with a great twist at the end, then you must get this.

Instead of alternating use (having one latern lit in the lead and the others following the first person they either used glow lights or had them all on.

The gore was immense, absolutely amazing, you will do yourself a favor by picking up the unrated version of the film. This movie is beyond your typical hack n' slash horror film, the characters are so greatly fleshed out you really get a chance to know and become attached to them.

It was a predictable storyline about a bunch of young women who go into a cave, and then they predictably get stuck and have to search for another way out.Once they're stuck in the cave, you can probably guess what happens next. Odd creatures come out (who apparently can't see, and have to rely on their hearing) and attack the women, in different ways. They weren't as scary as people made them out to be. Just typical-looking monsters.A big problem I had with the Descent was that the picture was incredibly dark, because the majority of the movie takes place in a cave, so darkness is mostly all around them, except for the flashlights and whatnot. A very dark film.There were a couple moments that made me jump, such as that scene in the beginning of the film when the woman jumped out of bed and walked to the window.

The know-it-all, the one with a bad past, the cocky one, etc. The reason this is not \\"intense\\" is that you see the creatures completely, they look like naked people that are all greasy (it's not a sexy as I just put it). and even the ending... spoiler... you don't know if she sees her friend who either somehow, impossibly made it out, or she is seeing it in her head, like she was doing throughout the movie.

The cast are relative unknowns (at least to me, sorry if any of these women are household names in another country, shame on my ignorant behind) and they are all exceptional. These characters balance gritty and vulnerable so well.

It starts off with a compelling story and then ends up being a slasher flick with characters so annoying, protagonist included, that you cannot wait for them to die.

The acting, atmosphere and gore were all top notch for this genre. Some people I went with didn't even know it was a creature film. They thought one of the girls was going to go psycho in the cave and start killing them all off. Boy were they surprised. I caught the UK ending on another website, and while I prefer that one by far, the U.S. closer wasn't too shabby either. The only thing I didn't really care for were the creatures. They were a little scary at first, but once they started showing swarms of them, they lost that creepy factor. The build up to actually seeing them was so good. I enjoyed the cave diving and crawling parts as much as the creature fest to come. Plus they weren't intimidating and hard to kill like the creature in another film similar to the feel of this one, called Alien. While I enjoyed Dog Soldiers quite a bit, The Descent is a film worthy of my horror DVD collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark and Claustrophobic Horror","review":"The Descent is a horror movie that develops a plot that's original, harrowing and not for the claustrophobic or faint-of-heart. I had never seen these actresses, who here play members of a hiking group embarking on a misadventure in an unexplored cave, but I was duly impressed. Natalie Jackson Mendoza (Juno) is beautiful almost to a fault and very gifted. It would be nice to see her in prominent roles in the future.The psychological aspect of the horror in this movie keeps building tension and is intelligently handled, where a lot of things are hinted at but not spelled out for the audience, and the caves and the things that happen inside them are unexpected and disturbing.No doubt about it, this movie does justice to its genre and I daresay that even the seasoned horror fan will be affected by it in some way. It is not a movie that leaves you indifferent to the fate of the characters, and the ending is unapologetic and unrelenting (European version)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dinosaurs are back and you're lunch!","review":"Do you hear that buzz? Don't worry, it's not a swarm of killer bees. It's the buzz surrounding this highly anticipated first novel by Justin Strauss. Justin is an academically trained paleontologist, so you can be assured that he knows his dinosaur details.The book? Entirely gripping. If you like crackling, intelligent fiction, dinosaurs, and futureshock stories with twists and turns, then put on your bloody running shoes and sprint to the store to pick this up. Alternatively, whip out your credit card and get it now online!The characters are hewn from classic science fiction material and the action is first-rate. The reader will immediately notice that Strauss swings effortlessly between heart-pounding imagery and the subtleties of humanity without ham-fisted literary tactics common in the science fiction genre.Somebody should contact the movie studios about this. On second thought, they'd just screw it up. Go. Get this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Entertaining Movie","review":"I watched the China Doll movie DVD that I received from Amazon.com and thought it was very entertaining movie. The movie builds up the relationship between Capt. Brandon (Victor Mature) and Shu Jin (Li Li Hua) which leads to their marriage and having a little baby. It is sad at the end as both Shu Jin and Capt. Brandon are both killed, but it was nice to see the daughter 14 years later being met at Los Angeles Airport by Capt. Brandon's old crew. I would recommend this movie to anybody who likes movies that end up being very heartwarming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Movie","review":"I have not seen this movie since I was a young teenager and have been looking for it for so long.

It's not Academy Award stuff, just a lovely romantic romp,something to get lost in for an hour and a half.

After listening to this anemic attempt at capturing the power of a acclaimed musical portrait by using synthesized instruments, one is left to wonder why a recording company hasn't recorded this piece using a large orchestra. It just begs for the real thing. At least with a large orchestra there might be more justification to charge $23 for just 33 minutes of music. I would strongly urge classical music lovers to approach with caution if they are thinking of buying any of the other selections in this classical music series played by Alexander Jero.

That was the scariest thing about this movie. I was probably about 8 or 9 at the time. I remember watching \\"The Incredible Hulk\\" on a Friday night and the commercials came on. This face appeared on the screen and I thought it might be the show, but it wasn't. They kept zooming in on him and I got scared. From then on, every time I saw the ad, I would switch the channel or cover my eyes. And over the years, whenever I've seen the ad, I've nearly jumped out of my skin. Yeah, Fats was SCARY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"More Ham-O-Rama Theatrics From Sir Anthony","review":"Whenever anyone I know blathers on about how great an actor Sir Anthony Hopkins is, I tell them to stick this in the VCR. It's a horror movie, alright: a horror to sit through. lt's Battle of the Uncured Hams as Sir Anthony, Ann-Margret and Burgess Meredith act up a storm on a script that should have never seen the light of day. Fats the Dummy is unquestionably the best actor in this movie but regrettably has to share scenes with the aforementioned actors; if only Fats had been able to break away from Sir Anthony's arm earlier in the movie and massacred the entire cast, I'd be writing a five-star rating instead of this. If you need convincing that Hopkins' success in \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" was just a fluke and that he is indeed just another tough slice of fatty Welsh ham, watch a double feature of this and \\"Legends of the Fall\\"; Hopkins is like some Monty Python grotesque played for pathos instead of comedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take The Knife Up The Hill And Rent This Movie!","review":"forget the fact that the viewer has no clue HOW hopkins' Corky got involved with the dummy, or HOW he even got famous at all. the big deal here is Hopkin's performance. reminicent of early Peter Lorre, hopkin's descent into dementia is mesmerizing, and, as \\"Fats\\", his high pitched Brooklynese ventriloquism is absolutely chilling.Whenever other characters (i.e. Ann Margaret and Burgess Meredith) invade the screen, the movie becomes pathetic. When Hopkins and Fats the dummy are alone together, it is one of the finest spectacles ever commited to film by a single actor."},{"rating":"2","title":"MAGIC ADS WERE SCARY!","review":"Though the movie was frightening enough, it wasn't what I saw one night alone in a Poconos hotel room while my parents were out dining and dancing. What I witnessed was the thing that STILL freaks me out when I think about it. The Magic commercial. All it was was Fats the dummy reciting a demonic poem. I can still say the poem to this day. I was so scared, I could not leave the bed until my parents arrived back, hours later.I must be honest, ventriloquist dummies still scare me to death. They should totally release the commerical to video or DVD. From what I see, enough people of my age were freaked out about it and would probably LOVE to see it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deliciously disturbing ....Highly Underestimated","review":"FINALLY it comes out on dvd. This film is absolutely brilliant. Psychologically scarred me as a kid. I've never been able to think of ventriloquists or their wooden counterparts in quite the same way since.

The BluRay transfer was done very nicely and the extras were pretty good but could have been better.I really enjoyed the Dennis Alwood interview, Fats and Friends. I do wish there were new interviews with Anthony Hopkins and Ann Margret though. There is an old, archival Anthony Hopkins interview which leaves much to be desired. Though it's better than nothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A ventriloquists nightmare","review":"Magic is a timeless suspense film starring Anthony Hopkinks, Ann Margret, and the always entertaining Burgess Meredith(better known as Mic from Rocky.) The story follows an up and coming ventriloquist \\"Corky\\" and his dummy \\"fats\\" on their near rise to stardom. This is a very entertaining yet creepy film where the dummy is in control of the ventriloquist(very similar to a Twilight Zone episode.) Just watching as Corky can't go more then five minutes without speaking as fats is sheer genius. Great acting plus a very clever story make for a timeless movie, as is the case in \\"Magic\\". I definately recommend this classic if you need a change from the typical cookie cutter horror/suspense films out there now."},{"rating":"1","title":"great movie massacred by tape quality","review":"One of my all time favorite movies has been edited for television recorded extended long play, and packaged as though nothing was done to it. don't buy this tape wait for the dvd version that should be coming out soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Early Hopkins story still sends chills through viewers","review":"\\"Magic\\" showed us early on what Anthony Hopkins can do. The dummy is not exactly a Charlie McCarthy and there are parts not for the squeamish. Ann Margret has a curious role in this tale, but she does it well. Along with \\"The Bunker\\" and his over-the-top Quasimodo in the \\"Hunchback of Notre Dame\\", the viewer gets an excellent foretaste of what was to come in his Hannibal Lecter roles."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Only Dummy Is The Writer","review":"\\"Magic\\" poses the question of whether ventriloquist Corky Withers (Anthony Hopkins) and his dummy Fats are two separate entities or Fats is just an extension of Corky's twisted psyche. Alas, the answer is telegraphed too soon so whatever suspense director Richard Attenborough is trying to muster is drained away. Anthony Hopkins doesn't help matters by chewing the scenery in a performance that's neither terrifying or funny. Ann-Margret is essentially wasted by being called upon to model tight sweaters which, in retrospect, is not entirely a bad thing. Hight point of film is Burgess Meredith as Hopkins' agent. Author William Goldman should sue the screenwriter but be adapted his own book."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"He's NO Dummy. . .\\"","review":"Viewing \\"Magic\\" is when I first became aware of Anthony Hopkins as a brilliant actor. This movie coincided somewhat with his starring role in the highly praised QBVII, that was being aired on TV. I made a mental note to \\"watch this actor.\\" I saw \\"Magic\\" at the Capital Plaza Cinema in Austin, Texas in the Seventies. One of the things I remember about it most, besides, spooky Fats, the dummy, was the haunting and eerie cords played on a \\"squeeze box\\" over and over throughout the movie, just two chords. They played when something creepy was about to happen, or had just happened. Hopkins was great as a type of stalker, psycho, who used Fats as a prop, Burgess Meridith was great as his manager and Ann Margaret was excellent in this dramatic and slightly kookie role."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazingly suspenseful psychological thriller","review":"This story of a psychotic ventriloquist is truly frightening, especially as portrayed through the gifted Anthony Hopkins. Ann-Margret gives her best performance as his high-school sweetheart stuck in a bad marriage. Based on the novel, the plot is powerful and well-developed. One caution: This video is edited; with the abundant vulgar language of the movie removed. This hurts the impact of the film, but the story is strong enough to overcome this sad bit of editing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly great horror movie","review":"I saw this film last night after refusing to see it for a while because of a fear of ventriloquism. What a great film! I sincerely believe that this is Anthony's Hopkins finest performance. His telepathic card scene with Ann Margaret is fantastic, he is just so intense. This is one of the most intelligent horror movies I've ever seen, because Fats never walks around on his own, when he murders victims, its done by Corky. Corky's obsession with perfection and success ultimately takes over his mind and ability to control himself. Metallica once did a song about this film called \\"Sad but True,\\" it sums up the ideology of this film well. I also believe this film's concept may have been based on that one Twilight Zone episode, but I could be mistaken."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frightening movie with superb acting by Sir Hopkins","review":"My recollection of the film -- I've only ordered it today (August 31, 1999) -- from my youth (when I was eight years old) is that of a genuinely frightening film which has a great deal of credibility to it. The dummy is seemingly real at all times, especially when it is killing some hapless victim. Hopkins acting is phenomenal. But one things disturbs me. I understand from other people's comments that there is significant editing on the tape available here. Should this be true, I am afraid I will be disappointed. I was hoping to see the movie in the way in which it was intended to run, i.e. the way it originally aired in 1978. The vulgar language of the dummy is integral to the film, I feel. Anyway, I look forward to receiving it."},{"rating":"2","title":"classic","review":"i got this for my dad. it is super creepy and worth a watch, but don't watch it in the dark."},{"rating":"2","title":"Psychological thriller!","review":"This movie really scared me when it came out in theaters years ago.

Anthony Hopkins is superb! \\"Fats\\" the dummy steals lots of the scenes.The question that crosses my mind is which is more frightening the Dummy or Ann Margarett trying to act!Burgess Meredith is great as the manager. One point of interest is the horrible score by Jerry Goldsmith. He throws in a great harmonica riff when we see \\"Fats\\", but during some of the more \\"romantic \\" scenes the music is so cloying it would make Yanni blush.Don,t miss the extras where they talk with the real \\"vent\\" that worked with them on the movie.If you like movies that are a bit \\"outside\\" this is a must have for any collection.Pete Cavano"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mauled again - killing bears to enrich himself","review":"Jim Cole has been ticketed and banned at many National Parks for willing breaking the law and endangering, not only his life, but the lives of the bears. He was recently mauled at Yellowstone and his actions most likely will result in the death of the bear as he pursued and harrassed a mother bear protecting her cubs. We were at Yellowstone during the incident and the rangers said that the photos they found in his camera did not line up with the tale he told.This is his second mauling because he will risk the life of the bear just to get his money shot. If you are considering buying his books because you love bears, be aware that man is not a advocate for bears but rather will do things that result in their being shot in order to enrich himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry Jim","review":"As a former realtor, Mr. Cole owes the natural world a large debt, and believes he is doing good work. My opinion, based upon a life lived in the northern rockies, is that bears NEVER benefit from interactions with humans.

Well worth reading for an insight into \\"news\\" that didn't make most newspapers but which was true in revealing life, the book is nicely crafted and the author writes with a knowing touch.One would wish for more intimate details of the subject's life, but he was a private man, kept no diary, and did not tell his innermost thoughts to his family. The book, however, succeeds, because it reveals the town, Lamar, MO (which happened to be President Truman's birthplace, and where Wyatt Earp had been Marshall and where the Earp kinfolk lived on) and some of the foibles and fancies of American life. I hope the author writes another book soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great biography of a very interesting journalist","review":"This biography of Arthur Aull, a small-town journalist at the turn of the twentieth century, is a most fascinating read. The role of the small-town newspaper publisher carried much of the moral weight of towns like Lamar, Missouri, during the first half of the twentieth century before the era of instant news carried by radio and television changed everything. The author does a fine job of demonstrating the role in both politics and society that newspaper publishers played during this era. Arthur Aull was routinely used as a classic example of the important role of journalists in developing America by the Journalism School of the University of Missouri. In addition, he was a character that continues to shape the nature of the small town where he published; his legacy newspaper still is in publication."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting Subject; Poor Presentation","review":"You'd be hard-pressed to tell a boring story about about a plucky country newspaper editor who had principles and stuck to 'em. But this author has done it. He says the book is an adaptation of his doctoral thesis. That fits. The book reads like a well-done, fully footnoted college paper, not like a dramatic novel. It strives to identify key historical facts at the expense of the reader's interest.

It would seem that Steiger writes a book every-other month or so. Once again, this author has no creditability what-so-ever with me.

I followed the instructions and installed the CD first. I bought the usb cable from Amazon - Belkin gold series, 10ft for around $10. This printer is so much smaller than the 2100, but it does everything my old one did, just faster and with a smaller footprint. It is also very quiet. Everything worked beautifully and I expect this printer will last as long as my 2100."},{"rating":"2","title":"HP LJ 1020 Printer","review":"This is a good printer for the money; however, the print is not as sharp as I would like.

(We use 5 of the similar 1012 model and they are good workhorses.The 1020's installation disk is great -- with good pictures, easy instructions that any normal person could follow.

It is a good printer, but make sure you have Windows before purchasing or it's a big hassle.BTW--it's B&W; only & works very well!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the task bought for","review":"I purchased this printer to replace a DeskJet in a dedicated application. The DeskJet was just too slow. I needed a small, low-power printer. This one fit the bill. Startup time is very quick. Printing speed is good and print quality (text only) is excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Vista support!","review":"I agree with the reviewer who said it was inexcusable that HP still has no Vista driver for this printer.It worked great when I had XP, but then I was forced to upgrade to Vista due to other issues and of course the printer has been sitting like a lump under my desk for two months now!I'm quite unhappy with HP's timetable of releasing a driver by JULY. Come on guys, Vista was in beta for how long? It's not as if you didn't know it was coming.And I tried using the original CD that came with the printer to install on Vista, the way another reviewer suggested. I couldn't get it to work no matter what.For that one week between getting the printer and installing Vista, it was great. I would have given it 4 stars out of 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great printer, but HP refuses to support Vista (or XP 64-bit)","review":"I love this printer. But it transformed from a great little printer into a useless piece of plastic when I upgraded to Vista (on one machine) and XP 64-bit (on my other machine).HP's customer support was useless. The worst thing is that they actually have the drivers available on the website, but you have to purchase them for $20 and wait for a CD to arrive. They might be available for download sometime in 2008, but I'm not holding my breath.C'mon HP, you're dropping the ball. I just recommended that our office manager buy a fancy, big, expensive Lexmark for our new network printer because I was annoyed with your customer support. So this little decision to ask me for $20 for the drivers just cost you about $1000 in a lost sale."},{"rating":"2","title":"HP LaserJet 1020 & Windows Vista","review":"A number of reviewer have reported what HP's support site reports - that the LaserJet 1020 does not work on Windows Vista. Just use the original driver CD that comes with the printer and run the installation on Vista. The installer automatically detects the printer and installs the driver. This printer works perfectly with these drivers on Windows Vista Home Premium edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"So good we now buy Brother","review":"Installing one of these printers is always a miserable experience. The install program constantly tries to load USB printing support FOR WINDOWS 98, leading to an \\"unrecognized object\\". The only way to get a working install on the first try is if you have already installed some other kind -any kind- of USB printer in the past.Doesn't work well with network print servers or USB switches.Extremely finicky as to which USB cable it will work with, need to have 2 or 3 cables on hand to find one it will accept. Of course HP doesn't provide one.I don't have time for this kind of nonsense every time one of my users needs a new printer, and have switched to Brother."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Driver for the Windows XP Pro x64 Operating System","review":"The LaserJet 1020 is a fine printer for use with older operating systems. It produces high quality output when attached to my Windows 98SE box. But it doesn't print at all when attached to my new computer with its XP Pro x64 operating system. The problem is there's no compatible driver available, not on HP's LaserJet 1020 installation disk and not on the HP website. I emailed HP Tech Support about the problem and they suggested two workarounds, using x64 drivers for other HP printer models, but neither worked. Tech Support now says to try working the problem via online chat. I'll try that next time I have a block of several hours free, unless I give the printer away first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Printer is defective","review":"The printer arrived in a box hardly big enough to contain it. Thin cardboard, very thin styrofoam and the printer didn't print. I contacted the seller. The seller sent a \\"new\\" cartridge. Still didn't print. The seller then had me send that printer back and sent another printer.It took a good two months to get the second printer which I have never bothered to open because it is futile.Instead, I used the cartridge they sent in my other HP that is the same model. Normally, one of those 12 A Cartridges lasts me a year of hard use. This one stopped working today!!!! I have not used it for even a month!!! These cartridges cost $86.00! This was the biggest ripoff I have ever experienced!Do not, do not fall into the same trap I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissatisfied with installation software","review":"I was very dissatisfied that the HP LaserJet 1020 installation software did not provide acceptable printer drivers for Windows XP or Vista."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent printer especially with the right paper","review":"Apart from the crappy instructions and lack of supplied USB cable, this is fantastic printer. VERY quiet and efficient. Some have mentioned the paper curl problem. I found that using proper laser paper greatly reduces curl.

Improved text as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little machine!","review":"I don't normally go out of my way to write reviews, but I do appreciate reading them before I buy....so here's one for those considering buying this for their \\"second office\\" application. I've had this printer for 3 months now, and it's great for my home office (where I work when I'm not in my office office). Footprint is tiny, no problems with paper feed (like prior top-feed printers I've had), print quality good and crisp, and printouts appear instantly. Good work HP."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Printer!!","review":"Great deal, great delivery, great packaging, great printer! Reviews were all correct - this is truly a fast printer. I have been using an older, much larger HP laser printer but needed a smaller one. This printer is even faster. This is one of my better buys - it truly is worth the money - and more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Spool crashes when printing PDFs","review":"There is a known issue with this printer when printing PDFs. If you scan an image to a PDF and then attempt to print the PDF the printer spool crashes. Not only do you lose access to this printer but you also lose access to any other printer. The problem occurs with all Windows OSs but happens on a regular basis with Vista. Loaded several different print drivers recommended by HP but nothing worked. So proceed with caution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellence","review":"This is an excellent product at an outstanding price.

They are virtually the same machine. I have found these to be easy to use and pretty fast printers. I like the manual paper feed slot and use it often for envelopes and labels.And, unlike Golden Comet, who either has a dozen printers at home or is in HP Marketing writing advertisements disguised as reviews, I am a regular customer with no bias towards or against HP products."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great idea gone terribly wrong...don't waste your money!","review":"This is a great printer until you begin to have spooler issues. It prints quickly & the ink lasts a long time; however, after a short time of satisfactory use you will likely encounter a \\"print spooler subsystem app has stopped working\\" error message. This error occurred for me when trying to print pdf documents. The error prohibits any printing, the error message will pop up frequently (even when you haven't sent anything to the printer) and the issue never goes away (there are a few temporary fixes). This error occurred three times for me and I had to finally replace this printer. The HP website has more information on this issue. I highly recommend researching this if you consider buying this printer...but really, don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prints fine--software/drivers abominable","review":"The printer produces crisp, clear black and white pages. The efficiency of toner usage isn't too bad.But I soon started having major problems with my computer system--all peripherals using USB ports stopped being recognized by my Dell Dimension 2400 running Windows XP. What finally fixed the problem? Disconnecting the HP printer. With the printer installed, nothing else connected to a USB port worked except the printer. With the printer removed, everything worked fine. Other (borrowed) printers hooked up to the computer worked just fine and did not cause the system-wide problems.I tried downloading a variety of device drivers and patches from HP, none of which solved the problem. I finally had to get another printer--foolishly I bought another HP device (a C4280 All-in-One--look for my review on that item) because they employ some people I know. A mistake on my part. In addition, HP doesn't make a Mac-compatible driver for this printer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Padre Pio: Miracle Man - a devotional movie","review":"This movie was soo well done!!

VERY DISAPPOINTED."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not the real Pio - Read Ruffin's Bio if you want to know that","review":"Yes the movie is \\"beautiful and touching\\" as another reviewer stated. However, it is also quite wrong. I have read just about every biography of Padre Pio published in English (and there are many) and can assure you that you must read credible biographical works before you see this film if you want to know the real Padre Pio. Then if you still want to view this movie, you can sit down and spot the outrageous errors in the movie.Question: Why would anyone interested in learning the truth about this remarkable man watch a movie that is loaded with mistakes and distortions?Recommended: Right here on Amazon you can order Lutheran minister Bernard C. Ruffin's biography of Padre Pio. It is an excellent way to get the facts!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Religious Movie Ever Seen","review":"I was surprised to see that I couldn't get enough of this movie and played it over and over. Thanks to all those involved who made this movie come to life. The actor who played Padre Pio looked so much like him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing movie","review":"This is a really good movie. It's divided in two DVD. It keeps your attention until the end. I'd recommend for anyone who wants a first approach to Padre Pio's history. It gives you the desire of start reading and searching about him. It's spirituality is incredible. I would watch it again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Padre Pio: Miracle Man","review":"Really a great film! I bought this wanting to get to know more about Pio's life and who he was and this DVD definitely delivers.It's over 300 minutes long and every minute completely gripped me - no exaggeration. The acting is good and the main actor resembles Pio quite a bit.It is very well made and if you have any interest in the life of Padre Pio and who he was, or just simply want to get to know more about him, I would definitely recommend this movie. It is superb. 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and Inspiring","review":"truly beautiful film that captivates the audience. I have watched it several times over and still continue to be inspired by it. Truly a must have in the collection for those who love movies about Saints"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational, but needs more","review":"I truly enjoyed this movie, but would have liked it to be a little more detailed. It seemed to jump from one scene to another too quickly. The acting was done very well and Sergio Castellitto, protrayed Padre Pio very much like himself. I have already watched it in its entirety about four times. And I still get emotional each time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stellar","review":"A brilliant film by any standards; has become one of my top ten films ever. Performances are stellar, and even flaws in the script become meaningless within the overall scope of both spirituality and an amazingly compelling and rich story. Castellitto can not be praised highly enough. This is not a film about Catholicism, quite the contrary, but about a man intrinsically surrendered to the sacred Spirit, to Truth and to Jesus on the most intimate level we can imagine. It is a profound meditation I watch over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good, and interesting for non-believers too","review":"I am a huge fan of Sergio Castellitto, and as a frequent visitor to Southern Italy I wanted to learn more about the life of Padre Pio. Although I am an atheist, I enjoyed this film very much, in much the same way that I enjoy visiting churches in Italy. A surprisingly good, interesting film, that grabbed my interest until it ended nearly four hours later! I recommend this movie to anyone interested in Southern Italian culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Catholic movies ever","review":"This is an amazing Catholic movie which portrays the entire life of the great Saint Padre Pio. It shows his humility, his struggles with the devil, and everything an orthodox Catholic and Christian would want out of a film. It doesn't overlook the temporal problems of the Catholic Church such as the pride, jealousy, and vindictiveness of the powerful opponents of Padre Pio, but it portrays this not as if most of these opponents were evil, but simply that they did not understand, and even in Padre Pio's words they were simply trying to protect the Church. The importance of the three religious vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience come to the forefront in this film in many ways. This movie has an amazing ending so it is worth watching until the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing short of incredible.","review":"This is one of the best films I have ever seen. Nothing else needs to be said, whoever watches it will understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"B rated film","review":"This is a very, very long film, but poor performances make it longer. $24 is a lot to pay for an incomplete story line."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very informative and helpful read","review":"I got this book, because I wanted to gain a greater understanding of Process Theism.

The other Plone books are better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated and misleading code examples","review":"If you are a designer who wants to know how to customize Plone's look beyond changing colors and fonts, you'll be disappointed in this book. Sure, the introduction is still good, but chapter 6 (for example), which instructs you to work with the Plone Base Properties file is giving you an outdated method, not well suited to upgrades and maintenance. I believe that stylesheets are the way to go, now...but I'm still trying to figure it out, no thanks to this book. The instructions for adding slots in Chapter 5 were just impossible to follow and did not even vaguely work. Yes, the text is in English, but the descriptions bear little resemblence to the Plone 2.1+ experience.This book will, however, give a somewhat glossy overview of the entire application.

This book brings it all back -- in a GOOD way. Reading it, you can understand why poor urban kids went to such lengths to make a mark for themselves. No one cared at first but Martha Cooper, who earned their respect and documented their achievements with her fine photographs. This book is a monument to those unsung teenage artists and the photographer who recognized and publicized their talents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific book","review":"I loved this book!

Reading this book, I found myself saying, \\"GET TO THE POINT.\\" The plot of the story was nice (sort of), but it needed more action. In the beginning and towards the end there was too much talk about what I already heard over and over before. What really bothered me was that one character's point of view, didn't really give me an understanding of the other characters (especially Adrian).Before reading this book the title caught my attention.

I'd read the reviews after a friend told me about the book and the reviews seemed (for the most part) pretty supportive. I like a good fast book too. With little mouths to feed and job and school, reality is all too much of my life so I needed some good fiction. When All Hell Breaks Loose was it. Even though Adrian wasn't honest and disrespected Greg, I know sisters out there who are foolin' brothers so it wasn't far from a certain truth (no insult to the real lesbians of the world but Adrian was confused, don't act like you don't know). Does anyone know about Cubicles? Will it be a sequel? I agree with the movie idea too. I loved this book! Oh, the language was a bit much, but I gave room for Ms. Spenser being a first time novelist.

As another reader said relationships are full of surprizes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I went to school with the author","review":"Camika was always serious at ETSU, so to see her actually write a book with humor almost sent me to my grave. I enjoyed the book and it's good to finally see the author relax and live a little. I never thought she'd be an author either. All she ever did that made her smile was play Spades. The book was all that and I'm really just glad to know that I know someone who is taking the bull by the horns and following her dream.

What can I do to let some big time producer know that they are missing out on this one at the box office?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible book","review":"This book needs serious work.

I went out and purchased it because I support black authors. When I found out she was my sorority sister, I was sick to my stomach. How dare she put down Jarvis Christian College, an historically black college that you she has never attended. You made my alma mater look as if the degree i received from there is worthless. I have a very successful life as do other JCC alumnus. It is up to our black authors to protray us in a positve light not degrade us.

I am just very disappointed that a sistah feels so lowly of her own kind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much hype....","review":"After reading many(good)reviews for this book, I decided to check it out at the library. I think the book was overrated. There were some good moments, but it seemed like the book was put together over night."},{"rating":"2","title":"It really breaks loose!","review":"When all hell breaks loose, it really breaks loose. The main character Greg is a positive role model and has it going on in his life. His business is booming, his friends are challenging and things are working well with the lady love in his life, enough so that he proposes.As in real life, what happens when things go well, all hell breaks loose and when you think it cannot get any worse, it does.This is a page turner and a nice debut novel. It is easy to complete in one setting. It was easy to predict what was going to happen in the end and the author took a few twist to arrive there. One downfall was that the prediction came to early in the book if you are a suspense reader, but it did not detract from the book. A little more developing of the characters will come as Ms. Spencer continues to write, and I expect we will receive more writings from this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I am also a graduate of East Texas State University and I am glad to see a fellow alumni do so well. This book is absolutely AWESOME. I read it in less than 24 hours and I could not put it down. I read a lot of books and this one is definitely in my top five.

Her characters were exciting and three dimensional and her words seemed to leap off the page and electrify my mind! I particularly loved her male character Greg, and the fact that she wrote so well from a male perspective. I predict great things are on the horizon for you, sister Camika, and I am happily spreading the word about your talent and strong literary voice. You were wonderful to indulge us with a few paragraphs in Philly, and I look forward to reading CUBICLES. Peace and blessings!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written and insulting","review":"Let me first say that I read the reviews of this work and rushed out and bought it. I wish I had slowed down and read a few pages in the store, because I would have left it there. I found this book insulting on more levels then one, to the point that I was unable to finish it. All of the characters were simple and single minded with no signs of intelligent life anywhere to be found! I am at a lose of words to describe how bad this book is. I would recommend, despite what you have read here, don't buy it. For the record, I am an avid reader who enjoys the likes of Toni Morrison, Alice Walker, Anne Rice, Terry McMillan, Valerie Wilson Wesley, and many others. If you want a good, easy read about African American life, I would suggest Tryin' to Sleep in the Bed You Made. It is a much better read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hell didn't break loose- it barely struck a match!","review":"It took exactly 100 pages for this book to even begin to be interesting! Ms. Spencer had a tendency to go on and on spatting what seemed to be her own opinions, and voicing them through Greg, her main character. While this can be good, her voice should not smother that of her characters. I thought Shreese's character was too the extreme. She just seemed like a stereotype. It was not until further into the book that you can see she is a true person rather than a stock character. It was a slow read that did not pick up until page 100!! From then on, I was just waiting for something to happen. The climax was smooth and well written, and the book closes giving you, the reader a sense of closure as well. It was refreshing since the beginning was so stale! Spencer used stereotypes instead of modeling her characters after real people. It is almost as though this book was written by two different people. This book should have gone unpublished."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sorry...but this one wasn't all of that for me!","review":"I usually don't give bad reviews but I must make an exception. I purchased the book sometime last year, and have struggled to finish it after pickin it up and putting it down a couple of times.After seeing all of the \\"glorious\\" reviews I decided to give it another try and FINISH IT! I must say that I was truly disappointed. I am sure Ms. Spencer's next book will be \\"da bomb\\" but this was a dud for me.It was tooooooooooooo slow - and it was sooooooooooo predictable. I mean I figured out the book's ending in the first portion of the book but it took Ms. Spencer 200 pages to finally get to the end of the story.I'm sorry...I just was expecting a lot MORE based on all of the reviews that I read. But then again...who am I to judge!Try it you might like it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete waste of time!!!","review":"I've been a member of a book club for several years now, and as a group we rated thisbook a \\"1\\".

I was very disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much enthused...","review":"When All Hell Breaks Loose was a great disappointment. I thought the story was building up to be something more. I knew what the ending was going to bring before I got there and it was anticlimatic. I didn't like the synopsis of all the characters at the end. Ms. Spencer didn't make me really like and grow attached to any of the characters and I couldn't care less what happened to them. All the male/female bashing and hatred was disheartening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow Characters","review":"I was sorry to see a fresh new author with such potential resort to stereotyped shallow character development, especially of her lesbian characters. These charaters (or shall I say caricatures) make the story lose its believablity and will distance many readers whose understanding of or expeirence in gay/lesbian culture goes beyond what they have learned from Jerry Springer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't all that great.","review":"After reading all of the reviews for this book, I thought it would be pretty good. However, I found it to be predictable. The story-line seemed be dragging at several points in the book and I just wasn't buying THE REASON for Adrian's betrayal- it seemed unrealistic."},{"rating":"2","title":"When All Hell Breaks Loose","review":"This is a wonderful first effort from Camika Spencer. Drama, however, is a perfect word to describe it. I thought the ideas were set on a great stage of characters, personalities and situations. We were able to follow our main character (Greg) throughout some very difficult and stressful times in his life. I absolutely love the interaction between Greg, his friends, his family, and his coworkers. The character development was absolutely great. There weren't too many that we were confused of who was who or what aura they possessed. I was quite pleased with the book. It was a fairly easy read and there was just enough suspense to keep you looking for the plot and the outcome. Personally, I was pleased to be able to follow Greg as he matured in this situation. I would much rather find my characters changed and mature at the end of a novel, than falling into the same scenarios. Ms. Spencer has done an excellent job with her premier novel. I look forward to more of her work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fiction and fabricated lies","review":"This book was poorly written and contained information that was purely insulting.

Everyone likes a good miracle movie. Right? Well, not quite. There was plenty of cringe worthy moments regarding race. Mr. Ashton calling Homer 'boy' and then telling the nuns that Smith was lazy and shiftless-but still wanted him to work for him. (Weird.) I hated the scenes where he was just shuffling to please them. And I didn't understand why Mother Maria simply couldn't say 'Thank You' especially when she was begging for everything. Out of all the good roles Poitier has played, they give him the Oscar for when he played a good field slave doing what he was told.

I have never been able to find a single minute in the movie that is not enthralling. Every aspect is just perfect. The B & W cinematography is excellent, the acting and characterizations are perfect (Poitier won an Oscar for his role as a skeptical but proud man), and the dialogue is witty and amusing. And of course anyone who has seen this film remembers the \\"Amen\\" scenes. If you haven't seen the film, just imagine a bunch of German nuns singing a \\"down-home\\" gospel song, lead by Sidney Poitier. Speaking of music, Jerry Goldsmith's score is one of the more memorable in film history. The style fits the style of the whole film like a glove.Enough said.

It's one that is watchable on a repeat basis. Low key but very meaningful. The movie is in black and white but that actually seems to add to it in the same way that the H. Bogart movies 'Casablanca' and 'Sahara' effectively use that medium.The price is right. It's a keeper. Buy it and sit back and enjoy a great performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"A glorious film!","review":"This is a wonderfully entertaining film. Sidney Poitier is charming anddelightful as Homer Smith. Homer experiences car trouble on a desert road. He receives assistance from a group of nuns in a nearby retreat.He obliges by doing chores for the nuns. The superior nun persuades himto build them a chapel. Homer is at first reluctant, but soon the projectbecomes as important to him as it is to the nuns. Poitier received a well-deserved Oscar for his role. Lilia Skala was nominated for BestSupporting Actress as the leader of the nuns. A spiritually feel-goodfilm. Excellent.

Upon receiving this DVD, I put it asidewithout checking it -- it was so nicely packaged. Upon receiving arequest from Amazon to review the purchase, the DVD was unwrapped,but it would not play on my machine, showing an ERROR message.The vendor had sent me (in Norfolk, VA) a Region 2 copy (forEurope, Asia, etc.). Yes, when I went back to the listing on Amazon,it did specify \\"Region 2\\", but that would have meant nothing to me,even if I had noted it.I give a 1 Star rating because the system will not accept a 0 Star,and I guess the nice packing deserves 1 Star.The vendor takes no responsibility for the goof-up, and it has costme more ($5.00 for Priority Mail) to return the DVD in order to get apartial refund.

Poitier (plus entire cast) just about perfect here. Ralph Nelson, the director, did a wonderful job.No violance or nudity or profanity in this movie (not that I have anything against violence or profanity or skin in my movies) and yet it still ranks as one of the best movies I've ever seen...Goes to show you: you don't always have to have a bunch of car crashes and people being blown away every five minutes to end up with not only a successful/heartwarming picture on your hands, but one that continues to be popular more than thirty years after it was made.People who like this film might also want to check out Akira Kurosawa's Ikiru."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true classic!","review":"This is one of the most heartwarming films I've ever seen and Sidney Poitier is a master of this sort of genre. This film belongs in everyones movie library if not for the great storyline, at least for the toe-tapping rendition of \\"Amen\\" sung by Sidney and accompanied by a group of German nuns who couldn't understand a word he was saying.Hilarious!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Toney Album","review":"I bought that Ghost face Album a month ago and in all actuallity that is one of the best album I've got in a while. From the intro it was tight, I'm a fan of the wu no matter what people say about them. I respect those who don't bend to trends, be leaders not followers. Toney does his thing on this one with lines like\\" I keep Big Shurly on my side so what's happen. Get the he'll out of here what other dude would say some ish like that. The album touch mad topic from love to runnin' from them folks. In closing all I got to say is to all those that hold the wu down keep doing it, true Mcin' is over here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but could have been great!!!!!","review":"The \\"Pretty Toney\\" album is a good album, but coud have been great had it included all the tracks that were supposed to be on the album.

Actually, from start to finish the album is pretty solid, but what do you expect from the most consistent Wu member? There aren't any Wu collabos on here (though RZA produces a track and Dirt McGirt shows up for some adlibs); instead, find Ghost rapping with the Ghost (Styles P., that is) and an even hungrier Sheek Louch on \\"Metal Lungies\\" and Jadakiss on \\"Run\\", a track so hot that Kiss said he \\"may have to take his shirt off\\". Even the duet with Jackie-O (who I admittedly thought would be a one-hit wonder by now) on \\"Tooken Back\\" comes off nice. The only duet that's average is the \\"this-one's-for-the radio\\" track, \\"Tush\\" with Missy Elliott. Otherwise, newcomers and Wu/Ghost fans should be satisfied. -EJR"},{"rating":"2","title":"Different label, same music.","review":"Ghost's fourth solo project, but the first he would be releasing on Def Jam. Ghost returns to prove all the doubters wrong and come out with the intense, raw and emotional styles of rap that we all came to recognise over a decade ago. Ghost's rapping hasn't changed much during his absense in the rap, I feel Ghost only improves with age, with cuts like \\"Biscuits\\" and \\"Metal Lungies\\", Ghost seems more hungry than ever to go head-to-head with the best of 'em. With cuts like \\"Save Me Dear\\", Ghost shows his love for women. Also Ghost comes back to takeover the club jams with \\"Tush\\" featured with \\"Missy Elliot\\". Also RZA shows up for \\"Run\\" with Jadakiss. The album shows Ghost leading the Wu-Tang to the right direction and sooner or later they will be back to smash the world!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hotter Than You Think, Even After Reading This","review":"This album blew me away, I was expecting Ghost's usual lyrical excellence and a few good RZA beats, but all the beats are pretty hot, and every single song on the album is good. Like someone else said, that hook on \\"Ghostface\\" can get pretty old, but the verses are good, and that's the only weak track. Even the more R&B type tracks are still good, I'm glad to see Ghost isn't afraid to rap about love and healing the hood. Overall, Ghostface continues his lyrical excellence, and the beats are all great. A Definite must have for any hip hop fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 Good Song = 1 Star","review":"I can't believe that Ghostface Killah could make such a sucky album, after making his classic album \\"Ironman\\" Anyway, I only gave this album one star, because there was only one song on this album that I could enjoy, and that's \\"Tush\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"RUBBY W IS A GENIUS","review":"man you indonesian cats are geniuses i totally agree.

I was def impressed by this album. I saw the single with Missy and I thought Ghost went pop, but after hearin the whole thing, all can agree, this is HOT. Check out \\"Metal Lungies\\" and \\"Run\\" for some hot D-Block verses from Jada, Sheek, and SP. \\"Holla\\" is just Toney rhymin over an old Delfonics song, not sample, the whole song! I hear this song on the Muzak workin at Price Chopper, make me crack up. Hottest track on this album tho, for me at least, \\"Be This Way\\". Good sample, hot hot beats, some REAL lyrics from Ghost, good message.

Ghost is back in full effect. Even though this is his 3rd best album behind Ironman and Supreme Clientele, it still goes hard as hell.

Go pick this album up, its pure hip hop."},{"rating":"2","title":"PRETTY TONY, BEST ALBUM YET...","review":"This album is what Wu Tang is supposed to sound like.

Yup, get this album... Ghost is killing it the way only he can, and the beats are what I needed right now, freshly cut soul samples make that make this album sound like it's out on motown.

His solo projects are the best out of all the Wu members. Supreme Clientele was good, but not better than Ironman. Bulletproof Wallets was nice too. Anybody that doesn't have Ironman needs to buy it. Don't bootleg it either. Remember this downloaders and artists.......good music is worth buying. A good album is worth buying.I just put it in the stereo and from the sounds of the first 2 tracks, i may have to buy another on for the car.

Still it was still fun to let your imagination run wild dreaming of doing some of these things. Also if you are going to do some reading about history why not go directly to the source on that particular subject?

Much of the joy lies in the relating of family events that occurred at its time in history. For example, children learned about growing up by participating in some adult activities (working at knitting scarves and making placemats that would benefit the whole family.) The greater lesson was, of course, learning their own importance in society. Furthermore, in a world where the future has become more uncertain than usual, this book reminds us that our ancestors did not have the conveniences of prepared foods like mayonnaise and jello but that with a minimum of research we can duplicate the same goodness.

The film is great... in its original version. \\"Deadly China Hero,\\" however, is a clipped version of the film \\"Last Hero of China.\\" I highly recommend the original film instead of this one, which cuts out several crucial scenes and important subplots. There's no reason to settle for this hacked-up version."},{"rating":"1","title":"You don't want this version!","review":"When I first put this DVD in I noticed that they cut away the opening, then the movie starts and I can't believe my eyes as the quality of the DVD is even lower than my VCD version, this is just frustrating to watch. The subtitle cannot be change or removed since it is fixed onto the movie, the subtitle is in chinese and english use at the same time, the quality of the image is so below par that the subtitle at times can't even be read. Another thing is the audio, you can't switch between Cantonese and Mandarin like on my VCD, yes this too was fixed to cantonese only. There is no extra features, you might as well buy a VHS tape, which would probably be an improvement on the picture quality. It does look like they tranfer this movie from an overused VHS tape with no other intention then to sell it to unsuspecting \\"customers\\"(read victims)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chopped Version of Last Hero In China","review":"I agree with Michael Van about the clipped version \\" Deadly China Hero\\" as I own \\"Last Hero in China\\" which is the movie in its orginal presentation and with Subtitles. This is actually, if placed in order of sequences by year, the Fourth \\"Once Upon a Time in China\\" series before OUATIC IV/V came out. Nonetheless, you have to watch this movie as it has, as usual, great martial art scenes. I own all but OUATIC IV and most of Jet Li's DVD's that are available. The 6th version of OUATIC is \\"Once upon a Time in China and America\\" also starring Jet Li. Though this may be the 4th Jet Li did as Wong Fei-Hung, you do not have to see the three previous OUATIC's. Order is not important with this version of Wong Fei-Hung but the tales of this Martial Artist (a real actual Chinese Hero) is. Get this DVD and try to get \\"Last Hero in China\\" also. In fact, get every Jet Li movie made. You will not be dissappointed. This man is our replacement for Bruce Lee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Last Hero in China - 5 stars / Deadly China Hero - no stars!","review":"Deadly China Hero is a poorly edited version of the original Last Hero in China. I'm glad so many people like it but it lacks about 15 minutes of the original movie and they are the minutes that make it a cohesive movie instead of a jumble of martial arts fights. This taking of a classic martial arts movie, chopping it up, and then releasing it under a different name has got to stop! People deserve the chance to see the original movies!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Last and The Least","review":"I bought this film on a whim, since the store I went to didn't have 'exactly' what I wanted (OUATIC 2 fer sure)SO I figured I'd watch the last in the series since OUATIC and America was a HUGE disappointment for me. I have yet to make up my mind on Jet Li films. And this put me in the negative state (again) The story was slow and unmoving, the characters were not interesting, the fighting was sparse (why else get a kung fu film?)and the last fight with Jet in a chicken suit (JET LI IN A CHICKEN SUIT!!!!!)was the last straw. I'm sorry, but if Fist Of Legend was his best, then this must have been by far his worst. \\"I wouldn't buy this DVD with YOUR money!!!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately, I was disappointed.","review":"I am writing this review without having even seen the movie itself, for the shock I got as I received this product was enough.

Way too much wire-fu, the plot was unintelligible and it seemed like the whole film was in fast forward. The only saving grace was the horrible job of translating on the subtitles. Example: when one character means to say \\"I have to go the bathroom\\" he instead says \\"I want pissing.\\" Without that it wouldn't have been funny at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kung-fu fun","review":"This movie is better than I thought .... It's more Kung-fu comedy than anything. Usualy the charactor Wong Fei-Hung is a bit to serious and stiff.

The man is a versatile actor and very good martial artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good movie with some flaws","review":"I have seen this movie from beginning to end, uncut.

I'm afraid that I can give it only two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"good but not great","review":"I was slightly disappointed in this book, knowing it was a Zane Gray.

A historical note: Those vets received no benefits and more than 200,000 U.S. soldiers suffered physical or mental injuries during The Great War, but in 1919 only 217 had completed rehabilitation programs. That sad chapter has similarities with the Walter Reed Hospital scandal over substandard treatment of U.S. troops wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan.Bless Grey for taking up the cause back in the day, it must not have been very popular to do so at the time, but it got weary hearing one of the primary characters wax on and on about that issue. In addition, I had a real problem with the ending...suffice to say it would not have played out that way.

But it is also the coming of age of a modern \\"sophisticated\\" woman who learns the real meaning of love, and what it means to love someone. The story has several scenes which take place in New York City as well as at Oak Creek Canyon in Arizona. For pure romance, this book can not be beat. Carly Birch is one of Zane Grey's finest female characters, and again I will say he often wrote from the woman's point of view which is why the vast majority of his work was published in the leading \\"women's\\" magazines of the day, and his readership was more than half women.

I would not want one with an in-line power switch. The unit is sturdy and feels good quality. The power cord is heavy and plenty long, as needed for most desktop situations. I have used it with a number of different cups, all having a small ridge around the bottom, and they all work equally well.

The first time I used it, there was a melting or burning plastic smell, but this is to be expected and never occured again. This one does not come with a mug which I was dissapointed about, but my \\"the Office\\" mug works just fine. I might suggest using it with a mug that has a top or cover since this would maintain heat even better. The black color blends in with my desk and it's quite small as not to be an eye-sore.

I can take as long as I want to drink my coffee/tea now, and it is still the perfect sipping temperature even after an hour.

I looked through my large collection, and they all have a small lip on the bottom.

My old one worked all day, everyday, for 14 years. I never paid attention to the manufacturer. Too bad. Now I still have to go to the microwave every few minutes to heat my drink.

There are good points -- nice length to the cord; convenient on/off switch. But the reason for purchasing a mug warmer is to keep the contents warm, even somewhat heated. This warmer does not do that. It barely keeps the coffee lukewarm. I previously had a warmer by Continental Electric which kept the coffee at a very nice temperature and it was never cooled to the \\"tepid\\" point.This model is not worth the money or effort. Check out the Continental Electric instead, even if it's more expensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Effectiveness depends on the cup","review":"This pad does get pretty hot, but how well it keeps your beverage hot really depends on the cup that you use. The problem is that most (all?) mugs have a circular bottom, so the actual surface area that contacts the pad is pretty small. That being said, my drink never really got colder than a step hotter than lukewarm, so I guess it works fine!Safety is somewhat of a concern, though. It uses a simple on/off switch, and I'm not sure what will happen if it is left on for days at a time. I think a system where it is only on when a cup is on it would be awesome.Your cup also sits about an inch higher off the table, so risk of knocking it over is a bit higher.Overall, a good and cheap solution to the everyday first world problem of keeping a hot drink hot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great item with lots of uses","review":"I've had mine for years and started looking on Amazon in case I need another.I use it all the time to heat soups and chili - it will do this if you use a metal cup and cover it. I've even used it to slow cook single servings of meat. The key is to heat small amounts.Good for melting chocolate or butter without burning and without using another burner. It also works well for heating hide glue for woodworking - keeps it just the right temp without burning.But of course, the main use is to keep coffee or tea hot so you can make extra and nip at it throughout the afternoon.Mine has taken spillovers and not had a problem, I just unplug and wipe it off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what it should be","review":"I bought this to be a candle warmer, not a mug warmer, but they are all the same.

Then dispense right into the cup from the Keurig which is set to 192 degrees, 10oz of liquid. In this case, I drank half and left the cup on the warmer.Upon my return, 30-40 minutes later, the coffee was not cold but saying it was warm would been an overstatement.I would have expected a little better from a Mr. Coffee branded Coffee \\"Mug\\" Warmer.

The wattage should be higher. In addition, earlier models had a somewhat higher wattage and an automatic shutoff if the cup was not lifted from the warmer for a period of time, approximately 10 minutes. When the cup was lifted, the timer would reset. Also, when the cup was lifted, the warmer would shut off until the cup was replaced on the warmer. The current model does not have either of these safety features.

This warmer keeps the bottom of my mug ready to drink when I get to it.I got jewelry for Christmas and I love it, but this is the best gift that will truly keep on giving.If you want your full drink to stay piping hot for any time, I suggest don't pour it til you're ready to drink!

Later I happened to cover my mug with a cardboard coaster to keep dust out while I dusted (Yea my computer room doesn't get the care it should from me.

The coffee may stay SLIGHTLY warm (a hair above tepid) for a bit longer than it used to, but it doesn't keep it anywhere close to as warm as it is when it comes out of the pot (or spout, since I use a Keurig).

The plot is not too developed or very interesting for that matter. And the main characters, they come off pretty flat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great romantic humor","review":"I will admit to being a bit overwhelmed in the beginning since it jumped in with all these characters and all this action, but it did not take me long to settle down comfortably in the plot. I adored how Crusie allows the reader a certain amount of imagination when it comes to the lustier moments. The characters had a wonderful blend of humor, intelligence, and chemistry. Also, the plot was interesting and had a few twists and turns, but nothing that seemed outlandishly implausible."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Look Back at Early Crusie","review":"This is a book written by Jennifer Crusie before her blockbuster best-sellers. It's shorter than her recent books (written to that short, digestable romance format), so the characters aren't as well developed as you'll find in \\"Tell Me Lies\\", \\"Crazy for You\\", \\"Welcome to Tempation\\", \\"Fast Women\\". But Crusie is such a solid writer (and was back then, too) she rises above the limiting format and delivers a solid, fast-paced, enjoyable tale. She has a gift for humor and believable, but witty, dialog. You do come to care for the characters. I'd recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So glad i didn't give up on crusie quite yet...","review":"This is definitely one of her better reads. It has a hint of mystery to it, and not to much of her love making writing...."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little rushed","review":"The story line is the typical Crusie formula but plot was weak and felt rushed. Characters fall for each other almost immediately and without reason so the tension between them is lacking in comparison to her other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"same old, same old","review":"I've read a number of Crusie books, and the first few were enjoyable enough fluff, but then they all started to blend together. This was no differetn The stories and characters are WAY too similar book to book, right down to the physical descriptions and situations they find themselves in, the secondary characters, the settings, and even the way it all ends up.Also, I listened to this on audio book, and for the life of me can't figure out why the narrator assigned Lucy's sister a Staten Island-ish accent. If they're sisters who grew up together, why would one have that accent and the other not? It was so stupid it was distracting!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD with one MAJOR problem","review":"After owning and enjoying this CD for over a year I decided to add it to my iTunes folder. BIG MISTAKE. Somehow someway the audio files prevented me from connecting to the iTunes store that serves Las Cruces, NM. Only by entirely removing the audio files was I able to again connect to the iTunes store."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than the Second.","review":"I am a BIG fan of the series and ordered the disk to the second season first, and was disapointed with it. All the heroic upbeat themes that I liked so much in the show just were not on the disk.

Not wicca or CM, so if you're looking for those you might be more pleased with some other selection. But it's good solid folk magic, largely of a mixed African and European flavor.I wouldn't say the book is indispensable for the advanced or intermediate practitioner. It's largely addressed at the beginner. But it's a pleasant read, well organised, and contains more useful practical spells than most books on the market these days.I definitely class it as a good value, especially at the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehhh =/","review":"To be honest I didn't really like this book, it doesn't really have spells just chants and potions and stuff, I would recommend buying somethine else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just OK","review":"I ordered this book because of the good reviews, expecting a great book full of spells.There aren't many spells however, like the cover implies. Instead the author gives his knowledge of herbs, incenses and oils and what each can be used for.Spoken and Written spells seems to give a few spells worth trying, but overall, if you're looking for an actual \\"spell book\\", this isn't the one unless you like to go herb/incense/oil hunting.I returned the book the next day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a favorite book of mine","review":"This book was not a hit for me for serious reading about a century ofspells.

Is seems like someone made them in their basement. I can't attest to whether there is really great sewing info in it, because I can't force myself to keep watching it.The woman is reading from a script like a first grader that just finished hooked on phonics. Extremely monotonous tone, I can't stand to watch her and I keep falling asleep... really falling asleep!Other people had mentioned how boring it was, but I didn't think boring mattered if I just wanted sewing info. Boy, was I wrong.The other goofy thing they do is start \\"showing\\" you how to read the back of a pattern package, but then they forget to zoom in on it so you can't even see what they are pointing to.Why so much money? This video should be a $10 movie (or less)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Outdated Production Hinder Information Presented","review":"Poor production from the early-mid 80's cannot be corrected with a \\"remaster\\" attempt. I purchased it directly from the company a few months back. With the greatest respect for the lady giving the sewing instruction who can be your best friend's mom up the street, the production values are so low and filming techniques so outdated as to be useless to observe. They make use of a mirror on her work surface, a camera does not go right into her work much of the time and contrasts are low. Editing was also very choppy at times. The resolution is so poor that I could not see critical details. It just isn't easy to see what she is doing half of the time.Good solid information is given for beginners but I cannot recommend this product. Not good value for the price. I honestly believe the company should scrap it (and the series assuming the rest are like this) and start over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and old","review":"I was eager to find a DVD that should show me how to sew! But I was dissappointed when I received my DVD. It was probably recorded way back in the 80s. I had really problems following the steps the Lady showed. I found it rather boring to watch, and it is still standing on my shelf, and I'm not sure, if I will ever watch it again. I would rather recommand a sewing class to someone, who wants to learn how to sew, than paying almost 50 $ like I did for this old and boring video. It's not worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I really can make it too!","review":"After reading the reviews on this product I purchased a 2nd hand copy of Level 1 with great reluctance because I was certain I would be bored stiff but I am definitely pleased to share that I found the instruction thorough and well set forth. My husband and 4 children even sat through the entire DVD with me!Truly you would not purchase this for the cinematography or for entertainment quality but it well serves its purpose and that is teaching one to sew and to sew well. I am looking forward to purchasing Levels 2 and 3 next (though as a bargain shopper I wish I could find 2nd-hand versions for $29.99 or less also - LOL)"},{"rating":"1","title":"what you will need to begin to sew","review":"Boring, speaker very unenthusiastic, not enough sewing information"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and hard to watch/listen","review":"Waste of money.

My two-year-old daughter loves going through page by page and naming each activity. My problem is that, except for one Asian, all of the babies and grandpas are white. It doesn't reflect the ethnic mix of America at all. I don't want my daughter assuming that all grandpas look the same.

There is a good span between the uprights to ensure your hands don't hit when replacing the bar. It was easy to assemble. I have decided to remove the leg lift, but it was not in the way. The padding is comfortable and seems durable. I would definitely recommend this bench for a daily workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective Product","review":"The product was delivered on time.

Instead of giving us the same bunch of hogwash about all the things that might help you through menopause, it lists only the things that have been clinically proven with good scientific studies. And the author manages to get this complex (and important) information across with lots of warmth and personal presence. You really feel like you're in her living room talking to her about what really helps get rid of hot flashes or insomnia or a lack of sex drive -- not just what we've already read about over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book that really works!","review":"This well-written, conversational and sensible book provides helpful advice for the perimenopausal woman. Addressing each of the major areas affected by menopause (hormonal, cardiovascular, cognitive/emotional, bone health), Ms. Taylor provides sound, referenced explanations and explores intervention options with the reader including evaluations of efficacy and safety. This book is the Honest Herbal of non-pharmaceutical menopause therapies. I whole-heartedly recommend it not only to women approaching/undergoing menopause, but to their families as well. Additionally, it is an excellent resource for health care practitioners working in the area of women's health who would like to offer their patients non-pharmaceutical intervention options."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too useful","review":"Although the logic sections of this book provide suffiecent tips, the math section lacked depth.

His ideas are sound, though he has a very off-putting pompous delivery. In fact, his verbosity and poor structure is so bad, that it turns what should be a slim read into a fairly mind-numbing experience. The book really needs to go back to an editor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerously flawed","review":"Galbraith is an economist who could only operate in academia--in any other setting he would be a joke. In his many books, which are widely cited, he attempts to provide an economic justification to socialism. The principle flaw in this book, from which all the others radiate out, is that all spending is equal. That government spending is just as productive to the economy as personal or corporate spending. He uses this assumption to justify confiscation of wealth by the government through the tax code. Of course, we know now that most of the taxes collected by the government is at best wasted money, and at worst counterproductive to society (welfare, subsidies, foreign aid to countries that hate us, etc.)All that being said, I highly recommend reading this book. It's important to know the enemy."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is THE BRINK OF TIME. shame on ... for not tel","review":"its not that bad, but it is just nbot chrono trigger and it doesnt keep the feel of the chrono trigger music.

Season Nine is the \\"chick-flic\\" year: close-up on Zoe's recovery from those awful awful episodes with the mumbler Jimmy Olsen and the whiner David Bloom; and, of course, the heavy panting of the sexually-starved Lois Lane.I am ready to admit that Smallville lost its vitality by the end of season 7."},{"rating":"1","title":"upset","review":"NEVER even got my order now they are telling me it is no longer available yeah season 9 of smallville dont think I will be ordering from amazon again!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One episode cannot define a season","review":"Smallville season 9 is downright the worst season of Smallville. The plot is not interesting at all. The plot of Smallville has really gone downhill. However, the finale episode showed great promise. I believe that where smallville really got messed up, was when Micheal Rosenbaum (Lex Luthor) wanted to leave the show. In my opinion \\"Lex Luthor\\" was a big reason why the first 5-7 seasons of Smallville where so good. I think if the producers could convince Rosenbaum to come back, that would turn the show around.Overall, I thought season 9 of Smallville just was not very good, however, I have hopes that the 10th (and final) season will be great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent but incomplete","review":"As a smallville fan, i find this DVD box set excellent, but i would like in the fuiture to find more episodes commented by the actors or the crew, and what happend with the webisodes that use to have smallville, like the chloe chronicles, or somethings like that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smallville","review":"I have a strong connection with excellent speed.

Now imagine you travel to another planet and their atmosphere and gravity are lighter, having been used to heavier gravity you would now be able to fly. And bullets that would destroy and kill the people of that planet would just bounce off you. That is why Kryptonite does not kill Superman, it would be equal to someone from that other planet giving you a rock or piece of earth, it would make you \\"normal\\" or weak.Of course none of this is reality, it is just science fiction fun, but it is the truth behind Superman's powers, not this Smallville nonsense!Let's get the facts straight.

Disturbingly, the main characters have also degenerated with the worst being, most unfortunately, Clark/Superman/Kent. The series appears to have lost its primary focus of Clark becoming the true comic book hero that loyal patrons, the world over, have loved for more than seven decades.

Of course, it's definitely B&W 40s type Hollywoodized stuff but I really enjoyed seeing it again. I've looked at it several times and continue to enjoy the tender love story between these very different people. I don't think I've ever seen Marlena Dietrich in any other movie but I've ordered a set of several others since I liked her in this so much. I guess I always thought she was all accent and smouldering eyes but she was a very good actress and I look forward to seeing the other movies.

One part shows the bullet shot to the top of his head while flying, but yet when you see him with his head bandaged up its wraped around the side of his head for a wound to the top."},{"rating":"1","title":"Historically inaccurate, highly suspect.A Roger Corman film.","review":"While this movie touches on some of the truths regarding Manfred \\"the Red Baron\\" von Richthofen and Roy Brown, the man who supposedly shot him down, it makes up 90% of it's material from popular tripe and the sensationalistic journalism of the era. If you have any interest in Manfred von Richthofen, or the truth, rent The Red Baron (1988 Queststar) instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vov Richthofn Video","review":"Purchased this video for my husband for Christmas. He loved it , But he likes anything with military or World War 2 Air Planes. Hope to get lots of use out of this video."},{"rating":"2","title":"WW1 Flying Movie","review":"This is the story of Baron Manfred Von Richtofen (aka \\"The Red Baron\\") who terrorized the skys over France during WW1 and the Canadian flyer who eventually shot him down. Stars John Philip Law as \\"The Baron\\" and Don Stroud as Lt. Roy Brown. Good flying sequences. Not the best movie but fairly accurate historically. Important to note that in the beginning there was a \\"Code of Honor\\" between the Germans and the Allied pilots. \\"The Great Game\\" as it was sometimes called. As the war progressed and more men died, those who took their place were less interested in honor and more interested in defeating the enemy and surviving to war. In the beginning there was enthusiasm to the flying. Toward the war's end those who survived were cynical and exhausted by what they had seen. Overall a pretty good movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Von Richtofen & Brown","review":"This movie was so full of incorrect facts that we just shut it off and decided that the money spent on it was a total waste as was the time spent watching it. Just a little research would have made a half way credible movie instead of a complete farce."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's no longer the worst movie on the subject","review":"Quite aside from the historical gaffes-- which are many and well documented by others-- it's a really lousy movie because the characters are so clumsy. Everyone is nasty to everyone else. Bad attitudes pass for 'drama.'I thought it was the worst movie on the subject of all time, but have recently seen the newer \\"The Red Baron.\\" While that movie has much nicer airplanes, it has its own long list of historical absurdities-- I think it 'wins' the race to fairy tale.But on top of that, the dialogue is so silly and the editing so chopped up that you can't even follow the storyline.So \\"Von Richthofen and Brown\\" is only the 2nd worst movie on the subject. Still awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who did shoot down the Red Baron? The other side of the coin - in fairness.","review":"To be perfectly fair about it, NOVA's documentary disputes the claim made by Keri Bailey \\"Kilby\\" in the review regarding the death of Manfred von Richtoven - so while Bailey cites undenialble proof - NOVA's documentary shows another side of the story claiming that RAF Flier Roy Brown did not and could not have shot down the \\"Red Baron.\\" It includes autopsy reports and photos which neither showed nor described a head wound as cited by Bailey's claim.This review is made by author of Blood of Scotland, M.E. Grant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Von Richtofen & brown","review":"This movie was not very good. It seemed like a low budget made for 3rd world TV production. The planes were hoaky and most were the wrong type for the time periods portrayed in the story. The story of the Red Baron was incorrect as well, and the ending was totally wrong. For a movie about history it was way off base."},{"rating":"1","title":"What? WHAT?","review":"Great movie. just needed a plot, a script, some acting, some directing, etc. However, seeing those planes fly was nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Von Richthofen & Brown","review":"Hey, just like to point out that Brown did shoot down the Baron. While some people say that he was shot down by allied ground troops, studies proved that he was shot from top down through the head (not from bottom up, because then he would have been killed by ground troops). Brown recieved a medal for his victory. Alot of guys disagree, but when its proven, then its proven, period, end of story. Also: Brown wrote an account of his victory, and describes plainly seeing his tracer through the cockpit of the triplane."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't wast your time on this propaganda","review":"There is some documenting of the workings of the US State Department - but the vast majority of this \\"documentary\\" is putting Mrs. Clinton up on a pedestal. I am very disappointed in National Geographic. Their documentaries are normally more substance and less propaganda."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very nice piece....if you get it out of a vending machine.","review":"I had ordered this for my girlfriends birthday, her birthstone being amethyst i thought i was getting a good deal on a nice piece. I was wrong. The stones have very VERY little purple in them, and frankly it just looks very cheaply made. And that is not the worst of it. When i was opening the box i could hear something jangling around, it turned out to be one of the stones that had already fallen out of the bracelet. I WILL be returning this item and i urge you the customer not to waste your time here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amethyst sterling bracelet","review":"This is made OK. The stones are washed out, no color. Purchased for gifts but will not give them as it will embarrass me. I would have returned them but I was traveling and missed the deadline."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent music and movie","review":"The film has a nice flow and plot. The music is great. It is all geared toward the Italian familia. I love Cher, Nicholas Cage, and Olivia Dukacas in it. They gave great performances. I already loved La Boheme prior to seeing the movie and bought the CD of the movie soundtrack. Anyone wanting to see an enjoyable movie and listen to great music should put this high on your list. It is entertaining and holds your interest, unlike a lot of other movies. It used to be a 4-star movie and is now rated a 3-star movie - but a high 3-star. It is a classic that will be viewed over and over. The music of Puccini will live forever. Once you see the movie, the music flows from scene to scene in your mind.A must buy CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO STARS - DVD IS NO PLACE FOR PAN AND SCAN","review":"It's time we consumers let manufacturers know that we're not going to be ripped-off by substandard DVD releases. Once again, a great film has been compromised by releasing it in it's broadcast master aspect ratio. One would like to think that the public is given more credit for having the intellect to understand the difference between a re-packaged broadcast master and a newly transfered master in the original theatrical aspect ratio.So, here's another DVD that will never be purchased for my collection. I urge you to do the same. One day, they'll get our message and stop trying to rip us off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Viewer from NY","review":"I am in complete agreement with the viewer from MN as to the unfortunate full screen format this DVD version was produced in. What a blunder! What a loss of visual information so important to the script! I have had to make a VHS recording off of TCM when THEY presented the movie in its' Letterbox format. I hope someone smartens-up and rereleases Moonstruck on DVD that delivers all the great cinematography."},{"rating":"2","title":"Medicine for the Soul!!","review":"This film has to be one of the most feel good, charming, and entertaining movies I have ever seen! After a tough day, a bad experience, whatever unpleasantness the world can dish out, \\"Moonstruck\\" has the ability to make it all better. The film takes you to a place where it is all forgotten, at least for the time spent enjoying it. Cher, always wonderful, will put a smile on your face from the first moment you see her. \\"Moonstruck\\" is a movie you will want to own! I watch it at least once a month...it's simply the best!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the letterbox?","review":"Like other reviewers, I'm baffled as to why this is not in letterbox. I can live without super-duper extras, but I have no reason to upgrade from my VHS until a widescreen version is published. The rating is reflective of my dislike of the fullscreen formatting. The movie itself is one of the great romantic comedies-a love letter to love itself, and NYC."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moonstruck","review":"Fabulous movie, can watch it over and over.
