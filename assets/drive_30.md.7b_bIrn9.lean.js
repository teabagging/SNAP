Cold sound design. Cold sounds arranged in such a way that they create music - i think music has a lot to do with time: every track has its own Bpm for example. This album is the demonstration of how you can create something musical by clicks, bips and other cold sounds. The great majority of the tracks here are so minimal that are constructed by two sounds juxtaposed.

The Black and Decker was too small and was just a toaster oven. My Welbuilt was both but it stopped heating aftr 6 months. I love that this one is black like my other kitchen appliances and that it is larger than the other ones I have had. I love to use the toaster oven and the convection oven daily to prepare meals and save on the usage of my large oven. It saves on the utilities. The price was a great price also. I believe anyone would love this oven as I do. It is great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I absolutely LOVE this toaster oven!","review":"This was my first toaster oven. I purchased it because I've never owned one before but use the one at work constantly and one day I decided, hey why not get one for home? This one I had to wait for. I did a search on Amazon for the one that got the best rating and this one was on back order. It was well worth the wait. Not only can I toast bread, bagels and muffins easily, but I've broiled ham, bacon and baked potatoes in this oven with ease. It is user friendly and makes my counter look sleek and modern. Cleaning is a breeze and I put the rack in the dishwasher - cleans right up! Loving my toaster oven. Wouldn't part with it for the world!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oven, not a toaster","review":"I am sure it works fine as an oven, but it really sucks as a toaster. There are only two heating wires on top and on bottom, which are at the very back and front. Because of the gigantic size of the unit, the elements end up too far from the item being toasted. The end result is that some items (tortillas for example) get baked (and totally dried out), rather than toasted."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT","review":"This a great little oven, It reheats food well and cooks food very nicely. I love the toast it makes, it is far superior to a regular toaster. As with all ovens it gets very HOT and should NOT be used by children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good oven, lousy toaster","review":"This toaster oven makes the worst toast I have ever had. It dehydrates the bread without actually browning it, except for the one burnt edge I get on every piece of toast. I burn my hands every day because I have to flip the bread over to get remotely even \\"toasting,\\" i.e. so one side isn't totally dry and the other side soggy. I end up with a hard, dry piece of bread. The control knobs are very counterintuitive and hard to read. Works fine as an oven, but if you like toast, as I do, buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's going on???!!!","review":"2 toaster ovens were ordered. Both arrived on the same day.

It is written well, however."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Didnt Know What I was missing till THIS ALBUM came along","review":"Barely hinted at in the last 182 album, this thing is pure emotional fantasy rock. Powerful and delicate in perfect measures, it harkens back to the new-romantic feel of the 80s, with a nice blink 182 spike... just a spike...God bless Tom Delonge for not giving up, and giving us something very special to listen to for years to come.My faves are 'valkyrie missle' and 'do it for me now'.In my opinion , Angels and Airwawaves is an instant classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"This is a great album! The songs are tight and each one is strong. Lyrics are mature and intelligent, music successfully fuses modern rock with splashes of 80s synth--great combination.I can't pick any stand-out tracks because I enjoyed them all! You will too so get this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"First off I would like to say I have been a huge Blink fan for years. This album has a couple stand out tracks, such as \\"It's Hurts\\" \\" The Adventure\\", and \\"Good Day\\", despite it's bad lyrics. However, for the most part, the songs are melodically devoid. It's almost as if Tom decided to pay more attention to all the crazy sounds he could get on this album rather then actually worrying about the songs structures themselves.You can put all the crazy synth effects you want in a song, but if the core of the song stripped down is bad, then it's a bad song. Hardly a song on here has any interesting hooks, or envokes any emotion. They are all just very mediocre.It amazes me that people can say this is better then Blink, because it doesn't even come close. Two heads are better then one, and the Mark and Tom songwriting team isn't going to be beat by Tom alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"good start","review":"so i picked this album up yesterday on the release date, being a hugeeeeee blink fan and all and i was impressed. a lot of musical has gone into this album and i think tom did a wonderful job with his producing and writing. being the first of the 3 guys to come out with an album, put a lot of pressure on tom. he doesnt want to lose fans, but he wants people to know he has started a new life. anyways this is a good album, shows the other side of tom (other than punk) and i reccomend picking it up. i feel like the songs have a lot of emotion and are sung truly from the heart.good stuff. hopefully one day i can see them live :)Buy \\"We Dont Need to Whisper\\"!!! you wont regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth It?","review":"This cd is totally worth the money. I'm probably one of the biggest fans of Blink 182, Loved em' ever since their first cd. This cd isn't the same as blink 182, but I think it's just as good. It's just as good in a different way. It's like you mixed U2 with the sounds of Tom Delonge. The cd is a masterpeice. The piano's change the sound making it like nothing else. It's not like anything you can get now, it's a one of a kind cd and a must have! Go get it, you won't regret it, trust me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No, it's not Blink-182... That's the point!","review":"Ok everyone, get this straight! Do not compare it to Blink-182, The Distillers, Box Car Racer, or The Offspring. Just because there's members from each band in Angels and Airwaves means jack-squwat! Tom DeLonge said so himself, that it wouldn't sound like any of the band-mates previous work. It was supposed to be this revolutionary sound. Something we've never heard before. Unfortunately, it's not that either. It's a good atempt, but it fell short. Nevertheless, I am not disappointed with the album. Sure it was over-hyped, but almost anything these days is over-hyped. It's still an awesome sounding album, and definately worth the $15."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lives up to Tom's hype...almost.","review":"I'd like to give it 3.75 stars out of 5, but since that is not an option I rounded up to 4. YOU'RE WELCOME AvA.I was pleasantly surprised by this album and I think if you give it a few listens you'll see why. Upon first listen it was ok-good, but it does get better the more you hear it. I don't know why that makes sense, but it does.The first single, The Adventure, was a perfect choice to launch this album. It's addicting without being annoying. Other standouts are Do It For Me Now, A Little's Enough, and The Gift. I'm not a big fan of Distraction however because it gets a little too repetitive.I wasn't expecting to like this album as much as I do. It is definitely worth a listen or two. If you like Boxcar Racer, I think you'll enjoy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Progressive!!!!!","review":"God this album is progressive. Some of the songs go over 5 minutes long and I love it. It's not crappy like Opeth or Dream Theater but it's awesome. Man what beautiful guitars. I'm an experienced guitarist who still can't play this stuff quickly. Forget Opeth or Dream Theater, Angels and Airwaves rules!That was more sarcasm. Angels and Airwaves try to be progressive but fail misreably and can't compete with Opeth or Dream Theater."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bring on the suck","review":"Musically, I thought these guys were pretty good....and then someone started to sing, straight in the trash.

I have been a long Blink 182 fan but Angels and Airwaves is Tom Delonges for mature and meaningful music. The songs have more thought and emotion and has literally changed my life."},{"rating":"2","title":"The ENTIRE CD is great!","review":"I really do like this CD. It is one that I can put in and listen to over and over again and there aren't any songs that I want to skip. It's great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A very big let down","review":"This is just way too contrived and glossed over for me. The minute you start saying the name of your band in the song (more than one time none the less) it can never be a good thing. Almost every song sounds like the one before it. I am guessing the band thinks they made an album that sounds much different than anything else...not so much. What they did was make an album that does nothing groundbreaking or exciting. I expected much more from guys like this. I would not recommend buying this CD and I wish I could return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Wow, im very impressed with this band. The singer has a some-what punk rock sound to his voice. Im not a fan of that kind of sound, however, their music, lyrics, and melody make up for it. The only punk rock band that I really listened to was The Offspring. From what I can hear, im really impressed with this band."},{"rating":"1","title":"From a Blink fan...this is terrible...","review":"First off, I laugh at how the members of Blink-182 are trying to lengthen their popularity. It's over guys face it, you ran out of material.I DO like Blink-182 but I will not allow myself to like the terrible medicore music that they will continue to pop out. Let's face it, I'm sure you thought their last CD was very mainstream & mostly vomit-inducing. I can't listen to a cd where all the songs have the same 3 notes in it. It's like hearing \\"Ba-Ba-Black Sheep\\" for an hour straight...This CD is a terrible disc for Blink fans and for any music fan period. Bands need to know when to quit because this cd is so similiar you'll wanna kill youself. Emo-horrific. And that was only after I listened to 3 songs completely through. The intros for every song are too long and boring. While every song carries the same monotone sound...God...Don't waste your ears"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"This album is almost as bad as Courtney Love's America's Sweetheart. All of the songs sound the exact same, they sample the beats of The Adventure. They even have the same lyrical structure and tune as The Adventure. I consider myself an old school Blink182 fan, Box Car Racer fan, and even more a fan of The Distillers. I anxiously awaited this release from one of 90s punk's guitar greats, and was greatly dissappointed. I am not trying to get a refund on this cd. So far no such luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"jerk","review":"Tom is a friggen jerk - why waste your time listening to someone who does not care about making music - at least thats why Tom broke blink up - this album feels just as tired as he was of blink."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great But Derivitive","review":"Next to Coldplay's X&Y this is probably the best U2 ripoff I've ever heard. It sounds great. They are maturing lyrically, which means they should reach adulthood soon. It's a great album, but sometimes I wonder if they should be paying royalties to The Edge."},{"rating":"2","title":"4.5 stars: Very impressive...","review":"I wouldn't call this the best of 2005, but in a world of Radiohead and U2-wannabe bands, Blink-182's Tom DeLonge released an album that, while still loaded with catchy riffs and hooks, manages to leave in the dust most of the pop-rock material out there nowadays.There are enough layers of sound and worthwhile instrumental intros and transitions to keep demanding listeners engaged, while the material is not out of reach from those more in tune with pop-rock sounds. With the opening track and \\"It Hurts\\" as the best tracks, the only thing about it would be that it can get a tad repetitive after a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"one big problem with this cd is...","review":"is not how the beats sound. every track has a new and refreshing beat to it, nice twists, makes for a great sound! however, when Tom starts to sing each song, it all starts sounding exactly the same. it's like a whole album of one song. it was very hard for me to distinguish one song from another cause of Tom's voice. they needed someone else to come in at some point. it's nothing like Blink 182 or +44 and I give them props for trying something new. after a few listens u can sorta tell the difference but it doesn't make them good tracks. I like 4 of the 10 songs now which is why it gets 2 starts! however, I don't think this is worth your money. +44 has a much better sound and the songs are more catchy and you can immediately tell the difference between one song and another! so I would advise you to get their album over Angels & Airwaves. though I still do admire Tom's efforts, it just doesn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"influenced by...Rush? Maybe just a little...","review":"I heard \\"The Adventure\\" and really liked it. I can't really say the same for the rest of the CD. A lot of people seem to love it and that's great; I'm just not one of those people. In my opinion, the songs all sound the same, and with the exception of \\"The Adventure\\" just aren't very good. It sounds like some kind of futuristic, progressive sounding experiment in music and I think it would have been better if it was just more rock. However, I would have settled for it just being more...good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some artists CAN amaze you","review":"I can honestly say I was never a fan of Tom or Blink-182. I was a fan of Travis Barker and his drumming, and that was about it, so when I heard Tom had put together another band, I just kinda blew it off. A friend told me I had to hear this album, so I threw it in, and needless to say, I was kind of blown away. This album shows off musical talent people could have never heard in Blink-182. It's smooth, flowing, and almost uncategorizable. Anyone can love this album, even people who hated Blink-182. If you have the slightest bit of ear for music, and appreciate originality, check this out!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing special","review":"This album never really goes anywhere. Most of the songs never reach a peak. There really arent any choruses that hit you. However, Tom really did try and it shows.The good: The Adventure, Do It For Me Now, It HurtsThe bad: the rest of the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good.","review":"For those of you who keep saying that their music is \\"too long,\\" it's because you have different expectations of the album. It's not a Blink-182, pop-rock album that you can head bang to. It's a more artistic piece. I think that it's great that bands these days are taking that route, instead of just producing 2:30 radio hits. Good job to these guys and good luck in the future. Hopefully they can put out some nice stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Based On The First Listen","review":"I'm trying to be reasonable about this album. Perhaps my opinion is influenced by the fact that I only had like 4 hours of sleep and I'm quite groggy...The thing is, I didn't buy thisexpecting another Blink album. I heard \\"The Adventure\\" single and liked it so I expected alot of keyboards and stuff. Well there are plenty of \\"keyboards\\" but these songs aren't too catchy and this cd is kind of depressing. I really think he tried to hard to capture an \\"epic\\" mood. Alot of the songs sound the same, but then again, alot of Blink songs sound the same. I dunno. I won't say it sucks, but it's definitely lacking... I'm a huge fan of Blink (moreso the earlier stuff) so I won't give up on them. Perhaps this was just a shaky start..."},{"rating":"1","title":"This music is horrible.","review":"Tom done lost his mind. After nearly destroying Blink182, he went on to form this band, determined to change the world somehow. The only thing he changed was his hair and his outfits. This is overproduced, euro-pop, U2-wannabe music with very little substance. Tom without Mark is half of a whole. I used to think he was a darn good musician, but after listening to this, I began to wonder: Did Mark and Travis come up with all the good music in Blink182? I tried to listen to this about 3 times, but I just could not get passed the 4th or 5th track. It is AWFUL. And to think they made another album... that sounded just like this one!

My last Timex had a similar band that disintegrated after a year and a half. I hate these integral watch bands! I need a digital watch with a timer because my toddler needs transition time ( \\"Three minutes then we have to go home from the park!\\"). I bought it in a stylish periwinkle blue because I get tired of the ugly gray and black bands, many digital watches have. The band is comfortable and I don't have to take it off to shower, etc, but it has turned from blue to an ugly greenish gray color. So, even though the watch works fine, I will have to buy a new watch because it looks awful. I don't want all the features as on an Ironman Timex, and my husband has forbidden me from buying a cheap watch of another brand because the instructions never work to set it.

Also, the movie poster is when I remember from my childhood when renting vhs was a part of culture. Anyway, I watched the rater R version of this movie and it really sucked. It looked like they held back so much and i'm hoping to see an uncut dvd of this soon. The main character, Curt, is very annoying and just makes me want to turn this film off. He loves Julie so much and keeps her alive even though she is a zombie. Julie looked hot though and with less then half an hour left, she looked smoking hot in a sick, twisted way.

This film loses momentum minute by minute. A terrible conclusion to a fine series. ONe can only hope that a fourth installment is released to save this series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best horror movies I've ever seen","review":"This movie has to be one of my favorite movies. It was better than the first two movies and it has some really good special effects in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad sequel","review":"This movie had very few zombies (except for the end), and the zombies were all weird looking, not like normal zombies. And the main girl zombie can talk and run. A zombie does not run!

A horror classic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool nr. 3 !","review":"The third installment in the \\"Return of..\\"series and a cool one. The first one was kind of a spoof of the Romero classic \\"Night of the Living Dead\\" and there was more stuff to laugh about that to be frightened.This third one is a good horror movie with your occasional scare and some good gorey FX. The story is rather simple but cool none the less.This guys girlfriend dies and he brings her back to life in his father's lab where he is experimenting on zombies. The girl gets rather sadistic and instead of eating flesh, she's starting to torture herself by sticking glass and other stuff into her well shaped body. A must buy for the nr. 1 horror fan !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cringe-worthy moments!","review":"Yes I miss the unrated version but I am happy to have a copy. Like all the RTOLD 1 and 2, this movie has government experiments, cover-up, reanimated dead, melting people, brain eating gore, love, courage, and some cringe worthy moments. I dont think this movie needs any humor like the first two did, and that this movie is the best of the three. Need brain, MORE brain!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Where is the unrated version?","review":"It's a shame I have to drag out my old unrated VHS tape of this to catch all the gore. I waited a long time for this to come out on DVD and we get the cut \\"R\\" version. It's still gory as all get out but is missing a few scenes that I need to be happy. Whoever released the \\"R\\" version on DVD dropped the ball."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll keep my VHS, thanks.","review":"I have Return Of The Living Dead 3 uncut and unrated on VHS. Why upgrade to the cut \\"R\\" rated DVD? This disk is damaged goods in my opinion, and with all the companies striving to restore films for DVD, releasing a movie in it's cut form just shows me that the manufacturer is more interested in making a quick buck than a quality product. VHS may not have the picture quality of DVD, but at least it's complete.Scott R"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best zombie films ever made","review":"The acting, for the most part, is quite servicable, but several characters really stand out. Particularly Melinda Clarke's character, Julie, who goes from a wild child to a flesh-eater with a concience.Some have complained that this film diverted from the first two films. To that I say \\"SO?\\".It was either divert from the formula, or go stale. There are tons of Zombie on the loose films (ROTLD, NOTLD, Dawn of the Dead, Zombie, etc.), so the choices for someone wanting to watch more in that vein are many. Considering that the second ROTLD film wasn't a sequel either, then I dunno why people are complaining.I highly recommend this film for its outstanding gore effects, good performances, and interesting plot development."},{"rating":"1","title":"This film needn't be watched","review":"I saw the film and was very dissapointed. It was completely different than the 2 parts before. All of my friends told me that this film 'd be bad, but I didn't believe it 'till I saw it. I hoped it would be better because the first part was definitely the best horrorfilm ever made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goofy, but brilliant","review":"This movie is well done with a bit of drama, romanticism, and gore. You can't go wrong with this film, sure takes you back to the classic 80's horror."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's NOT the zombies that need brains...","review":"Never too keen on zombie movies, but I checked out the video cover and it looked pretty good in a tongue-in-ghoulish-cheek way, but what we get is a sort of 'Romeo and Juliet' scenario, in an abysmal zombie flick. The F/X are not too brilliant and the characters can be somewhat empty and un-interesting. However Mindy 'The Killer Tongue' Clarke is very, very sexy (for a zombie!) and it had a nice touch with acclaimed horror director Anthony Hickox (Warlock: the armageddon, Hellraiser 3: Hell on Earth) making a cameo as a doctor who becomes a zombie (\\"..Dr. Hickox has been killed!!\\"). As zombie films go, it's not too bad, it also seems very 80's for a film made in the 90's and to be honest it's nothing new."},{"rating":"1","title":"a needless sequel","review":"i liked the first2 rotld movies but this one is not as fun as the others.There are few zombies in this movie but okay special effex if you are watching the unrated version"},{"rating":"1","title":"With this being the 2nd WORST film of ALL TIME,...","review":"somehow a 1 star rating seems a little too high. And considering that Troma Studios actually made movies better than this is even more disturbing. This movie has an amazingly cheesy story that defames the term \\"plot\\", the characters are flat and one-dimensional, and the zombies behave almost like normal humans. The best part of the movie is when the Army brat and his girlfriend go into the incinerator because then you know the movie is finally over. If you want to see a zombie movie, Please see Night of the Living Dead (1990). That movie at least has redeeming qualities, such as plot, depth, good acting, chemistry among the characters, and constant intensity. If you want to see an annoying waste of film, watch this. Otherwise, give this \\"film\\" a wide berth and spend your money on a good, or at least tolerable, film."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 and 2 were great, 3 is a letdown","review":"If you like these kind of movies like I do then you probably have bad taste (peter jackson is a genius)as it is, but if you like this 3rd installment then you have Michael Bolton bad taste. NOTD3 had nothing that made the first two so good. There were no mass of zombies taking over a town, no zombies spouting off funny one liners and worst of all, how could they not bring back Frank and Freddie after making them the stars of the first two. The other reviews talk about what made 3 so much better than 2 is that the plot was so different from the 1st and I say that is exactly what makes this film so bad. The only way you will like this film more is if you got a necro thing going on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great films, terrible quality","review":"How many ways can we re-package and sell the same terrible prints and insipid soundtracks?Well, the great rip-off continues. These are early Chaplin films taken from lousy prints and with random awful soundtracks added on. This is cheap for a reason. Unfortunately, all the dvds of the Keystone films use the same crummy sources for the films, so until somebody gets off their duff and restores these fine films, we have to deal with this. But we don't have to like it!!Don't buy these dvds. Don't encourage these guys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charlie Chaplin 57 Classics","review":"It's not cheap to get good Chaplin shorts but this set is still very good. It's weird because I have a few other dvds of Chaplin with the shorts on them and they are very good quailty while these prints are passable. I watched these on a Hi-Def tv and these shorts look very good; I dont have a Blu-Ray player yet but I wonder what it would do for this movies. The extra disc that is placed in a slipcase on the side is The Chaplin Puzzle narrated by Burgess Meredith, and it's a very well done film with a remastered version of Police. Overall, a cheap set but still very good considering the shorts are almost 100 years old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought","review":"The two stars given are only because I love Charlie Chaplin. As for this collection, most of the pictures are in bad condition and the heads are cut off of the majority of Charlie's earlier classics. It makes it very frustrating to watch.

It looks like they cranked up the compression, as there is a ton of compression artifacting. I could barely stand to watch the DVD in some places due to the little dancing color squares. If you are a fan of Sneakers, get the VHS version and avoid the DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it","review":"This is by far my favorite movie. And on DVD its even better. Great plot and excellent cast. The movie's portrayal of the government is quite right. Great movie. Every one should watch it once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie with one flaw","review":"I love this one. Lots of suspense, a few twists, some comedy, and even a little romance. Too bad there is so much swearing. That's the only drawback--parents, you will need to edit this before showing it to your kids! Love the characters, and this movie is one of Robert Redford's finest."},{"rating":"2","title":"This one deserve more playing time....","review":"This is such an entertaining film, but how often do you stumble across it on one of the movie channels, or any channel for that matter? Great ensemble cast, lots of humor, but still enough plot and drama to satisfy a wide range of movie watchers. Each of the characters (the \\"good guys\\") has his or her quirks that makes each one memorable, and also invaluable in some way to getting the job done. One premise, that decisions that we make can stay with us for the rest of our lives and influence so many other decisions that we make, is well illustrated by Redford's character. Great interactions and witty banter among the lead actors. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie bought from a poor source.","review":"While I have seen this movie many many times, and I consider it one of the greatest of all time. I purchased the DVD to replace a lost copy. I received a 24 hour rental as well. Little did I know that if I am not a Kindle or Apple fan that I am not allowed to watch this video on my device or even on my computer it seems.Very displeased, and will not order another video or DVD for that matter from Amazon. I also ordered \\"Hackers\\" at the same time in video format, cant even download it to watch on my local machine. No different than the lock-in provided by iTune's. From now on if it is not in the Google Play store I will order a DVD and burn a digital copy for the mobile devices. Way to go Amazon, the # 1 selling Mobile OS (Android) that has allowed you to prosper in the Mobile market has been locked out from your services. Thanks. At least I had free two day shipping so I can have the DVD to watch this weekend."},{"rating":"1","title":"PC Users Beware","review":"Sneakers is, without a doubt, one of my all time favorite movies. However, this DVD has some serious problems if you intend to view it on a PC DVD-ROM drive. A file allocation error renders the first half of the movie unreadable to most PC DVD drives (precise technical details are widely availible on the internet). This is not a problem for most standalone players. So if you're like me and use your PC as your DVD player, I'd suggest looking into the VHS edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"a classic.","review":"A truly great older film.

Twenty odd years later he heads a close-knit group for hire by banks and whatnot who want their security systems tested to the limit. I knew guys like that in college, one of whom was hired by the university computer center after he hacked its Univac 1108 as a high school student. Others guys I knew developed an algorithm that found the masters keys to virtually every university building. Redford's character and cohorts, played by Dan Aykroyd (as an eccentric conspiracy kook) and Sydney Poitier (as a level-headed old hand who they have given the nickname \\"mother\\"), find more than just irate university administrators threatening to shut down their honors dorm! A vast conspiracy is afoot and its aim is to break into every computer system in the world and suck out vast sums of money at its leisure--and only Redford and his buddies stand in its way!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fresh and Fun Thrillride","review":"What do you get when you put a half-dozen great actors together to make a movie?

Time passed and since all dvd were low quality, I didn't get a chance to see this movie since then.As for the hd dvd , let me say that from today's point of view, the movie has lost a bit of interest since the edge technologie used in sneakers looks a bit outdated today. This point apart, the movie is still fun and the quality is excellent. The image is extremely clear even in the dark scenes. Sound is good average. If, like me, this movie sounds a ring, it's certainly worth the buy...otherwise, it's for redford's fan only."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Caper Movie","review":"I can't be entirely objective in as much as I played a small role in the making of this motion picture. Sneakers is one of the best caper movies made in decades. Each year, it runs 24/7 on in-house channels at Defcon conferences in Las Vegas. Part of the fun is to try to find the subtle, deliberate technical errors designed into the movie so it wouldn't become a training film for criminals. Sneakers is highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sneakers on DVD","review":"My husband and I are always on the lookout for movies that we both like, as well as our adult children, who like to have occasional movie nights at our house--movies that are not full of profanity or lewdness or terrible violence and are immensely enjoyable. This is a tricky combination to satisfy. We saw \\"Sneakers\\" recently on TV and realized how really clever and fun a movie it is--definitely one that filled the above criteria. When we decided to try to purchase the DVD for our collection, we went straight to Amazon. How quickly we had this entertaining movie in our home! It is in great condition. We immediately planned a movie night and watched it (again).

Usually there is at least something memorable about a character or a plotline. However, re-reading the synopsis six months after having read the book, I don't remember anything about the story, the characters or even reading the book.

When the movie was first released, I remember, there weren't too many takers. The song 'Babam babam bam bhole', composed by Bappi Lahiri, was a moderate hit, and so was the title track sung by Anup Jalota. But the movie is indeed watchable because of the wry social comment that has been packaged intelligently as an over-the-top comedy. It is based on an acclaimed Bengali play by Manoj Mitra, which was first filmed in Bengali by Tapan Sinha as 'Banchharamer Bagan' (considered by many as a cult Bengali classic). Though the compulsions of mainstream Hindi cinema redeems the delicate flavor of the original work to some extent, yet Isi Ka Naam Zindagi deserves to be seen as a delectable comedy with a heart, and also for the fine performances of Aamir Khan, Farha Naaz and Pran."},{"rating":"2","title":"funniest yet","review":"I have seen almost all of George Carlin's videos and this is by far my favorite.

I found the book slightly sided against israel but this may be due to my own pro-Israel bias or because Israel has more cards to play.. in any case the book is written in an entertaining, fast-reading fashion and raises some points that i had not thought of before such as Israeli industry (cellphone, cigarette etc.) interest in continuing the occupation over an economically independent 2nd state."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was expecting something more academic & less anecdotal","review":"The author makes good points and appears to know of which he speaks. He is unbiased and concludes largely that the difference between the jews and palestinians is (largely) a factor of ... P.R. I was, however, expecting a more academic approach to the issue instead of the author's own personal observations and reflections on history. The text read as if you were talking to the author ... which leads me to my next point ...I have a background in editing and proof reading and was really, really, (really) distracted by the author's writing style. He never met a hyphen, elipses, or parenthetical that he didn't like.

He fails to mention the 3 nos of Khartoum \\" no negotiation, no recognition ,no peace\\" with which the Arab States answered Israel's forthcoming offer to evacuate the territories in 1967.His choice of title is interesting. It apparently refers to the four questions in the Passover Seder. The motif of four runs throughout this symbolic meal.

Many veteran citizens of the Middle East, historians who have studied the subject for years, people of good will who have striven to make peace (among them the vast majority of the citizens of Israel) hearing this can only wonder if Mr. Cramer has any brain at all.This book is a scandalous piece of defamation of a country which has struggled for its existence with great courage and decency ever since its founding. The author allies himself, wittingly or not with the most backward totalitarian forces in the world today in this unfair attack on the Jewish state."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti-Semitic and Ignorant","review":"Looks like Mr.Cramer has had no education whatsoever and never read any historic books and articles except those published by pro-Arab authors who provide intentionally false and fake information on the Middle East history. The historic Jewish land of Palestine has been occupied by Arabs for centuries and Arabs have committed ethnic cleansing against Jews with the obvious and clever spelled objective which is exterminating them. They invented new ethnic group \\"Palestinians\\" and have fooled entire world through massive Geobbels-stile propaganda that this is their land and Jews never lived there. The Cramer's book lies in-line with this propaganda.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sloppy piece of junk","review":"Cramer's book is a crude diatribe that is superficial, often sloppy, and badly one-sided. His insults of Israel's leaders and contempt for its citizens betray him as a one-sided hack disguised as a journalist. This book has one audience only: left wing supporters of suicide bombers and other terrorists. Anyone with a mind will see it for what it is: a joke!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A perfect read in 2006","review":"This book is entertaining even on such a somber subject. In light of the recent PBS Frontline special on the recent election in Israel and on the stunning reversal of the newly elected leader with even Sharon (before his coma)on returning occupied territories the book is right on for understanding today. This book explains it all from an insider of sorts. Cramer gives us examples from his own reporter type interviews. He is Jewish yet seems to empathize with both the Palestinian and Jewish sides. It is not meant to be a scholarly history(although he does document who he is talking to) it is like a conversation with a friendly knowledgeable insider and has answered \\"what were they thinking and why?\\" on the sometimes, to me, unexplainable positions and actions of today. It was a fast and interesting very interesting read."},{"rating":"2","title":"An extremely helpful book","review":"This book is a wonderful introduction to the conflict -- like having a knowledgeable friend tell you what's really going on. It's so hard to trust a lot of the rhetoric. So often any principled criticism of Israel is dismissed as anti-semitic, as you can see in some of the wackier reviews on this page, so it's hard to find out what's really going on unless you read the Israeli papers, which are a lot more fair. Richard Ben Cramer is a great writer and is hard on BOTH sides. He cuts through so many myths, and his writing is always a pleasure to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bitter, cynical and angry man","review":"I bought this book with an open mind, and was sorely disappointed.

Essentially, the book is full of mistakes, some so essential that you can't help but wonder wether the author really has any clue at all.

I truly recommend it to anyone who is not satisfied with the media coverage.I respect the author for being honest and brave to tell stories that few journalists would touch. These topics seem to be taboos for average journalists and I think Mr. Ben Cramer being Jewish helps in many ways.I very much appreciated learning more about the people of Israel. All we hear about in the media is the bombing statistics on the two sides. But this book describes ordinary and some not so ordinary people and their lives, as well.This book is very easy to read, as I think the author has full grasp of the topic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting - But Unabashedly Biased","review":"For someone with still unformed opinions about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, I found this book to be a dangerous primer - unabashedly biased and shockingly slanted. While the writing style is engaging and intersting, the message is almost propagandistic. Only the Palestinian side is addressed with any sympathy - Israeli victims of terror are ignored and it is plainly unbalanced. It appears that most of the reviewers' on Amazon are letting their political opinions interfere with their objective review of the text. Needless to say, the issue is quite heated and this book does nothing but fan the flames. If you already have strong opinions and don't want to be bothered by a book that presents facts on both sides or has even the pretense of journalistic integrity, then this book is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book doesn't offer any substance","review":"I agree with the criticisms posed in the New York Times, Washington Post, Boston Globe, Chicago Tribune, and other book reviews. This book is factually inaccurate. It oversimplifies a complex issue and presents an erronious conclusion. Author Richard Ben Cramer shows his dislike for Israelis with angry generalizations, while he demeans Palestinians by presenting them as some modern day \\"noble savage.\\" He ignores Hamas and other terrorist groups who are committed to eliminating the state of Israel when he presents his view, gained after \\"ten minutes of thought,\\" that achieving peace is as simple as Israel pulling back to its insecure pre-1967 lines.

It's very unusual to really care about the main characters in a sitcom, but Peter and Assumpta really got to me. Stephen Tompkinson and Dervla Kirwan were fantastic! Which was why I was so furious at the ending. It didn't even fit in with the rest of the series and seemed to me like the writers, or whoever, were trying to get revenge on two actors who wanted to leave the show early. It left me feeling very sad and just.... deflated. I might not have watched it at all if I'd known this was going to happen. Not sure If I'll order the fourth series when it comes out, or not.

Complete with amazing stone work, a fountain, and firepots. We have spent many nights at their house just relaxing, which isn't something that comes to us naturally. I have many, many health problems and struggle with daily pain and it sure is nice to be able to go home to sit and visit out on the back and just be with my family.Dad loves nature sounds but being in Odessa, Fl you dont get much \\"nature\\" except for misquitos...so I got him this cd to play through the outdoor speakers and man did he go nuts. This was a gift for them to celebrate their anniversary and the completion of all of his hard work.I have intentions of getting him a few more cds from this series for Father's Day.

I just received it today, and \\"tried\\" to listen to it, however found myself needing to shut it off about half way through due to one repetitive annoying bird that chirped the same chirp like a broken record.That being said, I own 2 other CDs by this company (Thunderstorm and Ocean Waves) and they are Excellent. It was because I loved Thunderstorm so much that I ordered Ocean Waves and Morning Songbirds!I still say this company makes great nature sound CDs, but I'm going to send this one back.

That is his worship of the Officer Corps of the Armed Services. In his novels, he portrays the Enlisted Man as a personna who is not capable of resolving any difficulty without the \\"expertise\\" of an Officer. He should take notes from real authors such as, William Manchester and Clancy. However, If the H.L.Menken school of Writing advice still exists( you will never go broke Underestimating the taste of the public) Then Griffin should continue to make money with his scribblings."},{"rating":"1","title":"A long way from his best","review":"I am generally a fan of the various Griffin series, but I just can't like this book. It's the first Griffin book I wasn't really eager to get back to reading.I think my biggest problem is the fragmented way that two stories are being told. We get a few pages each in different locations telling what's happening on an operation in Europe from several viewpoints. That's fine and somewhat normal for Griffin. The problem is that these snippets are also interspersed with some reports on what's happening on a different operation in the Pacific. With minor exceptions, the only connection is that they are occurring at the same time. Neither of them depends on the other in any way that I could see. This organization both detracts from the flow and reduces the space which could have been spent on either operation.It also seems that this series isn't as well developed as The Corps and Brotherhood of War."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful sacred songs","review":"playing these beautiful songs along with your prayers can heal and transfrom a space. why not?"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is get-down, funky, beautiful, soulful, Taj at his best","review":"From the very beginning, the Calypsonians, this CD grabs ahold of you. I listen to it in my car but I mainly listen to it while I stretch out and do yoga after I walk in the mornings. The 3rd cut, Sacred island, is a particularly haunting and beautiful instrumental that combines slack guitar, ukelele, kalimba, flute and saxophone in the most natural way. I can barely describe the effect this CD has on me every time I listen to it. I've always been a Taj fan (since I saw him in San Francisco in 1971 at the Boarding House where he sang to my fussy baby (now 28 yrs old). Every CD he puts out pushes the \\"coolness\\" envelope a little further and this is no exception. Thanks, Taj, and fans, don't miss it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More great sounds from an accomplished artist","review":"It's not every day you get to experience a new sound from an old friend. Sacred Island by Taj Mahal and the Hula Blues Band is the kind of CD that you want to play again and again. It's catchy rhythyms fused by Tajs love of Hawaiian Music blended together for upbeat arrangements.Outstanding cuts include \\"Cocunut Man\\", \\"Sacred Island\\" and the traditional blues offering \\"Mailbox Blues\\". Not a bad song in the bunch and the only reason I gave it 4 stars was that it didn't have more tracks. An excellent effort from a master of blues.

Vincent Price reads from some obscure and seemingly incoherent script as melodies and synthesized weirdness pour out of the background. Here, Disco is fused with trance and then becomes something very unique and alluring. There are touches of Eno and Byrnes collaboration of My Life in the Bush of Ghosts album, which by the way was the first to incorporate the truly \\"found sounds\\" concept of song structure. This work was of it's time in the art world back in the late seventies, as this music is to the CPU driven 3D creationists of the 00's.

Yes, she sings in Cho Dependent, but the songs were too long. Also, as much as an advocate for the gay life as anyone, I didn't need to hear about the anal-ness. I have always celebrated her as a woman but I think she may be upset with her own life, somehow, to promote so much gay as opposed to any other orientation. There were a few moments that made me chuckle, but perhaps she's done. I think she's brilliant, but unhappy, and that's my two cents. Huge Disappointment!!!

He is even quite funny as he gives an acting class that focuses entirely on pushing yourself ahead in Hollywood.On the disappointing side though is the underwhelming handling of Quinn's injuries after a car wreck which should have been fatal.

Despite this overriding negative tone, the book has some very clear strengths. The book activily explores the interlocking connections of our world, connecting life, to soil, to air, to water, and all of them together. She explains those connections by the transfer of pesticides through the environment and food chains, but that concept transfers outside of pesticides too.Although this book may have some exceedingly pesismistic points to it, it does have historical value, and some strong scientific value."},{"rating":"2","title":"The New Awakening","review":"Silent Spring, written by Rachel Carson was presented to the world half century ago. Although old, this book is a new overview and reflection of the power humans have to destroy. The book does not only give detailed information about each kind of pesticide, but it also presents a general picture of what the world might become if we don't stop the imprudent use of these deadly chemicals. This book set a precedent for modern biologists and ecologists. It also changed the view that mankind had toward the lethal weapons it didn't know how to use. Thanks to the advice and research of Rachel Carson, innovative ways of handling pesticides have been developed and human concern for the environment has been greatly awakened in the last half of the century. This is a magnificient work in which not only information has been recopilated, but also expresses human nature and sense for preserving our only home and partners, the animals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dated but Still a Relevant Warning","review":"Chemicals are not dangerous and there is no such thing as global warming.

But it is true. Thanks to Carson's ability to paint a picture of dying birds and mutating children with the ink of lies and now-discredited studies, probably more people have died of malaria than Hitler killed in WW2. DDT will never be available again thanks to the slander it received here in this book, and malaria is again able to kill tens of thousands of people each year in undeveloped countries.West nile virus? Probably wouldn't be here if we had DDT.Here's the deal, if you read this book and you already think DDT is bad, you'll agree with this book. If you have an open mind (and who really does anymore?) and read this book, and fact-check the book, you'll find that Rachel Carson committed a crime against humanity."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a tragedy","review":"This book is responsible for the deaths of several million people.Largely due to the fallout from this book, DDT was banned worldwide. Even though the ban was based on shoddy and now discredited science, this book sparked the popular imagination and chemoparanoia of scientific illiterates everywhere. As a consequence, a cheap, effective, and SAFE pesticide was denied to the poorest countries who needed it most. Malarial mosquitoes that were just beginning to come under contol instead rebounded, and rates of malaria -- often fatal in poor countries -- skyrocketed. Millions have died as result.Of course, none of this mattered to Ms. Carson, or to her legions of acolytes. To them, feeling good about supposedly \\"pwotecting the enviwoment\\" was more important about getting their facts right, and infinitely more important than the lives of the people their carelessness has cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong then and wrong now...","review":"Rachel Carson forgets to mention the huge benefits that pesticides have brought the world and massively overplays their supposed downside. Even the hated DDT has almost certainly saved millions of lives by helping to eradicate malaria in many parts of the now developed world. Pesticide use has resulted in a far higher fruit yield than would otherwise have been possible allowing more people to eat more fruit - and as everyone knows, fruit contains many anti-cancer substances. Set against this, the slight cancer risks caused by using pesticides,if there are any at all, are more than worth paying."},{"rating":"1","title":"No longer a classic, read the truth","review":"Read about the scourge of Malaria and people who could've been saved by DDT.

We have new technology that allows us to rid ourselves of certain pests that we did not have in the 1950's and 1960's. With new methods we have created new problems and eliminated a few of the old ones. Books should be recomended that discuss current problems rather than outdated ones. Although this book was a pioneer in alerting the country of environmental hazards it overexagerates situations to unrealistic levels. It does however suggest a few natural ways to rid communities and farms of certain insects.

After it, and the subsequent ban on DDT, millions of people have suffered and died needlessly. For example, in Sri Lanka in 1948, there were 2.8 million malaria cases and 7,300 malaria deaths. With widespread DDT use, malaria cases fell to 17 and no deaths in 1963. After DDT use was discontinued, Sri Lankan malaria cases rose to 2.5 million in the years 1968 and 1969, and the disease remains a killer in Sri Lanka today.Carson' science is dodgy, her conclusions false and her prescriptions plain wrong.

Because of the ban on DDT which largely resulted from Silent Spring, the WHO has estimated that around 20 MILLION children have died of malaria.DDT was, & still is, one of the very best insecticides to control mosquitoes, the sole transporter of this deadly disease. Best of all, DDT is very NON-toxic to humans.The need for DDT is so urgent that even the Sierra Club is justifying it's use inside houses in malaria stricken locations of Africa, South America, & Asia.Way to go Rachel.

You can never go wrong with Karen Robards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"Have read most, if not all, of Ms. Robards' novels and found this one to be a major disappointment. I found the central romance to be way too far beyond the bounds of possibility---even within the romance genre. Instead of developing one strong theme, she threw a surplus of subplots and diversions into the mix---reminding me of an overly-decorated Victorian parlor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I read half of the book and found it to be only a sex manual. The story plot is shallow and could have been written in a few pages. Why does she feel the need for detailed sexual experiences? If the story is good, such details are not necessary. Didn't she use the same type of \\"hidden\\" villian in a previous book? An earlier book with the horse farm background was much more interesting. Most earlier books were better than the recent ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paradise County","review":"This is the first work of Karen Robard that I have been disappointed in. The characters were lacking something. I could not finish this book. I have enjoyed most of her works."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst book ever written","review":"I have read many books in my time, but this has to be the all time worst. If this is supposed to be a love story with a twist, all I can say is \\"no thank you\\". The insert on the inside cover is to me, very misleading. Granted, it does say that \\"bad things\\" happen in the book, but does not indicate just how twisted the plot is. I could not even get to the end of the book, it was so disturbing. Someone else read the last part and told me who \\"did it\\". He too, agreed that the things the person did to others in the book, were so horrid that it was enough to give even the most seasoned reader nightmares. It is the ultimate how to book, when it comes to what unspeakable things one person can do to others!"},{"rating":"1","title":"is there a 0 star??","review":"Sick,. sick,. sick,.

Fortunately, I didn't pay for it or waste more of my time by reading the entire trashy book!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"needlessly cruel, needfully trite","review":"Not only was I very disapointed in this book - I was also replused by it. What is this prevailing trend in romantic suspense that predicates a really Sick and Twisted Villian??? In this particular book Ms. Robards seems compelled to up the ante by having her bad guy commit an egregious act of animal cruelty - on paper or not, it was needlessly cruel and violent and did not need to happen for the story to unfold. And what a story it is...Poor Little Rich Girl and the Virile Stablehand - there's even the predictable sub-plot romance. How trite and how not very interesting - I've read this story millions of times and 999,999 of them have been better written. Save your money and donate it to an animal cause on behalf of \\"Karen Robards\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Romantic suspense done right!","review":"Not sure what's up with these reviews, I loved this book! One of my favorites of hers. The romance between Alex & Joe was SUPER HOT. Alex is adorable and sassy and gorgeous, and Joe is manly and strong and they are perfect together. Plus the subplots of his children, who are great, Alex's little sister (who makes the story along w/ Joe's oldest son) - plus the first suspense story that actually pulls off suspense as well as a creepy factor. The romance is STEAMY and you will not want to put it down. Loved it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrified and Disgusted","review":"If I could give this less than one star, I would! I usually love Karen Robards' books. I have several of her books that I reread at least once a year. This one is horrifying! When I got to the villian pouring kerosene on a dog in preparation to set him on fire, I threw the book across the room. Two weeks later, I ripped the book apart and fed it into my new cross-cut shredder. I love books and this is the first and only book I've ever felt compelled to destroy so no one else had to read it. If I want something disgusting enough to give me nightmares, I'll read true-crime books or watch the news. Reading books is supposed to be an enjoyable escape, not something that you spend weeks trying to get out of your head every time you close your eyes. Especially disappointing is when the book is written by one of your favorite authors and it's supposed to be \\"romance.\\" My advice: If you love animals and hate needless torture and cruelty, DON'T READ THIS BOOK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nasty Romantic Suspense","review":"I have read all of Ms. Robards' books and enjoyed all but the last few. Lately, it seems that she is upping the ante with her villains as their acts become more heinous. I read romantic suspense novels for a few hours of escapism, not to be grossed out by evil antics. Ms. Robards needs to lighten up or be listed with other horror genre authors."},{"rating":"1","title":"not her best work","review":"This book was not what I expected from ms Robards. I have enjoyed her books a great deal in the past. For about ninety percent of this book, no one knows there is a bad guy, or even that people are missing or being murdered. Only the readers know, not the characters, which doesn't make for much suspense throughout the book. The story mostly concentrates on Alex and Joe's relationship, and at the very end the two kids go missing. Everyone thinks that they have just run off. The whole big ending with the bad guy takes about five minutes and is very anticlimactic. I would wait for the paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just another Romance","review":"I was very disappointed in Karen Robards' new book Paradise County. I was hoping that she would revert to the style she used so successfully in Walking after Midnight. I found that book so refreshing, a combination of Romance ,Suspense and Humor. The characters in Paradise County seem drawn together purely through sexual attraction and have very little in common. The book does have some surprising twists, in both plot and character definition. It is not the norm for romance/suspense novels to introduce drug abuse as a sub plot even though Robards just seems to throw that in as an afterthought. Not Karen Robards at her best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Actually zero stars","review":"There is no good reason to bring blatant animal abuse (p. 73) into a story sold as mystery/romance. Return this book to wherever you bought or borrowed it and do not read it. This book deserves no stars. I will not read anything of this author's works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vicious. Sadistic. Romance?","review":"This book was written by a monster. I thought I was reading aromance, with a murder intrigue setting. Instead I got \\"Silence of the Lambs.\\" I don't enjoy reading about animals and peoplebeing tortured and killed. If this former romance author wishes to continue writing these sick books. Please stop classifying them as romance novels. p.s. I threw it in the garbage!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Paradise County is not up to Robards usual standards. The book couldn't decide if it wanted to be a horror story or a romance and, unfortunately, it missed on both counts. The detailed violence was too graphic and intense for the romantic suspense genre. I suggest reading any other Robards book besides this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!","review":"I just started reading this book for what will probably be the fourth time (I think). I love ALL of Karen Robards books. In her stories, there is a really good balance between the romance and the action...she doesn't go \\"overboard\\" on one and not the other. In this book I love Joe...he seems sexy without even trying. Alex is strong, but she isn't afraid to show her weak side to Joe. Neely is the comic relief of the book...outrageous and funny. And they way she portrays the \\"villan\\"...wow! Pure evil. What he does to his victims would give you nightmares. Out of all her books, he gets my vote as the most horrifying villan. On a lighter note, I loved the part of the book when they go on the hayride to the pep rally and then at the pep rally...so sweet! I give this book 5 stars and 2 thumbs up! Totally enjoyable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect gift for niece","review":"My niece has wanted to learn how to play the guitar.

I could have done without all the \\"chit-chat\\" in Simla with the govt folks ... didn't feel it contributed much to the overall plot. Would definitely read more by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"I need more books by this author!","review":"I finished this book and immediately started the search for everything else Ms Ryman wrote. This is a wonderfull book, a perfectly told story. The main plot is the search for a legendary secret pass, but anybody who wants to read a good love story will love Damien and Emma's story. I adored the characters, Ms Ryman's style and wit, and while the book lasted I was in 1890 Central Asia - although this might give a uncontrollable urge to pack up and go to Kashmir, or Samarkand or Simla."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like it","review":"I didn't like this movie. The story was weak to begin with. I was really getting sick and tired of Hanna's insecurity. Theo should not have blamed David for breaking up his relationship. If one phone call broke them up then their relationship was doomed to begin with. So I really couldn't care less about that part which took up three quarters of the film. Then David takes Theo on a talkshow and you assume he's going to tell him that he's responsible for Hanna breaking up with him but instead he tells Theo that he's gay. After that pretty much the world hates him and Theo almost kills him with a metal pipe. Great story for bigots but for the rest of us this movie is disturbing and pointless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly Great Acting, but a harsh ending","review":"The acting in this movie was incredible, and very well done. The storyline was good, and overall, a good movie... but that does not mean a happy ending here. In fact, the ending, be warned, was a bit disturbing, perhaps a bit TOO harsh, but despite this, I still have to say it was good movie. I appreciated the film most for the actor who played the role of David, the main character,...his performance was outstanding. Rent this movie, but prepare yourself for an ending that will leave you feeling far from happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"contains allergens","review":"Methylchloroisothiazolinone (and) Methylisothiazolinone are ingredients that I am allergic to.

This does NOT make the novel about Marie Antoinette. I echo an earlier reviewer, it's a travesty. How on earth did this get published?I recommend Chantal Thomas's \\"Farewell, My Queen\\" and am looking avidly forward to the publication of Sena Jeter Naslund's \\"Abundance\\".

After coming across this novel, I have lost respect for Carrolly Erickson and will never take any of her work seriously again. Yes, I know that this is considered romantic women's fiction, but why do lies have to be more interesting and romantic than actual events?

This book lacked substance and depth. You don't really experience the life or the personal conflicts that played out in the French court. It was also too sympathetic to Marie Antoinette and highly unbelievable. There were also so many missing pieces that could have explained more clearly what led up to the revolution.

My concern is that people came away from this book believing that they had learned some historical facts they didn't know before. This is a falsehood.

It worries me greatly that people will take as absolute fact the inaccuracies that are rampant in this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"A quick but disappointing read...","review":"I was intrigued at first and enjoyed the parts about Antonia's girlhood and her preparing to marry, while still very young, a man she'd never met. But, it kind of went downhill from there. I found her character to be very shallow - she claimed to feel compassion for the poor, but didn't see anything wrong with only wearing a pair of calfskin gloves once and then throwing them away. I do not know if this is the way she actually was or just the way Erickson made her out to be - her \\"compassion\\" did not seem genuine, if that was Erickson's intension. And I just didn't buy any of the love stories which may or may not have actually happened. The whole love at first sight thing between the queen and Axel seemed extremely contrived and convenient. If you're going to invent a romance between two characters, at least put some effort into it.

When I saw this book I decided it could be a good intro to her story. It was a good, easy read- I think the author, who has also written a non-fictional account of the Queen, does a great job of telling her very interesting story.This book has made me want to learn even more about Marie Antoinette, and I just purchased a biography about her yesterday. I for one really enjoyed the parts of the book where her fashions, hairstyles, and lavish homes were discussed- I'd like to find a book that delves further into that. Imagine, at one time the height of fashion was to wear a gown the color of 'goose droppings'! Of course on a more grim note, guillotine earrings also apparently came into style during her reign ;("},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor historical fiction","review":"This is a very poorly written book. If you are a reader of French history of this time period, or of Marie Antoinette, you will not like this book. It reads like a romance novel \\"bodice ripper\\".

I found myself skimming and not feeling I was missing anything. It was too simplistic in tone and content for the immense complexity of the French queen's life. As she aged, her diary didn't reflect sufficient corresponding maturity. It would a good young adult fictional biography, but it does include some mild sexual activity for parents to be aware of as what might be age appropriate for their child.I've read Ms. Erickson's non-fiction, so I was disappointed in this, her first novel. I found Erickson's non-fiction biography of Marie Antoinette more satisfying. It read like a novel, was more factual, and added depth to Marie's character."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Good Read.

Why she didn't use her knowledge in this book is beyond me. Instead of giving us insight into things that did happen (adopting a child before she had her own), she creates characters who didn't historically exist. Instead of bringing alive the people who affected the Queen's life, she glossed over relationships and character. The King's brothers tried to take his thrown, the King's aunts tried to sabotage the Queen, the Queen adopted a child then abandoned him, the Queen was accused of relationships with her women friends... but frankly, this \\"hidden diary\\" is as vacuous as critics said Marie Antoinette was.

In many respects this impending marriage was a peace treaty between France and Austria. Louis is not at all what she expected. Marie does her best to help her husband. As he becomes King and she his Queen, her support of him does not change but she falls in love with Axel Fersen, a Swedish nobleman. Marie struggles with her quest to produce a rightful heir to the Bourbon dynasty. France is in the midst of one of the most turbulent times in their history.

I shreaded a bunch of old credit cards and a bunch of old credit card bills. I filled a 30 gallon trash bag, when all of a sudden, it quit working. I thought maybe it needs to be cleaned out or maybe it even over heated and needs to cool down. So I reached up under the shreader and removed as much of the shreaded material as I could. I then waited an hour for it to cool down and tried again. No go. Even with the green sensor light glowing, I can not shread anything.I liked the features of this shreader and it really did shread up to 10 pages at a time, but I recommend that you take this and other reviews to heart, this shreader just CAN NOT HOLD UP TO THE USAGE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother.","review":"Had the shredder for less than a year.

To test it's capability, I've successfully shredded 20 8.5x11 sheets of paper all at once.Twice, I've gotten lazy and shred laminated and glue-backed return mailing labels. Strong adhesives are not meant to be shredded. After unplugging the unit from the AC I took the top off and removed the adhesive label that was stuck to the shredder's teeth. Worked like a charm.

And once you finally get to the point where the bait is set and the trap is ready for its prey, the mice can apparently enter the trap and extract the bait completely WITHOUT triggering the damn trap!

The slightest bump to the wires or this trap will spring it, even when just trying to place it on the floor. There is a small plate that tilts inside this trap that you put the bait on. Unfortunately a man's hand and fingers can just barely fit in the trap to place the bait on that plate.

Peanut butter seems to work great as bait.Yes, they are tricky to set, but once you figure it out, it's not too bad. What's confusing is, that you need to line up two little pieces of bent metal wire so that one keeps the other from releasing. The tricky bit is that, when they're set correctly, the small rotating one is facing between 10 and 11 on the clock dial (or Northwest if you're thinking maps with North at the top.) The other trick is: make sure the bait isn't all to one side or the other of the bait tray. You want the tray to balance pretty well when the trap is set.

While I've had varying degrees of success with the Tip-TrapKness Tip-Trap 109-0-001 Live-Capture Mouse Trapand the Mouse HouseSmart Mouse Trap - Humane Mousetrap- The Havahart trap was hands down the worst of the bunch. I had this trap out for over two months, faithfully baited and daily checked. It never caught a mouse. The trap was invariably sprung each time I checked it, and the bait was gone, but never did it contain a mouse.Additionally this trap is a pain to set up, it's awkward and bulky and has a hair trigger for springing without cause. The trap itself is overly large for a mouse trap. And if it did ever catch a mouse with its grate sides, you'd be in for a lot of mouse-mess on your hands as you tried to transport the mouse. Havahart is a poorly designed all around loser."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't hold a mouse","review":"I agree with the other reviews that describe this as a finicky trap to set, but after one night of feeding the critters without catching them I eventually figured out how and caught one of the mice that have been living in my kitchen. I heard a \\"clink\\" as the doors closed and saw the little guy in there. But in the five minutes it took to get dressed and find the flashlight to take the mouse to a nearby park, it somehow escaped. The doors had closed, so there must have been enough space between them and the sides for it to squeeze through. Not an effective trap."},{"rating":"1","title":"who invented this piece of junk!!!","review":"Seriously does this even work???This piece of junk has a two rods attach to each door going over each other.

This incorrectly suggests that this trap is large enough to trap rats. As the written instructions for the product clearly state, this is a mouse trap and the next larger size (1025) is a rat trap. My rats are happy to crawl in, reach all the way to the back of the cage (in one-door mode) and eat the bait and wriggle out again because they are large enough to keep the door propped open the entire time. This trap is not useful for trapping rats. This product (1020) is a MOUSE trap, NOT a rat trap. My rat trapping is thus delayed in waiting for what turns out to be an inappropriate trap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe it works for squirrels, but not for mice","review":"We purchased this human trap to try to capture a mouse we had seen lurking in the yard/porch/crawl space. We loaded it exactly as directed (which is very very very difficult, partly from unclear instructions and partly because it is easy for human fingers to spring the trap).And we gave the mouse free snacks for a week. The bait--no matter what we put in--always got eaten, but the mouse never sprung the trap.Maybe it would work for a heavier animal, but the little field mice seem to be just too small to spring the trap. We had, however, EXCELLENT results with a different humane trap shaped like a little green house (although those results included finding out the mouse had a friend...or five)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless for chipmunks","review":"If you are planning on trapping anything bigger than a mouse, get the next size up.

For me, this means re-learning where Microsoft has moved/hidden everyday buttons like \\"Print\\". For my 80-year old parents this has brought their usage to a standstill. Windows brought a standardized GUI - consistent standard icons in consistent application locations - that changed the world. The Office 2007 apps have apparently lost that compass. Unfortunately, if you're on a PC, you don't have an alternative... except maybe to start looking at OpenOffice.

For example, the calendar in Outlook is supposed to sync with the calendar in that program (PCLaw). It never has.I have found that Outlook 2007 is very unstable as well. It is very prone to lock up. Also, quite frequently, I will have to open it in safe mode as it tells me the program did not exit properly the last time. Even more annoying is that Outlook 2007 will suddenly not allow me to click on a link in an email even though the program allowed it in a previous email.

I have bought it previously and dont really remember anything good nor bad about it from that time. Anyways, this feels great as soon as you put it on but within a minute it has soaked up the liquid and your lips feel even more parched than before!

Then the CD enters a few tumbles of thunder, not realy a clap, but a strong rumble and several rolling rumbles. Then it goes into a pretty long rain shower, then rumbles a little more before it tapers off into the chorus of frogs. It has been intrestingly popular in my massage work. (I am a Massage Therapist who works in a Chiropractor's office.). I have a little boom-box that I use and the rain comes across more like static but the white-noise it creates, appropriately drowns out the office environment. I warn my clients that there will be thunder that occurs and once warned they realy compliment how they enjoyed the rain.The massage room stays open when not being used. I usualy leave the storm cd playing, people always ask where they can buy the CD. Anyway - that is what I thought about it.

You were searching for a commradere between the two partners but there was always that \\"guy thing\\" that kept them at odds and made their partnership rather vacant for anything meaningful, especially after all those years. All the action throughout the film just seemed like a filler only until the end when it finally decided to pick up the pace.

What a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Unrealistic","review":"I was immediately struck by how miscast the two stars were - both too old to be playing cops, especially Pacino. The second immediate impact was how unrealistic the plot was - that 14 murders of criminals who had gotten off would have succeeded.

Instead he's wasting the years with third-rate sausage-machine drivel like this and like Meet The Fockers. What's the man thinking about? Unlike 95% of Hollywood stars he can really act when he wants to. Shame he's not making the kinds of movie that would be worthy of his talent. Unless you are very undemanding indeed or a certifiable DeNiro groupie this is a movie to avoid.

They are both too old and too fat to be believeable as 'bad-ass cops' here in a movie with a plot that is both dull & dumb. In the special features they keep referring to Deniro and Pacino as 'icons' of acting--and they are and deservedly so. But great actors can't do anything about a bad script and being cast in parts they should no longer take on. Deniro has crossed over into comedy (Analyze This) and has been hilarious.

And what is wrong with Carla Gugino ... why is she picking such strange roles that showcase her physical and sexual attributes, and not her acting?I am greatly disappointed.

To help me with the clean-up after remodeling my husband purchased a Bissell Flip-It to aid in cleaning the floors. This product was worthless. The dry vacuum side couldn't even pick up leaves that my various workers tracked in my house. I had to pull out my old 1980 vintage Hoover electric floor sweeper to clean the floor. The spray mechanism on the wet side doesn't put out enough cleaning fluid and doesn't get close to the baseboards. In my bathrooms it is even worse for getting to the baseboards. Frankly I finally put the machine away and got out a mop and bucket. No doubt my floors were dirty after all the remodeling so attempting to return this machine could be a problem as the filter did get dirty but unfortunately the floor didn't get clean. Bissell always was a name that meant quality to me but this unit is a piece of garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it.","review":"I looked at wood floor cleaners for several months and finally decided on this one.

Also the cord is short so there is a lot of stopping to find a new outlet. But what did I expect for this price?

It was so hard to push when trying to soak the floor and then suck it back up. It's as if there was actually too much suction and I couldn't actually move the machine! I'm not some feeble woman either. I used it about 3-4 times and I found it to be so much more cumbersome than a regular old mop and bucket so I returned it. The product was so bad that I have been super resistant to buying any other type of bare floor cleaner. I've finally broken down and ordered a Shark Steam Pocket Mop after reading enough recommendations for it and having a personal friend who actually has experience with it. I'll review that after it arrives.I would absolutely not recommend the Bissell flip it to anyone who wants a product that will make their life \\"easier\\".

This was disturbing since I have two young childre and they are constantly touching the cords of items like this while I am cleaning. If I would have seen that on the outside of the box I would never have bought it. I am going to return it and get a hoover floormate. All of my hoovers (vaccum and carpet steamer) say nothing about having lead in the cord and all work much better than any bissel I have ever owned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flip it is awesome!","review":"As a military spouse, we move, and have different types of floors that need cleaning. I have hard floors pretty much througout every room in my home, and also in our previous home abroad. The Vaccum side does not work well at all, but I prefer to do a good sweeping first no matter how I mop. In comparison to sponge and rag mops, this leaves the floor pretty dry, and the suction is great. As long as you empty the tank and keep it clean, and use just a minimal amount of cleaner in the clean tank, it works wonderfully. It's about half the work then regular mops and cleans twice as good as regular mops and swiffers, that generally just push dirt around. I believe it's worth the $$. I've had mine for two years now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't make life easier.....","review":"The Bissell Flip It is completely useless..... I was excited to use it and clean my laminate floors after the holiday mess.... What a Waste of Time and $$$$It just blew the dust bunnies and crumbs around and under furniture. The removable compartment doesn't fit well and the air actually blows out of there instead of moving down to the suction part. It must be some sort of defect. Then the wet part, the genius part of this machine is supposed to be that it cleans and dries the floor with the back and forth motion. Yes, it does that, until you have to go forward again and leaves a wet trail over the dry section! Plus it leaves wet lines after you use it a while!It is going back tomorrow!!!! I rather use swifter!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Product","review":"Very disappointing. My machine leaked after I filled the tank (others have had this same problem).

I bought this product thinking it would make my cleaning so much easier but I was wrong! Not only does it leave dirty \\"puddles\\" on the floor if you stop moving it for a second but if you don't change the cleaning pad on the bottom every couple of minutes, just end up spreading more dirt than cleaning it. After using in a few times, I gave up when all it did was leave puddles and streaks of dirty water. Not worth it! Stick to your swifer!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Design EVER!","review":"This is the biggest piece of crap I have ever had the misfortune of owning. The suction is terrible - it actually pushes a line of dirt out ahead of the machine that you can never fully clean. The dirt tank come apart easily so when you go to empty it - it often comes apart in your hands and all spills back all over the floor so you can have the pleasure of re-cleaning it all again!This vacuum was so bad that, rather than take it back, I felt that it was more appropriate to smash it into the ground and then throw it in the trashcan outside so no one would ever have to deal with it again. I would actually be a worse person for taking it back on the off chance that someone else would end up with one it again. Amazing that it is still on the market.Horrible, horrible, horrible vacuum. You would be better off with a squirt bottle and a dirty mop.Do no buy this product. You will regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smoking! (Literally!)","review":"I have had this product for about a year but don't use it all that often because the vacuum side isn't all that good and for the small floor area that I have, I usually find it quicker to just use a dust mop and then mop. However, I drag it out every so often and tonite, immediately after I plugged it in, the motor made a funny sound and then started smoking - enough to set my smoke detector off. I emptied the detergent area, wrapped up the cord, and put it in the trash bin outside.

(I can go over the same floor area and pick up additional dust and debris using my dust mop, broom, or Swivel Sweeper.)2) It's not easy to maneuver around furniture or corners.3) It's noisy.4) The filter becomes easily clogged. I usually have to stop after each room and clean it.5) It cannot be used to vacuum under furniture or to pick up lint on lightweight throw rugs (see No. 8 for the reason).6) It easily falls over if you do not stand it up just right.7) The brush does not rotate.8) The squeege (on the wet side) interferes with the back and forth movement while dry vacuuming.9) It's as heavy as my Orek.The only positive: The Bissell 5200Z Flip-it Hard Floor Vacuum Cleaner is easy to assemble."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm returning it.","review":"I was very unhappy with this product. The suction for the dry vacuum was very weak. The air blowing out the side of the vacuum actually blew the dirt away before I could vacuum it up. The wet vac left streaks and did not dry the floor.

Found it on Amazon and the reviews were \\"iffy\\". I always use the reviews but I also keep an open mind on items. So I got it two days ago. The setup was easy. With my open mind I started to dry vacuum the kitchen and bathroom floors (we have one dog and two cats). Sad to say that I'm returning this item, the suction is terrible. Thought I had something wrong when I put it together so had my hubby check it out. Nothing wrong - it just won't work. Tried it again the next day thinking I was having a bad day. Nada.

I also don't like the fact that you have to use \\"bissell\\" cleaning solution. More marketing scam! I tend to be green in the house and prefer to use good ol' white vinegar, water and lavendar oil.

I had read some reviews, but didn't think it could be as bad as they said. It was. The dry vac side blew the dirt away, and then stopped completely. The wet side just kept leaking solution everywhere, even when on the dry side. It didn't dry the floor afterwards, either. The only decent thing I found was that the wet side worked alright. I returned it for a full refund, and would not recomend anyone to get it. Hope this review helped."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bissell Flip-It is a Waste of Money","review":"I purchased the Bissell Flip-It about 6 months ago after a friend recommended it. At first, I had the same problem other users have reported, the vacuum blowing dust, dirt, and hair away from suction head. I reported the problem to Bissell and they sent a gasket that prevented the exhaust air from blowing forward (I still believe this is a serious design flaw). Even after making this change my wife and I find the Flip-It to be a poor vacuum; our $19.95 Eureka \\"The Boss\\" bagless does a much better job. The wet cleaning is marginally better but we think it takes less effort to use towels and floor cleaner to clean our Pergo flooring. We gave the Filp-It to the thrift store two weeks ago and don't miss it a bit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah, I'll Flip It Alright -- Right into the Garbage","review":"I truly wish I had read all the previous reviews before buying the Bissell 5200 Flip-It. Now that I've read a few of the other reviews, I say DITTO. It will not pick up even the smallest particle on the dry vacuum side and I had to go over spots on the floor many times before they were clean. I bought it on sale at Target and stupidly threw away the box. I tried it once and just assumed I wasn't pleased with it because I had to first assemble it (which is very easy) and read the instructions and then use it. I figured my dislike came from the amount of time it took from beginning to end. When I used it the second time, the vacuum picked up absolutely nothing. It falls over easily, and the water stinks terribly. Give me back my old string mop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hang on to your regular vacuum","review":"I own the Hoover Floormate and bought this product because I thought it would be lightweight and easier to use. It says it's good for everyday cleaning, so I gave it a try. I immediately noticed the vacuum suction was terrible and blew all the dust away from the unit. I had dust bunnies flying as high as my head, which landed on my kitchen counters and table. The wet scrub feature wasn't much better and the suction was still terrible. The brushes don't rotate like they do on the Hoover Floormate, so the floor was hard to clean. I was going to keep the FlipIt for strickly damp moping, but the $100 price tag was high for something equal to a wet Swiffer. Luckily, my store took the FlipIt back without the box. I used it twice in 3 months and am glad to be rid of it. I'll stick with the Hoover Floormate, which has powerful suction and does a fantastic job, even though it's a bit heavy to use for everyday cleaning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Convenient & easy to use","review":"I recently purchased the flip it in spite of the some negative feedback I read in some of the reviews. I have a bissell carpet cleaner and it is awesome, so I decided to give the flip it a try. I have been wanting one of these bare floor cleaning machines for awhile, and I finally convinced my husband that we should get one. I am happy to report that I have not experienced any problems. Mine works great and is a breeze to use. It sucks up all the dirt and dust bunnies first, and then does a good job washing and drying the floor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"This is a TERRIBLE machine. I was very excited to get this product but was SOON disappointed. The vacuum part did not suck up everything. It missed a lot of crumbs and hair. The wet part was even worse. It left the floors very wet which is VERY bad for laminates and dried very streaky. And just when I thought it couldnt get worse I started to clean the machine. The dirt that the vacuum part picked up went into the same tank with the dirty water. It took about 15 minutes to clean out the dirty tank because now I was dealing w/ wet, dity hair and dust filled water. Absolutely disgusting! So after an hour w/ the ridiculous machine I had to re-mop w/ an old fashion sponge mop. Seriously dont waste your time, energy, and money on this product!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"deserves zero stars","review":"Do yourself a favor and don't buy this product. The vacuum is absolutely useless, all it does is blow the dirt all over the place and the filter needs to be cleaned every 15 minutes or so. This is possibly the only vacuum that leaves a room dirtier after vacuuming than before you started. The tanks for washing floors are much too small and need to be changed constantly. I am unable to return this dud since it has been used.

When using the vacuum myliquid cleaner drips onto my hardwood floor leaving water marks!I have not recommended this product to anyone.

I'm NOT talking about one that's stuck to the floor either. In fact it doesn't pick up much of anything. The flip it - is a joke - not like youi can just switch back and for. you have to change parts. It doesn't even seem to want to pick the water back up very well when using the wet side. Basically useless except as a big ole paperwait. Personally I don't have a desk that big! Serious waste of money. Hope to exchange it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bissell 5200 Flip-It Bare Floor Cleaner","review":"I purchased this cleaner because I am getting old and washing my whole downstairs on my knees has been killing me. I have tile in every room. Hate mops. Well, I did realize you'd have to change the water a lot but the machine didn't work well all the time. Sometimes water did not come out and I had to keep going back and forth to get the flow going. Everything was in place so I don't know what it was. And I vacuum my floors first with my Kenmore. Anyway, I used it maybe 3 weeks then sold it to my neighbor for the same amount of money it cost me, so I wasn't too disappointed. I think it is good for hardwood floors, linoleum or even laminate, but not so much tile like I have. By the way, my neighbor loves it. She says the vacuum works great."},{"rating":"1","title":"serious design flaw for dry vac","review":"This vac has a serious design flaw for the dry vac side of the flip vac. When using as a dry vac, the motor exhausts all the air down, across the \\"dirty tank\\" and directly onto and across the vacuum head. So, when you are tying to sneak up on a herd of dust bunnies to suck them up, the vac blows them away before you can get to them. You work twice as hard chasing the stuff you are trying to vac up. The motor needs to exhaust out the side vents that are carved into the housing, not blow back down on the floor in front of you. Don't buy this product if you are looking for a floor sweeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely a waste of money!","review":"You will cry over your wasted money. This is a hefty price to pay for a bad product. The Flip vac does not vacuum well, clogs easily and cleans worse than it vacuums. Keeping the machine clean is a hassle. The machine wore down quickly and is prone to leaking fluid. I was back to an old fashioned broom and mop very quickly (and with better results).If you have kids, pets and high traffic this is not for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bisssell Flip it Mop","review":"This mop flips OK but the suction part for drying up the wet floors is useless. As soon as you hit a bump or tilt the stick backwards too far or sometimes for no reason at all, the suction stops and you are left with a soaking wet and dangerously slippery floor. You have to switch the unit off and start the motor again for the dryer suction to engage but by then you have already left wet floor sections everywhere which you can't see unless you are in direct sunlight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best bare floor cleaner ever","review":"This is the third Flip-it we have owned and they continue to do a terrific job for us. We have a lot of pets and have tile floors throughout our home so a piece of equipment that makes up-keep faster, easier and more thorough is very welcome.

We have tried bigger and more expensive units for hard surface floors, but always return to the Bissell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bissell Flip it, nothing to flip over","review":"It leaks all over the place.

Much easier to get a mop and bucket out then towel down the floor."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd Forget-it","review":"To anyone thinking of purchasing the Bissell Flip-It, my recommendation is to Forget-It!! I just purchased one today about 1 hour ago. However, when I tried to use the dry vacuum side, the cleaning solution leaked out of the wet side. When I tried to use the wet side, the sprayer didn't work. The only thing that did work was the part to suck up the mess it created. After calling the customer service center and going through the trouble shooting, which included checking to see if water was in the tank, I was told where the nearest service center was located. I wish I would have read the reviews and saved some time. Needless to say, I'm on my way back to return it and get my money back."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Godsend!","review":"Living in a house with all tile floors, 3 cats, and a lab that sheds like crazy used to be difficult. I tried and discarded 6 methods of floor cleaning before I bought the Flip-It. They all left the floor looking dull and dingy, not to mention the dog hair that no broom, dust mop, or microfiber sweeper seemed to get up. I now have shiny clean floors and no dog hair.Pros- It does it's job a with minimum of elbow grease,is lightweight and easily stored. Gets up spilled liquids easily.Cons- Cleaning the filter well between each use is a must or dust and pet hair will clog it. The dry vacuum is weak so I typically just use the wet side which sucks up the dog hair and dust as it sucks up the water. If you are looking to clean up large trash use a shop vac or broom and dustpan first."},{"rating":"1","title":"flip floor cleaner","review":"I sent this product back as it does not do what it says it will do.

The Doors had dumped their old producer (Paul Rothchild) and produced this album themselves. Rothchild later berated the band saying that they lost thier artistic vision without him (although he did still have a hand in this album). But, he was wrong. LA Woman turns out to be the Doors most mature album and their best and most creative since the debut album.This is mostly a straight ahead rock album with some blues/jazz influence. The Doors were heavily blues influenced. Fifty percent of a Doors concert would consist of covers of old blues standards. With the exception of some songs on the first album and Absolutely Live, that influence didn't come through on any of the records until now.

It's the only highlights I've got on my Best of collection here!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Doors Take to the Studio One Last Time...","review":"And it works. Very well. This is the ultimate finisher of the legacy that the Doors left us. Love Her Madly, Riders on the Storm, the title track, and WASP are all essential cuts to any Doors collection. This is probably my favorite album out of them all, save Strange Days and their self-titled debut. Wow. This album's damn good."},{"rating":"2","title":"THEIR BEST (by a smidge)","review":"Just beats out MORRISON HOTEL and the first two. What amazing rocking blues. The dark is now a mist...but Jim's your guide, and he takes you right on down the highway or desert dunes of dying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doors music will never grow old!","review":"I bought this album as soon as it was released(as I did with all the previous Doors albums). Several cuts really stand out...\\"The Changeling\\", \\"L.A.Woman\\", & \\"Riders On the Storm\\" portray the feeling of the times...just close your eyes & listen!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD-Audio","review":"I have to say that I am a little disappointed with this disc. L.A. Woman is perhaps the best of the Doors albums but the DVD-Audio is not very well done. After being totally blown away by other DVD-A discs ( The Eagles Hotel California, America Homecoming to name a couple) this one is kind of a dud. The surround is very artificial sounding or even nonexistant in places.There is no real advantage to owning the DVD-A disc over the cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Sound Quality-Mixes Are Fine","review":"This review is about the Rhino re-mix version. The sound quality is excellent. This is probably as close to the master tapes as we will ever come. The re-mixes are fine, and if you are expecting these mixes to be just like the old ones we've all heard 1000s of times before on Classic Rock radio, you need to set that aside and just listen. The mixes are a slightly different perspective on the music that gives the songs new life. LA Woman and Riders On The Storm were relegated to the last (inner) tracks of the LP and therefore had a lot of compression and distortion. On this CD you really hear them for the first time.The Warner DVD Audio of this album is pretty bad, so buy this and enjoy clear 2 channel sound instead of 5 channel sloppiness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"There is no denying that this is one the Doors' best and the perfect cap on their career with Morrison. Anyone who likes the Doors should probably buy this, even though Orange County Suite and You Need Meat are missing. But if you're a fan you probably have those songs anyway. My only beef is calling the songs on the second disc alternate versions. I think alternate takes is more accurate. An alternate version to me would be, for example, having two different cuts of Hyacinth House that sound different but are both album worthy and the band then releasing the version that didn't get chosen for the album. The alternate takes are interesting to hear but not probably something I'll go back to over and over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remixed!!!","review":"Yes, the sound is great but the tracks are remixed, often with new vocal and instrumental parts.

The selection was very poor. I bought about 12 different DVD-Audio discs in 2005, and it should be noted that I did NOT buy any of them from Amazon. This DVD-Audio version of L.A. Woman is the worst sound I have ever heard. It sounds like a remix of a mono recording (extremely flat). And they are asking over a hundred dollars for this? I would gladly sell mine for half of that, but I have a conscience.

What else would i get first besides my favorite bands best album. Of course L.A. Woman. Sounds fantastic on my new Sony (plug plug) record player. I can feel the weight difference between these new 180 gram albums and some of my original prints. Not sure but i would think the album would flex less after repeated usage. We'll see. Looking around seeing prices of $30 and well above for classic rock albums makes this even better. Under $30 is what i paid for this. If you like The Doors and vinyls then it's a no brainer.

Scheff was a major session player at that time and his other main gig was playing for Elvis, both in the studio and on tour. What would \\"Riders on the Storm\\", \\"LA Woman\\" and all the others be without that major Fender bass work? Mercy, he was good on this one, and brings the musicality on this disc to another level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Last true Doors record","review":"The Doors last stand. A bit of a departure from the earlier recordings. This was Jim's last recording before his death. A very bluesy effort with a laid back sound throughout. Songs like the Changeling, Love her madly and others are more real and not contrived just for the sake of doing a different record. Jim sounds like a blues shamen on this one. Too bad they never got to build from this one. Riders on the Storm rejoice and pick this one up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easily my favorite","review":"This album has great, catchy riffs everywhere. It was the last album of their career and Jim was resembling a weathered, bloated Jesus. You can hear the tiredness in his voice and it works great in all the songs. I mean, this is the blues and nothing else really. He should sound beaten down. Every song on here is a classic, great for riding in your car and singing along to, or dimming the lights at the end of the day and just relaxing. It's got the rock epic L.A. Woman, probably the best song they had ever written. This was an extremely high note for the band to go out on, I'd recommend it to anyone ready to get into the Doors."},{"rating":"1","title":"LP STILL THE BEST SOUNDING FORMAT","review":"I was disapointed in the mix of the entire DVD Audio disk. Who ever did it should of call the engineers who worked on ELP'S Brain Sallad Surgery. The mix is flat and Jims vocals need more than just the center channel speaker. I also feel the sub channel was left out in the remix of this great recording. If you want to hear great L.A. Woman recording BUY A TURN TABLE AND THE LP VERSION OF L.A. WOMAN."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware over rated listing","review":"I know you should be wary of buying penny items but the description did not mention the disc was cracked and skipped.

They don't specialize in LPs like they used to. Which made this an exciting find! I was out Christmas shopping, but I figured no one would be getting this for me. So, I went ahead and got myself something a little early! :D I dropped the needle to it when I returned home later that night. It sounds great! Besides the music, I had only a few candles and lava lamps going, which on a cold, wintry night gave the music a certain eerie-ness! I had heard some horror stories regarding some Doors reissues that came out within the last few years, and I was hoping this wasn't one of 'em. As it turns out, it wasn't! I would recommend this vinyl reissue to any Doors fan who might be considering it. Also, a nice plus, the plastic the LP was wrapped in doubles as a protective outer plastic sleeve for the cover. You just open it using the perforated edge. As I said before, \\"Very Nice!\\" ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who ReMixed This Mess?","review":"All of these tracks are very, very familiar from three decades of airplay and the LP. The net effect of the mix is as if the surviving band mates said, \\"Let's push all Jim's vocals down, and fight over the surround joystick so we each get our share of the channels\\". On most tracks, the band seems curiously crowded in the front, and then suddenly an instrument will blare out the back channels. Jim's voice was mixed low in volume and low in pitch so he is no longer fronting the band, he's singing by himself alone in the center channel. This remix is worse even than the DVD-A of Yes, Close To The Edge, which is an all-time bungle. Ham-handed remixes of well-known material like this are killing DVD-Audio."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book Changes The Way I Think Every Day","review":"After reading Bruce Wilkinson's book on Rewards, I have found myself re-evaluating my motives and living more for eternity than for the present. This little book can easily be read in an hour or two. As you read it, you will be surprised how much Jesus talked about rewards in Heaven. I appreciate the fact that the author makes it clear that we do not earn Heaven, but we earn our rewards in Heaven by what we do for the Lord here and what we give to Him. It is clearly pointed out that we can lose our rewards if our motives are not right or if we do not stay faithful to the finish.

The author also came across as noting clearly more than once that his ministry would be delighted to be the recipient of your giving.The book would have done better by instead inspiring a spirit of \\"love\\", as in \\"love your neighbor as yourself\\", as the motive for giving. That motive I'm sure God will honor and reward."},{"rating":"1","title":"Salvation by works of the law is failure to know God.","review":"I have noticed that these books all follow the same premise -'working for your salvation'. Yes the Bible does say \\"work out your salvation...\\" but 'work out' is different from 'work for'. One implies 'a process of learning' the other 'work hard or else you're going to be rejected'. What is it about Christians that they are not happy unless they are beating themselves up over some failure to please God?

It was given to me by a friend and I was excited to read it. However, once I read it, it was clear that the enemy was at work here. This book should serve as a reminder that the enemy can and will infiltrate if allowed. We serve God because we love Him. We follow Jesus because we love Him. If we continue to serve because we love, the rewards are incidental and will take care of themselves. This book encourages one to take their focus off of God and re-focus on themselves. THAT is not from God. This book creates doubt and confusion. THAT is not from God. It emulates the secular mindset of \\"it's all about me and what I can achieve\\". It touts a merit system in heaven. Scripture has been taken out of context and the subtle twists and turns are not hard to see once you look closely. We need to be ever vigilant of the tactics of the enemy. This is one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Life based on works?","review":"I found this book difficult to be enthusiastic about. It is definitely the most controversial of Wilkinson's books so far. Wilkinson maintains that in order to be rewarded in Heaven we must have good works. It seems like he is saying that we must have rewards in Heaven in order to be satisfied. This is off the mark. We should be striving for God's will and do as He would have us to, but not only to get rewards. The books reasonings seem selfish. There is little information about faith.

The characters were flat and had no life in them. There was nothing to show why the hero and heroine loved each other. The villan was boring and unrealized and the storyline uninteresting. I finished the book hoping for improvements but they never appeared.Sadly, I felt nothing for Gabriel and Venetia. Based on the first chapter I thought I was going to like Venetia but it turned out otherwise. Once she went to London she became hard and a bit unfeeling. I couldn't believe her reaction to Gabriel being alive and not dead - it was as though the woman in the first chapter had vanished and been replaced by this unfeeling person. Her attitude was that he should go away and let her focus on her business. She often unknowingly relayed that disinterested feeling to others.

First, the complaints. This book's biggest weakness is it's bad habit of jumping around, and jamming characters in for the entirity of three pages. Obviously, those characters aren't given much opportunity for development, and even some of the major characters seem to be either flat or generic. Also, the plotline,while serviceable, has been done before, and better, and there are many mediocre subplots. On to the good point.

In his earlier series, Op-Center, he at least followed his own style of writing. Without his name on the cover, I could have never guessed he wrote it. The only way it is remotely like any other Clancy books is that it is a definite rip-off of the first Op-Center book. Read them both and look at the similarities: the man who loses his wife (Gregory Donald in Op-Center, the chief of police in Politika), the bombing (a convention in Seoul, New Year's in Times Square).

Once I start reading a book, I finish it. I don't drop it in the middle. No matter how boring a book is, there is sometime a single page or paragraph or sentence which can justify the reading of that book. That holds true for most of the books but, sorry, not this one. I read this book from cover to cover and wondered for a long time how a writer of Calncy's reputation can produce such a book. It triggered an old and recurring thought in my mind; it's everybody's right to make as much money as he or she wishes but should he or she compromise the quality to make that money?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did he write this?","review":"I have read almost all of Clancy's books and none have even been as close to a total bomb as this one. I do not think that he wrote this book because some of the parts are not characteristic of a Clancy book. Why in heavens name does a techno-guru have his own private special forces task force? Something like this Clancy would have loked into and realized that that is so ludicrouse an element that he would throw it out immediately. In short, don't buy this book, I would be ashamed to have my name on it, and I hope Clancy is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many mistakes.","review":"It's not absolutely bad (I put 2 stars!), but boring enough.

Well, he didn't. If the cover says \\"Tom Clancy\\", then he wrote it. If it says, as Politika does, \\"Tom Clancy's\\", then he only created the concept, possibly gave the real writer an outline. That's all. The Op Center's are not written by TC, Politika was not written by TC. Don't waste your money on this \\"brand name\\" garbage, wait for the next *real* Clancy book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was a waste of paper. Politika.","review":"I anxiously read this book, hoping to tide myself over on great Tom Clancy material until the next great book of his is released and lo, this was what I read. It was horrible! I could have read any other book by Clancy. Gee another disaster hits America? Sum of All Fears? Clancy probably just cut and pasted this story out of his hard drive. The characters are one dimensional, the plot is laughable, and most importantly, I was unsatisfied with the reasons enumerated by the author as to why a corporation would need a militia. I read through it laughing at a California business getting its paid goons killed in Russia. Why? I asked that about the plot and ask that about my purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another NO vote!","review":"Tom Clancy's normal standard is \\"I cant put this book down\\", little else gets done while I'm reading a good Tom Clancy.

Its a bad one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who actually wrote this book?","review":"I actually bought this book because I'm a student of Russian and F.S.U. politics, but there's nothing political really going on in this piece of pulp fiction at all. And who actually wrote this book? It only says \\"created by\\" Tom Clancy. I find it hard to believe that he had anything to do with it at all! I've read other Clancy work, and while they're not great literature, they're very entertaining. This book reads like something I might have written in high school!

Avoid this at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS CAN'T BE CLANCY!","review":"Readers, don't even look at this book. The only thing that was even like Clancy was the name on the cover. There was no plot line, the story seemed to jump from one subject to another. The characters were unrealistic. Now that I got that all out- This book was a marketing ploy for the game and Clancy better watch out what he puts his name on or he is going to lose fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother!","review":"Tom Clancy should be embarassed that he has lent his name to this overt marketing ploy. If he wants to sell on-line gaming, do an ad, don't \\"trick\\" fans into wasting their time reading a truly deplorable novel (I'm not sure this should even be called a novel). The characters are poorly developed, the plot is poorly laid out, the action is poorly described. In summary,this doesn't even deserve a token scanning. If someone is looking for a story about internal political/ economic/ organzed crime type turmoil in Russia, a better choice would be Forsythe's \\"Icon\\", or even Thayer's \\"A Wild Justice.\\" Please, if you read this, take my word, and avoid Politika."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money on this one !","review":"I have much enjoyed - pondered and reread - the 'real' Tom Clancy series: since the beginning of the Op-Center genre, have been very disappointed. They are short; low on concept and content; and lack any interest in the way of ideas. Mr Clancy's name is on the cover: but the content/concept of this latest one is persistently and disappointingly low grade and is of the \\"breathless hero/it will all turn out OK in the end\\".

An awful waste of time and paper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Power Plays is power-less","review":"Although Tom Clancy is highly regarded as a adventure writer, I found \\"Power Plays\\" limp and unrewarding. The characters jump from one place to another in such disconnected fashion that I found myself not caring for any of them. To me the story was predictable and--dare I say it--boring. There is none of the depth that early Clancy books possess. I had the feeling, like with Michael Crichton's \\"Airframe\\", that this book was written for one reason: to make money via sequals, cd ROM's, and a movie. This does not make for good writing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Get a decent fact-checker","review":"This is less interesting than most of Clancy's works, and since he appears to be making money hand over fist, you'd think he could afford a fact-checker.

Poor character development","review":"The first few chapters took some time to get into, but when the opening action plot begins it looks as to be a very promising read. But alas, character development is slow, and many 2nd string characters are barely utilized, and open ended plot threads are dealt with too quickly or not at all towards the end of the book. Too bad Clancy did not write this himself, had a lot of potential."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzz... Zzz...","review":"I had high hopes when I bought this novel. The concept immediately enthralled me; the idea that the death of Boris Yeltsin creates a power vacuum, which resurrects the old Cold War hostilities between the west and the east. It is such a compelling concept that I couldn't help but buying it.The first few chapters did not disappoint, as the plot moved quickly and set up much suspense. After the beginning, however, this disintegrated and the novel degraded into a sleep stimulator. By half way through this garbage it became a tedious snooze fest only useful for inducing a catatonic like sleep or as an ineffectual paperweight!This novel was such a disappointment, mainly because it had so much potential. Shame on you Tom Clancy for getting my hopes up and then crushing them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Promising start but withers quickly","review":"This was a major misfire from TC. Is this the alter ego of Clancy? It reminds me of Spielberg:the good Spielberg who makes Schindler's List, ET, and Saving Private Ryan; and the bad Spielberg who makes The Temple of Doom and The Lost World. This book takes a long time to move along-unless 100 pages is acceptable to you-and only sparked my interest due to the New Years bombing. This isn't as bad as the newer Rainbow Six( which bites a lot). I just miss the old Clancy:the one who gave us Red October, Patriot Games, Red Storm Rising, Clear and Present Danger, etc. Come on Tom; no more power plays to make a quick buck are gonna work here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not A Good Book!","review":"I bought this book because it had Tom Clancy listed as the author. Surprise. He has hired another ghost writer. The book started out on an exciting note. Boris Yeltsin dies after having heart surgery. The next plot developer is a terrorist act that is committed in New York on New Year's Eve. After the terrorist act it is all downhill. The plot dies a sad death. The villains are even boring. I also was able to discover that Roger Gordian is not Jack Ryan. This is not vintage Clancy. The new book \\"Bear and the Dragon\\" is a much better book. I think he must have fired his ghostwriter. Don't buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"shallow and sloppy","review":"Not only the book is shallow and weak, Clancy's attention to detail is gone too. I can forgive him misspelling of so many Russian words, but a woman named Nikita?! This is a masculine name! Clancy seems to be going from detailed, informative and interesting descriptions to butt-kicking kind of cheap thrillers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better read ICON","review":"This book is not exactly very bad, but it is quite weak. A shallow story, weak characters and not well written. I had the impression that the author, opposite to the REAL Clancy, didn't alwyays know what he's talking about. Dear guys at RED STORM: I'm getting tired of books with Tom Clancy on the cover but not inside. I think that even Mr. Clancy didn't like the book too much. Look at the editorial. In his \\"Op-Center\\" series he always thanked his ghost-writer for the \\"invaluable contribution\\" to the book. This time, in POLITIKA, he only thanked the ghost-writer for the \\"valuable contribution.\\" Quite a down-turn, isn't it? Mr. Clancy, WRITE another book on your own and stop launching boring spin-off series!END"},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing key elements of a story","review":"There were aspects of this book that were entertaining. The action sequences were well written. The overall plot is intriguing. It has the elements that would make a great start to a series of action novels.But it's missing a few things. It's missing a central character. There were several candidates, from the head of the Sword organization, to some of the team leaders for Sword. The police commissioner from New York was also a good candidate. But none of these characters were ever fleshed out enough to be considered the protagonist. The story moved in an orderly fashion, but the conflict that was central to the book was rather bland. There were no surprises and it was generally very predictable.In addition, the language and adult content simply detract more from the book. This has the potential to be a good series, but after reading the first novel, I'm not hopeful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to usual standards","review":"Very dull. Was unable to connect with any of the characters in this story. Did not find the plot to be very creative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad, but...","review":"This book was not too bad, although, none of the Power Plays, Op-Centers, or Net Force series have really appealled to me. I think Clancy should stick with the original series centered around Jack Ryan, first, and then John Clark (Rainbow Six). I think Tom Clancy should continue with the original series but now have Ding Chavez as the main character. He is young enough that several books could be written about him without age becoming a factor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated book by overrated Genius","review":"This book is highly overrated. I am sure I will get blown away for saying this but it has nothing to do with my appreciation of modern writing. I enjoy Joyce, and many avant garde writers. Stein has an ego as big as a house. Witness her constant comments about herself as a genius in the Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas. The literary equivalent of Picasso she is not. The book is slow and boring, filled with failed, in my opinion, rhetorical tricks. If you want stream of consciousness avant garde writing there are many better writers, Joyce being the best. Jack Kerouac is a newer author who is great also. I found it difficult to finish this book. It did not keep my attention. I basically find all the praise for her as both a writer and an individual vastly out of proportion to her talent. It would be helpful if those writers and academicians who are full of praise for her would perhaps write some articles that are readable saying exactly why she is a genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"I saw myself in these women","review":"I derived a great deal of pleasure from reading this book. I \\"became\\" each of these women. I wanted to live their lives and experience what they were going through. I identified mostly with Lena. I don't think she was as stupid as everyone said - she's a much deeper character that doesn't quite know how to express herself.I wonder if women tend to identify with these characters more? I would love to see these made into a movie.The language was difficult to follow at times. The patterns and rhythms were in the way sometimes, but if you allow yourself to \\"give in\\" to it - you'll be fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dover Thrift Editions made a poor choice","review":"I have been an admirer of Gertrude Stein's work and chose \\"Three Lives\\" in good faith. I wound up discarding the book because of the content of the second story in it, entitled: \\"Melanctha\\". The story concerns a woman of African descent. The language and content of the story is racist, blatantly so. Why did the publisher choose THIS volume for its Dover Thrift Edition when something far better could have been selected from Gertrude Stein's vast body of work? (And why did Gertrude Stein write something like this at all?)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland subject matter makes for bland book.","review":"This was my first book I read by Gertrude Stein, and frankly, it will probably be my last. Her subject matter is bland and uninteresting. I understand her rejection of conventional prose, and she does have a unique style of writing, but I just don't like it. I can understand and appreciate why she wrote it the way she did, but it barely kept my attention. And her use of stereotypes was extremely blatant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this","review":"If you're looking for something fun to sweat to, this is great. The aerobic moves are easy and the instructor (Gay Gasper) is very good at teaching them.

It too is for beginners but does not waste the video time the Dummies tape does."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good basic workout","review":"This video is exactly what it claims to be. It's a very easy to follow workout that gets your heart rate going with any complex choreography or jarring motion (in the low impact version). The instruction is clear and some of the best I've seen. I've caught only one cueing mistake so far after 3 viewings. Since the moves are simple, it really makes you focus on proper form. I don't work as hard as some of my other tapes, but I'm planning to add the high impact elements next time. A previous reviewer mentioned that the right/left instructions are reversed from what the instructor is doing on screen. I just wanted to say that this is common on many exercise videos. I believe they are trying to create a 'mirror image' for you to follow. At first it may seem confusing, but once you realize this, it actually makes it easier to follow."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst exercise video","review":"Because of the title, I expected this to be a low impact, easy to do aerobic workout so I was dissappointed to find out it is not. Also,it goes from step-by-step instructions on how to do the steps, which is extremely slow so you can't get your heart rate up. Then it switches to full speed ahead when you are actually doing the excercises like they are supposed to be done, so for me it was like there was no warm up. I'm not in excellant condition, but neither am I a beginner, but I was huffing and puffing after just a few minutes and barely made it to 10 minutes before I had to stop because it was not comfortable for me. So, I think that it should be explained in the product description that the workout is high intensity. Maybe they should title the next one \\"for Dumber Dummies?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid","review":"This product is no better than a poor standard VHS transfer - Grainy & poor sound - Total Disappointment for a great film"},{"rating":"2","title":"sweatpea from fla/ny/ca","review":"Robert was right!

Before purchasing this DVD, I recommend reading a biography of Hildegard. This DVD is not a documentary of her overall life and work. To be fair, Hildegard's work spanned so many disciplines, it would be a difficult task to address all in depth.

Lacie Adams is supposed to be a mature woman with an education and life experience. Tony Douglas, her love interest is written like a high school senior. I expect to feel swept away by romance, not dragged through a jerry springer like experience.

If you love horror like I do, and you enjoy a good critter story, with a fun b-movie flavor to it, then I highly recommend you seek this one out.

Loved the wardrobe, and dancing was a blast!! Good movie!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Miss Julie","review":"When I was thirteen, this was my favorite movie. I tried to see it every time it came on TV. I was thrilled to find the VHS and the CD here on Amazon, but I sure would like to have it on DVD! Julie Andrews is perfect as a \\"modern flapper\\" who has the idea that being the most efficient secretary will get her married to her handsome boss. She and Mary Tyler Moore are hilarious in a movie that makes fun of just about everything!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Exchanged for another","review":"I had to return for an exchange. The DVD didn't work. We'll see how the new one is when I get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"cute and entertaining","review":"My wife and I had the pleasure of seeing Thoroughly Modern Millie and it was very entertaining to watch this 1920's era fun time. It is based on the Broadway hit of the early 1960's and feautures that \\"All American Sweetheart\\"- Julie Andrews. The movie is suitable for the entire family and we would reccommend it. Travel back in time to a 1960's musical about the 1920's and have a fun time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"We purchased this DVD thinking it would be fun family entertainment, something along the lines of The Music Man or South Pacific. It didn't appeal to any of us.

However, for some reason, when I bought the new DVD and saw it again, I found it to be so tedious and embarassingly corny that I turned it off after the first half-hour and donated the disk to my library. The acting is all annoyingly over-the-top, and James Fox, in particular, is so hyperactive I wanted to shoot him with a tranquilizer dart. Maybe it was the difference between viewing as a kid and as an adult, but this film has really lost its luster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chamingly funny---a good rainy afternoon flick!","review":"If you are looking for some good light entertainment, put this film on your list. The song and dance sequences are peppy and upbeat, the period costumes are a hoot, and all of the stars are clearly having fun. Julie Andrews, Mary Tyler Moore, Carol Channing, James Fox, John Gavin, and Beatrice Lillie all make the most of a campy/cornball plot. Jack Soo and Pat Morita, later seen in Barney Miller and Happy Days,respectively, also have fun roles----although you may have to force yourself to turn a blind-eye to the racist portrait of Chinese Americans.The film is a low-key joy, and you owe yourself some chuckles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoroughly AWESOME","review":"This is a great movie. Having Mary Tyler Moore, Julie Andrews, and Carol Channing ought to tell you how good it is. I love the cooky music and dances. This is either something you love or hate though. I tried to get my friend to watch it and she hated it. It is so silly and stupid that I found it hilarious. My friend just thought it was stupid and annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hollywood's Roaring Twenties","review":"This is a film for fans of Julie Andrews, Carol Channing and Mary Tyler Moore; big splashy musical numbers; the Hollywood romantic view of the twenties. The costumes are \\"really spiffy\\". Not much storyline, but if you let yourself go, this is a lot of fun. Warning: This is NOT a racially sensitive film. The reflection of the Asian community will make you cringe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally on DVD!","review":"This is one of my all-time favorite movies. I never tire of the story, humor, music or Julie Andrews. The picture on the DVD is clear and the color is fantastic. Each scene has a color theme to it and with this excellent transfer, those colors really stand out. Maybe someday this will be re-released with a documentary, but for the price, who can complain?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing like the Broadway show!!!","review":"With the exception of a few songs and key lines I found this movie to be extemely disappointing in comparrison to the Broadway show. In my opinion, Julie Andrews lacked the spunk that Millie's character required and Carol Channing was just horrible as Muzzy! I do think Mary Tyler Moore was a very good \\"Miss Dorothy\\" and I was impressed by the dancing, much more so than the singing. If you are wanting to purchase this as a reminder of the Broadway musical, I would recommend purchasing the CD of the songs from the show instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"To be watched only if there's nothing else...","review":"I did not think too highly of Thoroughly Modern Millie. The acting fell flat (especially the overstatement of Carol Channing) and it was mostly plotless. Plus it was blatantly racist. \\"If Mrs. Meers is with the Chinese, she's into something really big...\\" Two stars because the idiocy of the movie was funny in spots, and it is good only if there is no other alternative."},{"rating":"2","title":"BY JINGO, THIS ONE'S THE BEE'S KNEES, SIMPLY TERRIF!!!!","review":"Julie Andrews was never in finer form for this light-hearted and cute spoof the twenties. She proves that the she has a wonderfully tongue in cheek sense of comedy beneath her cheerful screen persona. Supporting cast great, especially the marvelous Carol Channing, Mary Tyler Moore, James Fox, and Beatrice Lillie as Mrs. Meers with the idiosyncratic Chinese expressions. The musical numbers great, comic scenes funny, especially when Julie and James Fox do the homage to silent slapstick comedy on the building ledge. First-rate entertainment all the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST musical ever","review":"I often can't stand musicals because I get the songs stuck in my head, but these songs are so fun it doesn't matter! Mary Tyler Moore is as always absolutely adorable and the rest of the cast is loveable, too. The twenties atmosphere is loads of fun and the spoofiness of oldtime movies is a kick. I cannot reccomend this movie enough!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It did not work and was not formatted correctly to even have the disc on it.

I will be returning it and while there is the option for money back there is not for a new product. I was really excited to watch this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Broadway please!","review":"It wasn't bad, but I much prefer the play made a few years later. The songs are more fun, and the characters are more fun and likeable, esp. Muzzy, Trevor, Jimmy and Miss Dorothy. I didn't like Muzzy in this. And Julie Andrews is a wonderful performer, but I would have cast someone else. She just doesn't seem like the right Millie to me. Also, the songs, except for \\"Poor Butterfly\\" and \\"Thoroughly Modern Millie\\" were not that great. I did like the Vaudville scene and where they take out Miss Meers and her lackeys. Still worth watching, but the broadway (Well I saw it at George Fox and it was AMAZING) version is much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not \\"paperback\\" version but study guide","review":"What is being called the \\"paperback\\" version of A Short History of Western Civilization here is in actuality not the paperback version at all but another paperback book entitled \\"A Study Guide to Accompany A Short History of Western Civilization from the 1600's.\\" Richard Sullivan is not the author of THIS book. On the order form and on the packing slip it says \\"A Short History of Western Civilization\\" but it is not! If what you want is a study guide for half of this book then go ahead and order it.

The customer buys it and loves every track on it. That customer then sets out to buy the band's other albums, because the \\"Greatest Hits\\" was top-notch. That's what this album has done for me. I did have \\"Leisure\\" in '93, but traded that in when I got into Gangsta Rap(what a regret). My favorite track on this CD now is, \\"This is a Low,\\" and my least favorite track is, \\"Charmless Man.\\" I didn't realize how hilarious this band's lyrics were, until I listened to \\"Coffee and T.V.,\\" \\"Parklife,\\" \\"Country House,\\" and \\"Charmless Man.\\" This CD generates a jovial mood in me each time I listen to it.

From the UK number one Country House to the recent single Music Is My Radar you know that Blur will around for a long time to come. Containg tracks that have become anthems like Song 2 and Parklife to songs like Coffee And TV, you are getting everything that you want from a album, its hard to believe that they are all from the same band.

I think every Blur fan there is would select a different playlist for this album; I'm no different.

Yes, they can do better","review":"Blur is probably the best rock band today (please don't try to mention Oasis, who makes the Beatles 30 years to late!). This double CD album shows a very intelegent band, who can do almost every style in rock music - from the 60's (There's no other way) to Nirvana (Song 2) - and to add it their unique interpatation. No need to write much about the first CD, that is a fine collection. The second includes live performance from Wembly stadium, and i found it a little boring. They did'nt try to make something new with the old material, and just \\"brought\\" the studio to the stadium. Only \\"Tender\\" sounds better in the live CD. So in my opinion, they could do much better, and as i believe - they will."},{"rating":"2","title":"haha yeah right, blur is better","review":"blur is a much better band than oasis, they have much more diversity in their songs, unlike oasis which every song consists of \\"la la la la la i love you girl\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite enjoyable!","review":"Not really a big fan of Blur's (w/ or w/o Graham Coxon) or of Damon Albarn's, but I don't mean to say that this is a terrible cd. In fact each of the songs is good, never mind if it's a bit esoteric sometimes (sample: \\"It's got nothing to do with vorsprung durch technic you know\\"). Plus most of the music is pretty upbeat, and the styles are surprisingly diverse that make for a really fun listening. This is a great way to introduce yourself to Blur. You'll never get bored with it.Suggestion: for perfect driving companions (especially if you're set for a long drive) get this cd, along with \\"A Secret History\\", (also a best-of cd) by the Divine Comedy (this is the third time I'm actually \\"plugging\\" this!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly, the Best of Blur!","review":"My music-buff cousin bought this for me a few years ago as a birthday present. I listened to it and instantly loved the CD. These songs give a general idea of what Blur is about with an eclectic mix of the hyper and dance-able (\\"Song 2\\" and \\"Girls&Boys\\") to the more tame and temperate(\\"The Universal\\" and \\"No Distance Left to Run\\"), not to say that any of the songs by Blur lack substance. To sum up, it is great music with a message and I highly recommend it.*The second disc is a Live Blur Concert and gives you a taste of what they sound like in concert."},{"rating":"2","title":"Demasiado Bueno (It's all too much)","review":"Un disco estupendo de principio a fin.

It also includes the excellent tracks \\"Beetlebum\\", \\"Tender\\", \\"She's So High\\", \\"On Your Own\\", and the huge \\"Song 2\\". I'd say if you know any of these songs, you'll like them all. Each one is catchy and well crafted. This is also available as a \\"Limited Edition\\" import which comes with a bonus disc, 10 tracks live at Wembley Arena. But that's fairly expensive, and this should be fine for any casual fan. It's Brit-pop at its best."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor style, spotty substance","review":"Admittedly, I expected a lot from this book. I had just learned about Bernays from Stuart Ewen's book Spin: A Social History of PR & was looking forward to getting a balanced picture of this alleged master. Tye's book did not fit the bill and, unfortunately, most of Bernay's books seem to be out of print. My main problem with the book is that Tye does not document the connection between Bernay's schemes & their outcomes - were Bernay's efforts smoke & mirrors that simply presaged natural turns in public opinion or did they actually manage to influence public opinion? This is the main question that I wanted the book to address, and it simply did not do it. Furthermore, the book is structured non-chronologically, and Tye does not have the skill as an author to bring Bernay's life together coherently in this manner; at best the structure is a good idea poorly executed. Check out Ewen's book for a more cogent history of public relations (including Bernay's innovations)."},{"rating":"1","title":"the father of spin:edward l bernays & the birth of PR","review":"The book is entertaining in parts and provides interesting information to someone who has no prior knowledge on Bernays. But considering the impact Bernay's ideas & work made on PR and spin and consequently the American way of life, I found the writing style to be rather flippant; and the book, as a whole, skimpy. From the research material available and the interviews which he had conducted, Tye could have written a more substantial if not a scholarly piece, irrespective of his sentiments for Bernays the person. Perhaps, that was not his intention. However, Tye did make a bold claim with his title, and I naturally expected more from his book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Scary","review":"This book reveals how Public Opinion has been shaped by the elite in order to control our way of life.

Voiz Noiz is cut-up, abstract trip-hop -- if such a thing is possible. The majority of the album is composed of seemingly random vocal snippets, complemented by beats and music. The effect is jarring, but also strangely compelling. A few of the songs seem oddly freeform, without much structure; since the run times on the tracks are so short, however, the scattered nature of the songs don't outstay their welcome. \\"Mono/Metro\\" is probably the most traditional of the tracks, while \\"Where?\\" is a striking and fascinating mixture of vocals (such as they are), silence, and piano.

And no American artist is more cherished than the Eagles.Taking their cue from far superior bands (The Flying Burrito Brothers, the Byrds, The Band, etc.), the Eagles were certainly country-rock's first and most successful mercenaries, sucking all life from the genre, and, at the same time, making Gram Parsons turn over in his grave (though not technically, thanks to Phil \\"The Human Torch\\" Kaufman).If you want a truly great album, try \\"The Guilded Palace of Sin\\" by the Flying Burrito Brothers. Believe me, it's so much better than this tripe. The Eagles have far more money than they know what to do with already. Their thoughtless, condescending, mindless songs make up a shameful catalog that should be burned in effigy (as well as physically)."},{"rating":"1","title":"So how'd this get to be the best-selling album in American History?","review":"Turns out everyone who bought a copy of this album made a major mistake. Thankfully, that mistake can be fixed. All you gotta do is return your copy to whatever record story you bought it at and ask for your money back.Now what about the music? Well, I gave it one star, so that should be a sign it sucks. Any album with Witchy Woman, Desperado, Peaceful Easy Feeling, Lyin' Eyes, Take it To the Limit, Best of My Love and One of These Nights would be worth one star already, but they lose even more points by ruining a great Jackson Browne song (Take It Easy). Skip this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Lord","review":"The Eagles represent all-American mediocrity at its blandest. Apart from the song 'Hotel California' their catalog is listless country-rock balladeering with a dollop of misogyny and cynicism thrown in. I just picture people in the heartland buying up multiple copies of this CD because they don't want that 'weirdo' Michael Jackson to have the best selling record in the good ole USA! If there is a Hell then this album is playing there in a constant loop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like a collection of your most hated '70s Commerial Jingles","review":"I wanted to like this album. i really did, but it's full of the most overplayed songsin history. I'd rather listen to the greatest commercial jingles of the 70s. (The Dr. Pepper song, Sometimes You Feel Like a Nut, Sometimes You Don't, Plop-Plop Fizz Fizz, Oh What A Relief it Is). the problem with the Eagles is their soulessness. No soul. And no sense of humor. All they did was rip off The Flying Burrito Brothers. If you want to hear a great album of easy listening Country Rock Pop, I suggest you buy the Best of Bread."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"Everything this band ever released was horrible. Fooled by the masterpiece tune \\"HOTEL CALIFORNIA\\", I went out to buy a compilation from them. Uau !! awful. \\"HOTEL CALIFORNIA\\" is a thousand miles ahead of all other songs they ever wrote, in terms of sheer quality. THe rest is a bunch of cheesy and souless music.

The standouts here are \\"One of These Nights,\\" \\"Best of My Love,\\" and the underrated, overlooked, and totally awesome \\"Tequila Sunrise.\\" Great music for singing along in the car (especially the doo-doo-doos at the end of \\"Peaceful Easy Feeling\\")."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive","review":"A nice collection of the early days of the Eagles. Peaceful Easy Feeling, Take It Easy, Witchy Woman, etc. are classics that will always be special.

Why even buy it? Gee whiz, just turn on your favorite classic rock radio station and within several hours, it's likely that you will hear most of these songs. Classic rock radio is over rated,too, but that's going off the subject.

When the LP was released I immediately made a copy on 8 track (remember those) and played it day after day in my car.

The album has moved a staggering 26 million copies and the fact that people are still consistently buying it 24 years after its release is a testament to the timeless nature of the songs. The songs are mostly in the country-rock vein from the wistful \\"Peaceful Easy Feeling\\" to the two-timing tale \\"Lyin' Eyes\\" to the supple number one hit \\"Best Of My Love\\". There are some harder number like the evil & dark sounding \\"One Of These Nights\\" and the smoldering \\"Witchy Woman\\". The band's success can be tied into the fact that Glenn Frey & Don Henley are extraordinary songwriters, the band are perfectionists in the studio, so their songs are painstakingly produced, Bernie Leadon, Randy Meisner and later Don Felder all are excellent musicians and they make picture perfect harmonies. An essential album."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best rock bands in modern history","review":"The eagles were one of the top bands of the seventies. No other band could blend country and rock like the Eagles. this CD contains many of theigraetest songs. Most of the songs were written by Don Henley and Glen Frye. The songs vary from the driving rock melodies of \\"One of these nights\\" to the mellow country ballads of \\"Peaceful easy feeling\\". One song , Lying Eyes, is played frequently on country stations. It is a song about a wealthy woman who tries to have an affair. Peaceful easy feeling has to be one of the Eagles prettiest ballads. Songs like \\"Desperado\\" and \\"take it easy\\" combines both rock and country."},{"rating":"2","title":"The GREATEST ALBUM (not just \\"greatest hits\\") IN THE WORLD!","review":"This is the best compilation of the Eagles anyone could own.

This hit-packed compilation includes one of their early ska-based songs Food For Thought, plus all their later successes. Most of their biggest hits were covers of older classics, but they always did a good job in the interpretation. Red Red Wine, for example, is absolutely brilliant and the same can be said for Kingston Town, Cherry Oh Baby, Can't Help Falling In Love and I Got You Babe with Chrissie Hynde on guest vocal. I also love the humorous Rat In Mi Kitchen and their excellent interpretation of The Doors' Light My Fire. Although not completely comprehensive, this compilation offers excellent value for money in that these tracks really were their greatest hits from a 20-year career. There's not one filler track and every song is catchy and hummable. If you like your reggae melodic and mellow, this album is a must."},{"rating":"2","title":"Am I missing something???","review":"Where was \\"Here I am (Come and Take Me)\\"?

She is placed in the youth shelter from hell where she encounters three other troubled teens and is haunted by ghastly visions.

It is an \\"I can read\\" book, designed for young readers, but it is rather lengthy, which is why I think I ended up reading the book to my niece. Plus the dialogue is a little forced... a lot of repeating the phrase 4 times in a row \\"Oh no oh no oh no oh no\\". I understand a little repetition is good in children's books, but this one kind of was overkill.I think kids starting out with reading will get bored half way through the book because its rather long. And the older kids that want longer stories will get bored with the actual story line.I did pick up on the craziness of the \\"hallucinations\\" after the medicine. That was kind of odd, then again, if I read right, it WAS published in the '70s."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!

And it definitely gave you basis for how to start and didn't make you feel inadequate.

They do walk through the positions with you and describe them well, but then go a bit fast for a beginner to keep up and get into the next position. Overall, though, after you've watched it a time or two and have memorized the positions....it just about puts you to sleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good intro to Pilates","review":"I recently bought this tape because it's a great price and I was interested in trying Pilates. I think it is a good place to start for beginners. The instructor, Michelle, is very friendly and demonstrates each exercise before we get to try it at home. (Do follow her advice at the beginning of the tape and watch it through first before trying the exercises. I made the mistake of diving in and wound up getting lost.) The pop-up dummy icons, while helpful at first, get sort of annoying becaue they interrupt her cueing. And, Michelle could have probably done a bit more cueing, because this is a beginner's tape.

Another limitation of this video is that it does NOT include the importance of flowing movement, rhythm, dynamics, and energetic tempos, all of which Joseph Pilates believed are essential to his method of body conditioning.

When you experience the energy and inspiration of traditional Pilates taught by true Pilates professionals, you will want to keep Pilates in your body forever.This video is not traditional because you don't see the full range of exercises and mat levels, and because passion is missing.

A couple of the exercises I couldn't even do (like laying on your stomach and lifting your legs and shoulders off the ground). However, with as hard and effective as I thought this video was when I was doing it, I did NOT wake up sore the next day. At all.

She shows the exercise beforehand and then you do it with her. She even shows you how to do it if you can't quite get your leg up all the way yet (like me).Also, she emphasizes that it is all about quality, not quantity, and she goes slowly enough with pauses in between the exercises that if you do need to stop and breathe, you're not feeling guilty for missing something (a big problem with me).One tip, and she mentions this-watch it before you try it so that you know what you're getting into.I have had it for a month, and I still haven't gotten through the whole DVD, but I can feel my ab muscles have strengthened already!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple but not easy!

I think the instructor is sympathetic, not glitsy and non-intimidating, all important things for beginners. The exercises are done at a reasonable pace, not too fast, and there aren't too many reps to discourage people. There's two programs, beginners and intermediates, but the beginners program is perfect for me now...it runs about 30 minutes in length but with a DVD you get to pick and choose which exercises you'd like to concentrate on. I noticed results almost immediately, especially in the abs, because Pilates is great for the stomach, and I haven't lost weight, I've just toned! I highly recommend this tape for anyone just starting out on Pilates and not wanting to get discouraged.

I really wanted to do Pilates because I heard the great benefits it provided.I recommend anyone doing Pilates for the first time to buy, \\"Pilates Workout 4 Dummies\\" first. Michelle, gives the name to each exercise, explains how to do each one correctly.She even gives different alternatives to doing some of the exercises, in case you have had an injury or experience discomfort. She is very patient and informative. I was reallyimpressed with her.Thanks to this tape, I didn't give up on Pilates. I am now doing the \\"Pilates Method\\"Precision Pilates and 3 Dimensional Toning, smoothly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't love it or hate it","review":"I've recently started back with Pilates after a 4 year break. Since this had a beginner and intermediate workout, I thought it would be a good reintroduction for me. It's very mediocre. Like most tapes out there, there's too much time taken by the instructor teaching and demonstrating before every exercise in the routine. This is ok if you're a real beginner, but after the first 5-6 times through, or if you have some experience and familiarity, it gets very old. Once you forward through, you've lost the flow (picking up and putting down the remote a zillion times) and only get about 20 minutes of workout.The routines themselves are pretty good for newbies or out of shape people. The intermediate workout could really use more challenging exercises and less instruction between each one. If you're a true beginner and you use this tape at least 3x week, you'll be ready to buy something else in about a month tops. I wanted to give it a true middle rating of 2.5."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first shot at Pilates, and I love it!","review":"I'm not sure if I'll ever feel the need to move on to a more advanced Pilates program, but for now, as a beginner, this DVD is excellent. I am definately seeing results. My favorite thing about this video is that I can do it every morning (sometimes I'll do it a second time at night instead of my evening 2-mile walk), be sweating like crazy, burn calories and tone my muscles, and not feel exhausted afterward. I take a short break to have a glass of water and I'm ready to get on with my daily routine.I highly reccomend this video for anyone just starting out."},{"rating":"1","title":"you better have strong back muscles for this one.","review":"Don't attempt some of these exercises if you have lower back problems.

I've watched these moves and tried them but to no avail - I got confused with the breathing when to's and not to's and the rolling! My Lord! This tape is not for beginners which I am - it goes on the belief that the watcher knows what the heck they're doing! It also is not for people who are any bigger than the instructor! Sheesh! Not worth the money - very disappointed in this."},{"rating":"1","title":"too easy, should be called \\"intro to pilates\\" not a workout","review":"so easy and instructional, not a workout video to anyone who has any knowledge of fitness whatsoever"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Instruction","review":"This video has very good production quality, and it is well organized, yet there is so much instruction that you do NOT get a good workout. Pilates should be a vigorous workout, and you should sweat! Explaining too many details removes the zest and fun and life from your movement! The Dummy series has a good reputation, yet it is possible to dumb-down too much. The main purpose of exercising is actually defeated when you do not get a good workout that will energize you and make you feel better."},{"rating":"1","title":"i'm not a pretzel, my body can't handle this, yuck","review":"my body was not designed to spiral out into say contorted moves. I think I was DUMMY to buy this and think I could do. I do 30 minutes of jobbing and do a tai chi class once a week, but I will never be able to do this kind of workout. It was not a good video and I think the style it shows was poorly done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Men & Pilates: Where Are They?","review":"Why do you seldom see men doing Pilates? I bought this video but was somewhat disappointed. Although the woman who primarily demonstrates exercises seems good, it's sometimes good to see male strength and stamina show a workout. This helps me understand that Pilates is NOT only for women. So I looked high and low for a DVD that has a man who practices Pilates. I finally found one: Classical Pilates. Don't get me wrong, Pilates for Dummies is OK, but I just couldn't connect to all the explanations and talking. It was better for me get another DVD that had a man do the workouts, and to have a master instructor---who is also a man---teach me and challenge my abilities."},{"rating":"1","title":"CRAPTASTIC!!!","review":"I used the entire book for MCAT preparation.

From my experience with the book 101 passages in Verbal Reasoning, I was impressed with Examkracker's accurate represenation of real MCAT questions. However, I soon found numerous errors in the questions used in this book, and I confirmed that they were wrong with several physiology and biology professors. From that point, I gave up on the book, because it caused more harm than good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Premed","review":"This book is one of the best tools to hone your biology test taking skills. With 101 passages and 1001 questions, you will become familiar with every topic covered on the real MCAT AND know some topics in details which may not be possible by just studying one of the prep books. I improved my scores from 8 to 14. Sure there may be some errors (maybe less than 10 questions), but i think it's definately worth to go through this book to prepare for the most important aspect of your medial school admission."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Rick Springfield Album Ever","review":"The title of my review says it all.This album will make you go back and listen over and over.The music and lyrics are obviously written and sung by someone in incredible emotional pain.It's a shame it didn't get the attention it deserves.Best album of 2004."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must buy","review":"This cd was a shock;Coming for Rick.My depression is one of the best songs ever.Also the range this cd reaches.A must buy!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"His best work to date!","review":"I really enjoyed this CD.

There seems to be a constant theme of anger and rejection throughout, that becomes exhausting. I understand the venting on maybe a few songs, but to have to endure this on all 17 tracks, is not enjoyable. The singing feels forced...Also missing is the natural progression, from song to song. What made Love Somebody, Jessie's Girl and Human Heart so excellent was the great pop hooks, and great emotion- unfortunately not present on this record. Will I is the only track that comes close, but not enough to salvage the rest of this record, to give it a recommendation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Up To Par With Rick's Other Effort's....","review":"I Have to agree with the other review, about this album falling short of his other work in the past- notably Karma and WCD.

I have been since the early 80's. I have seen Rick in concert over 25 times and his live show is spectacular. I have every cd Rick has made in my collection. I even had the pleasure of meeting Rick twice and he seems to be a good guy. But I've got to be honest, this is not Rick's best effort. I understand Rick not singing about \\"scoring\\" with girls in the back seat of a car anymore, but why are you so angry?! I tried to listen to the whole cd, but I had to listen to it in stages. I could not take the bitching and moaning for long periods. In all fairness though,\\"Will I\\" is great song and should get some serious radio play. As for the rest of the cd, stop complaining. Rick is a talented musician and song writer, but you would'nt know it from his latest effort. So, until Rick's next cd, I will have to rely on his past efforts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to par","review":"I have always enjoyed Rick Springfield's music. It weighs in somewhere between bubble gum pop and rock. But it's catchy and enjoyable. With his latest, I just can not connect with many of the songs. A lot of the material on this cd sounds like some kind of garage noise rather than the mature and thoughtful sounds I've grown accustomed to from him. Even some of the more \\"enjoyable\\"tracks (although I use the term pretty loosely) like Perfect and Beautiful You are hard to listen to because of the noise of the guitars and sometimes inaudible words Rick tries to sing over all the commotion. If you want to hear some quality newer stuff from Mr. Springfield, check out his last release \\"Karma\\" which is very worthy, fun, quality music."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS CD ROCKS!","review":"I can't even begin to say how blown away I am by this new album by Rick Springfield. WOW! I can't even pick a favorite song...they are all soooooo good! Jesus Saves White Trash Like You is one of the best rock songs I've heard! Idontwantanythingfromyou is also one of those songs you can't get out of your head.Rick has totally undone himself with this one! If you don't get this CD, you are missing out! This is THE CD everyone has been waiting for from Rick!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Intense Album","review":"I love this Springfield album. I picked it recently based on some of the reviews. It is a really strong rock album and has an underlying intensity to it that I really like. I would highly recommend the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Rock n' Roll should be","review":"This CD is what Rock music is supposed to sound like.Rick Springfield is truly a gifted musician who improves with each new album. SDAA is his best work without a doubt.Each song sounds different, unique from the one before.The stand-outs are the bluesy \\"Alien Virus\\", \\"Every Night I wake Up Screaming\\", \\"Jesus Saves\\", \\"Will I?\\" and what should be the next single \\"Wasted\\". But again all 17 songs are great!Rick Springfield Rules!This CD is highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great CD from an Excellent Entertainer!!","review":"This is one of Rick's strongest CD's yet. From the harder edged music from songs such as \\"Perfect\\",\\"Idontwantanythingfromyou\\",\\"Jesus Saves\\", and \\"Wasted\\" to the beautifully written and performed \\"Angels of the Disappeared\\" are wonderful complements to Rick and his talent. This CD positively displays Rick's versatility and the endurance that has made him a fan favorite for over 30 years now! Run...don't walk to this CD today!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rick loses it...in a bad way","review":"I found this record to be extremely disappointing. It doesn't even scratch the surface of the rock gems he put out back in the 1980's. Where are the hooks Rick???? This is basically 17 tracks of an angry 54 yr. old man, venting his frustration over some broken relationships. The reviews I've read so far, The Washington Post, for one, seem to agree. He really misses the boat on this disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bubble Gum Rock Schlock","review":"It's clear that Rick is indeed in denial. I was highly anticipating his return to his musical roots. Instead, we get kiddy pop/rock fare, reminiscent of that disposable bubble gum rock music from the likes of Dokken, Warrant, White Snake, Et al. He basically whines throughout this record...It's one over the top, unsatisfactory song after another. Rick, stop acting as if you're some broken down old man. Maybe next time you'll get with the program."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inexplicable Noise","review":"This is a truly awful effort, by a guy that had some pretty decent songs back in the day. It's more than a little dumbfounding to see some of the reviews...Unless it's the same person under assumed names. Anyway, this unambitious album suffers from a lack of any kind of creativity. Rick seems to be desperately wanting to jump on the bandwagon of comebacks, trying to appeal to the teenybopper crowd. Track after track offers us nothing more than noisy guitar riffs, backed by screaming, uninspired vocal exercises. I recommend Working Class Dog Instead..Anything he put out back then, is a major improvement over this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoying Rick's Latest","review":"I wish Rick could get booked on some late night shows and morning shows to showcase SDAA. It's mostly a nice CD, and I feel so badly that he is looked upon as somewhat of a hasbeen from the 80's, and can't get booked on any programs. I've been checking the tv guide for upcoming appearances, and there isn't a thing for him. Oh Well, I'll just have to check him out live then...Enjoying the record."},{"rating":"2","title":"OH MY GOD!!!!!!!","review":"I have been a Rick fan for well over 20 years and have all of the music, but.........this is by far the BEST work the man has ever produced. This album rocks and drives hard like nothing else you have ever associated with the 80's icon! This an album that you do not have to be into 80's retro to get behind. My kids listen to what I do and prefer bands like Godsmack and NIN, but they LOVED this album when I played it for them, they rocked out to it!

While you do sense the energy and fun that was there at the gig, the songs we love are full of mistakes, have poor backing vocals and are certainly not to the standard of his incredibly polished studio recordings. I was surprised that one song particularly was left on this album as the band stuffed it up, the b.v.'s miss their cue, Bryan even says \\"This is a terrible song\\". Still, it shows his sense of fun and the ability to laugh at himself. Best to buy his studio albums. They are awesome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie is better than book","review":"This is one of the few instances that I have found in which the movie version of a novel is better than the novel itself. This is a contrived work through and through, and one can understand why Bertolucci completely changed the ending for the movie. Moravia here displays his utter sentimentality with an admixture of arm-chair psychology that is truly laughable....and this is probably his best novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"This edition omits 100+ photographs","review":"This Kindle edition leaves out 100+ photographs which were in the original book.Since the text is largely a commentary on the plates, this version is rendered 95% useless.Another problem is the many charts are gibberish in this Kindle presentation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and interesting.","review":"Having lived many years in several cities in Utah I found the book rather entertaining. The lighthearted, humorous look at the eccentricities in the government, the people and their often unusual behavior was a nice reminder of what we loved and loved to hate about Utah. I disagree heartily with \\"offcenter\\" who sounds a bit defensive and appears to have expected an academic treatise rather than a lighthearted look at an unusual state-which appears to be what the book is actually about. What is suspicious though, is the need to question another reader's motivation for liking the book. Correct me if I am wrong, but royalties for this book would not go to Dr. Stern no matter who publishes her books, and therefore the unnecessary suggestion of unethical motivations is inappropriate."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"While some of the anecdotes are quite humorous, a large portion of the commentary sounds like it comes directly from the mouths of some bitter ex-Mormons/Latter-day Saints. I didn't want an entire book of Mormon/Latter-day Saint jokes--I was looking for commentary of Utah at large. Also, a lot of the tongue-in-cheek humor would be misunderstood by those not 'in the know,' giving a perverted view of the Utah I know and love to make fun of."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two shots and it is dead.","review":"I bought this as a gift for my wife. She took it out of the box, charged it up and on the second click of the shutter it flashed a message \\"turn off and turn on again\\". We did. It never recovered despite numerous resets and removing the battery, per Sony customer service rep instructions. The lens is frozen; it cannot retract and the camera stays in an inoperable error state. Sony is telling me to ship it to them. Giving it two stars rather than one because I removed the memory stick and printed the two shots we'd taken and they looked great. Second Sony product in a row that we've had out-of-the-box quality problems with (LCD monitor was the other). Losing our brand loyalty very rapidily."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe it's a Sony","review":"I fully agree with the reviewer who gave this camera only 2 stars. I have just tested one, which I bought for my wife as a Christmas present, and everything he wrote about the P150 is true. I spent the whole afternoon, took 152 snapshots, and found not a single mode that would give my wife an easy way to use this camera. Even in full manual mode about 40% of the easy shots I took turned out to be blurred or underexposed or both.I have been a VERY satisfied owned of Sony's DSC-S85, which is a great, great camera. (great lens, very good flash, decent firmware) The P150 is such a disappointment that it is hard to believe it is made by Sony. It has seriously shaken my trust in this brand and I am now wondering whether I should do the previously unthinkable: buy a Canon? :-("},{"rating":"1","title":"Tendency to get dust on the sensor","review":"The camera (along with the other P-series) has a well-known tendency to get dust on the sensor. This shows up in brightly lit outdoor scenes when the shutter is stopped down.

Deep Purple had the perfect rock intonation, phrasing, tone, and dynamics that one expects from a band (they performed from 1969 to 1973), but their musical intelligence, their sense of abandon, and their intense and continuous concentration was extraordinary. I listened to the great Child In Time with tears running down my cheeks, I don't remember that happening since a performance by the Moody Blues many years ago.

Deep Purple's recording engineer Martin Burch was asked to capture some shows from the 1972 Machine Head Tour on tape. During the August 1972 Japanese leg of the tour, he had his chance to record. Burch was supplied with an unimpressive, cheap looking Ampex 8-track recorder to get the job done. Burch was dissapointed with the equipment he was given and was certain that the results would be a total waste of his time.When the entourage arrived back in England, Burch took the time to throw the eight track recording tapes onto a studio deck and have a listen. COMPLETE AND TOTAL SHOCK !!! The combination of skillful microphone placement, concert hall acoustics and the unexpected superior performance of that little Ampex tape deck had collectively ganged up to capture one of the finest quality live rock recordings of all time."},{"rating":"1","title":"CAUTION...DELUXE EDITION (US RELEASE)","review":"Purchased this release a few years ago, after ignoring the info I'm about to impart to you.Warner/Rhino have the stereo imaging backwards.

When songs run out of musical ideas, the boys just crank the amps and let 'er rip for 10 more minutes. Nuance and subtlety were not in their collective DNA. Nor was a sense of humor: the whole point of 70s hard rock was to be dumb fun. But pompous Ritchie Blackmore thought he was Mozart with a Stratocaster.

I am not super strong and did not apply too much force.

This may be good for someone with a larger bust, but I don't recommend for anyone who likes bralette styles.Another problem I had with this bra was the uncomfortable fringe around the edges - apparently an effort to make it more frilly, but also a source of itching for those of us who do not like poking edges.

I ended up donating it to Goodwill.I prefer soft fabrics for a bra. The breast area is very sensitive and I can't stand to have a coarse, itchy bra on. I couldn't imagine wearing it in the hot Atlanta summer, sweating and having that mesh clinging to me.If you don't care about fabric, the bra was very well engineered otherwise. The cups had nice lift, even without an underwire. And the shoulder straps adjust in the front, so they are easier to reach.

The book feels pieced togetherIf you are stuck in the backwoods of Vermont and this is the only book available, or if you are on a long plane ride and the choice is this or the airline magazine, read it.

So I ordered it from from Target online and was displeased because it's not the same shredder. It's the same model number but it does not have the convenient clear button that allows you to clear the shredder of paper. So when it gets jammed, and it does, you have to unplug the shredder, remove the top and dig out the shreddings. It also refused to work after about 4 minutes of use and you must let it cool down for 2-3 hrs. So don't let the items you must shred build up or shredding it will be an all day affair. My brother's has gone for as long as 15 minutes without needing to cool down and he bought it at Target instead of online. It does however shred paper pretty well so I gave it 2 stars. Will be looking for another one soon but this time I'll make the trip to the store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Make sure you buy some needlenose pliers too","review":"This product worked OK for 3 months then the shredder began to fall apart. There are little finger like pieces (that are breaking off) underneath the shredding area which began to collect paper and cause the paper to backup and jammed in the shredding mechanism. The more fingers that fall off, the faster paper backs up and gets jammed. So after every 10-15 pages I have to get out a pair of needlenose pliers and pull the impacted paper out of these tiny slots. It takes about 10 minutes of extreme frustration to unclog this clunker. That's about a minute a page. This is obviously completely unacceptable because if I had enough time to spend 1 minute to shred each piece of paper I would be paper mache artist.Now, I just use it to store paper until I buy a new shredder. This product was a complete disappointment for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing shredder","review":"I expected this \\"crosscut\\" shredder to make confetti of the papers I fed through it. Instead it slices paper into strips. My old, less expensive shredder already sliced paper into strips.

I have little shredding to do. As it turns out, I used it once and it broke down. You can't see what wrong, so I took it back. My mistake was I exchanged it for another. Used the second one 3 times and then it broke down. Considering the whole thing a loss at this point. I didn't shredd excessive amounts of paper and there was no reason for it to stop working. Will probably spend more money and do a little more research next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do yourself a favour and don't buy this shredder!","review":"I'm very disappointed with this shredder. I got it back in October 2006, and I have only used it about 3 or 4 times. First of all, although the product is supposed to shred up to 5 sheets at a time - IT DOES NOT. It will get jammed, so I only shred 1 or 2 sheets at a time. Tonight I used it again, and it became completely jammed from a few sheets. I cannot get it to work again. It is very loud and a bit slow, but I can live with that, I just don't like the fact that it jams after only using it a few times.

It's loud and jams easily. The others were loud and jammed too but this particular one lasted me only three months. When it jammed, power automatically shutdown. I kept it in reverse and waited for power to come back about one to two hours later. I'm kinda ruthless with the shredders, sticking papers with staplers, tape or dried glue, and I'm pretty impressed that the other shredders lasted so long. Not this one, it came from planet pms and work only when it was in the mood. I kept the baskets and placed one in each room. Looking for the one I bought before this one. At least it lasted almost four years.

The software sucks but on top of that, the product is flimsy. The GPS unit (a square button thing) is supposed to be attached to a USB stick. One end of this stick is attached to the GPS unit and the other end into the computer (or the supplied cable which then inserts into the USB port of your computer). This USB stick which sits in the middle is the worst product I have seen (from a quality standpoint). The USB stick has a seam which is coming apart. In my case it came that way in the box but I am telling ya, it is easy to break that seam! I am not sure you can get the replacement USB stick or kiss your GPS setup goodbye but in my case, I don't wantto take chances.

I am a police officer who recently got assigned a new area of the city to patrol, an area I am not familiar with at all. Working at night makes it even harder to find my way around. I installed the software in my laptop in my patrol car and plugged it into the USB hub and I was set. It gets you to where you want to go and a whole lot more. I did notice, however, my own neighborhood is not on the map yet and it's been in existance since Spring of 2006. It beats spending $500 or more on other GPS systems."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works just like it should","review":"We sold our Garmin and bought this. What a welcome surprise. We bought it for traveling now that we are retired. We installed it in an inexpensive Gateway laptop. After a bit of practice we had it doing exactly what we wanted. It is not hard to use and the receiver works. The only thing we would like to see improved is the voice volume. The software is very intuitive and you don't have to unlock maps and go through a lot of changes to make it work. It costs less than a Garmin and works a lot better. If you buy one, spend a little time learning the software and reading the manual before taking a long trip. You will be very pleased with all that it does. We will never buy anything Garmin, but we will certainly upgrade this software."},{"rating":"2","title":"Streets & Trips by Microsoft","review":"This is the poor man's GPS system....very comprehensive and updateable (traffic & roadwork conditions).

When I wanted directions to the Manassas battlefield, I could only get directions to the town. The map shows something north of the town, but it is not well identified.A solution would be to provide the ability for me to add a category (Lebanese restaurants, anyone?), and to add records.

Not! The Pharos 500 GPS receiver will not stay connected to the satellite signal for more that a few minutes, and once it loses it, you have to start over by shutting down the program and re-launching the ap. It's a mess. I've used this in totally wide open areas of Dallas, TX, and there is rarely a time when the satellite signal is found, much less kept connected. Perhaps the most ironic thing about it is the GPS receiver works best when sitting on my 2nd floor window sill, exactly where it's never going to be used! Once it gets into my car, it loses the signal. Buy a different GPS system if you expect to own one that works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Streets and Trips Flunks","review":"We used Streets and Trips for an 8-hour road trip. The GPS unit lost and failed to reacquire about every 15 minutes. We had to fiddle and restart the program the whole trip. We were frustrated and worn out just fighting with the computer software. When we took a wrong turn, it told us \\"off route\\" and \\"proceed to route\\" (no help) and then lost the satellites again. The little maps of the intersections that we printed out from the program were too small to get a perspective of where we were. On the return trip we ditched the dumb Streets and Trips and used our old fashioned maps and enjoyed the trip home without getting lost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to return it","review":"The GPS unit stopped working the first time we tried it so we had to return it for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"streets and trips stinks","review":"This program stinks. you need to enter a new starting point every time you use it even though most people start from the same point usualy.

I also bought car inverter for long trips. I was really disappointed by the results. The GPS took long times to lock to satelite (as much as 10 mins sometimes). On highways its sensitivity was really low. The driving directios for lot of points was screwed up. Don't drive to Hanauma Bay using MS S&T.;The biggest problem I faced was that the driving directions will not specify which direction to take on HWY (I mean w,s,n or e). It will just say take H1 and I had to guess H1 E or H1 W. Try HNL to Hanauma Bay Natural preserve Honolulu.Further more this GPS solution is very cumbersome (especially since the included suction cup) doesn't stick very long, thus the gps receiver keeps falling off.The reason I bought this unit was to postphone buying a real GPS for a year or two. In retrospect it was a bad decision...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brings Haida culture to life","review":"I bought this beautifully illustrated book for my grandson, who is growing up in the Pacific Northwest surrounded by the art of the region's native people. I've colleced a lot of Haida and Tlingit art over the years and was so pleased to find the book's illustrations were both historically and aesthetically accurate. Between this book and the author's Storm Boy, kids can see Haida button blankets, Chilkat blankets, coppers, wooden chief's masks, the carved and painted interiors of long houses, the woven reed clothing worn in past eras, and of course totem poles. I loved the scale of the illustations in scents in the Frog longhouse, with the little girl so dwarfed by all the big carvings and sculptures. I have to say that these two books are among the best-illustrated kids' books I've seen in years.

Trial and error and searching the internet for non-Maxtor help did the trick. After about two weeks the noise started, then stopped, then started, then stopped, then started... The USB ports were amazingly slow when accessing a second drive, and the printer server function worked a total of once. After about nine months it stopped being recognized on my network altogether: lights flashed inconsistently and no number of power cycles got it to respond even when using a cross-over cable connected directly to my PC.

Two emails requestes for tech support, not one answer.

This was tried on 3 different machines running XP and XP Pro. No help from Maxtor.Then, my first unit failed after 3 days and was replaced. My unit was configured using RAID1 so I was hoping to save my data. No way: You have to return the unit to Maxtor and even if only one of the drives failed they won't replace the failed drive to save your data. They simply send you another unit. You might think that you can replace the failed drive yourself but, no, you can't as you cannot open the box. This is simply a scam and a good demonstration of corporate greed. Maxtor simply advertise a useless RAID1 feature, has quality control problems and ships non functional software with no available updates."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible! Awful!

But if you plan to use it as a small shared data server (which is what's it's supposedly designed for), don't waste your time or money. The software is problematic.

There were times that she would cut Chris down that I actually cringed. **Spoiler** When Cris asked her to go with him to see his father (clearly a BIG moment in his life) Emily automatically said no. There wasn't a let me think on it until he practically begged her and she was still snotty about it. That is where the book ended for me. Emily had one too many snappy remarks, stay out of my business, I can handle this on my own moments for my taste. Next and final issue is that this book was so slow.

The problem, if any, is that the movie is a little short, hence the subpar character development. The streaming version here on Amazon contains a few short lacunae: bits and pieces of missing film, usually less than a second or so in duration, and only a few. It's just an old film, you know, that has not been preserved properly. But the audio is quite good, if a bit scratchy at times: again, not often and not too detracting from the entertainment.

He contacted three african singers, each from different areas and all fairly unfamiliar with each other. Over a period of a week or so the three made this album.

The collection is very good, however it tends to lean heavily toward the philosophical; I am much more concerned with the practical day to day life of the church. The work contains essays that deal with a range of theologies in the post-modern world. There are several that I thought were quite helpful to my own thesis: D. Stephen Long's Essay on \\"Radical Orthodoxy,\\" and both of Vanhoozer's. The work also includes a \\"for further reading\\" section at the end of each essay that I also found helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome CD","review":"The Great Divide is a fantastic band, and they're at their best when sharing their faith and sharing the studio with their fellow musicians.

Viewers jaded in the aftermath of Ringu (1996) may argue that long-haired girls in flowing white gowns just aren't that scary anymore, and despite yet another appearance of such a menace, Ochiai has seemingly compensated by timing out his various other horrors at a consistent and truly satisfying pace. While not entirely original in concept, Hypnosis certainly stands out among its contemporaries when it comes to tone. Successfully balancing his horrors with an offbeat air of quirkiness, there are few films that can match the oddball air of menace that Hypnosis achieves effect bieng a good film,highly reccomend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hyponist: A Thrill Ride For The Mind","review":"This film was well written. The beginning was a bit gruesome. Overall it's thought provoking and a bit mind bending. It has a surprising plot twist. The ending is very abrupt, wierd, and effective at the same time. A classic tale of horror! Somewhat creepy, it leaves disturbing images in the mind for at least an hour after watching. Definitely worth seeing! The only bad thing, there were too many previews on the disc before the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"When the serpents bits its tail !","review":"A real plague of mysterious suicides rocks Japan .

It might have been ok for its time, but it offers the typical idealist interpretation of Kant, and attempts to separate the contents of Kant's Transcendental Aesthetic from his Transcendental Analytic, arguing that only the contents of the latter have merit. But the two sections play the similar roles in Kant's revolution and to wholly reject the aesthetic and not the analytic is, I believe, impossible. Strawson does not even take seriously the arguments of Kant's aesthetic, probably because he is English and the English always get nervous around the aesthetic. While one may still have to deal with this book if writing a paper on Kant, as Strawson is still held in fairly high regard, I would recommend this book only for one who is not familiar with the traditional idealist interpretations of Kant."},{"rating":"2","title":"After many listens, finally several straight through,","review":"This album has revealed its subtle and magnificent grandiosity. Make no mistake about it, this is a highly ambitious and creative undertaking. This album is a frontier blazer. The first song is the single most beautiful and mesmerizing in the entire Llamas canon. The rest of the album follows suit. Every song is a sprawling work of art. Though it's their shortest album, its the High Llamas album of electronic epics. Yet another masterpiece from a band that is almost unable to create anything but masterpieces. Sean O'Hagan is the most talented and ambitious pop musician in the world right now. And has been for quite some time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short..but sweet.","review":"While some fans of the band might consider this a mini album compared to some of their work, what it lacks in quantity it more than makes up for in quality. This is music that lures you into it's own little world ,beguiling and elegant. It is by now obvious how The Llamas and Stereolab interact and influence each other,but this is definitely a High Llamas disc.

How could R.W. have written a second book that made Vivi a fun likable character, when she was an awful person. I think that R.W. must have had a terrible childhood and a mother who was also incestious to write a book like this. Also the story was disjointed and boring.

However, I'd advise anyone who hasn't read either book to read Ya-Ya first; otherwise, you might not be able to feel compassion for some of the characters, and the laughs would have a hollow sound to them. Lots of background information and character studies of a huge list of folks - but it's pretty tough to read in spots.Bottom line: Read Ya-Ya first and enjoy it fully. Then, if you're up for it, read Little Altars - but pour yourself a stiff drink first, and keep topping it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written, but forgiveness is too much","review":"I read this book some time ago, when Divine Secrets of the Yayas was first popular. I just loved the title and that some of it was from a child's point of view. I have not read the second book as of yet. I enjoyed reading the book greatly, I felt it was honest and moving. What troubled me is that there was so much emphasis on feeling that Sibba should be able to forgive her mother, when her mother was incapable of expressing any regret or remorse for her treatment of her children. Wells almost seems to say that children are responsible for whatever happens to them at the hands of their parents. I worry that this message in the book could continue to have others who have been victims of abuse believe that their only choice is to try to forgive the unforgiveable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed but disappointed","review":"I loved the first two chapters of this book. I thought it was going to be a funny novel. But there is nothing funny about the tragic turn the childrens' lives takes. Also, the second half of the book was pretty confusing.

Yes, she wasn't the nicest of people, and certainly she wasn't the best mother, but she had heart and pain and love. \\"Little Altars Everywhere\\" destroyed the love each reader has for \\"Vivi\\" despite her difficulties.

Also, I wasn't a fan of the format of the book, in which each chapter was told from the point of view of a different character ....It read more like character sketches than a story.

Vivid, the book evokes pictures of family cruelty and ruthlessness. The whole feel of the book is disjointed, lacking cohesion and feels more bitter than meaningful. This books is a disappointment compared to her other, the Divine Secrets of the YaYa Sisterhood, which is peopled by the same characters (though is characterized nothing like them) and has more grace and redemption.

However, after reading this book, all that compassion has evaporated. Viviane is a horrible, small-souled women who beats and humiliates her children at every turn. There are a few loving memories included in this book, but they are by far overshadowed by the verbal, physical, and sexual abuse detailed in this novel.Rebecca Wells is a truly talented writer, who brings her characters to life. Her gift is such that I read this entire book, despite my feelings of loathing and disgust toward Viviane. I would have been better prepared for this novel if it was portrayed as less of a \\"feel good, humorous\\" book, and more of a \\"dark, emotional, and deeply felt\\" book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing Characters","review":"After reading Diving Secrets all I can say is who is Vivi Walker? The character in this novel was a smoothed over version of herself in Little Alters, where she was represented as physically abusice, manipulative, and alcoholic.

Sure she breaks down, but this novel should also be about Vivi's reconciliation with her past, not only Sidda's.

There was none of the charm and wit of the original. In fact, I couldn't believe that this was written by the same person. I didn't become attached to any of the characters, and there is not a light moment in sight.

I had to force myself to finish it, so that I would know my negative opinion was fully justified.The story does not flow well with each character chiming in with their own observations. Each is on a different track. Nor did I see the point of this book. A book about a sick, alcoholic woman who abuses and neglects her children can not be heartwarming, funny or entertaining. Since Vivi doesn't seek any professional help or even feel the slightest bit of shame, I found no redeeming qualities in this story.I cringed when I read the reviews which reinforced Wells' descriptions of the Catholic church, small, southern towns and growing up poor as wonderfully realistic.Overall, I found it disturbing and without real-life value.

I found \\"Alters\\" to be much more of a downer, going from how mother Vivi, a raging alcoholic, physically abuses, sexually abuses, and verbally abuses her four Southern children.However I was still very impressed at the author's ability to narrate from a childs point of view. With such innocence, and raw humor, you almost forget it wasn't Lulu, Sidda, Baylor, or Little Shep who wrote the chapter.The author weaved in with the tragic reality of how Vivi is traumatizing her children with hysterical, and twisted humor: such as the ugly dogs 'babies', and so on.This is definetly a good book, but I definetly consider \\"Ya Ya\\" a reward to read after this book.

The first half of the book illustrates an off-the-wall, although not entirely disfunctional, family. By the end of that half, I had grown to care for each of the children. It isn't until the second half that the reader learns the awful secrets of the family and, because the characters are so powerfully drawn, is deeply affected by each character's childhood."},{"rating":"1","title":"couldn't stomach it","review":"I am not someone who only enjoys a book if it is about a functional and happy family; I loved ANGELA'S ASHES. But something about LITTLE ALTARS made me a little sick. I didn't care about any of the characters because they were so awful. From the first page to the last, I found nothing compelling about this book, only characters who are smug about their skewed world. Guess I won't be reading DIVINE SECRETS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such a disappointment!","review":"Really loved Divine Secrets and was so excited to sit down and read Little Altars. Couldn't believe how bad it was. I read Divine Secrets in every spare minute I had, and got it finished in no time.

Understanding the characters' beginnings and their motivations results in a very savory read. You'll laugh, cry, have your own values challenged, and care very deeply about the characters.

You found out all these secrets that you really didn't want to read about, like how Vivi abused her kids. I thought after learning that about her, it made her character seem so crazy and deranged. I thought the overall story was great, but the fact that Sidda's parents cared nothing about the kids, only about drinking and fighting, was rather saddening. I haven't read Divine Secrets yet, but I'm planning on it. I hope to get a better outcome after"},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book!","review":"One of the greatest books I've ever read.

Truely great."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one of my all-time favorite books!","review":"I love this book! I love the way that each character narrates a chapter in the first half during the 1960s and then in the second half during the 1990s. This approach perfectly captures what it is like to view the world as a child, and then look back on things as an adult and realize that they were not always as they seemed. I think that the writing is marvelous and that the antics of the characters are humorous, sad, inspiring, and abhorrent all at once. I did not like the sequel (Divine Secrets...) as well. If you are a woman or have childhood issues with your parents that you are dealing with, I think you will relate to this wonderful narrative. It is like a movie where all the lines are written and delivered perfectly and you just want to watch it over and over."},{"rating":"1","title":"HF100 Vignetting","review":"It works great EXCEPT that there's significant vignetting on the Canon HF100.

The production is powerful; Ross's voice is confident and commanding.What's so puzzling is that \\"The Boss\\" didn't storm the album charts in '79, nor did any of its tracks enjoy any real singles chart success. Hopefully, those who didn't give \\"The Boss\\" a chance two decades ago will reconsider.

They shoot countless bullets, including maybe 30 or so from a 15-round magazine gun...this happens more than once. I can't really complain about that, though.

Michael Pare sleepwalks through his role as the ex-military captain whose services as a boat commander are solicited by environmentalists out to expose the wicked treatment of animals on a remote South Pacific island. Along for the ride, naturally, is an ambitious tv journalist out to make the \\"big story\\", and you know that most of the cast will end up as appetizers for the monsters, but that's what you expect in these kind of films.

In addition to the menu problems mentioned in other reviews (and please quit telling us we can skip the ads with the \\"menu\\" or \\"fast forward\\" button because we don't all own the same DVD player as you), the quality of this DVD is just poor. It looks like someone just spliced segments together with no regard for the end product. I did not sit through the whole thing, but the first two segments I watched had the audio clipped at the beginning and end in a very noticeable fashion. This would have been easily caught before production if someone had taken the time to watch what they created.

The names of the Gods and Goddesses seemed to be innumberable and impossible to pronounce unless you've had some previous learning of the Greeks or Romans. Furthermore, since it was difficult to find out how to say their names, it made it difficult to remember them!However, a few of the stories were fun to read, and other were humorous. Also, the stories were written with simplicity; it would be feasible for a middle-schooler to read just as it would be for high-school and beyond.As far as mythology goes, and to it's inherent barrier of excitement, Hamilton did well."},{"rating":"1","title":"not my type","review":"I thought this book was so boring.

I beg to differ. This book describes way too many Greek myths with unnecessary detail. It was about 500 pages of boredom, but if I had to pick a favorite part, it would be the part about the Trojan War. It was the most well-written and I found it interesting. There are so many myths, each with an individual main idea, that it would be impossible to describe all of them, so I won't. The author probably wrote so many myths to better inform the reader about Greeks and their history. Even so, she could have made it a lot more exciting. Overall I didn't like this book at all, but I would still recommend it to kids who like mythology and don't mind a boring book.

It is an easy and interesting read that also sets the stage for further exploration.

It hardly appreciates the richness of Greek mythology; Hamilton rather plods through the stories in Greek mythology (the book ought to be called \\"Greek and Roman Mythology,\\" as it is mostly stories from ancient Greek culture, and its imitators, the Romans), except for that last chapter on Norse mythology. The only useful parts are the introductory chapters, which provide a nice overview of the themes of Greco-Roman mythology, how it came about, brief bios of major writers, etc, and the genealogical tables at the back of the book. For a better introduction to mythology, and a book that encompasses more than Greco-Roman mythology, read Michael Macrone's \\"Brush Up Your Mythology.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Readable","review":"The author accumulated the legends from authors such as Ovid and Hesiod, and then organized them into her own words.

I only read it for school, but normally I enjoy reading books or Greek/Roman History. The error in this book was that too much information was covered in so too few of pages. I know that may seem strange as the book is 350 pages, but the author tried to cover ever aspect of Greek and Roman Mythology and Literature. His writing style became to plain and ended up reading like a teenage girl was describing it. It came out like:Zeus sleep with Lady 1. Lady 1 had Son 1. Hera killed Lady 1. Son 1 love Lady 2. Lady two had 3 girls and 1 son. Zeus slept with one of the girls... and so on.Yes that is a simplification of how the book read, but I think it gets my point a cross. This book worked a a great refresher for information I already knew. In that fact it did succeed. I feel if you don't already know Greek/Roman Mythology it will leave you lost or wanting to read a different book to fill in all the holes."},{"rating":"2","title":"NAPAHIGH STUDENT million word report","review":"Mythology by Edith Hamilton is a wonderful book for anyone who loves the stories of gods and heroes as much as I do. After not studying the Greek and Roman myths for about two years in school, I thought I had lost my love for the stories. But, when I read this book about the stories of myth and ledged, my mind is once again filled with awe and wonder. Reading about how people in ancient Greece and Rome explained how things happened, such as with Hera and Argus and how the peacock got it's eyes, and with Demeter and Hades and how the seasons began, is a truly wonderful reading experience. However, there are so many different stories in this book, it starts to become hard to tell one from the other. That is one thing I disliked about the book Mythology. True, they were separated and placed into categories, but I felt like there were to many stories/legends crammed into one book. However, over all it was a truly wonderful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Pleased","review":"This book arrived in great condition, packaged in a ziplock bag and was very clean.

This is much more than just a reference book...it's more like a giant Greek fairytale book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grain of Salt","review":"While it is certainly true that Edith Hamilton is a standby in the field of Classics, her telling of myths must be taken with a grain of salt. A product of her time and education, she has a tendancy to try and force a quasi-Christian mythos on Greek legends ie a Savior figure being slain and resurrected. Although this is a good introduction, particularly for younger folk, it should be viewed as a springboard and no more. It is easy to read, and relatively well laid out, but anyone with a serious interest in Greek mythology and mindset should look elsewhere for a truer understanding and appreciation, one that does not force or contrive Christian parallels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mythology","review":"ISBN 0316341142 - Mythology is a bit like Pokemon to me - I can't remember all those names and I certainly can't remember who's got what powers. I had hope that this book would help me start to remember at least some of it, but it seems to have made things a little worse.Author Edith Hamilton retells various Greek and Romans myths, in her own words. Most gods are referred to by both names which, at least for me, only adds to the confusion. On top of that, Hamilton's writing style doesn't appeal to me. I had to read and re-read sentences, not because they were complex and confusing but because my mind would actually wander in the middle of sentences - not a good indicator.Clearly, mythology is a matter of taste, but if you're anything like me - a bit ignorant on the topic and trying to correct that - this book is a good reference, something to open and rely on for info, but not a good read.- AnnaLovesBooks"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Introduction to Mythology","review":"Being a mystery writer, I find that reading a wide variety of materials assists me in my work.

I still have that much worn, much loved, much dog-eared paperback on my book shelves that later in life inspired me to read other myths of other times and places, which lead me to James Joyce, Flannery O'Connor and T.C.Boyle and a life-long head over heels romance with literature.

Boy, was I in for a disappointment. Not only does Edith Hamilton blandly summarize every story, but she leaves out many of the details that students are eager to absorb. Although I have great respect for the text since it was one of the first to bring Greek myth into an easily-accessible form, it is dated and a poor text for a high-school mythology class. Some teachers argue that the elevated language and confusing sentence structure is good practice for serious students, and it is in other contexts. But I am of the opinion that mythology should be fresh and exciting--as it was to the original myth-makers. As Thomas Bulfinch had said, \\"Thus we hope to teach mythology not as a study, but as a relaxation from study.\\" When a text makes its subject nearly impossible to appreciate, it's not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfaithful to the sources","review":"Hamilton's writings on Classical mythology are very easy to read, and give the general reader an intoductory view of the different myths.

I love the record for a number of reasons: the voice; the musicians; the songs, but more than anything else it was memorable for showing me a country band could SWING. It's not rock or blues or jazz but it has it's own feel and, of course, caused me to check out the likes of Bob Wills - not exactly a household name in the United Kingdom.

Please, for the sake of those that like Everclear's early work don't listen to these new albums, especially \\"Volume II,\\" which I haven't put back in my CD player for weeks.So sad, so sad....I gave them a chance. I think I'll just revisit \\"Sparkle\\" and \\"Afterglow\\" from now on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another #2 Sell-Out Album","review":"Everclear spoke of true middle-American troubles on their first album. Well, they apparently living the high life and have bought that big house on the west-side now because it comes through loud and clear on this album. This is pure sugary-radio pop rock at its worst. If you liked the first album, you won't like this one. If you like 'Nsync, you'll like this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"it rocks","review":"\\"I will be sitting on top when the sky falls down and it all goes wrong again!\\" There's a line from the first song on Everclear's counterpart to Songs From an American Movie, Vol 1. Learning How to Smile had a more optimistic take to it... but Good Time For a Bad Attitude is definitely back to their aggressive, angry sound which completely rocks this album. First of all, look at the cover and notice the Halloween-colored American Flag, a cynical spoof on the whole damned 2000 election... Vol 2 is jam-packed with angry, somewhat sarcastic lyrics and killer melodies (Check out instrumental \\"Halloween Americana). My favorites on here include fast, alternative-rock driven \\"When It All Goes Wrong Again,\\" and slower ones like \\"Out of My Depth\\" and \\"Overwhelming.\\" There is no holding back on this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Follow Up Album","review":"I bought Volume One:Learning How to Smile with high hopes and big expectations, and I was happily surprised. It was a wonderful album, one of my favorites. I was quite sure that Good Time for a Bad Attitude could never even come close.Then I popped it into the CD playerAt first listen, I was dissapointed...it was so different from Volume One and I had been hoping for more of the same. Then, I threw all of my preconcieved notions aside and listened to it as what it was, a great album. They up the ante on this one, making the distortion louder and the lyrics meaner until suddenly I wasn't quite sure how I could ever think it wasn't worth my money.This is one to be bought."},{"rating":"2","title":"So, you like Everlear huh?","review":"Let me just first say that the reason why I didnt give this album 5 stars is because its not breakthrough. Its just a great album. You are here for one of 2 reasons (probably), you're thinking of buying this album or you just want to see what comments people has posted. Well for those of you wanting to buy this album I say this: \\"Buy it\\". Thats it, thats the end of the review.Actually, let me just share some more thoughts. I think the lyrics on this album are great and I relate to them. I expected the album to be heavier, mostly because the first single, but the album didnt dissapoint. It has about 4 slow songs that are great once you get into them. There isnt a bad song on the album, really. Every song is great in it's own way. And there isnt much repetition. My favorites are: 2,4,7,9,10,12"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!","review":"I have to say Everclear is my all time favorite band...no one will be able to top them ever. I was so happy to learn that they had two albums comming out this year. The first one of the set was great but a little dissapointing to people who are used to their darker side. This album really is great and rivals So much For the After glow as my my favorite from everclear. I bought it the day it came out and was not dissapointed.

If you edited a couple of these songs you'd have to take out the entire chorus. I was bitterly disappointed. And as I say, I am a fan of the last two Everclear CD's but this one.......yuck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to the old sound.","review":"Do you remember when Sparkle and Fade was released? I do and I remember listening to Art Alexakis's voice and wondering what kind of life he must of had. Sparkle and Fade had a real alternative band feel. Lots of guitar and hypnotizing lyrics.Songs From An American Movie Vol. 2 has that feel again. Its real pain. Kind of what was on World of Noise. Everclear has been my favorite band forever and I can't see how they could go wrong. I was estatic that this cd had heavy guitar in it. Back to the old sound. Thats all I can say."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD Works","review":"Volume 2 is definitely a harder, punkier style than Volume 1 or even Afterglow. However, do not buy this album expecting a replay of World of Noise or Sparkle and Fade. This is a distinctly new style for Everclear, a sometimes obnoxious, self consciously juvenile, triumphalistic ode to being a badass. That said, there is no denying that this is a good album, especially when viewed within the context of Everclear's earlier work. That is, the honest, melancholy tone of the first 3 albums, I think, buys Everclear the right to come out with this slightly tongue and cheek production. The album flows easily from beginning to end without any obvious ear soars, although \\"Babytalk\\" is admittedly a little lame.So my advice to fans of Everclear (and good music in general) is go out and buy this album. It will quickly become a part of you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than Volume 1, by a long shot.","review":"What little \\"Volume 1\\" had to offer, \\"Volume 2\\" has even less.There is not one single memorable tune. It's all Everclear-sounding songs, but nothing that jumps out and says, \\"Hey, listen to me again!\\"Competently done, well played, well produced...but utterly inconsequential. \\"Rock Star\\" even sounds like an Everclear cover band song, like somebody was trying to imitate Alexakis and company.This was WAY boring, I thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book stays with you","review":"I read Orange Laughter a few years ago and I still remember how thrilling it was to read.

Hadn't used them a week before the blades were dragging and the spring would not return to full open. Annoying when you have acres of pruning to do. I'm a bit anxious about making any un-directed adjustments to the screws I see. Can just picture parts flying everywhere with no instructions on how to re-assemble.

I would NEVER switch to anything else. They never break, and the blade's are replacable if you ever ding the blade were it can not be repaired. Now that I know there here on Amazon, I plan on buying another pair, just in case I end up losing the one's I have. There more than worth the money whether your using them for commercial use or just residental. They will cut any hardwood branch you need them to. Garenteed. And for the person who put them as three stars because of rust; you need to oil them and keep them in better care than leaving them out in the yard at night..they stay in my truck toolbox even during the winter and as long as you oil them once a week; they will be fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Felco original hand pruner rocks!","review":"I helped with landscaping/pruning questions as a part-time job some years ago, so have had occasion to use many pruners.

I have sprayed it with oil several times and it is good for a day of two and then it sticks again.One of the blades has a ridge which is about 1/8\\" wide and 1/8\\" thick. I don't remember that on the older one (which she loved) having that.Very disappointed and as you know \\"If momma aint happy, aint nobody happy.\\"What is the next step?Howard HochmanP.S.

But as much as I wanted to like them, after six months of use I have to admit I'm disappointed. The blade has already dulled and shows signs of rust, and the pruners now often stick (i.e., do not snap back open after a cut and need to be nudged open). I have oiled them regularly and sharpened as well. It's possible I'm missing something on the maintenance front. But after only six months one would expect a quality product to work well even with less-than-perfect maintenance, no? In short, in my experience these have been no better, and actually a bit worse, than the \\"regular\\" pruners you can buy for 1/3 the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced. Look further.","review":"Clearly of quality construction, but far too expensive given options that are available.

They've worn well even though I don't treat them very well. I'll admit that I got them in part because of the snob appeal. Every horticulturist I know has a pair of Felco's in a holster on their belt.You may want to see these in person first, though, before buying them on Amazon. I'm 6'4\\" and have pretty big hands, but the F-2s seem a tad big even for me.

It has high reviews but the item I got was nearly useless. If I cut 4 or 5 stems the plant juices will cause the blades to stick together and I will have to use both hands to force them open. Then the next thing I cut they will stick closed again. Considering the other reviews I can only think that they are making this much more cheaply than they did in the past and the spring that opens the blades is much weaker. Anyway, it is useless. And I even bought the leather sheath for it. Which shows that sometimes even 96 positive reviews can be wrong.

Even though I'm petite (95 lbs) and have arthritic hands, I am able to use this tool with no problem.

Now, after seeing this movie, I have a much bigger respect for him. Still, it's not the best movie ever made. With a great plot, and great acting, this movie falls short of a comedy. While it has many funny moments, most of them are shown on the preview, so, when you see it, you won't see a whole lot of surprise gags. There's a few, some extremely funny, but not a whole lot.

Because of these scenes it made me think that this movie should not have named The Mexican, it should have named \\"Toilet\\" or \\"Ugly Toilet\\" or \\"Toilet Exchangers\\". There was not a single character in this movie whom the director did not show us going to the toilet. One character comes out of the toilet and the other goes in and this carries on making the viewer think that they do not have any thing else to do. This was an ugliest and worst movie i have seen in my life time. This was an ugly movie by ugly Americans named \\"The Mexican\\". I think Mexicans should have sued the director.

Brad Pitt's been voted People magazine's \\"Sexiest Man in the World.\\" They possess two of the screen's most photogenic faces, so teaming them, along with \\"The Sopranos\\" James Gandolfini, was a stroke of genius. The story follows a reluctant bagman (Pitt) who is sent to Mexico to retrieve a legendary pistol, known as The Mexican. Supposedly, it was crafted as a wedding present for a nobleman if he'd marry the gunsmith's daughter who, in turn, loved her father's apprentice who rigged the gun to misfire if it fell into the wrong hands. He figures this errand should end his indentured servitude to an underworld crime boss for past misdeeds.The script and performances are both stunning, but there wasn't enough screen time between Pitt and roberts, which was dissappoining.

Must see the DVD version as some of the deleted scenes were awesome.

Though I found myself continuously saying, \\"Hit the eject button\\", I stuck it out with the idea that something with Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts in it had to get better as time went on. It didn't. Brad Pitt is appealing enough, but he looked and appeared a good 7-10 years younger than Roberts. She seemed more like a big sister than a woman the refreshingly boyish and open hearted Pitt would be head over heels for.

Being a native to California and having lived several years in Southern Cali, I could completely relate to the analytical dialog between characters at what would seem to be inappropriate times. The \`Supranos' star was true to his deep yet...sorry but I gotta kill ya now, persona was great. I actually could get into Brad Pitts, screw up' character role which fit him well.

It was really bad. There were a few funny moments where Pitt revived his role as the crazy guy from 12 Monkeys, but most of the movie was a real bore. Tony Soprano was in the movie as a gay hit man. Very weird seeing him play the \\"sensitive\\" role. The movie had a strange vibe, I'd call it Drama-Comedy?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much ....","review":"Unless you really do not have any thing else to watch at night, then have a go... but you can certainly speed-forward the video for some part. The scenario was basically made around a couple of famous actor, but the story is really nothing to be doing kart-wheels about! I do not recommend this movie even though the main actors are nice to watch. Julia Roberts always has a great laugh and smile...."},{"rating":"1","title":"A helluva disappointment!","review":"In my view, the star status of Pitt and Roberts and the magazine reviews that spoke of \\"A two hour adrenaline rush\\" were rather misleading. Were the stars using this movie as a \\"filler-in\\" between bigger projects? This is a long movie and there ain't no adrenaline, folks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"surprisingly disappointing","review":"I thought that a film with Julia Roberts and Brad Pitt would have to be a good one. This isn't the case. The story hardly holds together and rambles. Even Roberts and Pitt lose some of their appeal as the protagonists they play are non sympathetic characters who, in the end, I didn't care about at all. The only character to elicit my sympathy was the hired killer who at least is changed by his experiences in the movie. The others remained unaffected, as I was."},{"rating":"1","title":"After 15 Minutes","review":"this film goes down hill. You keep expecting it to pick up but the story let's the actor's down. I watch this because of the star's past reputation. They have both made some good movie's. But in this film you need more than just star chasima to carrey a film. Pitt seems to have fun with the role and his take on it is fun but Robert's is relying to much on her smile. If she ever loses her teeth she is in trouble. There are few suprises and you come away disapointed. This movie you forget as soon as you get out of the theater. That's why the review. I would like to see better movie's. Movie's with some comic insperation. When we give film's like this a good review we get what we deserve. These actor's and especially writer's can do better."},{"rating":"1","title":"the mexican","review":"i ordered this movie oct. 14, 2001 and never received it-buyers beware-there is a crook on this line"},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment........","review":"Ever since I viewed this movie, I've been trying to figure out how they ever got two big stars like Julia Roberts and Brad Pitt to appear in it. The loosely-woven plot centers around a beautiful pistol, inlaid with silver, which seems to be valuable to a lot of people. Brad Pitt had the temerity to run into a big-time crook with his car and ever since then has worked off his debt by doing the bad guy's dirty deeds. (How unlikely is that?) His last assignment is to recover the gun and bring it back to his boss. Julia Roberts is kidnapped by another bad guy with a heart of gold and they form a real bond as the movie progresses. It's hard to tell who's a bad guy and who's a good guy and frankly, by the end of the movie, I didn't care!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best movies in a long time.","review":"The fact that this movie had two big Hollywood stars (well, 3 if you count Gene Hackman, but he's in EVERYTHING these days anyway.) may have done it an injustice everywhere outside of the box office. Everyone was expecting typical Big Hollywood over-the-topness, which this movie does not have. Instead it is sublime. (Note: pay attention to the \\"slow\\" periods of the movie, they are actually important.) The way the story of the gun and it's maker is re-told, each time revealing a little more, giving you the clues you need to tie it into the current story, up to the beautiful climactic scene is nothing short of brilliant. Think of this as an Indie movie which just happens to have two big Hollywood stars. Think of it as the movie 'El Mariachi' WANTED to be. Simply the best effort to come out on major release in years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining screwball romance","review":"\\"The Mexican\\" follows the arcs of one dimwit and two marginally brighter bulbs in pursuit of the fabulous titular weapon. Brad Pitt pulls off the dim bulb role ably, but he does manage to seem just smart enough to stay alive in his difficult liine of work. Julia Roberts's rather loony rendition of Pitt's pyscho-babble enamored girlfriend teeters just on the edge of irritating, but Roberts's natural charm keep her in the audiences' good graces.The movie's real saving grace is James Gondolfini's delirously improbable character, who truly makes the movie worth seeing and adds the best entertainment value.Avoid this movie if you like very linear plot construction (a la French Kiss, Chinatown) and don't like disjointed cutting (Pulp Fiction, Traffic)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Like a good pudding but then there is a fly...","review":"The music is terrific. The atmosphere of Mexico is terrific. Brad Pitt is good. I can't stand Roberts. What is she doing, going for the Barbara Streisand acting award? Talk about annoying. I mean really annoying... The movie is on the one hand fun as long as she is not on the screen. But then she is back on the screen..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a terrible movie!!!","review":"The only thing to say about The Mexican is that it is a monumental disaster! It is one of the worst movies I have ever seen and joins the ranks of other movie stinkers such as Batman and Robin and The Quest for Camelot. I suppose the director thought that by getting big names to be in his movie (Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts) that he could make this movie flop, a hit. This is not the case at all. He was horribly mistaken. The story goes absolutely nowhere and from the very first scene, there begins a steep downward spiral. So if you enjoy watching movies with no plot and horrible a script, by all means, view this movie. But if you like movies with plots and a somewhat presentable script, avoid The Mexican at all cost. This movie is not worth the time or the paper the script was printed on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice packaging","review":"Yeah, nice packaging. But content... something is lacking and I'm not sure what it is. I didn't get bored watching this film, but I didn't get very excited either. I think I chuckled twice, both times at Pitt's character. This film just seemed like vanilla... nothing particlularly bad about it, but nothing particularly good about it either. Bland..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm surprised it was dull, boring and bad...","review":"I was surprised that Julia Roberts and Brad Pitt choose this movie to play. It wasn't Roberts-isk. Nor do I think it was Pitt-isk. Funny in few parts but overall the movie is dull and boring.About a Mexican gun with a \\"story\\" behind it. Jerry (Pitt) is set out to hunt the gun down and bring it back to his \\"boss\\". In the meantime, someone 'kidnaps' Sam (Julia Roberts), who is Jerry's than girlfriend, to tell him where the gun is and where Jerry is. Sam knows nothing, of course, because they broke up because Jerry keeps being Jerry (aka selfish, not ready to settle down).In the long run, someone gets killed, all others are threatened by someone else. And in the end it's a happy ever after story, as well all know that's how stories usually end up.Again funny few parts but I suggest one to pass on the movie.

The plot was dull, the script was laughingly bad.... the whole thing simply plods along leaving the audience not caring what happens to the characters on the screen. The most comical thing about it is the fact that with such \\"A-list\\" talent on the screen, this bomb cost a fortune to make. Didn't anyone bother to read the script before they started filming?

But I guess star power given a mediocre directing and editing just bombs out. Roberts and Pitt's continuous bickerings and shouting all throughout the movie made them look like two over grown kids fighting over anything at the slightest provocation. Gandolfini's character was likewise confusing. I believe the only good actor in the movie was the dog. The DTS format was excelent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateur hour","review":"This movie is a mess. The convoluted plot could probably work in good hands, but the direction is completely lacking in focus, and the editing is atrocious. Pitt and Gandolfini turn in good performances -- the only redeeming qualities to be found here. There are too many plot points that don't make any sense at all. One fairly prominent character disappears without a trace about halfway through the movie, and there is no explanation as to what happened to him -- or how a particular plot thread was resolved. You do figure that out after watching the deleted scenes on the DVD -- but why were these two or three key scenes deleted? This movie was made by a bunch of no-talent amateurs who got in way over their heads."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost Criminal","review":"The title of this review refers to the waste of Julia's and Jimmy Gs talents.

Mr. Pitt isn't very convincing either. Specifically, this film is a dog because: Incredible poor editing.

The writing within these tracks is truly five stars. This album has by far the best writing of any Brooks album, possibly any album in history. Each and every track tells a story. I salute Brooks in his decision on making videos. When listening to these songs, you can vision your own video. You're not robbed by one that is made for you. All tracks on this album are stories that most of us can relate, they are real life.

The acting by the principles was fine, but I think the only thing that saved this movie for me was the choreography by Bob Fosse. I think what really turned me off was the omission of a few great songs. The following tunes from the original show were left out - Near To You, We've Got To Think About the Game, A Man Doesn't Know. And Applegate's tune, The Good Old Days, was abridged. A new tune, There's Something About an Empty Chair, was added to replace Near To You, but it was very weak.

In the 60's Channel 9 (KHJ-TV) in Los Angeles would show the featured Million Dollar Movie seven days a week.My brother and I watched it each time it was shown, thus we knew the words to all of the songs so we would sing-a-long with the stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"damn yankees","review":"i ordered this because our community theatre is going to do this musical and i wanted to see the dance numbers. it was interesting to see fosse dance in his early works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Native Peoples Magazine has it all!!","review":"I LOVE this magazine!!

With Daz repping Southern California and JT repping Northern California. It has more of a Bay Area rap sound to it as far as production goes but you can't go wrong with the West Coast sound and quality of all the beats. This is an album with a lot of Northern California rappers guest starring and a spot by Kurupt. Other than a few skippable tracks there is a lot of heat on this. E-40 and C-Bo and Yukmouth and the usual Bay ballers all don't let down. Daz is not featured on a couple of the songs and there are a few rappers who should not have been on the project in my opinion, but it happens. The cd booklet says all songs are produced by Sean T but I noticed a Mike Mosley production and also a Battlecat on one of the bonus cuts. This is a cool record, if you like California rap then this shouldn't be a downer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding !

Now that I'm concentrating on my Kindle collection I'm so pleased to be able to add these books and at more reasonable prices than most Publishers charge for their Kindle ebooks.This is a sweet story, a fantasy of times long pasted, in which Ms Robards has created her own world. The story is told simply. The characters, at least the main characters, are fully developed, likable and interesting. Actually, it would have been nice to have seen some of the minor characters developed further. I've always wondered about the direction the younger sisters lives would take.Ms Robards writes very well and I, generally, always enjoy her books. My biggest complaint is that her works are not frequent and sometimes end abruptly - like she runs out of time to write to the full story. She creates some of the best characters in her genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"For un upgraded version, try \\"Dark Torment\\". Skip this one.","review":"Karen Robards is one of my favorites. Her more recent book, \\"Dark Torment\\", is extremely similar to \\"Nobody's Angel\\", and surpasses it in character development, plot and tension.\\"Dark Torment\\" is the much better version, and I recommend you skip \\"Nobody's Angel\\" and go to the real thing.Suzannah's and Ian's relationship seemed slow, and there wasn't much tension (until the end on the ship).There was continuous reference to Suzannah's religious beliefs, but she fell into bed with Ian with almost no urging. Not too believable and overly hypocritical.I feel the end was also anti-climactic, and felt that Robards had included too many unnecessary secondary characters.

I was curious, but I wasn't sure if I'd actually like the stuff. I bought this sampler to help me decide, and I think it was a good choice. It offers nine tracks of highlights from other 'Echoes of Nature' albums. The tracks may be short (approx. 7.5 minutes each), but it's still a great way to decide whether you like this sort of thing, and what kind of sounds you're looking for. Personally, I was rather impressed at the quality of recording on such a cheap CD! While I'd be willing to bet that the sounds are re-mixed, they all sound quite real, the volume is constant throughout the CD, and for the most part there aren't any lengthy repetitive stretches which seem to plague other albums. If you're curious about this sort of CD, I'd highly suggest getting this one first!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the real thing","review":"This is a collection of real nature sounds, with no goofy melodies to get in the way.

Not every track is perfect: the thunderstorm is not as dramatic as I'd like -- I guess it's tricky to get close to a thunderstorm with recording equipment : ) -- and the morning birds are a little too busy -- I was hoping for something gentler like NPR's morning bird sounds.

Of course, the pop music crowd ate him up, and the guy made millions...but left most of the real country music fans scratching their heads, and wondering what the hell happened! But, back to the album. This CD showcases Garth's talents with such numbers as: \\"I Know One\\", \\"Much Too Young\\", and \\"If Tomorrow Never Comes\\". It also includes the more \\"pop\\" oriented preview of the \\"Garth\\" to come, such as \\"The Dance\\" and \\"Everytime that it Rains\\".

She implies that those carrying multiples many years ago always gave birth to healthy 7-lb each infants with none of the problems that some of us having multiples face today. She is an advocate for veganism, water births, home births, doulas and midwives and avoiding pain meds.

This is my second pregnancy, and I recently found out that I'm carrying twins. I was interested in the possibility of a vagnial birth with minimal intervention, but I'm more shaken than encouraged by Noble's stance on the evils of c-sections and other possible complications. This book was NOT the one I needed to help me discern what was best in the upcoming months.The nutrition information had a solid core, but Noble pushed the envelope with her own agenda of anti-dairy pro-vegan diets.

I would say that the new addition has been updated in its political idealogy only, with little focus on improving the accuracy of the information."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as awesome as I'd hoped","review":"parts of this book are ok, but I disagreed with a lot of it too- the book does not give an objective viewpoint on pregnancy & birth."},{"rating":"1","title":"an author with an agenda","review":"This author clearly has her opinions--and negative ones directed at the medical community. Admittedly, while this author probably knows more than I do about twins (I'm still pregnant with mine), I felt as if I were reading an editorial at times rather than an informative book about being pregnant with, having, and raising twins. She's against circumcisions. She's against C-sections. She thinks mothers should take their twins to the doctor's separately (what??), etc., etc.. There are some helpful notes in the margins which are from parents of twins, but some of them were worrisome rather than helpful (\\"I thought everything was fine and I lost one twin at 12 weeks...\\"). I just happened to buy this book because it was among the first I had seen. Perhaps it was not my wisest choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"ridiculous book","review":"I pretty much agree with all the other negative reviews about this book so I won't restate everything, but this book was clearly written by someone who does not want to INFORM, but only to convince the reader to do things HER WAY. Basically, if you have a C-section, don't breast feed, or if you circumsize your child then you are a horrible person, according to the author. Also, I work in the Pediatric ICU and I can tell you that some things written in this book are not only false but could be dangerous to your child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scary and preachy, would not recommend.","review":"The tone of this book comes off as preachy and guilt laden. This book will easily make most pregnant women anxious and scared. Elizabeth Noble has her opinions and is entitled to them,however I wish I had read the reviews before I wasted my money on this trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just threw it away.","review":"This is the worst book I have ever read about pregnancy, parenthood and multiple birth. The author seems to mistrust every healthcare professional, medical procedure and discourages common sense. With phrases like, \\"Circumsizing terrorizes, terrorism circumcises,\\" you can get your guilt trip without even leaving the house. Negative and disturbing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Having Twins and More","review":"There are several areas within this book which misrepresents published data - a concerning example of misinforming the public concerning areas in obstetrics which the authors obviously lack knowledge. The chapter on Prenatal Care and Screening Tests has inaccuate data on ultrasound and makes ultrasound seem unsafe. In fact, the reasons patients were having ultrasound exams in the first place were because they were having complications. The authors twist the data to make it sound as though the ultrasound caused the problems. Ultrasound equipment utilized in the USA has strict safety criteria to ensure safe use in fetuses. Too bad they forgot to describe how much perinatal care has advanced because of sonography.My patients find this book confuses them and misleading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of feel good mumbo-jumbo","review":"Don't be fooled. This book is full of feel good psudo-scientific mumbo-jumbo, and rather short on good, scientifically backed information. It really is garbage, and I cannot see how it would be useful to anyone, nor would I want anyone who found it useful to be in charge of raising a baby, much less two. I cannot even count the number of useless paragraphs in this book, or the number of unsourced 'studies' that show one thing, but another unsourced study from a different country said that the other thing could be true, and ARGH! It's so bad my brain hurts... starting to get the picture?"},{"rating":"1","title":"why am i still reading this book?","review":"I continue to search the pages of this book for \\"guidance.\\" All I seem to find are very negative, very opinionated statements on what the author wants to convey are the ONLY ways that you can carry, birth and raise twins. The last thing a parent of multiples needs is reading that they've been doing it wrong. We are all one step away from insanity in those first months and surely want to read something more objective and encouraging. Don't waste your time getting depressed from reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book is Biased, Unscientific, and Unhelpful","review":"I am pregnant with twins and I've read six books so far on pregnancy and this is the only book I've read that reads like an opinion column and not one based on any medical facts or published studies. Worse yet, the author presents her strong biases only and her views are not ones that are supported by the majority of OB/GYN doctors, including mine. Beyond the misinformation, I just did not enjoy this book at all and thought it was a big waste of money. Among other things, I was really offended by the author's preachy tone and lack of any factual support for her opinions on the evils of all milk and dairy products, circumcision, and C-sections for babies in the breech position. I did not learn a single thing from this book. There are so many other twin books out there and ALL of them are more helpful than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I bought this book because it was the only one available on multiple pregnancies at the book store I was at. The book was really disappointing. Although I tend to agree with some of the authors \\"holistic and natural\\" views, there was little unbiased presentation of all the options. It was pretty anti-Csection, anti-formula, anti-circumcision, etc. I feel like a more helpful book would present all sides of an issue in an unbiased manner and then let the parents make the decision from there. I am not the kind of person to write a review on anything... but I just found this book so disappointing that I HAD to make sure that other people don't make the same mistake I made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Preachy, One-sided and SCARY","review":"I am pregnant with twins and a friend bought me this book as a gift. I am so happy she left the gift receipt in the book! I can't wait to return it!! This book was shocking, bizarre, and extremely one-sided. Sections of it were downright scary and INSULTING. Don't waste your money. The author does not present information for the reader to consider, instead she preaches. Sections of the book made even me angry. We are human beings. Perhaps the author forgot this as she wrote parts of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please dont read this book","review":"I bought this book because i wanted to learn more about twins. I do not usually post reviews but I chose to make an exception. The book is very disorganized, has alot of negative stuff in the book that unless your doctor advise's you there is problem, most pregnant woman could do without reading. As if pregnant woman dont worry enough on their own! I basically stopped reading after i came to a chapter on nutrition that stated if i drink cow's milk i might as well attach my babies to a cow's udder. I think this author seems fanatical in her opinions and many of them do not have much scientific evidence to back them up."},{"rating":"1","title":"a very evil book","review":"I bought this book when I was expecting twins. Now my twins are 8 months old. This book will make you unnecessarily anxious and upset and the author tries to push her own opinions on childbirth and pretend they have a scientific basis. The fact opf the matter is a lot of twin moms end up having c-sections. This isn't just because doctor's are c-section happy but because it is often medically necessary. Just one exapmple of how evil this book is, is that it pertrays a c-section as a very scary and horrible thing for the mom and the babies. In fact, she even goes on to imply that your babies may have some horrible lasting memories of their traumatic c-section birth that they will ask you about in later years. Give me a break! Also, read with caution the 5-star reviews of this book. It is my opinion that these folks either work for the publisher or are in cahoots with the author."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Only Twin Book that tells it like it is!","review":"After searching for several books on twins, I found this one. I have had several children, and am expecting twins now. This book gives the medical side of everything having to do with twins, as well as the emotional side. She is very well researched, and steps outside the mainstream side of the birthing process. There are alternatives,it is possible to have a great twin delivery, but it all starts with nutrition. One cannot run a marathon well if she has not practiced due diligence. Very well written! Thanks for this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing","review":"I bought this book and initially skimmed through it. I was shocked and horrified by the section on circumcision. It was completely biased AGAINST circumcision and I believe referred to it as \\"male mutilation\\". After reading that section, I didn't feel that I could trust any of the other information in it to be objective or scientific and therefore returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Having Twins and More: A Parents Guide to Multiple Pregnancy","review":"I would not recommend purchasing this book for yourself or as a gift. If you want to know about everything that can go wrong with a multiple pregnancy than this book is for you. The book is very depressing and will add stress to any pregnant mother of multiples. There must be better books out there with information for pregnant women of multiples."},{"rating":"1","title":"be careful with this advice","review":"This author offers a lot of advice that, in my opinion, make a multiple-birth pregnancy more, rather than less, risky. With any multiple pregnancy you would be playing it safe to weigh the unconventional advice against the more conventional."},{"rating":"1","title":"just plain bad","review":"Not that you need another review warning you about this book, but here's a couple of real gems of advice from the author: (actual quotes from the book)- 'Knowing the gender of each baby before birth makes naming easier.' (thanks.)- 'Soon after the mother has been cut (episiotomy or Caesarean), the knife is readied for the newborn boy's penis.' (The book then goes on to tell a story of a guy who's penis was CUT OFF during his circumcision which forced him to undergo a sex change.)I've learned my lesson, read the reviews before you buy a book.How did this book even make it to print?Isn't there something fishy about all those 5 star reviews for this book? It almost feels like they were written by the author or the publisher."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Parent's Guide to Fear and Guilt","review":"Do not read this book if you are an expecting parent of twins unless you are looking a nightmarish exploration of medical challenges, frightening statistics, and guilt-inducing diatribes that--even if true--is by no means helpful. This book is written for academics and professionals, not parents. It has only encouraged us to fear the remainder of our pregnancy, the well-being of our first child, and the pains we will suffer in the afterlife for having resorted to fertility drugs to have children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diappointed","review":"I was disappointed in this product due to it being horribly warped. So far it plays OK but you can hear a distortion of the Music and Vocals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much pop","review":"Bland and unorignal, this album contains too much of the slick pop that dominated Dolly's career duing the late 70's and early 80's. Now that she is beginning to embrace her roots again it is time to forget about this sad chapter in her career."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let the sell-out begin","review":"This was the album that began Dolly's sellout period. Abandoning her country roots for a slick, glossy, Hollywood production she recorded a set of mostly forgettable songs (the title track is as generic as they come) and thus, of course, sold a ton of records to a bunch of people who knew nothing about country music. This blueprint has now become an example for Shania Twain and countless others more interested in making lots of money then they are in making exciting music.This is a real shame as so much of her music from her country roots is out of print in favor of umpteen compilations with \\"I Will Always Love You\\" and the title track to this album (among others), while her much more compelling music is no longer available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unlistenable","review":"For anyone who has spent the past 20 years or so writing off Parton as merely an icon of American kitsch, this album is a big reason why. With this album Parton made a conscious effort to leave her country roots behind and go for the big bucks that bouncy and heavily produced pop had to offer and her credibility as a writer, and musician was lost for many years as a result. To make maters worse these songs sound very dated today and the whole thing is all but unlistenalbe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has not aged well","review":"Although clearly one of Parton's weaker albums, \\"Here You Come Again\\" probably isn't her worst and indeed it does have one undeniable gem in \\"It's All Wrong, But It's Alright\\" (used to clever effect in a scene in the movie \\"Norma Rae\\"). But what really sinks this album from two stars to one star is the mere fact that this is the album that to this day makes so many people refuse to take Parton seriously as the artist she often is. Therefore so much of her fine original work, and the more satisfying direction she has taken musically over the past couple of years has gone ignored by people who can't get the giggly, tacky pop princess out of their mind, and for that this album deserves to be shunned."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of Her Best RCA records...","review":"Silk Electric.Ross' second RCA album after \\"Why Do Fools Fall In Love\\".Like its predecessor \\"Silk Electric\\" includes an eclectic number of songs ranging from doo-wop \\"So Close\\" to a bold rock attempt \\"Fool for your love\\". The album opens with a song titled \\"Muscles\\" written by Michael Jackson for Miss Ross. The track is breathtaking and quite sexy which had great success across the globe and was praised by many critics. Some tracks are great while others just don't seem to belong in this album. Ross sounds harsh in the rock-ish \\"Fool for your love\\" while the best track on the album is a soft Ballad \\"In Your Arms\\". Ross also co-wrote \\"I Am Me\\" a funky- reggae-like song that is catchy. The album also includes a pseudo-disco track \\"Who\\" and other pop/rock tracks like \\"Love Lies\\" and the stunning \\"Still In Love\\". Recommended for Loyal Fans. The Album cover was designed by Andy Warhol, the album was certified GOLD."},{"rating":"2","title":"You really NEED to See this Film....Whatta RIDE!","review":"I was honored to be asked by this man to appear in this film. He has singlehandedly produced 125 amazing music videos for our record label [...], so i'm used to seeing great work from him. But this QUIET ARRANGEMENT is such an enjoyable thriller from the seats. I enjoyed my part but I knew nothing about the film until seeing it all come together at the premiere. Plus an incredible score and soundtrack as expected from such a great director David Snyder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately, only good for a solid overview","review":"It covered all the topics you would expect, but it is mostly a just a good overview of .NET security. I expected more in-depth coverage for a book titled as such. It has only a very brief overview of encryption algorithms without enough real world examples in my opinion, being an advanced .NET programmer but new to the issue of security.The book is actually quite thin compared to its competition, so that should have tipped me off. You could go through it in a couple of days, but the price doesn't reflect that. I was really impressed with the .NET Programming with C# book from the same (small) publisher, so I was really hoping for a lot more. Consider the table of contents and decide for yourself whether this books warrants a purchase. It's a reasonably new topic of course so there are only a few other choices out there right now."},{"rating":"2","title":"How Come Christmas","review":"What a wonderful story to incoporate the joy of Christmas.

I have placed this one on the shelf and very likely will never watch it again unless absolutely bored to tears."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dancing, walking, and sometimes running across country.","review":"I was eager to get my teeth into this book, after having been a huge fan of the author's first book \\"Autobiography of a Witch\\" which I read over a decade ago. However, this book seemed more about the association and friendship with Gerald Gardner (and about his character), and a history lesson throughout some of the travels mentioned in the book. There is mention about the experiences of being a part of and working in a coven, and also chapters about some other interesting witches Lois Bourne has met throughout the course of time which delighted my intrigue. But all in all it wasn't quite what I had anticipated or hoped for. Still worth the read, so long as you don't pre-empt the guts of the book by the suggestive title."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent work!","review":"This is another excellent book from Lois Bourne, one of my favorite authors. She writes about her life in Wicca and Hereditary Witchcraft, telling wonderful stories about her past, training and personal opinions about many well known witches of our time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away","review":"I purchased one of these in 2006, worked fine for 3 years. Then I bought a new TV - a Samsung 52\\" plasma screen. Has never worked properly since. I have spoken to Marantz, they have even sent someone by my house to try to fix it (which was real nice of them). But the final resolution was this unit is simply incompatible with my TV.Since the unit is no longer under warranty, there is nothing they are willing to do. so beware when purchasing a Marantz product, they don't keep up with technology.

Not to mention \\"Against the Grain\\", the first track, which is like the story of my life. Even though \\"Which One Of Them\\", \\"Cold Shoulder\\", and \\"We Bury The Hatchet\\" aren't the best songs in the world, they are not the worst either. Anything those three songs lack is easily made up for in\\"What she's Doing Now\\", The quite brutal \\"Papa Loved Mama\\", and the exciting \\"Shameless\\". Not to mention the Dreamy \\"The River\\", which made a great ending to a great CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Album With Several 5-Star Songs","review":"An uneven third album, but still dizzying, dazzling and inspired. \\"The River\\" may just go down as one of the all-time great songs of hope and inspiration, while \\"Papa Loved Mama\\" is an all-out rowdy delight. \\"What's She Doin' Now\\" - pop melodrama of the tallest order - testifies yet again to Brook's vocal strengths, while \\"Shameless\\" (at least for me) falls flat, subpar even to its live versions. All in all, though, \\"Ropin' the Wind\\" stands as one of Garth's finest."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star is too many!","review":"He was thought to be a carrier of the traditional flame. Once he got his \\"foot in the door\\" in the country music industry, after his first two albums, he all but killed the music genre.

And I'm far from the only one who feels this way!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trailer Park Rock","review":"Roping The Wind might keep the Trailer Park rocking, but it doesn't do much for the rest of us who recognize insincere twang from Garth Brooks Inc. The only wind Garth is roping is between the ears of anyone who'd actually spend their hard earned welfare cheques on it. \\"Against the Grain\\" sounds like Garth is musically and lyrically bankrupt, that is, to anyone with functioning eardrums. That's the best song. Songs such as \\"What She's Doing Now\\", and \\"Pappa Loves Momma\\" only solidifies Brooks as this decade's greatest snake-oil salesman."},{"rating":"1","title":"It IS! It's rock'n the trailer park","review":"I agree with the guy who wrote \\"Trailer Park Rock\\" and disagree with PA. By the way - if you actually were educated (as you claim) you would properly use \\"there\\" istead of \\"their\\" in your paragraph. Anyway, I don't think Garth is a cowboy. In fact, he couldn't rope squat. Certainly he's a poor excuse for a musician. Even PA should recognize that. Rock on PA! But watch those twisters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ropin' the wind is the same as trying to find Garth's talent","review":"Why does this horrible garbage sell? This album is awful.

Give me a copy of the movie on VHS and I could do better on my computer! There are only 2 version of the same movie on DVD currently available on Amazon.

Their (Aplpha Video) version of the Charade is piss poor as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great performance by Vincent Price","review":"This film is more of a mystery than a horror, despite the label on the box. Price's performance as the Doctor-presumed-murderer is... well, priceless. However, those looking for a good horror film ala \\"House of Wax\\" will undoubtedly be a little disappointed. Interestingly enough, I believe the original silent film adaption of \\"The Bat\\" was the inspiration for Bob Kane's \\"Batman\\" of DC Comics fame.Good for anyone who loves old films about creepy mansions with hidden rooms."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 stars for plot 0 for lousy dvd transfer!","review":"I wish I would have read the posts for this movie before buying it!!!

Check out STARWOIDS for a better look at this subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"Cinematography that looks like it was shot by a 5 year old, terrible audio and a message that basically says there's no God.

The worst video I've seen all year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Film","review":"I first saw this film at the Santa Barbara Film Festival and thought it was great. It's good to know that great films are being made outside the studio system. I laughed more with this film than the last three comedies I've seen in the theater. I was also impressed by the poignant points the movie makes. I will always look at the Star Wars movies in a different way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"I'd never completed reading a book in one sitting even if it was only forty pages long. This is the first book on which I've accomplished that feat. Witty, engaging, humane and above all such an easy-read - this book is blue print for how science related books should be written for general public."},{"rating":"1","title":"Move along... nothing to see here","review":"I guess I'm not sure what I expected but the book does not live up to the hype. The book seemed more about a phase in Mlodinow's life; Feynman, Gell-Mann, Helen, and the garbageman neighbor just happened to be there at the time -- like the cast of a play. Getting an insight into physics from reading this book is like learning about bartending by watching Cheers, or medicine by watching Scrubs. It's a good, light read, reminiscent of a well-told recount of an eventful personal vacation."},{"rating":"1","title":"What do you care what other people think?","review":"Mlodinow's book is more about himself than about Feynman, whom he admits he hardly knew. There are no insights here into Feynman's character, or his personality, or the incredible story of his marriage to Arline. Nope, this book is mostly the author boasting about graduating early, writing a well-respected thesis, and being expected to excel. It should have been called \\"Mlodinow's Rainbow\\" but I guess that wouldn't have sold as many copies, would it?Don't get me wrong. The book is entertaining enough, and short enough (171 pages of large type) to be quickly devoured in a single sitting. Just don't expect there to be anything of substance about the name in the title, which is obviously a marketing ploy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mlodinow's rainbow","review":"This book has nothing to do with Feynman, it is a book in which the author boast about what he did in his PhD thesis and tries to justify his choices of not doing science full-time (perhaps because not good enough.. don't get me wrong, there is nothing bad in it). I find pathetic the way the author uses Feynman's name to get attention and selling books. Not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time or the money","review":"This slight book is part autobiography and part parasitism on the Feynman legend. If you know nothing about Feynman, start by watching a couple of the BBC videos of him, so you get a sense of his voice, accent, mannerisms, and infectious interest in science. Then, with that imprinted, read \\"Surely You're Joking, . . .\\" and after that move on to his \\"Lectures on Physics.\\" You will then know enough to tackle his other available work. If you still have an appetite for the man behind the scientist, read Gleick's bio or the selection of his letters that his daughter edited. Mlodinow may have an interesting story to tell about his life, but not in this fashion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting, but not enough \\"book material\\"","review":"I would only read it if you want another view at Feynman's life. Keep in mind that half the book is autobiographical and not too interesting"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mlotinow's Rainbow","review":"Don't buy this book thinking it's about Feynman; it's really all about the author, a whiny sycophant who attached himself to Feynman at Caltech while the professor worked in his final years. Mlotinow offers precious little from Feynman, while going on interminably about his inability to find a purpose in his work, his pot-smoking buddies and an especially excruciating bit about a false-positive testicular cancer diagnosis. The few-and-far-between anecdotes and quotes from Feynman are nuggets, but there's really nothing here that can't be found in Surely You're Joking or What Do You Care What Other People Think.If you're looking for information about and from Richard Feynman, read the two titles listed above. If you want to find out about quantum theory or string theory, read The Whole Shebang by Timothy Ferris or The Elegant Universe by Brian Greene. Take a pass on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real life \\"Big Bang Theory\\"","review":"This is a worthy effort by a \\"former\\" physicist. Mlodinow is a postdoc at Caltech in the early 80s who is struggling with the age old question \\"what should I do with my life\\"?Sandwiched within his time at Caltech, Mlodinow is heavily influenced by Feynman who is slowly dying of cancer. Feynman's approach to physics (and life as a whole) is explored in a unique fashion in this highly readable memoir."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine writting style, subject deserves attention","review":"I was hoping for a book about Croatia that is written by somebody who does have Croatian heritage and knows how to write. It is well written and author did try to be objective and to put some interesting historical facts aboot Croatia. However, at times it is too personal and talks a lot about author's own family.

I do admit that I did hear potential for some major jams so I am willing to buy another one of his cd's and try it, since I believe there is a monster in there but not in this one. I like Chucho Valdes, Hilton Ruiz, Ruben Gonzalez, Papo Luca, Palmieri, etc. and I thought this would be more along those lines. Mr. Rubalcava should stick to his genre.

But, that little smudge aside, this book is, as has been said before, one of the best introductions to Ch'an buddhism you can buy. It outlines the major forms of zen practice, some you probably hadn't heard of (HuaTou, MoChao), as well as some autobiographical parts, explanations of core Buddhist belief, as well as a great chapter on compassion. In fact, the book gives an exercise in compassion you can practice each day to help you out with it.

Why? Isaac was an artist whose music needed to be heard (or, more accurately, EXPERIENCED) on a full-length basis to be appreciated. While most of these songs were (out of necessity) released as singles it goes without saying that the full-length LP versions of such immortal Hayes classics as \\"Walk On By\\", \\"I Stand Accused\\", \\"The Look Of Love\\", \\"Joy\\" and \\"Never Can Say Goodbye\\" were what sold their respective parent albums. If you really want a compilation of Isaac's hits then I recommend getting the now-deleted \\"Best of Isaac Hayes \\" Volumes 1 & 2 (both released in 1986) as these at least give you the original album versions without any (unnecessary) editing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Of The Big Man","review":"Isaac Hayes' Greatest Hit Singles is an excellent representation of his body of soulful love songs. He is the cuddly teddy bear not seen since his heydey in the 1970s and 1980s. There is no one today who even comes close to his strong, yet vulnerable yearning for love. The only thing I would suggest is that \\"The Theme From 'Shaft'\\" was the first track and \\"Theme From 'The Men'\\" was the 12th. In between would be the theme of Love, the yearning, gaining, and keeping of its eternal flame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun toy","review":"Works great, pretty fun and I dont have any complaints.

On the slow Blues numbers, King croons and sings in a very relaxed manner that reminds you of the best work of Lou Rawls and Jerry Butler. On the raucous uptempo numbers, he sings, shouts and testifies with the fire and intensity of a Gospel preacher. All of the songs on this ageless masterpiece are classic Blues-Soul numbers but both the hit title track and \\"Angel Of Mercy\\" are the real standouts. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you love blues","review":"If you love blues, you cannot give anything else than five stars.

It's tremendously sad this book is not in print; it should be the cornerstone for every class on comparative religion. The first few chapters are a bit technical/dull, but once you get to the fifth chapter or so you'll understand why I consider ita must-read.For those of you not raised in a religious setting, it will give you insight into how religions form and why they have had such a tight grip on the human mind since time immemorial. For those of you who are religious, this may upset you, but the truth will set you free, and this book may actually lift your spirits as it did mine.I truly believe this is one of the most important books ever written.

As a victim of verbal abuse, I can't believe she expects people to respond to abuse in such a way, and her idea that a few well-chosen words will stop an abuser is ludicrous. She also leaves out one important thing: even if this were to work, her methods don't include confronting your abuser or making him/her own up to being an abuser. Not exactly empowering! I found this book to be a complete waste of my money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent information for educators to practice and teach!","review":"I was looking for information to teach elementary school students on how to not get hooked into verbal abuse or verbal violence. This information fits nicely with Dr. William Glasser's Choice Theory and how to be more effective in building a positive language environment. I have enjoyed what I have learned thus far and I am excited to share my findings with teachers and students!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book!","review":"What a waste! I agree with the other reviewers. This book might be of some (limited) benefit in dealing with verbal jabs from people with whom you have limited contact or limited emotional investment. But, her assertion that these techniques will defuse all but the most egregious verbal abusers is so absurd that it makes me wonder if she's ever been in the same room with one. Don't waste your time or money. A MUCH BETTER option would be Patricia Evans' \\"The Verbally Abusive Relationship.\\" Evans addresses the problem, from why it happens to how to recognize it to what you can and can not do about it. Elgin tries to create a Pollyanna world where the abuser will respond logically and like a \\"sane\\" human being. If that were the case, you wouldn't be considering this book in the first place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely Useful Resource","review":"I found Elgin's techniques to be extremely helpful when I was struggling with remaining in an abusive situation. They helped me recognize, analyze, and divert the verbal abuse. Although it did not cure the abuser of the need to abuse, it did change the abuse to more open and easily recognized forms, that made the final solution more obvious. These techniques have been extremely useful in other instances of verbal abuse from healthy individuals, and have changed the mode of communication of those individuals towards me for the better. She gave me the power to control my language environment, and to remove myself from toxic language."},{"rating":"1","title":"blames the victim","review":"I think these ideas might work with people you have limited contact with.The scenario about the husband blowing up about the dinner was just terrible and I really couldn't see how this guy really loves his wife. He just expects her to be obedient like some dog.Elgin says if you just respond the right way you can stop the verbal abuse. This just isn't true. Most verbal abusers are just looking to find fault about anything.The problem lies with the abuser and not the victim. The abuser needs to learn how to stop treating people that way.Most victims of abuse spend years twisting and contorting themselves to try to fix what they are doing wrong so the abuse will stop.Notice the in the scenarios the abuse never stopped. Just until next time when the husband felt like blowing up about something again."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not about true abuse","review":"I was deeply disappointed in this book. I am desperate to find some effective strategies for dealing with a verbally and emotionally abusive parent. The author makes one good point: that what abusers want is to get attention and a \\"rise\\" out of you. But her strategies for avoiding this are *only* useful for very *mild* cases. I laughed out loud at some of the techniques she thinks would work. She clearly does not know my abuser. She herself does note this, by saying that some people have an underlying problem that has to be solved before the abuse will stop. But what to do in that case? Her only answer is that you may have to leave, and of course one can't \\"leave\\" a parent. She completely ignores that the verbal abuser is usually blackmailing you in a very effective way until you give in to them. Ultimately, the book is misnamed. This is not about verbal *abuse,* but simply about becoming more effective communicators with normal people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Helpful","review":"As the (soon to be ex) partner of a verbally abusive man, I can say with certainty that if you are in an intimate relationship with a confirmed verbal abuser, this approach will not only ensure that the abuse continues, but that you will feel responsible for it. The first section on \\"Miller's Law\\" is a blueprint for continuing the dynamic of verbal abuse, because it asks the partner to try to understand what she must have done to deserve the abuse. There is never an excuse for abuse, and it isn't the recipients fault, no matter what."},{"rating":"1","title":"Facile and simplistic","review":"The author's recommendation for responding to verbal abuse from a spouse or significant other amounts to \\"cleverly change the subject, and all will be well\\". That might work with small children, but it doesn't work with abusive spouses. The author's prescription reflects a breathtaking lack of appreciation for what the victims of verbal abuse are subjected to, day in and day out, often for many hours at a time and with no meaningful way to escape, and is quite reminiscent of 'just say no' as a cure for drug addiction. I think that a good deal of the problem comes from the lack of a clear distinction between abuse and occasional crankiness. The author's word games may offer a polite way of deflecting the latter, but as to the former they are a surefire prescription for continuing to be abused. I don't know what the solution is, but you won't find it in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not helpful...too wordy and the scenarios are a bit ridiculous","review":"I couldn't get through more than a couple chapters...the rest I scanned through and realized it wasn't for me. The scenarios she uses are silly. In short, this book is about the cause and effect of verbal communication. The wife is angry and verbally abusive, so the husband 'catches' that and passes it on to his coworkers...and so forth. She is trying to basically dissect how a person says something will affect people in different ways depending on HOW they say it. Isn't that obvious?

Now do you understand why Garth's huge sales don't mean squat. We are not sheep here. The Garth Brooks Corporation is gigantic.

I don't think anybody knows. Garth Brooks epitimises terrible music, there is no way that you can get any worse. No possible way. Not even pop like Britney Spears and N' Sync is worse than is worse than him. If there was one kind of music that I wish never existed, it would be country. I mean, WHAT EXACATLY IS SO GOOD ABOUT IT?!?!?!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have Album!","review":"Garth Brooks' NO FENCES is one of his all-time classic albums. It contains some of his best-loved songs including \\"Friends in Low Places\\", \\"The Thunder Rolls,\\" and \\"Unanswered Prayers.\\" This is truly a classic that paved the way for the country music explosion of the '90s.

To call this CD an abismal piece of drivel would be to disrespect things that truly are abismal pieces of drivel. Shucks this is even worse. \\"The Thunder Rolls\\" is as overblown as it is insulting to the listeners's intellegence.

Another two weeks pass before the harvest begins. Then, we'll be enjoying fresh, organic herbs, grown under our own supervision. So far, the Aerogarden is working exactly as advertised. The water tank had to be refilled after the first two weeks and new nutrients were needed at the same time. Separate warning lights indicated the need for those things to be done.

It was easy to set up and get started. The plants sprouted within just a few days, some even sprouted after 1 day!! We have had this product for 2 weeks now and are already enjoying fresh herbs from it.The only downside to this product (and the reason I didn't give it a full 5 stars) is the fact that the light is very bright. We live in an apartment so decided to move our garden into the office so we can close the door at night which allows us to sleep without the light bothering us. If you live in an open apartment you may want to consider the amount of light this puts off before you buy it.

I've had my herbs in for a few weeks and all is well, except the Cilantro never sprouted... oh, well... the others are doing well.

Now I'm sure it's too late to 'plant' a fresh one, so I'll do without this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so green thumb!","review":"Aerogarden doesn't live up to it claims. Plants on outside corners underperform. I contacted Aerogarden directly and they sent me a new pump, which means you have to disassemble the unit and take the plant pods out to install. New pump doesn't seem to make much difference.

I recently purchased two new 7 pod gardens (pro 100). Up to this time I was a satisfied customer albeit you have to either read up on what grows best or just practice a lot. Recently I received new universal grow pods that are supposed to fit in all the aerogarden models. Despite what customer service says they do not fit well in my 7 pod. Worse is that the new grow pods do not hold the grow medium near the top of the pod. The new universal pods promote mold and rot and discourage germination. Up to this point I would have highly recommended this product but not now or until they create a better grow pod."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pump stopped working after 1 Month, my plants are now going to die.","review":"The Aerogarden was going great until today when the pump stopped working. I did some searching on the net and found others have the same problem. The pump needs to be replaced, I wrote Amazon to see if they are going to replace or refund my money for the Aerogarden. I am not very happy, especially when many other have the same problem with defective units. Buyer beware, you may want to wait a year or two until they perfect this system. Who want to watch their plants die because of a bad pump, then after they die you have to put in a new pump and start all over again.I don't think they even tested many of these units before they sold them to the public. How could a problem like this happen to so many people if they did proper testing? And if they did test them out good, they must not care about selling a quality product.My final thought is it works well at first, but does not last long."},{"rating":"1","title":"POS","review":"I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. After a few months, I've harvested about 5 ripe chili pepper, the halapeno hasn't done anything, and I'm about to run out of nutrient.

Point being, some miraclegrow, a few bucks, sunny spot on the lanai, or just a trip to the grocery store. Waste of money. Update, ran out of nutrients, so am using Fox Farms Grow Big, I now have some chilis showing up in the Aerogarden, the outdoor plant is now 24\\" tall, has well over 30 peppers on it, the Aerocrap has one semi-mature pepper and is 7\\" tall, do the math, not worth it, and made in china, insult to injury.Aloha"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice gift.","review":"They never thanked me.

Now he can grow them year round. He was really pleased with this garden and it is growing exactly as they said it would. The only reason I didn't give it a five is because the light is so extremely bright that we moved it around several times before we found a suitable place for it.

The problem is that AG6 uses an aquarium-style pump (that makes bubbles) which is nosier than the original, AG7 pump which was a motor + impeller and virtually silent.Since the base was clearly labelled as an AeroGarden 6 this makes me believe that they just have a stock of AG6 bases that they want to get rid of...I tried to get the old base with pump but the customer service was not able to help me on that. They confirmed though their \\"upgrade\\":\\"We upgraded the Classic Gardens so all would have the same bubble technology operating system. If you received an AG6 base with seven holes for planting, you received the new AG7. We no longer have the older ones with the pump.

I have hydronic (infloor) heating, set at 64 degrees, which is very uniform and should not have caused my AeroGrows to fail. I checked the pH and TDS and found that they are way out of whack from what they should be for acceptable levels. I will be building my own hydroponic systems for far less money after this experiment. I am glad I got these on the trial basis which allows you to return them if not satisfied. These may work well in a warmer environment but in the long run, they will not outperform other systems that you can build cheaper and bigger.

This was not the case. It is a very detailed and exhaustively researched book on the Northern Pacific railroad, its construction and the cast of characters (Gen. Custer included) who were associated with it. It gives only very brief coverage of the Panic of 1873 (this is not a similar book as the \\"Panic of 1907\\", covering a similar event of another time). The Sioux get bit more coverage but only as they relate to the Railroad construction. A bit more detail about them in a general sense would have been useful. If you are looking for railroad history in the US, with some colorful charachters like Custer, this is your book. If you are looking for a book with an economic and markets bent, as it relates to the 1873 Panic and its aftermath or the history of the Sioux, you may be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dramatics.....Smokin'","review":"A great album!

This is one I had to have for my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Have","review":"This CD is sort of a starter kit for fans of the Dramatics that do not have larger compilations. What is important to note is that this CD contains the SECOND version of \\"Toast to the Fool\\", the one with LJ and Lenny. This version was never played on the radio when the song was actually out. It's an OK version, but doesnt come close to comparing with WeeGee Howard and Elbert Wilkin's version, which is the authentic \\"hit\\" version.

Look behind this poorly executed vanity film's tattered curtain and you will find a unfunny, untalented, and unattractive drag queen who calls herself The Plug Lady. Films like Girls Will Be Girls and Die Mommy Die are the Citizen Kanes of this genre. TPL could not qualify for Mystery Science Theatre.

This CD however is meant to capture his more thoughtful and sensitive side. However, it is languid and the tunes don't stand out. It is hard to tell if track 2 is really track 4 as the plodding bass and minimalist approach on piano make for sleepy moments - if driving later in the day. I have heard him with fire and brimstone and sometimes it goes over the edge of taste. But it is exciting. Not here. There is barely a hint of any Cuban influence in this music as well. Now some will like the gentleness I suppose, but with weak material and not much diversity, it sits pretty flat with me."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 stars for a thoughtful work","review":"This is Rubalcaba's most mature work. It's deeply introspective and lacks the bravura and pyrotechnics of earlier recordings. As a result, it's much more satisfying.Rubalcaba's selections for this CD are also distinct from other Cuban pianists: there is little that is inherently Cuban about them. In this sense, he is not an exponent of Cuban jazz, but of jazz without the usual national labels. In addition, his classical formation gives the music an interesting formality that pokes through here and there.A very pleasant, very thoughtful, and joyous collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Introspective and mature","review":"As the title of this album implies, this is introspective, thoughtful music, reflecting a high degree of musical maturity.

And the fact is, this album misses the mark by far.By any other band it might even be a 3- or 4-star affair, but not by the Pogues. Spider Stacy claimed that 'it's not timid... it's raucous when it has to be.' but this is hogwash. The songwriting is uninteresting, the conviction of the band (especially shane's vocals) is found wanting, and the album never really gels as a 'Pogues' release.Matt Johnson's subsequent TheThe releases following 'Infected' are similar, in that they're a total departure, and they might be saluted as an artistic (read: maturity) change, but they're less interesting as a result.If you find it used--cheap--you might want to pick it up, but otherwise forget about it. I'm sure the Pogues already have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Irishman from Minnesota","review":"This is the best, most consistent album by the Pogues. I believe it is also the last one with lead singer Shane MacGowan. Every single song is infectiously catchy. It is more laid back than their other albums, but I prefer their mellower stuff. It has more soul than the faster drinking songs. Make sure you check out MacGowan's solo stuff too."},{"rating":"2","title":"One more before he goes.....","review":"This album was quite a comeback for Shane and The Pogues after Peace and Love. That album had to follow If I Should Fall From Grace With God, an almost impossible task. On Hell's Ditch Shane's songwriting is back up to his normal level. From the upbeat opening of Sunnyside of the Street thru Lorca's Novena to House of the Gods you can feel that Shane had found his muse. And as Shane goes, so go the Pogues. This isn't as Irish flavored as their earlier stuff but still great party music. Shane has come out pretty much said that this album blows, I disagree with the man. I find it better than Peace and Love but not quite as goo as If I Should fall From Grace, Rum, Sodomy, and the Lash or Red Roses for Me. And it's far superior to the two Pogues albums without Shane."},{"rating":"2","title":"laid-back Pogues","review":"This is a fine CD. Some people don't consider it as good as Grace of God because it is much more laid-back than their usual fare.

They and many other survivors of the Third Reich (and of the Soviets, who were worse)have accurately reported on how many millions of Ukrainians were enslaved or murdered by both regimes. Anyway, I put this book down feeling as if this author has written much of this before. Just can't remember where. So I don't rate it as highly as some other books I have read about the Holocaust. In terms of personal memoirs I recommend Stefan Petelycky's Into Auschwitz, For Ukraine. It's the true story of a Holocaust survivor, Auschwitz #154922, and a Ukrainian patriot.

I am not at all advanced, but this tape still offered no challenge or burn for me.

On the plus side, the poses were explained well, by an instructor who seemed to know her stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"merely okay","review":"I would not call myself an advanced practitioner of yoga but I have been practising for a few years.I was really hoping that this tape would be a more rigorous workout than it was.Although the instructor was very clear and easy to follow, i really wished that there were more sequences and that the class would move a little bit faster.I would recommend this tape more for yoga novices and not for intermediate practitioners who are looking for a more challenging workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workout!","review":"I found this tape to be invigorating. The instructor has a pleasant, soothing voice, but she doesn't put you to sleep. You can get a really great workout and the final abdominal exercises are a great end to the video. You definitely feel like you get an all body workout. I would recommend this to anyone who is somewhat familiar with some yoga moves to get the full benefit from it. They do offer the advantage of having someone do the modified version of the exercises throughout the video for beginners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good for beginners like me","review":"This video was what I used for the first time I ever attempted yoga and, after being slightly discouraged at my lack of skill during the first few times, I have now advanced to a stage where I actually look forward to doing yoga, thanks to this cassette. It's a great toner, especially for arms (usually a difficult area to trim down for me) and abdomen. And I very definitely find myself working up a serious sweat. Sara Ivanhoe's (cool name, I must admit) extra-calm demeanor can be somewhat annoying at first but you get used to it and afterwards even learn to appreciate it. The cool-down period could have been a little more extended. After mastering this cassette, one can probably move on to a more advance workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reminds me alot of Joy of Yoga.....","review":"I bought this video because I love Crunch's Joy of Yoga. While I do enjoy this video, and there are some different moves in it, it still reminds me of the first video. I agree with another reviewer that it will be a slower day video. That's actually fine by me, as I enjoy flowing poses, but feel yoga should be more relaxing. I gave it 4 stars because it wasn't that unique. I will rotate between this and Joy of Yoga though, as it's great to wake up in the morning too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good only for a slow day","review":"I found this yoga workout to be great for stretching out the muscles and is a great option for a day I'm not really into working out.

It did work some muscles I didn't know I had, but I think that there are much better options in Karen Voight's collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are much better yoga workouts out there!","review":"Though not a bad workout for beginners, I expected much more from a routine touted as 'fat-burning.' The moves are very basic, and there's very little flow - the whole quiet peacefulness of yoga (which is it's real power) is lost in the too-quick movements. It seems as if what the instructor lacks in difficulty she tries to make up in speed.And let's talk about the instructor, shall we? She seems knowledgeable, but her weird vocal lilt and incessant giggling is just downright irritating. Her instructions are relatively good, but the moves are so basic that shouldn't be too difficult. I'd recommend the Buns of Steel Power Yoga if you're looking for a good yoga workout, or any from the Bryan Kest series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could be better","review":"Overall this is a quality Yoga video. The instructor is much less annoying and condescending in this video versus Crunch the Joy of Yoga (although I actually like that workout better.) This workout is not particularly difficult, so I am not sure I agree with the \\"fat-burning\\" aspect to the title. However, it does provide some good overall flexibility and strength work. She spends a lot of time on lunging poses so if you need flexibility in your harmstrings and quads this workout will feel good.

I've gone to the gym and taken yoga before and really liked it, but I wanted to find a challenging enough workout to do at home. This tape was it! It's great for the beginner to intermediate and the instructor is a nice-girl-next door personality. I found the workout to be challenging, and just when the thought \\"is this ever going to be over?\\" crosses your mind, it is just that-over! I think it's a great workout in the 45 mins it takes. I hope they come out with another tape soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tough stuff!","review":"I'm no yoga beginner, I've been doing it for a few years, and Crunch's first yoga tape (The Joy of Yoga) is still one of my favorites, I love the style and the instructor (who also does this video too). This tape is only recommended for those who are advanced in their yoga practice or just naturally very flexible. I did make it through the whole tape, but I was miserable for the next two days, my back and hips were killing me. This is probably a good tape for the advanced, but if you're a beginner, leave this one alone, there are better ones to start with that will help you to stick with yoga."},{"rating":"2","title":"Challenging yet fun","review":"I found this yoga tape to be very instructive and the breathing reminders helpful. As a yoga beginner the little \\"tips\\" on how to maximize each pose were great. Much of this information will be helpful to keep in mind while completing other yoga videotapes.

This is my second Crunch yoga video and both of them are terrible, but this one is particularly bad. I am not one of those \\"deep\\" yogis--I do it for exercise, mainly, and not really for the breathing and meditation aspects--but this is the most un-yoga-like video imaginable. It treats yoga like an aerobics class. That aside, the workout itself is very lame and has no flow to it, the sequence of poses is awkward, and by the time a vinyasa has finally been pieced together, the tape has ended. The only fat this tape could possibly burn is from your wallet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not buy it again","review":"There is not a moment in the tape when the instructor is not yapping. She describes the simplest moves in the most minute detail and it just isn't necessary. Once you see the tape a single time, 90% of her instruciton is not only unnecessary but down right annoying - impossible to enjoy the contemplative flow of the yoga practice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"This video was a waste of money. The title, Fat Burning Yoga,was misleading. I thought that i would get my heart rate up, but no that didn't happen.

I do not think so!","review":"I think there are two major problems with this tape. First, in no way it is suitable for beginners. Instructor cues for breathing are inconsistent, about 50% of the time there is no cueing at all. Her cues for poses are very poor, she mostly mentions if the pose is hard to do or not. You cannot follow her without looking at your TV screen, and if you do not know which muscles to flex or stretch, 50% of the time she is not going to tell you. The program does contain two levels, for more and less flexible. Yet, transition from one pose to another is so quick that you can barely get your balance. Try Jane Fonda Yoga instead, or (and) Kundahlini yoga."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like it at all.","review":"This tape was very easy and certainly did not burn any fat.

Do not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch!","review":"I thought this would be doable since it is for burning fat.

I had never taken a yoga class before and was surprised by how easy the tape was for me to do. This tape might be good for someone that's not in good shape what-so-ever but if you're in any kind of shape at all, this tape is not for you. It was kind of disappointing even for a beginner yoga enthusiast like myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"for beginners!","review":"i've been doing power yoga for about 5 months now and i thought this video who do as it says..fat burn! however, the yoga routine seemed very slow paced and a little bit lame. i recommend this video to those who are just starting yoga, but otherwise try the bryan kest videos!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Get Grounded","review":"I just received this video yesterday and I was eager to try it out this morning. The moves provided me with the focus I needed and I came away feeling refreshed. The instructor made sure that proper breathing was the first priority which is so important in making any yoga movement more fluid. The downward facing dog pose was featured throughout which had me feeling slightly uncomfortable in the neck area. However, I believe that is due to tensing the muscles instead of relaxing and breathing. Yoga takes daily practice and with this tape, I believe I will become more grounded. I highly recommend Fat Burning Yoga !"},{"rating":"2","title":"read in one night! a real page turner","review":"Here's the thing - you know who died, and you know where the body was found and in what condition, but you don't know the why and how. And you still can't put this book down!Alex Kotlowitz is a master story teller of a real life murder in a racially charged small town, geographically divided by a river but racially divided by mistrust and suspicion. His research is detailed and thorough, and the reader finds himself quickly immersed and emotionally invovled with the characters. Every character is complex and likeable. There are no bad guys/good guys. Just an unsolved murder, in a town yearning to heal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, a lot of information.","review":"Kotlowitz shines in this novel. He really lets one know of the racial travesties that can occur in our society. He lets the public know that there are still racial tensions in this country."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Passion For This Topic","review":"After 'There Are No Children Here', I was eager to ready anything and everything that Kotlowitz was writting. This book was a major disappointment. Clearly the author lacked the passion for this story that he had in his previous book. I'm not sure that this topic holds up as an accurate microcosm for race relations in middle America as it attempts to do so it's difficult to see why this would be an important text to anyone who didn't live in southwest Michigan. Nonetheless, it is well written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drama Not Documentary","review":"Tabloid account of a black teenager drowning and the author dramatizing it into a racial issue because law enforcement and first reponders who \\"could have saved him\\" were white. Benton Harbor and St. Joseph, Michigan certainly have had their fair share of crime but deserve more credit than an outsider's blundering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disjointed, unstable focus","review":"Kotlowitz's first book was stunning and I think he should have stuck with that type of writing. This book is a disappointing second. The entire story is rambling and often has no discernible point. I'm sure this is much more meaningful for residents of the town. The racial thing has been slanted so many ways in the media by now, I still think that 'The Eye of the Storm' from 1968 takes the cake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh","review":"Was assigned for a Social Studies class. Prof was highly enthused, no one else in the class was. Fortunately I was able to still get my A without finishing this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I expected...","review":"Alex's last book There Are No Children Here is hard to top, but I tried to give The Other Side of the River a chance. What was the point of the book? To show the different levels of racial tensions within this particular community or to find out who killed the teenager? I am still trying to understand the purpose of the book. I felt like I didn't learn anything new."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Is NOT The WHOLE Story","review":"Alex Kotolwitz it an out spoken liberal, that doesn't know what the heck he is talking out of his butt about. My father was in this book in the part where he a Steve Marshke were in the Silver Dollar having a burger after a hard honest day at the office. And I know for a fact that many facts are false accusations contradicting what really happened that night in St. Joseph. And may I remind you that this youth did commit a crime he broke in to a teacher of mine son's car. I think Kotolwitz should come back to Twin Citys and get BOTH sides of the story and not just words from the St. Joseph residents that were not in volved in the case."},{"rating":"2","title":"okay but flawed","review":"well-written and easy to read, but degenerates into just a series of anecdotes. Why? The author has no moral compass and not only admits it, but celebrates it as a liberal virtue. \\"Truth depends on what race you are\\" he expressly says. This is not only an infinitely sad statement, but also explains why this book has no center and is all frosting and no cake. Enjoy it skeptically."},{"rating":"2","title":"predictable but a good read","review":"I have loved every book from Catherine Anderson. This book was no different.

I didn't like this book because it wasn't very inventful and not a very fun book to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish this book was dead instead","review":"Mick Harte Was Here was kind of boring, but it had a few exciting parts in it. For example, when Phoebe and Mick wrote the word FART in the driveway, that was pretty funny. However, some people might find it kind of sad because Mick Harte was one of the main characters in the story, and he dies a horrible death. He dies because he was supposed to go to one of his friend's house, and he had a terrible accident.Mick asks Phoebe to ride his bike home for him, but she said, \\"No.\\" Then Mick asked Phoebe's friend Zoe if she would do the favor, but she said, \\"No.\\" Thus, Mick had no choice but to ride his bike to his friend's house. When Mick started riding his bike, he went head on into a truck which gave him really bad head damage.I myself wouldn't recommend this book to anyone because this book isn't too exiting.

This book made me laugh and cry and put alot of thought into my own family and what is important. Every parent and child should read this book, and talk about it.

She writes of starting to write because she did not want to be a grandmother who said \\"I wanted to write a novel\\", the England she remembers after World War 1 and surviving World War ll. She recalls old friends, literary influences, historic events, infamous crimes of the British Isles. Also touched upon is the struggle of living with a husband with chrinic mental illness and the acceptance of being the support of her family. All this is conveyed in some of the most flowing and beautiful language I have ever read. The everyday is lifted up by the command of the English language and the observant eye of someone embracing life. A wonderful book, a joy to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"P.D. James in Her 77th Year","review":"In addition to being one of the best contemporary mystery writers, P.D. James has an extraordinary command of the English language. Her book, a combination diary of her 77th year and a reflective looking back, is a must read for her fans. Some parts relating to her personal life, such as having a baby while bombs were being dropped during World War II and her relationship with her cat Polly-Hodge, make for interesting reading. Other parts about the more technical aspects of book writing and publishing, with the exception of her comments about adapting her books into TV movies, tend to be dry and would hold more appeal to writers and those in the publishing business."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommend Seller","review":"Highly recommend seller.

I, too, am an author and met the author of Sleep Talk through our work. I tried the techniques on my eight-year-old son because I was having trouble getting him ready for school in the mornings. He was always grumpy and would wait until the last minute to put his shoes on and get his backpack ready. I hated fighting in the morning and was desperate to have the harmony we used to enjoy before he started school.Even though I believed in the book, I was shocked by the results. The first night I told my son (after he feel asleep) how proud his father and I were at his ability to wake up with a smile and get ready for school with a great attitude. Sure enough, the next morning he woke up smiling, got dressed right away and had his shoes and backpack on... an hour before we even had to leave! It was unbelievable.

With an armload of practical tips, Van Amringe challenges you to look beyond the \\"tried and true\\" interior designs tips.

Since I'm a copywriter myself, I didn't expect him to write a chapter (the first one) about getting corporate clients for copywriting and technical writing assignments as a financial base to your business, which makes sense. Yet many writers or wannabes won't want to do this because it takes the romance out of being a writer. He gives a lot of sound, money making ideas for becoming a money-making freelance writer which are excellent if you want to know the reality of what it takes to be able to be successful as a work-at-home writer. Definitely recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"There are much better books out there...","review":"I bought this book based on the great reviews posted but was disappointed with just about the entire book. Meanwell does have a point or two that one can use but overall this was a waste of money. There was not a lot of \\"how to\\" in the book and most of what he did provide was useless. For example, he gave these tips for smarter layouts:1. add white space between headings, photos, and body copy.2. use subheads, pull quotes, and raised caps as attention grabbers.3. place select stories in colored boxes.4. design in consideration of two matching pages.5. make template layouts for future issues.It seems this should be common sense for those about to launch their own business in copywriting. I would suggest reading SECRETS OF A FREELANCE WRITER by Robert Bly (excellent), START AND RUN A COPYWRITING BUSINESS by Steve Slaunwhite (also very good), and THE WELL FED WRITER by Peter Bowerman (also good).

You know what? My mom was AFRAID of bratz when she first saw them. She only lets us have the little ones. And of course we all know that Diva starz and Barbie are made by the same company. Once I read a whole review about some kid blabbing over and over about how My scene copied Diva starz. They said one my scene had a diva starz's hair, style, eyes, skin...and so on for each girl. I am saying to all those positive girls...THANKS A WHOLE LOT!!!!:)I really apreaciate that you are doing this. I'm also thanking the people who didn't fight about who's better: my scene or bratz. I'm just sharing my opinion and I don't mean to hurt anyone feelings I usually don't get on someone's nerve like this...just LISTEN TO YOU!

You are just whining about saying you love My Scene dolls and hate Bratz. Well, you are the one with a problem. You like My Scene dolls. That is a huge problem for people. My Scene suck and you know. Just give up. Bratz are totally better. And guess what, we don't care if you don't want us Bratz fans to write if we hate this doll and like Bratz better. We can if we want to.

Bratz are good, but Barbie will always be better than Bratz, or My Scene............. Barbie IS number one . . . . . She is always going to be the best.

I really don't understand why Mattel would make a Barbie looking like a Bratz doll. I am a Barbie Collector. I have been for a decade. I am glad I have some to give to my daughter. I love the size of her head in the '90s. I won't buy a My Scene Barbie or any funky-sized head Barbie at this point. I can't see how sales could be better. Marketing experts should have kept the head the same size. I'm sure it costs money to make a different mold. Maybe it's better to take the losses and go back to what works.

Bratz is way beyond all of the other dolls because they know how to strut there stuff and they aint afraid to show there fashion.

You actually think that this this.... thing is p-p-pretty. Puting pretty and this toy together makes disaster. Because this is the ugliest thing I have ever seen. I don't even think this thing is human, I don't think any My Scene dolls are humans. They are all so ugly, they could make the perfect halloween decoration. It could be for old people that hate kids around their lawn. They could put them out on their lawn, and it would scare the kids to death. And I agree with that girl.

This book didn't give any advice for the common expecting mother. She goes on about how she couldn't sleep so she had a special chair made for her, her clothes didn't fit so she had them specially made for her. She brags about all the gifts she got for the babies, all the help she had once they were born, and how she lost all her weight weeks after delivery. This isn't a book for reality minded mothers-to-be. The only good part were the co-author's little comments (her doctor) they were the only factual, informative part of the book, unfortunately, her doctor didn't write enough to make it worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"Sorry Jane! I know she probably meant well, but let's face it, the majority of us do not have access to her style of living. If you're curious about how the more wealthy people live, go for it. If you're looking for more practical information, you can save money by buying \\"Multiple Blessings\\", packed with much more realistic advice and so much more helpful. I have to admit, I did get a good laugh (sarcastically speaking) out of the \\"can you believe in all our planning we forgot to put a bathtub in the babies bathroom. We immediately hired a contractor to put one in\\".

Do not buy this book unless you want to be depressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless (except as a psychological document)","review":"This woman lives in cloud cuckoo land. Her advice has absolutely no bearing on most people's everyday reality, and she comes across as a rich, spoilt, pampered woman who has no idea how ordinary people live. This book offers much insight into its author, but very little practical advice for real people. By all means purchase the book if you're sufficiently wealthy and morbidly self-obseesed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected...","review":"When we found out that we were expecting twins, a friend with twins recommended this book to us. We found that the book was not very realistic for the every day person. Although the author's story was intersting to read about, we didn't find it at all helpful in preparing for our twins. For a more realistic look at life with twins, I would highly recommend 'Ready or not, here we come' by Elizabeth Lyons."},{"rating":"1","title":"I had to give it one star because there was no option for zero...","review":"Okay this is my first Amazon review ever. You know how you read the reviews, and even if they're bad, you get the book anyhow? Try to give it a chance or whatever? Okay trust me on this one. DON'T DO IT. Right now, the book has a two-star average on Amazon--and I think that's generous at best. Not only does this woman have the special chaise lounge (as mentioned by another reviewer) that's carted EVERYWHERE for her, she also has breakfast (some fancy egg white omelet and extra crunchy hash browns) made for her every morning, maternity clothes crafted expressly to fit her body--and when she decides that the shower adjacent to her new nursery isn't gonna cut it, she has a bathtub put in instead. Huh? Oh and she suggests 24-hour baby nurse care and someone to come do your laundry twice a week. Beg your pardon? Can she suggest the lotto numbers, too? The limited medical advice can be found elsewhere, in other books with actual substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Living in Fairyland","review":"What a waste! This was more a fictional novel than a book that offered practical advise.

Good price and well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"Jhutha Sach was a pretty ordinary family comedy movie. It was quite watchable and nice but at the end of it there was a feeling it could have been given a skip. I watched it mainly to see Rekha and to an extent Dharmendra. Dharmendra plays a dual role in this film, one of a married man and the other of a selfish and greedy criminal. When Rekha's husband passes away, she hires his lookalike for a certain period of time until she will be able to tell her children the truth. Well, the story is quite inconsequential and not very interesting. The film was well done though - it was light and simple, not overly melodramatic but it still lacked charm and the execution felt weak. Rekha does a good job in a restrained act of a young widow and Dharmendra plays his two roles without being very impressive. You can watch Jhutha Sach"},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone show acknowledge the possibilities","review":"I loved this book. It is very powerful and engaging.

But, as Malidoma points out, he did not (and cannot) give you the full \\"4-1-1\\" on the cultural practices. . . those who are not on the path simply are not allowed to know.

Malidoma's account of his own life and his experiences growing up in a Jesuit missionary make him vulnerable and transparent to the reader, I feel he shared with me his deepest secrets while educating me about colonialism. When he returns to his village without his si (double) he has to go through an initiation process to gain himself back and be integrated and accepted back into his tribe. His elders remind him he learns by remembering. If you are interested in the super natural, shamanism, and African wisdom this book will satiate you to no end.

It gives you a great workout and adds different dimensions so that your body gets good toning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Unchallenging.","review":"This was my first Gunnar Peterson DVD purchase, and I was very disappointed. The first thing I noticed was how terrible Gunnar's cueing was...he gave little to no instruction at all (especially on form and technique), so if you are completely new to working on the ball you may feel very intimidated and lost at times. The second annoyance was the fact that the exercises were not timed to the workout music. None of Gunnar's workout participants were doing the exercises at the same time because there were no solid verbal cues and no music count to work to. Lastly, the exercises were beginner level at best. I have been working my core for several years now, and I literally only fatigued on one set of exercises out of the entire 20 plus minutes. I had to change all of the exercises while performing this DVD just to make it worth my while. I wouldn't encourage anyone to purchase this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"It worked for my 7 year old!","review":"I stumbled across this book while looking for ideas to help an older child to stop thumbsucking. We never pressured our daughter to stop, but had encouraged her for years. She had declared she was going to suck her thumb until she was 15. We read this book one night, and before we even finished, she had created an incentive chart that she hung on the wall by her bed. She put a sock on her hand that night. That was one month ago and she has declared herself \\"done with my thumb--it's fat now and doesn't feel right.\\" The ideas are simple and fairly obvious, but the story and ideas are well-packaged and presented to the child. My daughter could relate to David, who loves his thumb, but deep down knows he should stop. I couldn't believe how fast and easy this book helped her to get motivated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I did not like the suggestions from this book one bit. The book basically suggests that you appeal to your child's desire to fit in and convince them that sucking his or her thumb will make them appear silly or \\"like a baby\\" to their friends. I don't like this approach because I'd be telling my four-year-old son that he should pattern his behavior after his friends' which is something I will want to discourage when he grows older. He also wasn't thrilled with the book, its story or its pictures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this book and get Mavala Stop.","review":"I read the first part of this book to my daughter and although it is well written, it uses guilt to motivate the child to stop which I didn't think would be best.

The music paired with the waves is by-and-large conducive to relaxation. There is a brief segment in the second of the two tracks that is a bit more intensely new age sounding, or eerily computerish, and that short segment created a very minor bit of tension. Not enough tension to ruin the whole cd, however. There are momentary inclusions of almost muffled sea bird calls in a few spots, which I found more distracting than relaxing. Fortunately these two negatives are brief - and did not ruin the usefulness of the cd. Overall it is very useful for relaxing, and reducing tension. Playing it while working, or when trying to unwind is very useful. While I did try using it for sleep for a week, it did not aid me in reaching deeper sleep during the night. However, it did not disturb my sleep; did not cause me to wake up (unlike other cds). Overall 4 out of 5 for its calming influence.

It was explained to us that it's due to the shape, lack of stem, special crystal, etc., but we just say it's magic!!!There is a different glass for each type of wine - red, white, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the...","review":"NEWS FLASH: These are nothing more than an excuse for Riedel to sell you 2 CURVED GLASS TUMBLERS for $18. A trip to any home store will yield similarly-shaped glasses for a couple of dollars. Sure, undiscriminating wine drinkers used to (some still do) drink their cheap wine out of plain old glasses, but does that mean you should? Remember that one of the reasons a wineglass has a stem is to prevent your hand from touching the bowl and heating the wine well above room temperature. If Riedel is truly a \\"connoisseur company\\" they are undoubtedly aware of this but for some reason (ka-ching!) it doesn't bother them. Heck, if I were making $17.75 in profit from 25 cents worth of glass I suppose it wouldn't bother me much either...Drink up, suckers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely glassware","review":"Reidel is worth the money if you are wine snob like me. However, I don't recommend it for daily use, as it is extremely delicate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complimentary glasses with any decor","review":"Bought these as I like the Riedel name. This glassware will match any decor. I like the fact that they are sturdy yet look delicate. I would highly recommend hand washing these as they can still be fragile. The \\"stem\\" is hollow so the beverage fills to the bottom of the glass, thus making it sturdy sitting on the tabletop. The glass fits nicely in the hand and the spiral style on the bottom portion makes it easy to grip without slipping. Although they may be a little more pricey, I was able to take advantage of a special buy 3 get 1 free, plus free shipping, through Amazon.com, so it averaged out to a comparable price to other fine glassware found at local stores. I highly recommend this glassware, but like I stated earlier, would hand wash only. Oh yes, they come packaged in a nice box, so I keep them in the box when not in use, and that makes it easy to store, and I know they are protected. Just saying...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but not dishwasher safe","review":"I love these glasses. I've been using them since Riedel started making the \\"O\\" series. But I want to correct the information provide by Amazon. These glasses are not dishwasher safe. I always hand wash them but a guest snuck them into the dishwasher when I wasn't looking and I forgot to do the \\"guest precheck\\" on my dishwasher before running. We lost three of the pinot noir glasses to the dishwasher. So I would say great glasses if you are willing to hand wash."},{"rating":"2","title":"when you are too lazy to wash your good glasses by hand","review":"As other reviewers have commented, you do touch the bowl of these glasses with your hands which does warm the wine.

I don't know if I have been exceptionally lucky, but last night, for the third time, I dropped one of these tumblers and rather than breaking, the glass rolled (no joke) and remained 100% intact.

I enjoy these for informal dinners and after dinner sipping. It is nice to not have the 'tippiness' factor of a stemmed glass involved when relaxing. I also have a 'special' place for these in my dishwasher. and so far, no accidents. Just be sure that they are on the top rack and not touching anything else. I may be a little too critical, however, because after only about 200 washings they loose a little of their luster. Imagine that!?! One of the nicest things about these glasses is the delicate thinness of the lip. It just makes sipping wine (or anything) more elegant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riedel O Cabernet Wine Tumblers","review":"We enjoy using these glasses every day for Cabernet/Merlot wines.

Exactly the same as the Vinum line, minus the stems. The bowl is identical so you still get the breathing and flavor distinction you've come to expect from Riedel. They're just a bit more casual - perfect for a picnic or going out on your porch or patio to enjoy wine with friends or sitting around a fireplace. No worries about the stem breaking or finding a perfectly level place to set them down as they're like weebles - they'll wobble, but don't fall down. At about half the cost - if you like Riedel Vinum, you'll quickly be building your collection of the O line. One note, if you're a fanatic about the wine temperature, you may want to stick with the reds as you ARE holding the bowl while drinking, but I've not yet had that issue. What a great concept!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Full Of Dreams And Nightmares From God's Gift To Readers.\\"","review":"Jonathan Carroll is the most consistent writer working today. With each novel he writes, he breaks new ground and always manages to create something compelling and gorgeous.

It is well-written, not ponderous or academic like many histories.

I can think of several friends to whom I would recommend this book. Truly satisfying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review: \\"Poem\\" - Nettwerk","review":"Overall, I believe that this disc will meet mixed reviews. About 50% of the alternative crowd will either love it or be unsure, maybe even disappointed simply because some tracks, due to the vocals, may seem a bit too pop. However, this album is anything but pop!! Those who are looking for the ethereal beauty of Delerium will simply love this album.

That being \\"Terra Firma.\\" I had never heard of Delerium until a friend of mine bought the soundtrack for \\"Tomb Raider.\\" When I heard Terra Firma\\" I knew that I had to find what mastermind made this song. When I found the album, I was like okay, I'll give this a go. However to my dismay, it was not the album that I thought it was going to be. It appears that that music Bill Leeb once created died about 10 years ago. Now don't get me wrong, the singers in this album are magnificent, but I want something more of once was, when people made music for the music and not for money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and dull","review":"Forget it. They've gone completely commercial and every song is construtected to be a \\"hit\\". All the haunting electronics that made their earlier albums so beautiful and interesting to listen to are gone. The \\"lovely\\" voices overwhelm the music on this album, and the instrumentation is conservative and cliched.In their effort to sell more cd's in the pop market they lost the creative edge that got them there and have created a truly boring cd. Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Delerium has gone pop, rather disappointing.","review":"Despite the grandeur of \\"Underwater\\" on the first CD of this set and the excellence of the 2nd CD, I was overall disappointed with this release. It was prevalent that Delerium was heading this direction ever since \\"Semantic Spaces\\" but I wouldn't have expected it to happen this early. Kristy Thirsk was already pushing Delerium's style off the edge, however, it was a good combination. This CD is the landmark of Delerium's fall into commerciality. If you're into the popular type of stuff, then you might like this CD, but for someone that still prefers something such as \\"Karma\\", this just isn't for you.I hope Bill Leeb is getting enough cash off this, maybe he can do better with his already excellent projects such as Front Line Assembly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre At Best","review":"I bought \\"Karma\\" a few years ago. It was the first thing I had ever heard by Delerium and I was blown away. So, when I saw that \\"Poem\\" had been released, I eagerly snatched it up. What I got was a big disappointment once the disc started to play. The whole CD reminded me too much of a group who had a hit and now wanted to reproduce the same success by not evolving in any way. Did they really need another remix of \\"Silence\\" featuring Sarah McLachlan?"},{"rating":"1","title":"TO MUCH SINGING,NOT MY FAVORITE CD","review":"Been waiting for four years for the next Delerium album,but when peom came out for the 4th release,hasn't what I had expected from Bill leeb.This album is focus on singing with special artist,I was hoping for alots of instrumental beat music with gregorian chant and other culture sound.There a few song with gregorian chant which you might like,is call TERRA FIRMA & AMONGST THE RUINS.I don't know why Bill Leeb would do this,Mr.Leeb did great on the last two album Semantic Spaces & Karma.Poem doesn't do it for me,there's about 8 tracks with artist that sing and sing.Delerium Peom fail BIG TIME so I am dissappionted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I'm speechless... A masterpiece! I would never have expected such lyrically and musically powerful album from Delerium. If you are going to buy only one Delerium album, let it be Poem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunningly Beautiful","review":"Fans of Karma and Semantic Spaces will definitely be pleased with Poem. The lyrics are written and hautingly performed by various female artists. One of the few Delerium songs with male vocals also appears here. (Download Koran if you don't have it) The only minor downside is too many artists' writing styles are here. Only the music lend cohesion.The deluxe edition includes an four track extra disc with remixes of new and old. Silence and Flowers Become Screens have been masterfully remixed. The best versions outside the originals.Poem is aptly titled. Beautiful art for the ears."},{"rating":"1","title":"deterium","review":"I was anxious for this album as soon as I got Karma, however it wasn't worth the wait. It lacks focus and inspiration. It is lighter than the other Delerium albums but the greater use of the constant thumping dance beat reduces this album to something less enjoyable than even the remixes of Karma. Melodies are not as memorable, voices are less clear. Essentially it's Karma really watered down, tossed out to appeize the masses. I'll play Karma and Semantic Spaces for years but after the 3 week run in my car juke I doubt I'll actually pull this one out for any reason. I'd advise you hear this one first before you buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Kristy Thirsk!!!","review":"Overall, the CD is \\"OK\\". Nothing special and compared to the prior releases it was shelved pretty quickly.Thirsk was to be on four tracks on this CD. She isn't anywhere to be found. Before I buy a Delirium CD in the future I'll make sure she's there.Don't expect classic tracks off of this one. I was pretty disappointed...."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS ALBUM IS NOTHING LIKE \\"KARMA\\"","review":"It is obvious that the band has split. KARMA WAS ONE OF THEIR BESTS AND THIS ALBUM IS NOTHING LIKE IT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yet another awesome collection from Bill and Leeb","review":"While not surpassing or even matching it's predecessor \\"Karma\\", 2000's \\"Poem\\" is a really good follow-up to that masterpiece. I remember getting excited over the release of this album when it came out. I think what made it not dissapointing was that I was not expecting another \\"Karma\\" and that helps. \\"Poem\\" is a very good sounding album throughout though it took time to digest. \\"Aria\\" is my favorite song on this CD. It starts with a haunting intro and a dark minor note beginning giving the sense of a foggy morning and watching it get brighter outside. An exotic rhythm comes in and the song becomes a sunny day mood song like as if the fog cleared out. \\"Aira\\" is by far my favorite track on this CD but that doesn't mean the others aren't great either. \\"Temptation\\" is another great track I enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice","review":"Delirium are great and this album is very good. I loved karma and I agree with the reviewer that said that Karma was an exploration of Shadow energies and that Poem seems to be more Heaven like. That sums it up in a nutshell. Poem is a very heavenly set of track sang by heavenly voices. The singing on this CD is incredible and during some tracks i had goosebumps. While you listening to it i felt expanded and uplifted. It is a CD that speaks to the Heart Chakra. I really enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Album is a mixed bag, but the good tracks are well worth it.","review":"The first, secoond, and ninth tracks are prime stuff. Track 9, a poem for Byzantium, or whatever it was called, is quite possibly delirium's best track. It is simply excellent. It has a rather longish intro but it is worth the buildup. While I lack the knowledge (or was it pretension) to use correct terminology, I think that the 'song' is exceedingly well ballanced. It has enough continuity and variety to keep the listener interested. It fills in in all the right places and with a decent sound system can 'produce goose bumps' . It is also ,with the exception of 2 places, remarkably free of all those gimmicky sounds that are so overused in electronica, or whatever term best describes their music.There are another 3 tracks that are mediocre, and several duds. On the whole, the album is worth it even if one only wishes to strip off the good tracks for a private mix album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disapointing","review":"As hard as this is for me to say, this is a terrible Delerium CD. A previous reviewer said the singing was the cause and I agree. I find most of the singing quite boring and often covers up some good music. The CD's only redeeming factor is the track Innocente which is fantastic. I hear this one will be released as a single so my advice is to skip Poem and buy just the single. I own many other Delerium CD's and this one just doesn't compare. Too bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good workout","review":"I really enjoy this tape.

When i got this DVD i was bitterly dissapointed. There are movements in this viedo that should not be atempted by anyone with weights.

It was choppy and the putting of the weights up and down was just too much.

I was disappointed because it is mostly a low-impact weights workout and by the end of half an hour, I had barely broken a sweat. Afterwards, I popped in my \\"The Method: Boot Camp\\" tape to feel like I had really done something.

I look great!!!!! I have lost all the weight and I feel all muscle, and is it ever a great feeling. I actually have a six pack now and no other video has been able to produce such amazing results, because believe me I've tried others combined with a healthy eating plan and this one really works! I recommend this video/DVD to anyone who really wants to feel that muscle tone. This video combines cardio with toning in perfect harmony.

If not, you know what to do now thanks to me. A good video that has simple moves and works out all of your body is Victoria Johnson's H.A.B.I.T.

But this one just didnt live up to what I had come to expect from them.Its a very short tape and I knew that buying it, but compared to \\"Bootcamp\\" this just doesnt pack the same punch. The cardio segments arent energizing enough and the weight segments are pretty light as well.If your looking for a short workout that has a cardio/sculpt mix and that will make you sweat get \\"Bootcamp\\" its a great video. Ive had it for almost a year and still reach for it about once a week as filler for more workouts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what you might expect","review":"I was very disappointed with this being my 6th Crunch video.

The music is fun, the instructor is upbeat without being cheesy, and the moves are fairly easy to learn. Be warned, though, this tape may not be challenging enough for advanced exercisers who are used to longer routines (i.e., 45 minutes, etc.).

I am in my 40's and taking a college yoga class. I had to ask her the name of the cd, so I could enjoy it at home. My professor plays the second instrumental cd for the winding down portion of the class, where we lie in semi-dark and breathe, letting go of our surroundings. It is SO BEAUTIFUL ! What an experience. The rhythm is so perfect at facilitating such a slow deep prana breath.The progression from one \\"song\\" to the next is seamless. The Eastern influence, with occassional background chants supports my transcending experience.

You'll still have the most valuable trading book I've seen written to date. I see ten other reviews here, and only a couple mention OI's significance - mostly in passing. Very sad. Open interest's relationship with price action on a few levels deserves at least a few years of study, although it won't take you nearly that long for you to at least appreciate its importance the way it's presented in this book. This was the first market book I paid for as a market newbie in May '88. I still have fond memories of this basic OI move for OJ may 88, COP aug 88, PA oct 88, CT fall 88, COF dec 88, HO and HU summer 89. Try telling me again how worthless this book is...quit criticizing and study harder. The answers exist and much of it is humanly achievable.

Maybe I was expecting too much. Larry provides a great introduction to key ideas like premiums, open interest, and oscillators but sadly leaves the reader dangling. Much of the reading is more philosophical than scientific. For $50 dollars I expect details, not generalization. For example, Larry mentions that a change in open interest of 25% or more greatly excites him. A change over what time period? A day, week, what? To be fair, I'm very sure Mr. Williams is an excellent commodity speculator and very intelligent person. I just wish he would explain his ideas with a little more detail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me a Break!!","review":"Larry Williams is not a trader, he is a promoter.

Love this album. So many standards. What blew me away was realizing that one of my favourite Hip Hop samples came from 'Opus De Soul,' Public Enemy used it for their 'Give It Up' track back in 94. I'm bias anyway, anything that has the Staxx house band or Cropper's licks gets my vote. Pop's and King to boot? Better get'chaself daawn the crossroads bawwy!

Not only do you get the originally released VHS material on each dvd, but there are numerous bonus features added to these dvd versions which will captivate you children for hours! Any parent knows at times this can be a life-saver! The dvds are also great because there is no constant rewinding of VHS tapes; plus your child can access their favorite parts of the dvd without your help with the dvd remote. The Thomas series really teaches children some great lessons. As an adult who often watches with my kids, I still crack up at the sight of Ringo Starr or George Carlin! A must for any child's dvd collection, so add to cart ASAP!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Content ok, annoying ads can't be skipped","review":"My son loves Thomas. He can operate the DVD player just fine. However, on these Thomas DVDs, there are 2-3 minutes of advertizing (Spam) for other DVDs before you can get to see the content. They can't be skipped although some players let you fast forward through them. This totally sucks. It's hard to explain to a small child that he'll have to wait. Although cheap for 3 dvds (~$25 at the time of writing), since this set only contains about 30 minutes of \\"actual content\\" on each disc, I find that I have paid in full and shouldn't be forced to sit through the spam. Again, the content is fine - it's just unbelievably rude that they don't let you skip the ads."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great collectors set","review":"If you're child loves Thomas like so many do, then you'll want to get this set.

Im trudging through the first couple of pages and I have the urge to grab a pencil and rewrite stuff. I dont usually get that urge when reading books. After that, I decided to look at the author's credentials to see if it was even worth reading. Apparently its his first book, he works for some nobleman in the UK somewhere. Scotland deserves better than this book. The only thing I gleaned(sp?) off this book was that this author thinks Scotland is the greatest place on Earth. Avoid this book.

I had nothing else to read. For several days I was captivated. The settings in wartime Finland and Russia are outstanding, the perfectly flawed protagonist is wonderfully done. The premise is strange, but immensely appealing. I've recommended this book to others, including my father, an English teacher, (and he's a hard sell) and each person has acclaimed it. I cannot believe that this is out of print. The combination of war and intrigue, myth and mysticism, music and death, is superb. If you can get a copy, you'll love it. A tale of obsession, war, and love. You can't get much better than this. What I want to know is this: where is this author, and what else has he got?!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Read!","review":"Although this book is fictional, it gives an interesting and accurate look at Finlands war against Russia in the 1940s.

I thought it a bit hard to believe when I first heard about this project, and after seeing him in the role, I am convinced that he is the worst Holmes of all time.It is almost painful to see his portrayal--an accent that fluctuates all over the map, prone to odd gestures and movements, and wearing some outlandish clothing. It's enough to make one squirm, and this viewer certainly did.His treatment of Watson is terrible. Kenneth Welsh tries valiantly to bring some life into this production, and his portrayal of Watson is good, but it's just not enough to save the film.The production values are not the best--it was filmed in and around Montreal, and it shows. Montreal does not look like Dartmoor, even after building the sets. The \\"Hound\\" is a German Shepherd, and not very frightening-looking at that.In all, a real disappointment. If you want a great version of the \\"Hound,\\" the best to date is the 1939 Rathbone/Bruce, made by Fox."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended","review":"Moen's work is very readable, written in a very clear and precise style. Moen addresses most of the trends in modern newspaper layout and design, emphasizing visual journalism as a team effort.

They're super comfy to walk in but murder to stand in which is why I'm not giving them a 5. I talked to a salesman at the Saucony store who said their shoes are meant for action and movement, not standing...which is true. So, if you're a cashier or stand in line a lot, these may not be the best choice. I'm about 60 lbs overweight and find these extremely comfortable to walk in. I do overpronate a little and wish they had stiffer support on the inside to keep my ankle from rolling in, but that can be fixed with inserts. They're cute, they breathe easy and don't need to be broken in..they're flexible...so you can't go wrong with these. I'd love to have more in different colors!"},{"rating":"2","title":"love!","review":"I love these kicks! They are light weight, comfy and true to size. I wear an 8, ordered an 8 and thats how they fit....like an 8. Perfectly! They are nice and roomy across the top of the foot (but my foot it kinda narrow) They are a little snug around the heel but not to the point of discomfort. I have a hard time finding shoes that are comfortable due to having high arches. My feet don't hurt at the end of the day after wearing these. I can easily fit arch supports or heel cushions in them for added comfort (but don't have to). I vote yes on these!

They are comfortable as soon as you put them on and hold up pretty well to regular use. I wear them a few days a week and my first pair lasted almost 2 years before they became less comfortable. They look great with jeans and I often get compliments on them. I've had them in gray/olive and now in navy/silver. I'm a size 11 and love that these fit and are affordable. The only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is because the arch support could be better.

The book's methods for training seemed very stupid and I felt foolish doing the \\"Silly Little Rectangle\\", which is the main starting point of the book. Soon, however I found that the training was doing the trick, my little golden pup was learning! The instructions were easy to follow and as a result my now 14 year old white-faced friend has been the best behaved dog I've ever had, or that any of my friends/family have ever seen.

Klaus's book suggests a more proactive attitude (\\"taking retirement\\") which he displays in his daily narrative as he approaches retirement. Too many people are caught by unexpected feelings and disappointments. TAKING RETIREMENT will help many readers to more thoughtfully consider their goals as well as the reality of their expectations. It's cliche, but retirement is not an end but a beginning, and Klaus does a fine job \\"taking retirement\\" as an intriguing and challenging new time of his life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honest","review":"Both my wife and I enjoyed Taking Retirement. Although I won't retire for another 25 months I can relate to many of Klaus's fears and concerns and was happy to witness his coming to terms with and embracing retirement.Not recommended for people who use terms like \\"wimps\\" and \\"girly men\\" but it was a blessing for me to read this work at this point in my life."},{"rating":"2","title":"One man's emotions reveal a lot about retirement","review":"This book is a soft approach to facing the emotional side of ending one's working life and becoming retired.

Thus, I was disappointed in Klaus, who played an important role in the writing program at UI, because his book Taking Retirement leaves much to be desired. He is far too concerned about his own fear of retirement. If he had some suggestions for those who fear retirement, the book would be more helpful. I found it tedious, maybe because I've been retired for a while. Never did I read anyone's work who felt so sorry for himself. I wanted to tell Klaus to \\"get a life\\" as the younger generation says."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly tedious","review":"It is difficult to credit that Mr. Klaus spent his entire career teaching non-fiction writing, given that this book is so poorly written. Surely he should know that the purpose of a published journal is not to record boring details, but to enlighten, entertain or inspire the reader. Sadly, \\"Taking Retirement\\" completely fails at this task. It's chock-full of factual minutia (do we REALLY need detailed accounts of the menus of every meal he eats?), and utterly devoid of insight.One thinks of the scene in \\"Planes, Trains & Automobiles\\", in which a frustrated Neal Page (Steve Martin) tells the oh-so-boring Del Griffith (John Candy): \\"You know... you know when you're telling these little stories? Here's a good idea: have a point.

All medications have down sides and side effects. Celexa gave me my life back, and it is greatly disturbing to me that many people who need medical help beyond \\"talk therapy\\" will be discouraged from seeking it through fear and panic spread by Breggin. My doctor was not pro-pharmaceutical, he was desperatly searching for a med that would get me out of my bed and let me resume my life. Depression is a biochemical disorder, which has been proved beyond any doubt. For a chemical disorder, you need medicine, period. The same way a cancer patient needs meds.

I do appreciate the effort put forth into the making of these shorts, but they were just sort of lackluster. One dog humping a stuuffed animal maybe fine, but this film featured 3 such shorts, which made me lose interest very fast. There were also a number of shorts about cats.

He risked his life and went undercover but what did he discover? a bunch of losers who fight each other and do crank. All of the BIG moments in the book came and went with out much detail, excitment or anything that would make me care. The supposed plotting to kill a LA county sheriff is a great example. Their was no plot, he just happend to drive by the mongols campground and one of the drunken bikers on parole says \\"If he stops I'm going to take him out\\". Not much of a story if you ask me. I will be sending this one to the used book store asap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent reading for the motorcycle enthusiasts","review":"I bought this book for myself and a buddy of mine. After we both read the book we couldn't stop talking about the characters and the whole ordeal. I couldn't put the book down after the introduction page. I would read one chapter then find myself 3-4 chapters deep before I knew it.It made me feel that I was reliving this man's experience and I was part of the excitement of his undercover realm.I rate this book a 5 star rating, because the ease of reading the book and the gripping story that kept me captivated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long ride to nowhere","review":"All this product talked about was how \\"one time... under cover...

Stick to those \\"Walker, Texas Ranger\\" reruns instead...."},{"rating":"1","title":"a slam of motorcycle clubs","review":"Although the author does his best to berate and slam motorcycle gangs (notably the Mongols and Hells Angles) he comes across as more of a creep and criminal himself. Reading this book made me realize that the only really dangerous outlaw street gangs our society suffers from are the ATF and the police. The character and ethics displayed by those agents portrait in this book are despicable. Personally I would feel safer in the hands of one of these gang members than in the care of one of these aloof, self righteous, judgmental, and (unfortunately) powerful officers of the \\"law\\".I feel sorry and am very sympathetic of those poor souls trapped by this unethical and deceitful agent of the ATF. Prior to reading this book I held motorcycle clubs such as the Hells Angles and Mongols in distain, now however I feel differently. These groups are victims of over zealous, self righteous men that use the \\"law\\" as their weapon of choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Joke","review":"This guys tales are unbelievable. Like most cops everything is over the top, not to be believed. Everything is black and white to this guy. If you want to read a cop tale written at a cop's intelligence level, grab it. The part where he claims how he never did drugs during undercover operations were bizare. For him to questions the integrity of the Hells Angels was ridiculous at best. The HAMC are the last of a dying breed of patriotic do or die guys. His tales are nothing more than fodder for the LE community to continue to pursue this MC's"},{"rating":"1","title":"Self serving hype","review":"The author owes his kids an apology for the double standard he imposed on the rational for accusing his \\"new friends\\" of abusing their children while abandoning his own for the two years he was involved in this project. This book is filled with contradictions and not for one second do I believe the author didn't do drugs or screw around. You wonder what the cost effectivness multiplied by the number of these small projects that get approved around the country cost the taxpayers. I hope that this book gets made into a movie so he can afford all the therapy and rehab this is going to cost his family.

Would he do the same again? Somehow i doubt it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't be happier.","review":"This had to have been the fastest transaction in Amazon.com history!

Very amazing how William Queen was able to infiltrate one of the most notorious motorcycle gangs of our time, even gaining compassion for some of the \\"patches\\" as he became attached while becoming a full member of the Mongols."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story","review":"This is a great story, what surprised me was that it was not one sided at all. He even recalls a time when police were, lets just say, not acting as they should be. Great read, took only a few days, I recommend it for anyone, law enforcement or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes you think...","review":"I get that it takes a certain amount of ego and cockiness to pull off this kind of a sham, but how stressful a life like that must be! While I admire the undertaking Queen did, I did and still do keep asking myself why someone would want to do this. It seems like a heckofa lot of money was spent on this 2 year \\"investigation.\\" American courts need to revamp the requirements needed for putting bad guys away. Miranda is just too expensive. This is a very unsettling book for me as a \\"victim\\" of our American justice (?) system, as a taxpayer seeing how money is doled out to investigations of this type that may or may not reap results, and at the absurdity put upon ATF agents in the whole keeping up the demeanor, but-you-can't-do-drugs-lest-you-go-to-the-hospital requirement. What a joke! It's like the good guys WANT the bad guys to keep harassing and brutalizing innocent victims by putting absurd stipulations/rules on the very folks trying to protect them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bold and Daring","review":"Excellent book. It is well written. Few people know the difference between a motorcyclist and a biker. His book gives a view of motorcycle clubs from both the angle of being a police office and being a biker, a view that the public doesn't see. I have ridden motorcycles all my life. I have hung out with bikers and motorcycle clubs since I was big enough to walk. I am a retired police officer and a biker and have seen some things from the angle the author has seen it from. I have never worked under cover, and never cared to. He went much farther into his work than most police officers would care to, especially if they have a family of any kind to worry about. I salute the author in his boldness and daring in his work."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing true story","review":"This book is the true account of an undercover cop who infiltrated a motorcycle gang and became a full-fledged member. The action is nonstop; the things this man endured to bring this group to justice is amazing! He must be an incredibly strong-willed person to have stuck this out for over two years and retained his sense of purpose. Thanks to men like Bill Queen, we are all safer."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic","review":"I've never written a review for a book before but I felt compelled to do so after reading this one. It was fantastic. The book is engaging in that it provides an \\"insider's peek\\" into the world of the nation's most dangerous motorcycle gang. Under and Alone is a riviting page turner. I found myself chewing on my nails as I read tale after tale of Queen's numerous brushes with almost certain discovery of his true identity as a cop--discovery that would lead to his instantaneous death. Finally, it has heart as Queen shows how he became close to the Mongol members and began to see them as his brothers. Queen was often torn between his growing loyalty to the Mongols, who often showed him more love than anyone else in his life, and his duty as a cop to convict criminals. I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty vivid","review":"I thought it was a great book with a lot of detail.

I just didn't want to put t down. I ride Harley Davidsons but not affilated with any gang. I have had some assocition tih patched members of variours gangs and have always been glad I never joined. This book is very realistic and the biker world. I further show the dedication, detmination, and what our law enforcement gives up to protect the citizens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written","review":"I thought it was well written and very informative. It was also concise where it needed to be. I would recommend if you like this type of thing, which I do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable read","review":"Being new in law enforcment it was very interesting to read about the job that this guy was able to do. I am impressed with anyone that is able to hold their own under cover even for short assignments let alone for this long. It did appear to end very abruptly but I'm assuming that helps illustrate how quickly everything wraps up when the decision is made to make the busts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't put it down","review":"This is one of the few books about outlaw motorcycle gangs that is accurate and riviting. William Queen is not only an outstanding law enforcement officer but is also an excellent writer. It is rare to find an individual with both talents. A must read for law enforcement officers everywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"From a non-motorcycle fan","review":"I loved this book. It was gritty, gripping and wholly entertaining. I normally get bored about 1/2 way through reading a book and never finish it, but this, I couldn't put down. I'm not even a fan of motorcycles--in fact, I'm terrified of them. But that doesn't matter--this book will keep you on the edge of your seat! I wish this would be made into a movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Completed in 4 days! Awesome book!","review":"I usually have a hard time staying interested in a book, but that was not a problem with this one. I found the hours flew by as I read about how Bill Queen managed to keep himself from being found out by the Mongols. This was a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read","review":"A very interesting story of a different nature. I couldn't put it down! There were a lot of holes, though, where the author was unable to fill in the blanks due to a security kind of nature, I am sure. This book did give me an insight into the gang culture, and it is not a pretty sight. It also made me see that my job isn't as bad as I sometimes feel it is! To do what this cop did is a true act of incredible bravery. If you like reading true stories that show a different kind of life than most of us can imagine, this is it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Under and Alone","review":"One of the best books I have read! Fast paced and exciting! This is one book you won't want to put down! I hate like hell that Mel Gibson(or some other Hollywood suck ass) will try to play William Queen. This man(Mr. Queen) is one man of steel! Get this book for a ride of a life!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent reading","review":"I couldn't put the book down. I can only imagine what kind of situations Mr. Queen went through that were not in the book. Both touching and sad, these guys really cared for their brothers and I can see where Mr. Queen had a difficult time with the operation. It is too bad everyday people can't create bonds like these guys had. I ended up wishing they didn't go down the way they did. I would highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"I never knew the details about the Mongols. It was fascinating to learn about this motorcycle gang. The book is so well written that I finished it in 1 day. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it.","review":"Great book and a fast easy read. I was sad when I finished it because I wanted to read more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Under & Alone - Great Story Even If Not Greatly Written","review":"It isn't well written, but the story is tough.

This is what I was looking forward to and expected. What showed up was in a terrible neon yellow!!!

If you believe the restaurant descriptions here, you think that the worst 30-something restaurants in the Bay Area are packed with rich venture capitalists. It is more of a pickup bar guide than a reputable restaurant guide."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad music","review":"Watch out, there's music!

They should have FULL segments on preparation, the punches, the purpose of the heavy bag, a brief history of the bag, the types/weights, the importance of it, footwork, etc, etc. It literally seemed like 8 mins of content.

McCown, soloist","review":"A Taste of Passover provides a wonderful look at Jewish beliefs and music, and it gave me a new insight into a group of people and a religion that have fascinated me for years.Theodore Bikel's telling of \\"The Carp in the Bathtub\\" was touching, and the Matzoh Ball Demonstration by Chasia Segal was charming. Hankus Netsky and the Klezmer Conservatory Band played music with which I was unfamiliar and made me feel as though I were listening to pieces that I had known all my life and which had become my favorites.But the highlight was hearing Michael McCown sing \\"Dayenu\\" to the tune of Paul Anka's \\"Diana.\\" He sings it with such energy and delight that it became an interactive experience for the audience, and they seemed to enjoy listening to the song as much as he enjoyed performing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eli's Pork Chop--great blues harmonica.","review":"I just heard Eli's Pork Chop, an amazing blues harmonica instrumental, on KPLU here in Seattle.

Outdated information from previous editions was left to pile up, so this book is more of a history book than a description of the state of the art at the time. Other info belongs in other textbooks. For example, the description of how the Internet works (IP addresses and such) isn't relevant to multimedia production.There are also a bunch of sidebars that are supposed to be entertaining or deep. I found most of them to be boring and self-indulgent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great way to start the day","review":"I challenge anyone to make consistently good coffee with this awkward, finicky machine.

Obviously, I must have seen her picture on other covers but never bought her books.I usually find this type of plot, arranged marriages, interesting reading with charming characters. Unfortunately, I can't say the same for this. Ms. Craft seems to have too many other characters, who were certainly not charming and not engaging. Her main characters never develop beyond a \\"lack-luster\\" appeal. And I honestly almost \\"lost it\\" when they broke out into the FUNKY CHICKEN! [This is the part where I turn back to check out the copyright and printing dates.

It is NOT a handbook of how to adopt internationally. It is her story of adopting a girl from China. In writing the book, she talked to a lot of people who adopted from all over the world. Their stories are spread throughout the book and add a lot to the book. Overall, I was disappointed with the book and would not recommend its purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for anyone remotely interested in codes!","review":"I have always been fascinated by codes and Singh has put together a comprehensive book on the history of codes. Having read many books on codes, Singh was still able to enthrall me with some historical stories that I had not come across. It's not just technical stuff, but is written with the novice in mind as well. But the book holds enough technical information to keep the enthusiast interested as well. The version I bought has a crypt contest in the back, which I enjoyed working on - I was only able to solve the first 3 or so puzzles, but it was a lot of fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting book!","review":"Singh relates a plenty of interesting facts of the history of cryptography that were kept secret for a long time. Besides, a good introduction to the idea of some simple cryptographic schemes gives the reader a little bit of the thrill that involve the study of codes.

It goes well with the first set of several e-mails sent to them on problems I was eventually able to solve by other means, sometimes after several hours, even, in one case, a few days. It's sort of a challenge, but that's not exactly why I purchased this thing in the first place.When it works, it's not bad. It appears to be more complete that the other three I've tried (Grolier, Encarta, and Compton's), although I agree with time_velocity that it's far from what it could have been.

It was recommended to me, and I picked it up with anticipation, ready to buy a copy. I was very disappointed, (as a psychotherapist specializing in recovery issues), to find that the dual diagnosis approach to recovery and mental health was mentioned exactly once, then ignored in favor of the old \\"either/or\\" paradigm discarded by most of us in the eighties; thus the sections on addiction and mental health are of limited use, since the interactions between the two are ignored. This book is better than nothing, but you'll have to infer your treatment plans if you let yourself be limited by its contents. Hopefully a forthcoming edition will bring it's recovery paradigm into the nineties, before they're too far behind us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Caring for the Mind","review":"This book was recommended to me by a professor and I just love it because Caring for the Mind is very comprehensive and helps me better understand and make a diagnosis.

There's nothing to indicate to a new reader that it's the seventh book of a series, nor (more importantly) the third book of a trilogy within the series, so an unwary reader quickly find him- or herself confronted with characters making reference to past events that are never explained or expanded upon. As a thriller, it seems competent enough, but I found myself too mired in continuity to ever really get into it."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"If I could give this book higher than a 5=Star rating, it would have one. What a remarkably suspenseful, intriguing conclusion to a great series of books. Pendergast is fascinating, as are all of the characters. It has been most enjoyable seeing their characters develop and interact - makes it more interesting. The authors ability to create and not be held back by explainable reality is what makes the books so interesting. It gives you the opportunity to imagine and wonder. A completely engrossing book that I hated see end. Can't wait for another Pendergast book!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fitting conclusion to the trilogy... but is it really the end?","review":"This book was billed as the capper to the Pendergast series, when all of the plot threads left by \\"Dance of Death\\" would be neatly sewed up. Much to my delight, the authors were apparently seduced into keeping things going. Not to give the plot away, but I doubt that we've seen the last of Diogenes, and the last sentence in the book just screams \\"continuation.\\"Not that I mind. I'll be anxiously awaiting the next installment. After being sorely disappointed in \\"Brimstone,\\" but enthralled with \\"Dance of Death,\\" I can say with certainty that this book is the best of the three. I have criticized Preston and Childs for being poor \\"finishers\\" in several previous novels, but that is decidedly not the case in this one.Highly recommended, but read the other two noted books first, along with \\"Cabinet of Curiousities.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Confusing at First...","review":"The Book of the Dead was a bit confusing at first. At several points I considered dumping the book but couldn't quite do so. I am glad I kept with the book.

After savoring so many previous efforts, \\"Book of the Dead\\" is like reading a bad novel by an acolyte author. It is everything previous Preston/Child novels are not - predictable, formulaic and uninspired. Sure, there are occasional flashes of technical and storytelling brilliance, but they are few and far between. I suspect this gifted writing duo was pressured into writing faster than they prefer, were too busy doing other things, or have grown weary of their characters. Let's hope future books return to the suspense, subtlety and craftsmanship for which Preston/Child are rightly praised."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Elementary My Dear Vincent\\"","review":"Another enjoyable romp with the cast of characters from \\"The Cabinet of Curiosity\\" Preston and Childs are paralleling the career of the worlds' greatest detective and shuffling names a bit. Sherlocks' brother Mycroft belonged to the Diogenes Club and his great adversary was thrown over the Falls. All of this gets worked into the Pendergast Saga in fun forms. Fans of Conan Doyle will be delighted, but those who can't see through the veil will be a bit confused. It is still a great read and promises future amusment as well. Once again the joy is in the details, the poetry, the wine, the locations, and the ambience of a glorious pair of literary lights at the top of their form."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"This author is terrific. I can hardly wait to purchase more of these novels. The details are amazing and the storyline is mesmerizing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Disappointment","review":"The first book was incredible and the second book of the series was equally mesmerizing but this book bored me to tears. The main character was incarcerated it seemed for half the book. Way too much time was spent on the details of Egyptology.

Possibly the worst one from the duo. Other than the prison break portion, everything else was just awful. (If you like prison break, read \\"Dirty White Boys\\" by Stephen Hunter)What the hell happened to Douglas and Lincoln? Where is the imagination and the flow of Riptide, Ice Limit and Relic?I can't believe I bought this at hard cover price. If you are a fan of the duo, borrow this from the library. It's not worth the paperback price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book...","review":"The Book of the Dead was a good book, it was slow up until about the middle.. then it became a page turner.

All in all this was a good book, but not a great one."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"The 3 Stooges Meet The Mummy \\" was better","review":"\\"It was a dark and stormy night...\\" is probably the only cliché the authors missed.This book is a ponderous mash of clichés you've seen dozens of time in \`B' sci-fi flicks and cheesy slasher movies.The characters are colorless props, unbelievable and lacking in sympathetic qualities. Some of the plot elements are laughable. The pace is slow. I sometimes found myself rooting for Mycroft, er I mean Diogenes, to kill 'em all.I had read and enjoyed Tyrannosaur Canyon; Cabinet of Curiosities was OK. I had also read the first 2 books of this trilogy. So, I wanted to finish this book, awful as it is. Eventually I got through it by creating a theater in my mind with Joel, Tom Servo and Crow Robot from \`MST3K' sitting down front, making fun of the inanity that reeled across the screen. Push the button, Frank."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the beef?","review":"The book in no way let the reader know that it was the third book in a trilogy.

I was very upset with this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"book of the dead","review":"The final chapter to the \\"war\\" between brothers, a page turner which does lead to somewhat of a anti climax.

I'm half way through and have no idea what's going on! Why the hero is incarcerated, why a special agent can think he can tell a warden to keep an attorney from his inmate (who isn't actually sentenced yet), or put him in danger in a prison yard, and think he can do it again -- all on the word of an agent he's never met before. There's two women who are dead or injured and I'm clueless as to why. One Prof. entering the museum at 3 in the morning -- when 2 men were attacked there the night before and one died!

From what I heard of it, the story is good and deserves better treatment than it get."},{"rating":"1","title":"Designed for slow-moving people","review":"The characters come out of late-night television dramas. The plot requires suspension of reality to the point where paranoid quasi-paranormal drama is normal. Um... the progress of the book is well-paced, it's super easy to read, and it's moderately distracting from whatever dental surgery you may be undergoing at the time. However, it's designed for people who move slowly because they have tiny brains. The plot is obvious and easily guessable. The characters require incredulity to accept. Every three paragraphs, when you begin to think you're reading a comic book, they spout off some Internet research about a technology or Egypt. I have read books this bad before but they weren't best sellers. I would only recommend this to people with a fear of polysyllabic language."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great Pendergast novel","review":"I enjoy all of the Preston/Childs books, but I especially love the ones featuring Special Agent Pendergast. This one is no exception. It has a cast of characters that work so well together.

By far this is my favorite of the Pendergast series!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Preston and Childs Book by Far","review":"I've read a fair number of books by Preston and/or Childs. Some were good; some better than good. This book was a complete waste of time. First of all, this is not a stand-alone book, although there is nothing on the outside as to mark it as a sequel. But even if I had some inkling into the chronology and backstory of all the characters, I doubt that I would have found anything about the characters, the setting, or the plot in the least bit credible. Things just keep happening that don't make sense--it's not that they are mysterious or spooky or build suspense and are explained later--they just don't make sense. Coincidences abound. Police and bystanders alike act in ways that defy logic. Characters do things that are bizarre and unrealistic. I understand that thrillers depend on a willing suspension of disbelief from time to time, but this goes way beyond that. Thoroughly disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in Preston","review":"I very much enjoyed Brimstone and was looking forward to completeing the series, but in light of Mr. Preston's opinion of ebook readers, specifically Kindle owners, I have decided to take my Wal-Mart attitude and MONEY and give it to some other author who appreciates me.Those Indie authors seem to be a down right inviting group.Sorry Mr. Childs if you do not share Mr. Preston's views."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amusing, but would not recommend it.","review":"Characters not well developed.

I was duped on this one - and by many of the reviews written here and on another big book site! I should NOT have listened!This book is nothing but B-movie schlock on paper. Poor plot, poor characterizations, extremely unrealistic settings. It reminded me of something on Cinemax at 4am. Do yourself a favor: Watch that instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Summer Read!","review":"For fans of the Pendergast books by Preston and Child,this is a must read. It wraps up the unofficial \\"Diogenes Trilogy\\" begun in \\"Brimstone\\". The story climaxes on a cliff by the sea and takes Constance, Pendergast's ward, to a whole new level. While it can be read as a stand alone novel, you should really read \\"Dance of Death\\" first. Its a great summer read with intricate escapes, international flight, games of \\"cat and mouse\\" and a look into Diogenes' lair, as well as Pendergast's psyche. Its not \\"War and Peace\\", but it will keep you frantically turning the pages while sitting on that beach!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Agent Pendergast rocks.","review":"Do not read this book unless you plan on being immobile for a while.

It started off better than it ended, which is worst than startng off slow and building. Totaly unbelievable, unimaginitive and well, which means its pretty boring and predictable. Its a 1 1/2 stars at best. A mysterious benefactor, a magician style arch nemesis all seem over the top. I guess I should have read the first two novels in the trilogy because I don't think this novel stands by itself very well. My bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Awesome!!!","review":"A fantastic conclusion to the Diogenes series (though I wouldn't be surprised if he somehow made a comeback in the next book!). As with their other novels, I didn't feel like I was reading a book, but rather that I was there seeing it all happen in front of me. The writing is fantastic, and the plot will keep you on the edge of your seat. I would really recommend that you read Brimstone and Dance of Death before you read this, otherwise much of it doesn't make sense.I highly recommend this book, along with all of the other books by these authors."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read","review":"Preston and Child have done it again. They have created a suspence novel TOGETHER that keeps the reader on his toes. There are about four stories going on at once, but they all conclude at the end of the novel. My question though, has to do with the last two words of the novel. What will they do now?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, what a tangled web . . .","review":"Oh, what a tangled web they weave. Again, this Preston-Child novel, The Book of the Dead, contains so many characters and subplots it's almost too daunting to absorb and seems to bog down the read at times (though I'm still a huge fan of these authors). I stayed with the book to the very end but found myself skipping entire passages to get back to the action. Not on par with their earlier works, to be sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"the book of the dead","review":"this was my first book of the series, actually of both authors, and i am completely hooked! the action was hard core and i loved the main character pendergast. he is just the best good guy! you know kinda bad...i am definetly a serious fan and i cant wait to read everything by these authors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining suspense, stands on own","review":"Although I liked it and found the science behind the eventually \\"Big Event\\" cool, I wish I had read the 1st 2 of the trilogy first, but I got it from the library and it was not clear from the cover this was the 3rd. It managed to stand alone well enough but the Constance long-childhood thing was very unclear and hinted at annoying. If a focus was going to put on it, then it should have been flatout stated. Despite that, it was a rewarding, quick and exciting read. For a suspense novel, there were very few holes...I can't think of any except a weird statement made about Nora by her husband that seemed like something bad editing failed to catch a change in characterization. Still, a fun story great for a rainy day or beach."},{"rating":"2","title":"3rd in the Trilogy but perhaps not the last...?","review":"Great last book in the \\"Trilogy\\".

Every one of the other musicians on this project do it \\"Ralph's way\\". Dr. Ralph turned 72 yesterday and his music just gets better and better.

They are really small. You have to have tiny ears to be able to notice that you even have them on. So, I'd only recommend them for toddlers and younger children pre-school who have pierced ears. Quality is decent sterling silver, and they are probably ok for moms to put on their toddlers because they will stay nicely due to the good screw backing. But,kids a little older who usually put their own earrings in might be disappointed and will probably have trouble putting them in themselves. They are so tiny (looks like about 1/4\\") it's difficult to hold them to put them in and they will also be lost easily. Probably good for a small child who won't want to change their earrings very often and maybe keep them in, or if mom can do it for her. They might also be good for anyone with multiple piercings who want a few tiny earrings to go with their central earring."},{"rating":"2","title":"We Love them","review":"I purchased these for my two year old granddaughter.

I guess you could say this is a more contemplative, cerebral album, but there is little on it that inspires me for the Christmas season.

It's boring for most of the time as we're supposedly got to be in suspense as a mound of earth moves around as the monster chases after people - oddly not disturbing any trees at all as it does so.I think people can take heart that the French can make terrible low budget films just like everyone else.Avoid this.

While much of this book is the same old thing we here on the nightly news report, Mr. Weiss is more about himself and selling books and hyped-up newsletters (yes, he also peddles several newsletters - much inaccuracy and sensationalism) than helping you or I. His team of writers could work for the Nat'l Enquirer - nothing but a bunch of hype, sensationalism and self-indulgence. While this is just my opinion consider it food for thought.

Either way, readers would be best to steer clear of this book. Weiss' conclusions in Chapter 11 on Tax-Exempt Bonds is completely faulty and his 'advice' in that chapter is so off-base that it should be deemed criminal. In fact, it would almost be worth giving up our right to freedom of the press to get garbage like this off of the shelves - less people might be hurt. In my opinion, Weiss is no different than any other dishonest advisor trying to make a buck selling you bad advice and ignoring cost - he's just packaged it differently.

Like, honestly no one over 8 really bothers with Barbies. And I mean look at the choices we have: Barbies(in general), Diva Stars, Flavas... Bratz... ~What else?~ and all of them well... kinda suck...But thats not the point.

I am very pleased with this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Uppa Baby Vista","review":"If you own an Uppa Baby Vista stroller then do not bother buying or using the cup holder that is made for or comes with it. The Vista cup holder is expensive, flimsy, it sticks out awkwardly and it can come loose too easily (especially when folding or unfolding).Buy the Jolly Jumper instead. It is half the price, it holds two cups and has extra space to store other stuff. It sits nocely out of the way between the handlebars instead of sticking out. And whereas the cup holder from the vista is just for cups (since it is just a bunch chains with a plastic bottom) this can be used for sticking anything in there (since it is a closed pouch).I thought the angle of the handlebars would be a problem, but if you tighten the straps correctly it comes out pretty level and your cup of coffee is safe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stroller Caddy that works with Phil & Teds","review":"I have the Phil & Teds Explorer and this is so much better than the Phil and Teds Hangbag. My friend has a BOB stroller with the BOB bag and this looks identical but is about 1/2 the price. The pockets are deep so things like water bottles won't fall over or out. I wouldn't use it with open drinks but I havn't found any stroller cup holder to be good for this. My handlebar adjust so I can make mine level but you can adjust the rear straps to make it level if you handlebars don't adjust. I like the zipped pocket because it keeps your keys secure our your camera out of site. The logo on mine was all a light gray. From this review you can see I highly recommend this item especially if you have a Phil & Teds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect parent console for a stroller","review":"I use this on my uppababy vista, because at the time uppababy only had the weird chain link cupholder for their stroller. They've since come out with a caddy that looks just like this that has their logo on it, but this works great and is way cheaper. The cupholders work really well for coffee to-go cups, water bottles, soda cans, whatever. They level out with no problem, even though my stroller handle bar is not level to the ground. It's got a center zip pocket for a phone or wallet and a little open slidey pouch on the front.

It works great with my Bumbleride Indie jogging stroller! Since I'm short (4'11), I adjust the handles so that it is horizontal and the caddy lays flat, however, it still works if you adjust the handles at a slight angle. I put a couple bottled waters in there, my phone, keys, etc. It fits everything I need and seems very sturdy. I like that you don't have to remove it in order to fold the stroller.

It fits easily on the handlebar, but the only thing I would \\"complain\\" about (it's minor) is that it doesn't stretch as tightly across the handlebar as the picture shows. There is some slack in the caddy even with the straps pulled as much as they can go, but it is a minor complaint. It is really convenient to have this for my water, snacks, keys, phone, etc. since the P&T doesn't come with anything like it.

Just needed a place to set my drinks, keys and phone when we're out. Unfortunately it is very flimsy - doesn't fit tight at all as shown in picture. It kind of droops in the middle so that when there is a drink (just one) it tilts sideways. Also, if the canopy is closed (pulled back) on the stroller, I can't reach anything in the caddy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the bugaboo!","review":"There aren't many cup options for the bugaboo and this one is awesome! It holds 2 cups, has a zippered pouch for keys and stuff and slots for phones. It was way less downsize than a bugaboo cup holder and is way more versatile. The only negative is that it probably won't hold hot drinks since I wools be afraid they would spill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good idea, but broke fast","review":"This is a great idea, and I loved it.

The Jolly Jumper fits on the handle bars but the bag also sits at a 45 degree angle. Basically, this would work if I always carried around a drink with a cap on it but never an open container. If you have a stroller that will hold the bag level it will probably work better for you.Aside from the angle of the handle bars, I wasn't thrilled with it in general. The cup holders are not large enough to fit larger coffee cups or even larger water bottles. There is nothing that really gives the caddy any structure so the bottom part swings while the top stays rigid, making things bounce around. I tried this caddy head to head with the Sunshine Kids Buggy Buddy (which is cheaper) and found that caddy to be better material, better structure and the cup holders stretch to hold larger cups."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Joovy Caboose","review":"When we ordered the Joovy Caboose Stroller, we were suggested to purchase this organizer since the stroller itself does not have one.

If you look carefully at the picture of the stroller demonstrating the organizer, the organizer is attached to the end portion of the handle that is horizontal. We recommend purchasing instead the organizer from the manufacturer itself; unfortunately it will likely cost twice as much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome and affordable","review":"Much cheaper than the BOB organizer.

A stunning film that has clearly influenced science fiction film makers ever since. Direct influences can bee seen in films like \\"Aliens\\" and the television series \\"X Files\\". A stark B&W film that never lets up in pace. Masterful direction of Nigel Kneale's classic story of alien invasion easily stands the test of time. A classic of the genre that every science fiction fan should view. Leaps and bounds ahead of the UFO and Giant Insect movies that were coming out of the USA at the same time. One of the most important films of this genre. You won't regret this one..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"I got this video after reading the various viewer responses and found it tedious. Britain has provided us with some terrific Sci-fi movies despite low budgets, but this one has all the tension of an uncooked sausage and generally looks pretty silly - the costumes are dated, the characters cliched, and the \\"monster\\" is too silly for words. I place this film right down there with the worst of American 50's black lagoons!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Hammer?","review":"I couldn't even get past the first half hour of this movie before turning it off ... deeply disapponted.

I think a CD is available of some of his film music, including \\"Q2\\"....Wonder if ol' Bernard Hermann saw this movie before he scored \\"sycho\\"?

I ordered this dvd, thinking that this rare dvd had finally been re-released by Anchor Bay, only to find out it's only a DVD-R copy of the original. Amazon needs to be much clearer in their description of this dvd & let buyers know that it is not a factory pressed DVD. I'm not sure how the licensing for such a DVD-R was worked out with Amazon & Anchor Bay (presumably it was or it would not be for sale on Amazon) but Amazon should not list it like the original Anchor Bay edition which is obviously still out of print and rare.

The ending is very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Unexpected Gem","review":"I expected this to be a fun 50's sci fi film, and it is. It's also extremely well done. The movie's vast alien conspiracy is a precursor to X-Files storylines seen decades later. Brian Donlevy heads a cast all of whom deliver yeoman-like performances. Way-better-than-expected special effects.

The 1st thing I noticed that I didn't like was the water level indicator--if you only make 4 cups its hard to tell the amount in the reservoir. I use a measuring cup and somehow when the coffee is finished I seem to have more than I poured in! I learned that this pot uses 6 oz. cups for measure, not the 8 oz. as on my kitchen measuring cup. When I adjusted the water/coffee ratio I found that it does make good coffee. The stop-drip feature for when you pull out the pot before its completed it's cycle doesn't work very well. There are still a few dribbles. The clock/timer feature is easy to use, and the coffee making is done quickly. I would probably not buy another one. I'll probably save this one for the church yard sale next summer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsafe coffeemaker","review":"This coffee maker made the best tasting drip coffee but after a little more than a year, the electrical component shorted out.

It's so badly written, I constantly find myself editing it in my head. Obviously, the style is intentional and designed to capture a child's voice but many books are able to do this without such lousy sentence structure. The main problem is that it is written in a style of oral language, including a lot of unnecessary \\"fill\\" words and conjunctions. If you're a teacher who cares about the written word, I'd highly recommend steering kids to a different series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Getting Better and Better","review":"Lots of series can be read out of order, (Nancy Drew, Hardy Boys, Boxcar Children), without losing much. That's true of the Sammy Keyes books, since each is a stand alone. But, I've read a couple of them now, and realize that the books become deeper, and the Sammy character becomes more interesting, complicated and developed, from book to book.There's a big difference in the reading experience between, say, \\"Sammy Keyes and the Hotel Thief\\", which is book one, and \\"Sammy Keyes and the Psycho Kitty Queen\\", which is number nine. \\"Runaway Elf\\" is number four, and while it is still pretty much a juvenile mystery/adventure the Sammy character is beginning to develop, the secondary characters are coming into focus, and the mystery is better. This is where the series begins to develop into a little more than just \\"The Boxcar Children\\".If your young reader really likes it I'd recommend starting with the first volume and working through them. They're all good."},{"rating":"1","title":"wast of time","review":"when i was reading this book i felt that the story is toooo long and it bearly talks about the runaway elf it mostly talks about another topic . so if i was you dont wast your money or time of reading this book Two tumbs DOWN"},{"rating":"1","title":"bad book","review":"Sammy Keys and The Runaway ElfYou will be bored to death by this uninteresting mystery. This book doesn't really tell you what the characters look like or what they think about. I also don't think that its written very well. The book is more like a documentary than a story. A dog gets kidnapped is a silly plot.The plot of the story is a small town around Christmas time. There is a Christmas parade and one really expensive dog goes running and cats go every where. A ransom of fifty thousand dollarscomes to Mrs. Landvogt's mansion for the dog. So Mrs. Landvogt is going to blackmail Sammy Keys if she doesn't find the dog. So Sammy goes every where and at sunset Sammy finds a girl looking at the moon. Then Sammy takes her home and stays for a wile. So Sammy looks around alot finds clues and figures out who did it.

Their synthesized lyrics are clearly inspired by Daft Punk, and yet even more loopy. It will give them props for having an original sound, but originality doesn't make the album sound any better.Personally I feel like I'm shopping at Old Navy when I hear this music. It sounds remarkably like the genre of Muzak the store aims for, to smother the yuppies and high school cliques as well. This is exactly the type of thing echoing throughout the mall -- that spunky, yet completely forgettable noise that occupies the space. You may not, however, hear the track \\"Pornstar\\" in Old Navy. In this case you'd be shopping at A&F.;It's not a bad album, but nothing to recommend to a buddy.

I actually scored well below my average, on tests from all different sources, until I was able to mentally undo a lot of the tips the book gave me. It outlines systems you can use for arguments that don't apply even to the practice tests in the book! One of the primary strategies is to guess on 6 questions in every section to save time, because the author does a lot of assuming its audience is stupid and incapable of finishing. (Finishing all of the questions isn't even a strategy the book considers.) You could get almost all of the relevant tips for free on a good website and the ones you can't are shady at best anyway.

Some people seem to want to call it a comedy to help ease the touchy marijuana subject, but it is really a crime drama, not a comedy. It's a comedy only in the way that some unseasoned criminals screw up on the job (as in an Elmore Leonard novel), but that's just relief from what is truly a dramatic film about marijuana farmers. One can't help but wonder how the studio planned to deal with a possible backlash to a film that presents marijuana farmers as good guys, not demons.The cast is terrific, from Billy Bob Thornton to John Lithgow to Jamie Lee Curtis to Jon Bon Jovi, among many other big names.

EVERYTHING! The team can't take credit for finding ANYTHING. The book got exiting again but I was so disappointed that I dropped the 5th star I was about the give the book.

It is one of my favorite novels of all time. The movie doesn't do it justice, then again since when did a movie ever did a book justice.Congo is about a quest for rare diamonds and then you throw in silverback gorillas, a few competitors , a couple of plane crashes, a bunch of angry hippos, cannibals, explosives, warfare, ancient ruins, a primatologist, a guide, a bunch of guys who speak swahili and one hell of a crazy leader who would jeopardize everyone's life so long as she would get to the diamonds first!!!If you're going to read one novel this lifetime...read PSYCHO.

They invariably involve a scientific (or legal, in the case of Disclosure) concept that is extrapolated to create a gripping story, despite somewhat flat characters. Congo, however, was a disappointment. While he builds on two scientific concepts--animal communiciations and evolution--the story fails to grip as it should, pushing him to add some additional conflicts just to maintain some suspense. And while they seemed forced, they might have provided for a satisfying story if only all of the loose ends were resolved at the end. But they weren't, leaving me with a hollow feeling. My recommendation for a reader who has never read Crichton to try Jurassic Park or Disclosure. For those who have, avoid this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks the element Chrichton Provides","review":"I read the book some time ago, but I remember not being too impressed with this one. Chrichton's books usually have some sort of science development that make the story interesting, and, what was it computers and communications in this one? It just didn't seem to fit the action (killer apes and volcanoes, etc.) In Jurassic Park, it works (people running from monsters they are resbonsible for) and Sphere (people running from monsters of the imagination) but here I just don't see the connection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slower than an arthritic turtle","review":"This book is duller than dishwater.

I thought it was one of the most in-depth books I have ever read. The detail of scientific facts and ideas that Crichton includes makes it that much more authentic.

Even if you didn't like the movie, please read the book.Congo begins with a archeological group searching for lost cities in the congan jungles. The group, in order to be found if a disaster occured, would communicate with there base and operation center in Houston via satellite video. One morning during the transmission, something goes wrong. Don't worry I won't say it...(houston we have a problem)...anyway. The company falls under attack by what appears to be gorillas.

The question on everyone's mind is...Will Amy be enough??"},{"rating":"2","title":"A splendid work of fiction ... two thumbs up!","review":"Crichton, a master narative storyteller, does not dissappoint with this novel. Although it almost feels like a modern-day Jurassic Park at times, the writing, imagery and plot is most brilliant. Well researched and well written, it is only a shame that Crichton does not produce more works of fiction for his loyal readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looking for some older Crichton to fill that need?","review":"This is a good start. As many point out, the older technology is fun to come across periodically but I didn't find it distracting at all.What I enjoyed most was the gradual reveal of the puzzle behind everything in this book. The quest for blue diamonds is more than a bit farfetched but if you enjoy technical mysteries, it is done better here than in some of Lincon/Preston books such as 'Relic' & 'Thunderhead', two books that are very Crichton-esque in their reading. 'Rising Sun' has a better mystery at its core than this book but it lacks the overall fun that can be found here."},{"rating":"1","title":"could care less","review":"I know Michael Crichton is an entertaining writer, but I could not get into this book. The subject matter/plot was boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Congo","review":"This was another great novel by Michael Crichton. This book starts out quick with the killing of the eight group members, then it slows down to introduce the characters including a gorilla that understands sign language. The gorilla will help them out in the end... They will find some other stuff that they didn't expect to come across including diamonds and the terror that took the lives of the first group of members.Once the story gets going though, you can't stop reading it, you'll never want to put it down. There is a lots of twist and turns that will suprise you. If you enjoy a good science fiction then you will enjoy both the technology and the story. If you don't enjoy science fiction, if you can see past the hubble in the beginning with the systems, you will still enjoy this story. It's a good book for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Computers, Talking Apes, The Jungle, What Else!!!!!!","review":"One of Crichton's most interesting books.

It is full of extravagant detail. Each page is full of excitement and suspense. With each chapter, a new explosion of adventure occurred. There was always someting exciting happening so the novel was never boring. I even enjoyed the prologue! I urge you to read this marvelous novel by the author Michael Crichton, also author of well knownnovels such as 'Jurrasic Park' and 'The Lost World'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining, if perhaps a bit far-fetched.","review":"Darn floor. Big bite. So the apes can talk. But who among us would ever pick up Crichton's books to use them for research? This book provides exactly what one would expect: an entertaining, fast-paced story that is based on what is perhaps an outlandish theory. But isn't that what Crichton does best? If you like his other novels, you'll probably like this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Like \\"Jurassic Park\\", this book starts out promisingly but runs out of steam within just a few chapters.My reasons for such an accusation:1. Crichton overloads the reader with scientific facts. And while these can be quite interesting, they often obstruct the action and progress of the storyline (Dan Brown, for instance, is a writer who can properly balance compelling action with factual sensitivity). As a result, the book comes off as slow and stumbling.2. The plot isn't all that interesting to begin with. (Vengeful gorillas? Talking gorillas? Misanthropic gorillas? Come on.)3. The book's ending is utterly terrible.4. Cricton's writing is weak, and the characters are inconsistent and unconvincing.Sorry, Michael, but this book just didn't do it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I was searching for a \\"light\\" but entertaining book to read, and somehow, I decided to pick Congo. Bad mistake. The introduction was promising, I thought it would have some \\"realism\\", as the author made me believe (he even included more than two pages of references, such as Scientific American and...(yes) Rolling Stone). Big lie. The math is shameful, clearly Crichton has no idea what he's talking about (just as the \\"chaos\\" theory in Jurassic Park), and other details of the book reveal his careless \\"research\\" (like the emeralds in Bolivia!). But these are just irrelevant details if you are looking for a novel, of course. What was really bothering was Crichton hypocrisy: in the introduction he wrote about the misconceptions about Zaire (Congo) and Africa and its people, but before the page 50 he made all the misconceptions at least twice. That's shameful, really."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorilla Attack","review":"Crushed skulls and bodies lay everywhere in the destroyed expedition camp. A grainy shape is seen on tape and it resembles a gray gorilla but gorillas aren't gray. What could have caused this carnage thought ERTs employee Karen Ross. The secret may lie in a gorilla with a 620 sign vocabulary. All the action can be found in Michael Crightons Congo.With the first expedition team dead they plan to send out a new team in less than three days. Karen Ross the captain of the team is determined to get success on this mission. With Peter Elliot and gorilla Amy they must take more supplies. As they get deeper into the Congo Amy starts acting differently. She runs off and returns late at night.What is going on and why are the gorillas attacking? How did those gray gorillas come anyway? So many questions and all will be answered in Michael Crightons Congo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crichton's Best","review":"This book rocked!!! I can't say how much I loved it!!!

It is very well-written and all, but anyone who says it's his best...I don't think so. But it still has avery good plot. It is VERY suspenseful. If you liked the movie,you'll like it in a book form MUCH better. But still, if you're looking for a good Michael Crichton first,don't read this. Read Airframe, or Jurassic Park,or Sphere. But do yourself a favor and don't read this. It's defenintly noy his best. But it's still pretty good. It's good to read AFTER Jurassic Park. Notice the big AFTER"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"Well... all I can say is, I didnt like it. The first part of the book gets you interested and you feel like you want to read more. That was the good part. The next few hundred pages is like an instruction book on how to travel to the Congo. The last 20 pages were good, though. So, If you like to be bored, or if you are just wanting to know how to travel to the Congo, pick up this book. Otherwise, leave it right where you found it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly the worst book I've ever read","review":"Since I loved Jurassic Park and The Andromeda Strain (way back in high school) I happily picked up Congo at the airport. What an enormous disappointment - the book has the feel of having been written in an hour and a half. Nonsensical details are never explained (what's with the gray gorillas and the paddles? The gorillas were trained by the Zing-ites, back in the day, to execute people with the paddles and they sort of got into it? This is never made clear), the dramatic arc is entirely hosed up, and the characters are ridiculously one-dimensional. This is one of these books where you get to the last 30 pages and you realize that you're SOL - the plot is not going to come together, and you're not going to be satisfied. That, plus the obsessive detail about boring 1980 technology, left me entirely cold - this book hit the airport trash can the minute I debarked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seen the movie? Hated it? Here's why","review":"I actually wondered whether this was the same writer who gave us the fantastic Sphere and Jurassic Park. Congo is really something better left to airport bookstores. The basic story is that a group of scientists complete with an intelligent ape which can sign, travels to the Congo to investigate odd goings-on. At least, that's what we're lead to believe.Instead, the plot meanders around, often going into completely irrelevent sections on computer programming and terrorist activity which has nothing whatsoever to do with the story. The gorilla, Amy, is actually quite annoying rather than cute and the whole idea is a bit unlikely. Finally we meet the nemesis of the Congo - and then everything falls flat. It's not particularly scary and to be honest, it's difficult to care about the characters. The movie didn't do much for this book, granted, but to be honest, it couldn't have made it worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the book, forgo the tape","review":"Judith Ivy is the worst actress that ever was, and her only contribution to any form of culture is to single-handedly close down any TV show or play she's ever been in, so low sales of the taped version of COngo is guaranteed. Buy this tape if you want to suffer through hours of an affected Southern drawl that makes this Southerner flinch- her only talent is making one vowel into an entire sentence. Read the book or get something who can talk to read it for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unintentionally Funny","review":"As I was reading this ludicrous book, I actually burst out laughing at the description of the hybrid apes bashing people's heads using the implements as described in the book. Images of the 3 Stooges actually crept into my head. One of Crichton's worst; in fact, one of the worst books I have ever read in my life. I kept finding elements that were later to appear in Jurassic Park (the book), so it's almost like he was practicing in this one. The movie was a complete turkey; the best part is listening to Tim Curry's accent changing throughout the movie. Tim can do much better; he must have needed the money to agree to appear in that piece of garbage.....I think the fact that you can now purchase this book for $.01 speaks more about how awful it really is then anything else I can add."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read.","review":"Michael Crichton mixes fact with fiction to produce another great book. In this book an eight-person exploration team is brutally murdered. A second team is sent to investigate, including a primatologist and Amy, a gorilla who understands sign language. They discover the diamonds they are looking for, and slowly discover the reason the other team died so violently.A definite page-turner, and highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite fiction title","review":"This is actually my favorite fiction title, and to be fair, I read it before computers really took off so the technical details interested me quite a bit and didn't seem contrasting to current technology. Anyway, I loved this book, with it's intriguing plotline that really keeps you guessing until the very end. Heck, if you figured out the whole story without finishing the book, bravo to you because you must be really damned sharp.It might be a little difficult to understand some of the passages especially when Crichton decides to truncate all the words in the satallite transmissions for the sake of what would now be \\"bandwidth\\", but with a little thinking it can be accomplished.Overall it's still one sweet book and definitely worth a read. I found this much more riveting than Jurassic Park or The Lost World."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont go ape over this book!!","review":"a god awful boring book TMI best describes this book for me got a history lesson on every aspect of this book . not nearly scary enough to even get my BP up read more than 3 qtrs of book for one semi chilling chapter a HUGE YAWN very very boring"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Childs' Fairy Tale","review":"I was suprised in Michael Crichton that he would actually write something so crumby. A five year old could understand the plot of this story with killer gorillas. Plus this story had no character development at all. I mean the characters weren't changed after what had happened to them in the jungle. I also think the ending was very cheesey how they walked away with out a scratch. Well, besides the guys that did die in the city of Zinj. The people that made it out were all losers. Those people were the ones I thought would have died in Zinj. Over all this book was pretty bad for being written by such a great author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Your Assignment Class: Post a Book Review","review":"It appears youngsters love this book. I bought the paperback for a flight thinking it was a recent Crichton release I somehow missed. Within a few pages it became clear from the out-of-date technology that it was written years before - and the copyright date confirms it. Within a very few more pages it became clear why it had not been previously released, and should have stayed that way. But just like the ape in the story, money talks. A triumph of profit over art."},{"rating":"2","title":"There's a Monkey in My Boots","review":"This book was probably the best Michael Crichton book I have ever read. I wonder if the other apes besides Amy actually existed in real life. I had no clue that technology like voice recognition existed in the 80's. You would have to be an idiot to risk blowing yourself up just to get some diamonds. The silverback gorillas were a lot like the dog in The Mask in the way that they can use tools. I doubt that a satellite could send out jamming signals all the way from space to sea level. The death count of 7 people was especially high for a Michael Crichton book. I think that it's impossible that a person could do fractions when they were only 2 years old. My favorite character was Amy because she had more common sense than some of the other characters. I want to see the movie, even though everyone tells me it isn't very good. I think that this should be a required book instead the boring ones that the school picks out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crichton's dedication to research is inspiring","review":"While Amy doesn't wear a backpack that converts her sign language into words in this book...wait...this novel doesn't treat people like they are idiots.

The technological detail was highly boring (as with JP), I do love imaginative technology in sci-fi, like 2001 for instance, but that is seemlessly coupled with a thrilling story, this is like a textbook in places. As with all Michael Chriton books I have read, the characterisation is weak to non-existant, and unfortunately the storyline isn't elaborated enough to make it interesting. The huge potential of these apes, a relic of a brutal past civilisation is squandered in favour of a cheap horror thrill. I would not recommend this book"},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree with the mathematician from New York","review":"I agree with the reviewer from New York.

All these errors would be at least partially pardoned if this was a good novel. It's not. Somehow I managed to get through it, but it's not good. It's terrible. Too long. Awful. DULL. So there's TWO reasons not to read it. Why bother when there's so many better Crichton thrillers on the market? Go read \\"Airframe\\" or \\"The Lost World\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Informational. Could Have Really Been Something.","review":"Congo was the first Michael Crichton novel I read, and I just could never get into it. So since it was Crichton's first that I had read, I read it again. No good. The book is way too informational. Crichton should have focused more on the gorillas and the jungle. None of the characters were interesting, so I really didn't feel anything when they died. Too bad after all the good Crichton's this really could have been something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I have ever read.","review":"The reason that this is a terrible book is that the first part is excellent but the end is lame.

I am a huge Chrichton fan, and I've read better of his books, but this still rates up there, above many authors books."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of his best!!!","review":"Congo is a good Crichton book in many ways. First in character development, where it gives us a good background of the people on the expedition. Second, there's Amy, whom I found very interesting. And third, the action scenes are described very well, even better than \\"Sphere.\\" I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of Michael Crichton. This definitely ranks as one of the best books ever written.

I had read Garrett's Beyond the Paddle and loved it so I got this book and was blown away. I would reccomend it to anyone who likes to camp-out in woodland areas in the winter.

Then \\"Larry's Party\\" which, though it was somewhat ignored by the literary press, was every bit as enjoyable as \\"Diaries.\\" By then I had realized that Shields is one of our greatest living novelists. I picked up \\"Small Ceremonies\\" knowing it was nearly 25 years old -- her first published novel -- and expecting it to be less than those two later books. I was wrong. \\"Small Ceremonies\\" is simply a terrific book. Buy it. Read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thats 3 hours I'll never get back...","review":"I ordered this book after seeing the reviews but, not having read any of the authors previous books. I found it dry, not at all engaging and almost silly in content. As someone else mentioned...maybe I should have started with her first novel and moved forward. I was so bored that I found myself dwelling on the four grammatical errors I came across. Happy it was less than $5, including shipping!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Unusual Look at Life","review":"Pulitzer Prize winning Carol Shields presents a most haunting personal reality in \\"Small Ceremonies.\\"Her protagonist's train-of-consciousness reflections about her experiences are written in the first person and present tense, and bring this amusing character into sharp focus as she copes with her eccentric husband, her family and her career.The result is a thought provoking read to which all of us can relate, for these 'small ceremonies' enter into our lives too, and all of us have our own way to consider them.It is the unusual way that daily life is presented, and the clever commentary upon it, that is so delightful in Small Ceremonies, and makes it such a pleasure to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I have not yet read anything by Carol Shields that I have not liked, so this book was no exception in that regard. As always, her characters are flawed, and likeable more because of that than anything else. Judith Gill, the main character in this book finds herself looking at her life in an almost bewildered way. She knows she should be happy, but wonders if she truly is. Shields has injected the novel with her usual dose of satire on academia, but one of the most wonderful things is how she pokes fun at herself here. One of the characters, a successful fiction writer keeps a terrible secret - I don't want to give anything away here, let me leave it at: Carol Shields was born in the US!"},{"rating":"1","title":"absolutely ridiculous packaging.","review":"I bought two of these, and i returned two. The medicine cabinet is _big_. The construction isn't all that sturdy, and the wood is pressboard. But it's relatively cheap, so i wasn't expecting anything more.However, i did expect the item to arrive in one piece. The box (packaged by zenith, not amazon, though amazon shipped it) has literally half an inch of styrofoam padding. Keep in mind that it weighs in around 50lbs. I don't think there's a single carrier that you can select who would be able to guarantee delivery of this cabinet intact.The first came with pulverized styrofoam padding, two broken mirror segments, a cracked wooden frame, and stapling that had come apart. After returning the first and ordering a replacement, the second arrived in similar disrepair.If you want to pick this item up from a store, then be my guest. It'll probably serve you about how you'd expect.

Thanks Amazon.com to help me out. I was in really trouble with this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, well crafted and strangely touching...","review":"Director Brett Thompson has done a fabulous job giving us the life of the man once dubbed the Worst Director in Hollywood. Thompson wisely eschews mocking Wood, and instead concentrates on a skewed vision of the American Dream: A career, a wife, family and an angora sweater. But Thompson also gives us the good with the bad: On one hand, we have various Wood-ites telling us all Ed needed to make a great film was more money; on the other hand, there's Bela Lugosi, Jr., calling Wood a \\"user and a loser\\". Thompson also mixes interviews with some witty recreations and images, including Wood's raid on the World War II beach in women's undies.A pleasure from start to too-soon finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Tribute","review":"I found this documentary to be probably the best tribuye to Edward D. Wood, Jr. available.Cheaply done, prroly written, this documentary was mainly a few of Ed's old friends sharing their memories of Ed and thereby cashing in on their association with him.What better tribute to Ed Wood can there be?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The real journey thru Ed Wood's mind!","review":"This is a fantastic documentary about life and death of Ed Wood, an eternal misunderstood for his time. It has amazing and shocking statements of the true story that surrounded him and his monsters, as well as his crazy, but brilliant ideas. It's definately shocking in a way to see his work disputed today and despised yesterday."},{"rating":"1","title":"Key Lime?

It's easy to light."},{"rating":"1","title":"The item itself is nice, shipping method is horrible!","review":"The lamp itself is nice, and the chimney itself is real glass. I can attest to that because it arrived in pieces. Whomever packed the box used three plastic air pillows on one side of the box only. Horrible! Thus the lamp was only protected from impact in one direction. It's a shame since the lamp itself seems nice.

If you want to watch a goofy comedy with a little heart this is for you. Paul Rudd is a very underapreciated actor and shines in this movie. Sean William Scott and Mc'lovin are quite funny as well, this is just a really good movie all the way through. Yes it has some bad language but it's funny the way it is used. If you enjoyed the 40 year old virgin, american pie, superbad you will like this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hotter than hell!","review":"I don't know, I laughed my butt off. And that's really the only reason I watched this. I mean, you can't look at the cover and expect a cinematic classic can you? Some of the humor is just plain tasteless, sure. But hear me out - I actually laughed harder at this than I did at Superbad. Or did I? I don't know, but this movie even has a KISS freak in it...so any KISS freak or former KISS freak should see this right after watching Detroit Rock City. Beneath the veneer of whacky characters and goofy scenarios, there is some depth and heart in this movie that shouldn't be overlooked. As an understatement for a side note, Elizabeth Banks is a bad mamma jamma. Some of Jane Lynch's lines in this film made me feel vulnerable and alienated at the same time, but if you like stupid comedies for the sake of hilarity, don't miss this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love You, Man!","review":"I loved this movie. So sue me. I'm a complete sucker for jackass adolescent humor and boy/man/guy comedy. What elevates \\"Role Models\\" and other good ones like 40 Year Old Virgin, Superbad, Pineapple Express is a great script, memorable and believable characters and a point...and a moral...to the story. Maybe because I have sons, I just hugely enjoy these smart and sensitive guy comedies from the \\"frat pack,\\" the whole Judd Apatow crew. NICE JOB PAUL RUDD, who stars and wrote this. I have loved you since Clueless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just fun","review":"I love this movie, and shared it recently with friends. You're not going to find a piece of deep, meaningful film here - but you will find a quality bit of comedy with great acting alongside a positive message about appreciating people for who they are, not for who you'd like them to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just plain Funny","review":"You know this movie will not win any Academy Awards,but then again I dont think thats what the producers had in mind.this came out in a period where there were not alot of great movies in the theater,but I'll tell you it had us along with everyone else in the theater laughing the entire movie.Sean William Scott will of course be forever branded with the Stiffler persona from American Pie,but for some reason even though he is doing the same kind of I have 11 inches routine character he is able to change just enough in each movie to be accepted by the audience.You might not want real young kids seeing this although i,m sure parents will ,which is why our children are like they are today,but you will laugh which is something were lacking today big time whether in the movies or real life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth The Watch","review":"This movie was just as good as the previews (thank goodness). The growth of the characters (both adult and kids) was nice to see. Had there not been so much foul language sexual content this could have also been a good family movie and had a much larger audience. But, as it stands it is pretty much an adult movie with plenty of laughs. I could watch this more than once so that is good if I consider buying the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"2.5, Stupid, But Does Have Some Funny Moments","review":"This had a few more funny moments than I expected. Not enough to make this a worthwhile movie, but gave me a few laughs. The whole medieval dress up portion of the movie went on way too long. It became boring and uninteresting. I do have to say it is a little disturbing that parents will let their actor kids (little black kid) say and do things in movies that are completely inappropriate.Don't but this one, but almost worth renting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny","review":"I really enjoyed this movie. It was fun to watch. People who were supposed to go to jail are doing a public service.

This movie is disturbing. The simplistic and hackneyed premise, plot, morals, cliche depiction of relationships, not to mention the story that revolves around children and their mentors, would seem to set this up as a movie that only kids and teenagers would find appealing. Except for the fact that the crude raunchy humor and innapropriate nude/sex scenes make it totally unacceptable to show to them. I can't say it any better than this: this is a kid's movie that you would never show your kids because of the sexual content. Top that off with the fact that the jokes fall flat way too frequently, and you've got a complete waste of film and an insult your intelligence. Stay away from this garbage.The 2 stars are for the charming depiction of the SCA/live role-playing spoof portions of the movie which are original and funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product","review":"Good product just like it was described and fast shipping. Would buy from this person again."},{"rating":"1","title":"I started to turn it off. This was bad! Very bad!","review":"I am stunned at the Amazon ratings for this movie. It makes me question all other ratings. Oh this was horrible! 10 minutes into it I told my wife this is going to suck maybe we should turn it off. We tortured ourselves! If this is what goes for funny I need to start making movies. Kids cussing is only funny the first time for shock value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I was so excited to see this movie after seeing the previews. I watched it and was very let down. It's like they ran out of actual jokes so they just threw in language intended to shock. It was like this through the entire film. They started with a really good idea, and it all just sort of fell apart after that.They resorted to 3rd string movie fillers and I was not amused. Oh, and by the way, on several reviews I read that there was no nudity. There IS nudity, so that combined with the incessantly bad language, this is not a movie for kids.I unfortunately purchased this movie before I knew all this, it's headed for the trash now."},{"rating":"2","title":"love this movie","review":"I love this movie.

In the process they face hilarious trials and tribulations. The plot is rarely if ever weighed down with sappy emotionality. The movie stays silly from start to finish. They even dress up in KISS costumes and have a fantasy role-play battle at the end. This movie had many laugh out loud funny scenes and one-liners. Grade: A-"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious Movie","review":"I thought this was a very funny movie. Seann William Scott and Paul Rudd play well off each other and are quite believable as the loveable losers that have to become \\"Bigs\\" in a Big-Brother type mentoring program due to court-ordered community service. I also liked Jane Lynch as the head of the program. Her over-the-top sarcasm and self-deprecation was hysterical. It's definitely not a movie for kids because of the language and brief nudity, but it is well worth watching. I have seen it numerous times and will continue to watch it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Under the radar","review":"This movie came and went like a lot of others that look similar, but I think it was the best and funniest comedy all year, and I've seen all of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is what passes for comedy today!? --","review":"Gawd awful.I'm hardly a prude, but there was a time when one could be funny without/instead of making an over-the-top fetish of unnecessary foul jokes and language.If there's something funny about a ten-year-old kid having probably the foulest mouth of all the characters I missed it.If you're an adult, and not a sniggering pre-/teen, then avoid this as much as you avoid remembering when you were this immature.One star is many stars too many for this hollow, sub-juvenile tripe."},{"rating":"1","title":"I fell asleep here!!","review":"This was a dumb stupid movie that was uninteresting and not funny. It was so uninteresting that I fell asleep while everyone else was watching the movie. One of the theater ushers had to wake me up and tell me that the movie was finished.

Why do movies like this get green lighted? Do studio heads figure it will be something their teen kids might like? The kid cursing up a storm in this movie should be offensive at his age, yet the whole movie is so poor, it gets lost in the long list of despicable and insipid things about the movie. I could literally write something...anything ..what I did today...what I had for lunch..a phone call,etc,etc,etc and make it more comedic, entertaining and NATURAL than this forced farce with ten tons of the typical Hollywood super shiney chromed witlessness. One day, the studio's will finally figure out that a handful of funny 1 liners and/or a kid cursing and/or shoehorned plots aren't enough to wad together and call it a movie.

Rudd, Scott and company seem to be having a ball in this mildly raunchy and not too sweet comedy.Although predictable, the cast and funny dialogue keep this one from getting stale. The ending was a little corny for my taste, but it didn't spoil the over all experience.

The Hosen play with such an intensity that they unleash a tremendous amount of energy in your body which makes it impossible for you to remain motionless. But it is not all about loudness, the music itself is great too. Good vocals followed by great guitar parts. Furthermore, if you try to listen to the lyrics (and understand them because they are mostly in German), you will discover that they are actually briliant. I think most people can identify with the stories they try to tell or the points they try to make. All in all this CD is yet another quality product of Die Toten Hosen.

They have amazingly deep lyrics thanks to the intellectual German haze that gives english-speakers such a wild trip trying to understand them and most of their songs are very addictive and enticing, whether its one that's a lot of fun or one that's more profound.

Though always mumbling a little bit too much, Sir Albert sings better than ever on these tracks, and his guitar is as bluesy and funky as a six-strings version of James Brown. Add a right dose of Hammond organ and a perfectly orchestrated horn session, to obtain a virtually perfect, modern and highly enjoyable LP."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to read introductory book","review":"An excellent introduction for people looking for a good overview of writing systems. The content is succinct and the large number of illustrations and pictures make it easy to understand and grasp the concepts."},{"rating":"2","title":"An overview of writing systems.","review":"A richly illustrated nontechnical introduction to the history of writing. The author briefly touches upon the relationship between language and script and the challenges involved in the classification of writing systems but the bulk of the book is on presenting different families of scripts and accounts of thier development. The sections on extinct writing, such as cuneiform, and on undeciphered scripts were interesting but the book's chief attribute are the illustrations of alphabets, inscriptions, and glyphs, many of which are interpreted for the reader. A similar volume for the more linguistically inclined is \\"A History of Writing\\" by Steven Robert Fischer. The author, himself not without contraversy, provides the technical precision that is lacking in Robinson's book and has lots of examples of scripts as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good early work by JAK","review":"This is the first book in the Jayne Castle(Jayne Ann Krentz) Guinevere Jones series. Gwen Jones owns a temporary employment agency. Zac Justis run Free Enterprise Security Inc. He's investigating lost equipment shipments for a firm that she worked for and wants her help to find out who the culprit is. She's got personal reasons for hating StarrTech and it's owner. The two agree to work together and soon realize they want to share more than business! I really enjoyed the relationship between Gwen and Zac. Because this is a 4 book series, things develop slowly and the mystery/who-dun-it is the focus with the romance slightly(but not too far) in the background. As in many other romances, the hero and heroine are wary of each other and admitting their feelings. I enjoyed the banter between the characters and liked the fact that they were both struggling small business owners who needed to work for a living. A wonderful way to spend a rainy day or a cold winter night!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oldies but Goodies","review":"I'm thrilled with the re-release of the Guinevere Jones series by Jayne Ann Krentz aka Jayne Castle, I have the original paperbacks but having them now on my Kindle and best of all in audiobook format from Audile.com (Kate Rudd does an excellent job narrating) is a treasure.You can tell that the stories are slightly dated but but they are still fun classic JAK and I really appreciated the attempt to update them with little nuances such adding in cell phone references and the like.

The canvas is thick and reminds me of old-fashion canvas camping tents and Army surplus gear. The handles are firm, made of leather, and are attached to the canvas with sturdy rivets.

I can't imagine what could possibly come out next! As a five minute skit, Ladies Man, was always very funny and one of the better parts of the show. Tim Meadows has had quite a long run on the series, and he is a very gifted commedian and actor. To date the best SNL skit turned movie have been the Wayne's World movies. Ladies Man did have it's share of dumb laughs, but it's hardly one of the best comedies of the year. It's just a very dragged out skit of what you see on the show. Like I said, it had enough laughs to keep it somewhat interesting, but I wouldn't buy this movie.

Tim Meadows' \\"ladies man\\" character is EXACTLY how you know him from TV....and then some! He manages to keep this character on the same level (as we've come to know him) all throughout the movie. His sexist comments are all here and he doesn't become \\"a changed man\\" by the end of the film (as so many other characters do). At the end of the film, he's the same funny, misguided, sexist radio show host we all love! Briefly, our hero is bounced from his show and is pursued by angry men whose wives have all slept with him. Why bother relating the whole plot? It's just a very fun movie to watch. You'll be using his catch-phrases well after the film's over and you'll watch it again! I hope Meadows does a sequel.

There are a few exceptions. The Ladies Man was never one of my favorite characters, but my wife always thought it was a funny skit. The film is nothing more than a stretched out skit from SNL, but it does have a few funny moments, mostly due to funny man John Witherspoon. The pickled bar food eating scene is a riot! Ladies Man isn't going to become a classic, but for fans of the skit, this will probably entertain you for its hour and twenty minute running time."},{"rating":"1","title":"another bad SNL movie","review":"I liked Night at the Roxbury better than this. Of course that was a great movie though. So this is funny but do we ever get an actual story in any of these Lorne Michael's movies?

Good movie to kill about 30 minutes or so on."},{"rating":"2","title":"We've all met The Ladies Man!","review":"This movie is filled with hysterical, yet typical, SNL one-liners and quick witt. If you've enjoyed Mr. Meadows on SNL, you HAVE to see this movie. Tim Meadows is Leon Phelps, a DJ who provides extreme advice to listeners. After a run of bad luck, he is terminated from his job and must find a past lover who will make him rich. His search is long and hilarious. This 90 minute movie will have you slipping out of your seat from comedic relief. It's sexual refrences and regular pimp like scenerios remind us that we all know someone like Leon. It could be our boyfriend, father, uncle, cousin, friend from the local bar, or even your own brother. If you're looking for something to make you cry with laughter rent or buy this movie.

It's one of those themes that are so huge and stirring, you can't help but love it. However, after buying the soundtrack, I was slightly disappointed with the rest of the tracks. Part of the problem was the ording of the tracks (for instance, I think \\"The President's Speech\\" should appear last, as it is the last song heard in the movie).

A few selections are downright cheerful (Barenaked Ladies' bouncy \\"God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen\\" and Lily Frost's delicate \\"Skating on the River\\"), but the spirit of most of the pieces is more in keeping with the ancient concept that the winter solstice is a time for a kind of peaceful melancholy. If your collection is heavy on the Jingle Bells, get this to round it out (but be warned: one track, \\"The Cat Carol,\\" goes beyond melancholy -- it's just sad).

I especially enjoyed Dido's song, \\"Christmas Day\\", which I had never heard before. The rest of the album was a disappointment to me, as each song following Sarah MacLachlan's got more depressing in tone.

The vocals, as you would expect, are tremendous.The rest of the CD however, has little to offer. Some songs are enjoyable, such as Dido's \\"Christmas Day\\" and \\"The Cat Carol\\" by Meryn Cadell is a beautiful, bittersweet tune.

Yes, this is the story. I did not find it uplifted and yes I can understand the symbolism of supposedly bitter enemies coming together on one special night and self sacrifice. A great sentiment, but it didn't work for me here.Furthermore, my 5 y.o. daughter loves cats and loved the song up til the point where the cat dies (the fact that Santa says the cat will be there forever in the form of a constellation meant nothing to her)... She started sobbing and bawling uncontrollably for HOURS. I could not console her. This was on the first listening and I had no idea what the song was about before hand.

I feel sure you will never regret buying this cd - both for the music itself and the first-rate performances.

Satire is not my favorite form of humor, so it took me a few essays to get \\"into the swing\\" of the book, but I can say that once I came around to the appropriate frame of reference, I quite enjoyed the book. When reading this book, you must also remember that it was originally published in 1910; the humorous themes of the essays have aged well, but some of the settings have not.As I read the essays, I kept having the nagging thought that the author's style reminded me of a contemporary author. Once I reached the \\"How to Make a Million Dollars\\" essay, it hit me: I would not hesitate to call Stephen Leacock the Dave Barry (Miami columnist and author) of the early 1900s. They both have the same sort of perverse logic to their points of view. Thus, if you can picture Dave Barry writing in the early 1900s, you can get some idea of what reading this book of essays would be like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"This fryer is junk, to begin with it was short parts and the pans were bent because of shabby packageing and cheap box.

This study offers a holistic reading of Job, with particular reference to its depiction of creation and evil, and finds significant clues to its meaning in the striking imagery it uses. The author takes seriously the literary and artistic integrity of the book of Job, as well as its theological profundity. He concludes that it is not so much about suffering per se as about creation, providence, and knowing God, and how-in the crucible of suffering-these are to be understood.

It is a Great cd!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Intermission: The Greatest Hits","review":"This CD skipped and was delivered in a paper cover so we didn't have a cover with the list of songs on it.

Even if you are into the softer types of music DC is right for you!! so dont miss out on this one....if you are thinking about it, think no more! it is so worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good compilation","review":"Good compilation but wish it included the live version of \\"The Hardway\\". Why was the hit \\"So Long(My Friend)\\"not on there? Also I think their version of \\"Spirit In The Sky\\" would be another track that would be a nice addition to this cd. Overall a good cd for fans of dc Talk and those just getting into their music."},{"rating":"2","title":"dcTALK does it again!","review":"If you are a big dcTALK fan like me, you can finally pop in a cd filled with the most intense, rocking, and incredible sounds!

You should most DEFINATLY get this cd!Jo"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of the best!","review":"'Intermission'- an album that features a kaleidoscope of dc Talk's greatest songs spanning their very successful 11-year career. Well-known dc Talk songs such as 'Jesus Freak', 'In the Light', 'My Will,' 'Jesus is just alright' are included in the 17-track list. Remixes of 'Say the words' and 'Hardway' and 2 new songs 'Sugar coat it' and 'Chance' are also featured on the album. Both new songs, 'Sugar coat it' and 'Chance' are musically diverse, as are all dc Talk's songs, but still contain a common element- a direct and uncompromising message which has made dc Talk stand apart from many other bands. Personally, I love this album and recommend it to anyone who loves good music. It contains all the favourites, as well as new challenging songs-and an upbeat techno remix of a classic song-tieing the old with the new! The bottom line is though, that dc Talk are still the greatest...and i'm sure have more great songs to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome !!","review":"This Cd is Dc Talk's 2nd greatest hits cd and it is the best in my opinion. It contains 19 of their best and most popular songs from Jesus Freak to Colored people, this cd has the goods. The makers of this cd have also thrown some screwballs into ths making of it by remixing some songs like Hardway and Say The Words, these songs are almost better than their orignal counterparts. Dc Talk is my favorite band and i believe they will be making good Christian music for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"I could type for an hour and never be able to explain how good this CD is...so save me the trouble and just check it out!

Quite possibly the best Christian band ever. This is a collection of their greatest hits,and of course,there's not a bad song on this cd. Dc Talk has such range, they can be soft like in\\"Hardway\\", or hard like in \\"Jesus Freak\\". With the lyrics of Toby Mac, the gospel voice of Michael Tait,and the smooth unique voice of Kevin Max, they're unbeatable."},{"rating":"1","title":"not too fun","review":"This game was'nt fun for me at all.

I demoed it at Walmart on release day and was blown away by the intense graphics. Forward to just recently when I got a Ps3, I still love this game. The game play is tuned to almost perfection and the idea of multi-levels is great. The only thing keeping this from getting 5 stars is that the number of levels is relatively small and sometimes you will launch off a ramp, only to run straight into a rock. (also the loading times for vehicles is terrible, but that is because blu-ray has low transfer rates and is not this games fault) Overall though, worth the 19.99."},{"rating":"2","title":"Muy buen entretenimiento","review":"Mucha adrenalina con este juego.

Sure you can play on the internet against eleven other people. But what happen to people having fun in the same room with two or four players having a blast splitscreen. What is the point of having four controller support if most games are online multyplayer! A racing game that does not support two or four player splitscreen is INSANE!!!! Don't get me wrong, the game is fairly good for single play. But that suffers too with so little tracks and you on some levels your forced to play only a certain vehicle type! While your computer racers have any vehicle they want! PS3 is going to suffer big time if it don't get any decent made games very soon. Except Resistance Fall of Man. Now thats a game!

THIS IS A SINGLE PLAYER GAME, which is hard to believe in a racing game. Isn't the whole point of racing, to compete against someone else? Yes, you can compete on-line, but all of that side-by-side interaction is lost. I had waited for this release so that I could play side-by-side against my brothers and friends, but not with this title. Perhaps if EA Sports had released it, it would have lived up to its billing. Sorry Sony, you again deliver less than the hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ignore the positives!","review":"Man, what are you people thinking? This is just a PS2 game with updated graphics.

There's a decent variety of vehicles, however, they do lack the ability to customize. As others have pointed out, a big flaw is the number of tracks. They are well done, with each one providing a different set of challenges, but there are only eight of them. The other big problem is a exploit that lets you use boost constantly without overheating your engine. This is really a problem in the online game (which is otherwise excellent, imho), giving a big edge to those who know about the exploit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs offline multiplayer","review":"I have bought about a dozen titles now and this is my least favorite. My kids also played it for about 3 days, got bored with it, and havent played it since. Here are the issues:1. Needs offline multiplayer. I want to race my kids. They want to race me and eachother. We arent buying a ps3 for each member of the family. The box said multiplayer. GIMME MUPLTIPLAYER ACTION with people i know.2. The game is kind of repetitive.3. The game is difficult, you will play a long time to win a single race and be able to advance to the next race. Takes longer than your interest will allow.DONT BUY THIS GAME UNTIL OFFLINE MULTIPLAYER IS AVAILABLE. Then it may be worthwhile, otherwise too many better titles out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading in the number of players","review":"I would love for game advertisers to know the difference between online multiplayer and console multiplayer.

They will slow when you are stuck behind them. Also the menu selection process is slow and non intuitive. I could not figure what I was suppose to do. Do you have to come in first on all races etc? Loading and selecting the vehicles was slow. I could not finish as it got too difficult and frustrating and repetitive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks great, get's old fast","review":"First off the game looks, feels, and appears amazing. Best graphics and handling of a racing game i've seen. However it gets boring real quick. There are very few tracks and you just keep doing them over and over and the only thing that changes is the type of vehicle you drive and the difficulty. And the few tracks that there are, aren't even that fun to begin with. I'm only on level two, and I'm already bored.Get this game if you like cheap thrills, but if you're looking for substance and re-playability, this game sucks.Take a lesson from Off road fury 4, they had a ton of great tracks. You could upgrade your vehicle, buy new vehicles, and there was even a story mode. This game gives you no incentive to keep playing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for when you need an alligator with an open mouth","review":"I mean, i have tried many fake aligator mouths, and this is really the best. really.if you need a fake aligator mouth, this is the one for you. it rocks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not as good as penguin","review":"I also bought the penguin head open mouth and I have to say it's so much more realistic than the alligator.

JD's innocence and love for Noah is just amazing. Don't mean to get mushy, but some of the scenes between Noah & JD just make my melt, that i literally dropped the book.i can't say enough about this book, but to just buy it. this coming from someone who is picky about what he reads and has the attention of a gnat, i can tell you that this book is a real page turner. you CAN'T put it down--even after you finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take This Journey","review":"This is an incredibly engaging novel. Some may find the subject matter difficult; I found it refreshingly honest. Much like Mark Kendrick's \\"Desert Sons,\\" \\"Leave Myself Behind\\" is direct and realistic in exploring the highs and lows of young gay men coming to terms with their emotions and their sexuality while they're in the midst of surviving abuse within their dysfunctional families. Unlike \\"Running With Scissors,\\" which seeks to shock and sarcastically amuse in its account of adolescent turmoil, \\"Leave Myself Behind\\" never loses focus on finding ways to survive, heal, and even flourish in spite of the odds (not that there isn't any sarcasm coming from Noah, the narrator -- but he's not consumed by irony). I highly recommend this book to lovers of gay literature, mystery (yes, there's a mystery happening in here, too), and all who know what it's like to find yourself as a teenager who has to become their own parent when the biological parents don't do the job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Impressive","review":"I don't know exactly what I was expecting from this novel, but it delivered a lot more than I was anticipating.From all the reviews comparing it to The Catcher In The Rye, I was expecting a classic, gay take on the bildungsroman. In a lot of ways, it's nothing like that, since I wouldn't say the main character discovers himself so much as discovers others around him. But that's not a bad thing.A lot of plot, which reads on paper like a Eugene O'Neill play, would almost be ludicrous if Yates didn't have such a keen ear for dialog and the ability to create likable characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Gotta Read This!","review":"You gotta read Leave Myself Behind! This story is simply unforgettable and will be thoroughly enjoyed by anyone who has read other gay fiction novels.Bart Yates has created a main character that is like none I have ever experienced as a reader!

My HD70 has a very low profile to the ceiling. The sloping ceiling allowed some additional access to the adjustment screws.The only improvement that I can see being made would be to put rubber feet on the three extension legs that tighten into the projector to allow for some vibration dampening and for the screws that slide through the extension legs to fit more snug inside the legs."},{"rating":"2","title":"This product is great!","review":"I was pleased with this product from the time I pulled it out of the box to full instalation and use.

They said it would, but they happily sent an extra set of arms and mounting hardware for me to use, free of charge! And they sent it before I even purchased the unit from Amazon.

They told me I could send it to them with all purchase info, but they could only replace it with some other product. I fixed the toaster by taking it apart and jamming something in to allow space for the lever. It had a manufacturing flaw.

Given that it is used OUTSIDE in the RAIN, and is attached to a hose bib (all of which leak), one might think they would make a battery compartment that has a rubber sealing gasket and screws on tight to keep the internal mechanism dry. Instead, they have a cheap plastic snap on cover for the battery that doesn't come close to sealing tightly to keep the water out.Would you buy an umbrella with holes? If not, why buy this timer? It would take about 50 cents to design the battery compartment correctly. I already sent mine back after the first rainstorm flooded it.

I live in a townhome and have a pretty small yard.The other day my wife's aunt turned me on to a low cost solution - the Gardena 3-Cycle Electronic Water Timer. All you do is connect it to your faucet on one end and a hose on the bottom. This thing is real easy to schedule.I ended up buying a two channel water distributor and connected it to the bottom of the timer, which let me hook up two hoses that come on during the scheduled time so I could water my whole lawn.I have the \\"system\\" set for 25 minutes in the morning and afternoon.

She loves it, and so do I. It is a very light-hearted depiction of hamsters. Our favorite part of the game is the way that the hamsters talk to you. They say really cute, engaging statements, out of the blue, like, \\"What you do when you see a cat and your heart almost stops?\\" My daughter thinks the hamsters are really funny, and she enjoys teaching them and buying them enriching items for their cages. One of our favorites is a roller coaster where the hamsters get a little dizzy. For a lot of fun, I would recommend this game to other lower elementary age children."},{"rating":"1","title":"No \\"Ham-Country\\"","review":"Before I got this game, I thought it looked kinda cute. When I played it, it was okay, but pretty boring overall. You can teach your hamster to talk, which was kind of fun but sometimes I said one thing, and it thought I said another thing. Also, in order to play the mini games, you have to wait for your hamster to want to play and then it picks a mini game and a difficulty. The biggest dissapointment was the Ham-country. There isn't one. After I played it for a while, I couldn't find anything about the ham country in the game booklet or in the game. I looked at some sites, and other reviewers said there is no ham country, and it was a misprint. Overall, this game was a huge dissapointment, but still a little fun if you like taking care of vitual pets."},{"rating":"1","title":"DONT BUY!

If they had the ham-country the fact that the hamsters say and do pretty much the same thing would be excusable, but Ubisoft downright lied on the packaging. I wish I hadnt bought this when it first came out. That I couldve read reviews about it before I bought it. Now Im stuck with this crappy game. I dont even want to sell it on Ebay and have someone be disppointed with it too. They'd probably as for their money back as well.I wrote to the Ubisoft company twice and they NEVER returned my emails. I'll NEVER buy another Ubisoft product again. Want a hamster? Go out and just buy one. It'll be alot cheaper than raking out the 32 bucks like I did for this stupid game.

Instead I just thought she was over-reacting and that she didn't have enough research/data to support her arguments.

Here is her answer:\\"A child who's radiant, who's happy, who's civilized but not repressed, who's curious and full of a sense of wonder and adventure, who's confident, loves to engage in conversation and activities and basically feels that her body is powerful and wonderful and can do great things for her, and that her mind opens her up to endless possibilities.\\"Now that does sound beautiful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Collection","review":"This is the John Hurt collection I keep coming back to.

This doesn't have their famous 60s hit \\"Soul Finger,\\" but remember that version of the Bar-Kays perished in the same plane crash that killed Otis Redding. Another day the music died.

Leave out the dozens of floundering allusions (literary, cinematic, and musical) and there is practically nothing approaching original, unless you consider the story itself -- a blatantly Burroughs-esque nightmare of barbituares, coprophilia, and trannies -- original. Marshall even conjures up sad doppelgangers of Nico and Patti Smith, and makes a jesting attempt to channel Shakespeare. It's talentless imitation and no good.Spelling and grammatical errors also abound, and the book's thankfully scant 114 pages are double-spaced, seemingly in an effort to look sizable and worthy for publishing. Ultimately, 'Psychoboys' smacks of an amateur writer who somehow doesn't realize it's all been done more artfully before: by de Sade, Ballard, and Burroughs, for starters."},{"rating":"1","title":"These were great","review":"I had to make my reply about this...I too would love to see this as a DVD set.

(such as removing one of my sister's doll's eyes and putting in a hole in the wall FACING MY BED.) Imagine waking up to that! Anyway, Vincent Price is PRICELESS. His typical wonderful performace.

Elisha Cook Jr. is great as the one house guest who refuses to see any good in the whole situation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Camp","review":"House on Haunted Hill is classic camp at its best and lots of fun to watch over and over. Don't get it if you're looking for scares though 'cause you won't fine any! The five stars are for zany acting, bad dialog, rediculous special effects, hilariously dated soundtrack, and of course, the character Nora's scream. She screams and screams again and then yet again. And then she turns right around and makes a matter of fact statement as if she didn't have a care in the world. Best lines: \\"Scotch and;\\" \\"Darling, the only ghoul in this house is you!;\\" Did she say Lance is gone? Gone where?\\" Of course, Carol Ohmart, who plays Vincent Price's beautiful wife (Out of nowhere, \\"I'm Annabelle Loren\\") gets to scream too and boy does she get to scream! Don't miss this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not As Much Fun As The Remake, But...","review":"The original House on Haunted Hill isn't quite as much fun as the ultra-gory remake, but it's still a good spookfest. When the movie is over, you realize that it is quite different from the remake. It's more of a Hitchcockian thriller than a supernatural thriller. It's very clever with it's share of frights. And Vincent Price gives a delicious performance that is probably the best performance I've seen from him. Actually, the whole cast is good. See it if you are a fan of classic horror. I still favor the remake, though, I guess because I saw it first and have seen it many times over the years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old AND spooky","review":"It might be a bit dated now...but back when I was a child this movie made me wet my pants!

However, all is not as it seems. Price, as always, is wonderful and adds some much needed class to this substandard outing, which basically consists of the cast wandering from room to room, delivering bad dialogue and reacting hysterically to tired haunted house cliches.

To this day, some 30 years later, I still remember that movie. Like Psycho, where you never feel safe again in the shower, The House has forever stayed with me. Vincent Price was such an impressive actor, his voice alone can scare the wits out of you. This movie is a classic and one that will stick to your ribs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun to watch camp classic","review":"I find this movie fun to watch. It is not in the least scarey, but is campy. The plot is simple: a millionaire, played by Vincent Price, invites five strangers to spend the night in a haunted house. Any survivors get $10,000. His beautiful wife has her own plans for the night. There is much sreaming, a bloodstain that won't go away, a vat of acid, and other things and events that should be scarey, but aren't.

I'm sure if you buy this from Amazon, you'll be fine. I just thought I'd better let Australasian readers know that they should avoid the Mira Entertainment DVD release of HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL as you can't hear a thing. I had to turn the volume on my TV and DVD player up to max, and I still couldn't hear it. This really annoyed me as I'm a huge Vincent Price fan.

This is a great Halloween movie for young and old. It's stars Vincent Price and lots of creepy atmosphere(something that is missing from so many new horror films)and it is also lots of fun. Castle seemed to always make fun horror films with a couple of good scares despite very small budgets he made very effective ones too.There are many releases for this film and the one I am reviewing is the 1999 release that has both widescreen and full screen versions of the film. The only extra is the trailer, but the trailer and the film are in very nice condition with clear picture and sound. If you are looking to add this film to your collection this is the way to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"These are no good against the dead, only the living.","review":"This William Castle/Vincent Price thriller classic will satisfy fans of both old black & white horror films and those who dig Vincent Price movies.Price plays a wealthy bored type whose wife is only around for his loot. He throws a party for \\"her\\" - inviting a mixed bag of a gang who could use the $10,000 he promises them all: the catch? Just stay the night... Along the way they'll have to avoid basement holes full of acid, blind, weird maids scurrying around in the dark and other assorted chills.Remade & re-imagined in 1999, the new version is a flashy more disturbing romp starring Geoffrey Rush and Famke Jannsen as the psychotically bored, overly blinged couple. However, the wacky original contains lots of scary goodies. It's perfect for those who like good old fashioned frights!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So glad I ordered this DVD","review":"This DVD played beautifully, no skips or pauses on any frames.

Several remakes have been done since then. What was striking for me is that without Vincent Price this film would just have fallen flat. With him, it is a horror classic. The producers and director were smart in their casting decisions.The story revolves around a rich, bored millionaire who will give 5 people $10,000 each if they can stay in a haunted house over-night. Naturally, bad things start to happen when the doors are locked from the outside and the guests cannot escape.It is not bloody or gory; rather, it relies on suspense and tension- much is left up to the viewer's imagination.

I'm sorry to offend any \\"Classic!\\" criers out there but it's true. There is a good premise here, and yes it was well filmed, lighted and edited. Acting was good on the parts of principle charecters. But overall this movie really lacks. For as much as a ghost movie that people claim this too be, it really isn't. And I almost kicked my Television when I saw a charecter at the end proclaim \\"Now there are more ghosts to join the other seven.\\" Puh-Leeze! As if those other seven even made a cameo appearence! The remake is bad too, but at least it's one up on this movie by offering one or two eerie shots and scenes.Bottom line, not worth the price or even the almost hour and half it takes to watch it....wait a tick!

Also, they do not represent themselves in a straight forward manner. They should state in the description of the film who they are, what they do, what rights they have and then give a synopsis of the film itself.

Basically this opera requires great voices and there are NONE present in this recording. You are better off getting the Paris recording of the opera with Samuel Ramey, June Anderson and Alain Vanzo. At least all of those singers are great voices who do justice to this score. I seriously do NOT recommend this recording to anyone who wants to enjoy this magnificent opera.

Not respected by many in the industry probably for no other reason than their name sounds violent, this band will be looked at by future generations as nothing short of brilliant. One more thing: I grew up listening to bands like Sepultura, Slayer and Metallica. These bands and basically all bands like them haven't put out any decent material in over ten years.

The main character in Truck seems loosely based on Dunn's own childhood. The characters are compellingly physical-- they do things that real people do, like check their pits for smell, that people in books rarely do. They are polymorphously perverse.

But for those moderate and beginning floyd fans that are interested in more than just the mainstream floyd, or for any syd barrett fan, this album is essential.This is an early look at the singles of Pink Floyd, which were vastly different than the albums. It was almost as if The floyd were two different groups. On one hand you had pop(the singles) and on the other you had experimental freedom. This led to much stress at some venues, as the live floyd was much more the album floyd than the singles floyd. There are stories of the band being pelted with coins by angry crowds that came to hear arnold layne and see emily play, and instead got 20 minute and half hour experimental jam sessions.Dont miss this opportunity to hear a young and vibrant Pink Floyd, with Syd in the height of his powers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks home-made","review":"Disappointed with this product, it is big and shapeless.

The one we see is of a beautiful blonde sitting down in a rocker with a baby. What we need to see is a photo of a pregnant mother standing up wearing the gown. The only good thing I can say about this gown is that the fabric is soft. However, it is just a long, shapeless hospital gown that happens to tie in the front instead of in the back. I feel like a frumpy old lady when I put it on. I can't see myself wearing this nightgown during labor or after giving birth. It should be sold as a front tie muu muu.

Of all the textbooks I have read-this is clearly the worst. The authors don't spend any time to make the material coherent and organized. They seem to have published this book just for the sake of establishing their names in the field. It is basically a collection of research papers on the subject. The worst part of the book is that the authors use excessive verbiage to describe extremely inportant concepts with little or no mathematics. This leaves the readers confused and disoriented. This book is not for those looking for an introductory text and is useless to even those experienced in the field. Avoid this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another student prospective","review":"The comments left are interesting in that all the people teaching from it find it useful, and all the students find it frustrating...there is a trend here!I agree that the explanations are great in detail and the content practical, but at a graduate level with minimal support from the professor and no TA available, not having examples or solutions (to the odds or evens at the very least) is infuriating. After spending close to $100 for this text, I had to go out to buy another with some problems to make it through my course. Two stars for readability, will pile the other three onto the review for my other text.If a professor recommends this book for his course, my suggestion would be to go talk to some fellow students who have already taken the course to be sure you know what you are signing up for!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Adequate at best","review":"I really tried to learn the finite element method by reading this book in great detail and is why I bought this book for an introduction Finite Element class. The organization and notation of symbols of the book was very odd, and therefore made it hard to read. Rather than talking about the theory first, the authors first state the equations, and then talk about \\"remarks\\" on the equations and underlying theory. The book contains very easy and introductory examples and problems, not practical examples that would help in the computer implementation of finite elements. For example, the book does not contain any examples on how to compute the stresses and strains from interconnected finite elements (which would help greatly when you want to write your own finite element program). Overall, a very confusing and brief presentation of the topics. I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an undergraduage text","review":"This book was used to 'introduce' us to finite element analysis. To say the least, the book is very hard to follow. For an undergraduate text book, I don't recommend it at all. The problems are very difficult and assume you have a lot of knowledge on other subjects. Also there are close to no examples. This would be a great book for graduate classes or those seriously interested in the theory, but not for the intro introductory class, unless you have a super great professor. Because of my bad experience with the book, and how I found it difficult to grasp, I give it only two stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book for engineer who is new in finite element","review":"This book gives a very good explanation in finite element especially for engineer.

Now the pink shorts are one of the best things about this movie, I love the campiness of Wang yu's fimls, and the pink shorts did hit the spot. Other than that, I just got this really bad stomach ache while watching this, but when you press stop it goes away, so for health reasons, do not watch this. If you wanna see a good Jimmy Wang Yu movie, go and get the Original One-armed boxer where he loses his arm, now that is a GOOD movie, not great, but rates like a 7/10, now this movie is a 0.5/10, so if you like to evaluate how bad movies are, you will be takingn a lot of notes during this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing logbook, especially in its log design","review":"I was very disappointed with the Runner's Training Diary, particularly with the \\"log\\" portion of the book.

I love that I can see the whole week on a 2 page spread, and I love the one page summary of the miles for the year. I also love the places in the back to record shoe mileage, races, PR's, etc. The only downside is that I sometimes want to write more details about the day, and the space provided only allows for a few inches of writing for each day. However, I think the benefits of seeing the entire week on the 2 page spread outweighs the downside of this. I just have to summarize more.

Regardless of your normal musical tastes, you will find something on this album to relish (and mostly likely, the whole album). Holly Cole is a powerful and musical singer. Her vocals are crisp, clean, and precise. Cole has a wonderful voice: soulful at times, popish at others, but always sexy and seductive. She sings with a tremendous dynamic range, a refreshing change from the so often over amplified and \\"processed\\" singers of today. Cole demonstrates her versatility on this album with a variety of sounds from the soulful ballads, to the pop sound jazz renditions. If you like music, you will love this album. It is a fine sample of true musicality. If you like Jazz, then your collection should not be without this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lot of wasted talent","review":"What a great voice!

Though it would not seem to require this many pages to refute a self-refuting position, the author along the way makes acute observations on the culture of American academic philosophy that seem little changed in the 30 years since it was written. The final pages contains one of the most beautiful paeans to philosophy ever written. This is a clever, insightful, amusing and lovely work that has received far too little attention. And strangest of all, it turns out that the author writes elsewhere under the pen name \\"John Norman\\"--author of the \\"Gor\\" fantasy novels. But don't let that dissuade you! Read this book!

It was always on my list of books to read, but I had never reached it until recently, when my interest was sparked by a comment made by David McCullough (the author of the great biography of Truman) that this book greatly influenced him when he read it as a very young man. It is a a beautifully written book --- prose as good as any I have ever read. Dana's accurate and detailed narrative of his own life at sea on sailing ships in the 1830's, and his time spent on the coast of California,when it was true wilderness, is an unforgettable reading experience. The book has a personal intimate quality about; it is as if the author is a friend writing to you from abroad about his extraordinary adventure. This book deserves its esteemed place in American and world literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated classic","review":"After finishing this book, I am amazed that this book is not more prominent in famous literature. Much of US and Sailing history can be learned through this true firsthand account of a Harvard student gone temporary salty dog. I am not from California or even the west coast but still found the stories contained throughout the book fascinating. Dana did an excellent job of describing the life at sea in the early 1800's without a moment of boring reading. I would recommend (and have been recommending) this book to anyone and everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Journey of life and the power of the sea","review":"I read this book after reading some poetry by Pablo Neruda, in which he sparked a renewed love for the sea and its mysteries within me. This story is about a boy reaching manhood and the battle that he fights within himself, and the battle without against man and the unrelenting power of nature. At points it is difficult reading if one is not familiar with ships of the 1830's and 1840's, but that is part of it. He too had to learn and adapt to his situation; he was entering into a world new and unknown. It is concurrent with London's stories of struggle because it is not crowded with the survival of the fittest motif but rather it paints this very struggle without the preaching. I thoroughly enjoyed the book and the full circle ending. He returns to the world he once conquered to find that it is no longer the same place that he left it and he is now on a different journey."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Escape From today's woes","review":"I am rereading this book for the third time and now realise why - it is a great way to escape today's world and relive a time which will never be repeated when plains mountains and valleys were mysterious places full of adventure because they were totally unknown uncharted and uninhabited. The wold has changed to the extent that we seldom enjoy our natural environment and are locked into the digital revolution with all its quick fixes.

He offers us a marvelous view of a land that no longer exists. An intimate view of a sailor's life in its exciting - and mundane - details. I read it as an adult and/but I think this is the book they should give kids to read in high school literature classes. A book that shows life for the adventure that it can be. Not always easy, of course, but always an adventure. I recommend that you relax with it, take you time, go there. You can trust Richard Henry Dana.

Although the actual writing of the book is excellent, conveying wonderfully the flavor and character of the times as well as the vanity of the monarchs and suitors, the plot ends abruptly with a tragic ending. Aside from altogether disliking tragedies, I found this ending a surprising disappointment because the book gave very little indication of the horrific climax which was to come. After finishing the last page, I almost felt as though I had finished reading two separate books - a romance and a tragedy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Warning! Don't read the reviews that follow -- they spoil the plot!","review":"Don't read any of the following reviews unless you've already read Kenilworth. Scott deliberately withholds from the reader key facts (facts which all of the following reviews reveal) until well after the plot has started. Anyway, I've been on a Sir Walter Scott binge recently and, of the three Scott novels I've read -- Ivanhoe, Quentin Durward and this -- I'd place this book well above Ivanhoe but equal to Quentin Durward. It takes place in Elizabethan England; it has some sword fights; it's fairly funny in parts; the plot creaks only occasionally.

The client comes with no presets or Netgear specific advantages. It is just as tedious to setup as any other client including free ones like TheGreenBow and Shrew. It does not work with Vista 64bit. I see no reason why this client which has been around for MANY years should be an added cost, or why there is not a Netgear specific client that could work with Netgear hardware. In any event, not a happy camper. To be fair I will say that if and when you get it connected it is a solid client- and also that I have never had it crash on me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably bad","review":"Whoever produced this software seems to have missed the point. There is no point in havng one VPN client on your machine that limits you to just being able to use that one client.

Luckily, I have an XP computer I can fail to get it to work on. (I can't fail on the Vista computer since it won't even install).Needless to say, I'm somewhat disappointed.

You can understand why I salivated when I saw that a paperback edition of this mammoth collection of Dickinson's letters was available for only $8.93 -- far less than the expensive hardcover edition. Well, once again the adage of getting what you pay for is proved true. The book that arrived in the mail contains a small portion of the complete correspondence, and the format is not reader-friendly. No footnotes, not even a clear demarcation between the text of the letters and any explanatory information. Out-of-date is the kindest way to describe this edition.

It is a large-format (approx. 8 1/2 x 11) paperback book and is bound like most paperbacks.As with all Dover Editions, it is very easy to read and follow the music, but it was not designed as a performing score.

It's loaded with genre shifts, catchy riffs, keyboard couter-melodies (reminds me on what would be \\"heavy Doors\\"), loads of time signature changes (something I love), vocals switching between strong, controlled and melodic to an immense roar - all very Patton, although sometimes too Patton, but it doesn't bother as much as most nu-metal Patton wannabes; dark but colourful lyrics: and the whole thing mounts up to an amazing atmosphere that has you hooked, there's not a dud song on the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY???","review":"This is just a bad album pure and simple...

Now, after not using it for about 4 months (the batteries removed for safe storage) the unit will not lock onto satellites regardless of how long it's left on or despite performing soft and hard resets. The built-in Lowrance software on it is actually newer than what's on the latest Lowrance software update page - which makes no sense at all. Lowrance's minimum repair rate is $149.95 plus shipping since the 1 year warrenty has expired!! I might as well buy a new GPS - a non-Lowrance unit this time!

Aided by topo mapping software, this device will lead you to any spot you want. To get the same features in other brands, you would have to spend more money. Also, the car adapter comes with the device whereas it is a separate purchase in other brands. We have used it extensively and never had a problem. It acquires the satellites quickly and keeps the signal under adverse conditions such as tree cover. The only small problem is that the road map overlay may be off in some areas by several yards. This is not a big concern since it's the topographical accuracy that is important.

Overall this movie is empty! Character development is horrible, that acting is \\"woody\\" and empty. They could have done this true story justice with a better script. Lame sub-plots throughout. Very weak overall. Just poor quality as far as a movie. Redemption (not)!!: The image quality is amazing. The computer effects and ocean are truly incredible and a breakthrough in cgi, although you have to be bored out of your mind for about an hour and a half before you get to see them. It was just too bad. The hype made it sound great, but in reality....VERY LAME. Don't buy this movie...It is only worth a rental , if that. You'll never watch it again.

I was excited to see this film for the special effects and expected to put up with the usual cliches- but my god!

The actual effects are great, all 20 minutes of them, but skip the rest of the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Near Perfect Movie","review":"Having been to Gloucester many times, I think that this movie gives you an accurate depiction of the New England fishing town. I have now have a more deeper appreciation of what these fishermen, these \\"Gloucestermen\\" go through - the hard work, dedication, and their love for the sea. George Clooney's acting is good, but the lack of a true Bostonian accent, despite the fact that his character states that he's lived there his whole life, was obvious. Mark Wahlberg, on the other hand, being from the area, was perfectly cast, in my opinion, and did a great job. The music, well, it's by James Horner. What more can you say? It's perfect. You will learn a lot about the New England Fishing industry by watching this movie. It's a very poignant movie about sacrifice, love, families and man versus the sea. Very touching, set against a background of the beautiful New England coast. Good flick."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Plot and BAD Acting","review":"This movie had to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. There is no plot. There is no character development. This movie is riddled with some of the worst acting I've ever seen. Don't waste your money. Visual effects are okay, but do not make up for lack of plot and lack of acting. There is no story.

This is also an issue with netflix, though there is more progress there than in amazon by at least have caption on most of their movies and tv shows and Spanish audio for 5 films out of their many selection.

Has Hollywood no shame? There are so many factual inacuracies and utter implausibilities that they can't all be listed here. And the cheesy background music destroys whatever excitment the well done visual effects might generate. The only positive thing that can be said is at least George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg LOOK right for their perspective parts. But they are given lines of dialog so unbelievably hokey and cliched that you almost feel sorry for them as actors.Bottom line is if you loved the book, stay far FAR away from this totally disrespectful farce."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the perfect movie.....","review":"This was among the dumbest movies I've ever seen. The plot lacks any point, and, aside from the special effects, has nothing remotely interesting about it. It is basically about a group of the stupidest fishermen in the whole eastern seaboard who realize they don't have any money, so, decide to go on a fishing expedition even though they get 1000's of hints that sailing their course would be suicide. But being truly idiotic, they go right to the place where the 4 largest hurricanes on record are about to collide in search of more fish. (Even the fish they seek would be more clever than these stooges and the twits who directed this film.) The only part of this movie that's truly sad is the fact that it takes itself perfectly seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love this movie","review":"I don't understand the negative reviews, sure there's some weaknesses in this film but I consider it one of my top ten, although I would have preferred little more in depth look at Gloucester.

A script full of cheap cliches, George Clooney's monochromatic acting, idiotic dialog, and mawkish score do not add up to a good movie.

Anyway, the movie was a whole bunch of water sloshing around for two hours. Next time I want to do that, I'll get in a hot bath tub and have a slosh fest. The movie could have been summed up like this; the guys went out in boats (cause that's what they do); they got caught in a storm (cause that's what happens in the movies); ...I definitely prefer sloshing in my bath tub because I don't even have to drown at the end of the slosh."},{"rating":"1","title":"World's worst story and movie . . . .","review":"Why would anyone make a movie or write a story of a bunch of guys who think to themselves 'this storm is really bad and we'll probably die if we go and try and catch fish in this storm but heck, let's try anyway' . . . then they all die . . . end of movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A PERFECT MOVIE!","review":"A really great film.

It's a real eye-opener when it comes to these issues - \\"species vs. people's lives.\\" This goes for logging, fishing, and any other occupation that harvests nature for the benefit of humankind. It does nag at my conscious as a biologist - what are we to do? Save the species, or the people? Or is this a false dilemma? Are people adaptable enough to find work in a different field? Some logging towns are drying up - they are in an economic slump.

I really enjoyed this film and watching the bonus features to see just how difficult it was to make, made me appreciate it that much more. It isn't without its flaws thou. The whole background story of love, looking for love, and flirting was very cheesy. The relationship between Diane Lane & Mark Wahlberg was necessary, the rest was not, such as hearing his thoughts before he's about to drown in the ocean... come on! I also didn't like the supposition as to what happened on the ship during their finally voyage. Did Sully and Murph really fight? The rogue wave? The shark? We don't know and neither does the author, it was just Hollywood getting in the way again, but overall I did like the movie and really appreciate how hard it was to actually make."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving Story","review":"I used to live in Boston for a while and would drive out to the small surrounding towns to sight see. The first thing that hit me about this movie is what an awesome job the cast and crew did of capturing this subculture. It had a very authentic look and feel. I felt like I was there.I've seen this movie many times now and am always moved by it. You know what's going to happen, yet it still hits me the same way each time. The writers and the cast do such a good job of making these people relatable so that you feel like you know them. You care. It's a sad story, but a wonderfully told one. It's definitely not for everybody. If you're looking for non-stop action, you might find it slow and boring.

The waves were cool to look at but I'll never understand the stupidity of the sailors in this movie. I don't know the real story but they must've been insane if they really tried to get back in the midst of 3 storms. I also ust don't really understand fishermen at all. I live in Alaska and I hear of fishermen who die in the Bearing Sea all the time and I just can't understand why anyone would want to be a fisherman, especially up here where it's so dangerous, when there are so many other jobs out there that offer a world of oportunity. That was the main reason why i didn't like this movie. It was also very predictable all throughout. Rent it first.

By the time the storm hit, I didn't care if the characters made it or not. The character development was almost non-existent, they could have used cardboard cutouts instead of real actors. The early part of the movie reminded me of Armageddon in the way that it tried to give a glimpse of the characters everyday home life. I feel that both movies failed miserably, with The Perfect Storm being the worse of the two.I would only rate this movie 1 star, except for the very nice 5.1 channel surround sound. If you want a movie to show off your home theatre system, this one will do a good job. However, if you want a good movie to go along with the surround sound try The Matrix, or T2."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome movie","review":"i like this movie....a lot of action and it keeps you interested the whole time!! very glad i got it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Twister meets titanic","review":"This is a all around good movie.

It stars a great ensemble cast (one of the best in recent years), tells a powerful and moving story, and contains some of the most realistic Mother Nature special effects of all time. However, the title of this film is THE PERFECT STORM and as much as you might like George Clooney or any of the other fine actors in this cast, they aren't the stars. The storm is the star. That's not bad, but it does mean that the other characters aren't going to be as fleshed out as they would be otherwise. This movie also has a wonderful and useful moral, something that is becoming more and more rare in today's movies. Not only is It a good safety message for summer play the moral also sums up the movie; the moral: wear your life jacket."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Perfect Mess","review":"The Perfect Storm was a terrific read - factual, intense, and mostly fluid. Where the book does right by the real people depicted, the movie goes overboard (sorry) with melodrama and invention. Characters are added out of whole cloth, plot lines are cut and pasted into each other, until the movie ends up with only the barest resemblance to the book. Now, I'm not one to say that every movie based on a book has to be an exact replica - but this thing was a well-documented true story! The acting is overwrought, the plot is jumbled, and the true stories that made up the meat of the book are sliced and diced into a typical, easy-to-digest bland Hollywood \\"adventure\\" movie. George Clooney deserves kudos for not trying (too hard) to lay on the [phony] Boston accent that the rest of the cast has poured on thick."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Movie Was the worst peice of ...

Soon I found myself yawning and looking at my watch wondering when the thing would be over.I can't say the acting was poor, it was fair.

The movie takes a while to get going, it spends the first hour setting up the characters and telling us about them. When the storm finally hits the film turns into a non stop action film. The action scenes in this movie are astounding to watch, mainly because of the awesome computer generated waves.

A great dissapointment after Peterson's previous work.The only impression I got was that the fishermen deserved exactly what they got.

People in the real world don't talk or behave the way these people do, so watching it is a laughable bore. Even the much hyped special effects aren't convincing. Save your time.

The plot was initially promising, but once that vessel took to the high seas and encountered the \\"Storm\\" it became repetitive and monotonous.In addition, the ending held no realism for me at all. As a matter of fact, it was one of times you fully expect the movie to shift to an entirely different scene in order to achieve some sort of closure. Instead you are left with that \\"Is that the END?\\" feeling.Graphics were great of course, and very realistic.

The DVD has three different commentary tracks - for people like me, who love this stuff, this is the most important thing. There is also a really fascinating movie about the making of the movie - I am usually oblivious to special effects for their own sake but I thought these were really interesting.As for the film itself it is more interesting than I had expected. There is something fascinating about the story that goes behind its simple plot. Something I can't articulate. I think it's a great movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"water water everywhere","review":"god, this movie was awful! i hoped at least for an interesting special effects movie, but it was so hopelessly cut and spliced that the effects weren't even effective. as for the so-called story, there wasn't any, except a half hour of cliched set-up. this movie is a How Not To - a story that could have been a seagoing \\"apollo 13\\" was instead less interesting than a long does of the weather channel."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Perfect Waste Of Time!","review":"This movie did not work...the story of \\"please don't go out to sea\\" drowned out all of the action and suspense in the movie. It was too bad that the movie had to go in that \\"pretending to be emotional\\" direction. All it did was turn the movie into a mess. Had they left out all of the forced drama between girlfriends and boyfriends, the pacing of the movie would have actually worked and the movie would not have been half bad. Wolfgang Peterson has done such better works than this. It is clear that the forced emotion was done to meet the expectations of summer blockbuster movie fans, I would love to see a \\"deleted nonsense\\" version of this on dvd, but it will never happen, so I give it 1 star for special effects, which were at least impressive."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Perfect Cure For Insomnia","review":"Let's take a natural disaster movie and mix it with a boring story line and see what we get...Nothing!

I am an AVID movie buff and this was the first time ever that i fell asleep in the theater. The special effects were beautiful and thats it! The acting was dull which went perfectly with the storyline. This movie should sink to the bottom of the sea!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hello, George and Mark are in it... of course it's a good movie!","review":"This is a great movie. George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg star in the movie as two fishermen that need to make a living. This is a very suspensful movie that takes place in Gloucster,Massachusetts. The fishermen recently come back off the sea and then learn that they must go back out on the Andria Gail ( the ship ). Little do they know...a hurricane is coming straight at them. They don't want to waist all the fish they have cought. They decide to drive through the storm. Sadly there is a 100 foot wave heading straight for them. You'll have to buy the movie to see the ending. This movie is based on a true story that actually happened in 1991 in Glouscter, Massachusetts. Fans of Mark Wahlberg and George Clooney should definetley buy this movie. ENJOY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Special effects, But....","review":"This movie had really good special effects, as when the waves were hitting the boat. They were bad when it involved the helicopter or the Satori. The character development in this movie was so aweful and the way they portrayed most of the characters was wrong because if you read the book most of the characters were very different such as Chrissy and the mother of Bobby had fights over the mothers boyfriend and that is why she moved out. The other bad point of the movie was the dialogue, there was none. The interaction between the people didn't go. The lines, if you listen closely, didn't go with what the other person even talks about. Released the 30th of June, this movie grossed 182 Million Dollars. This movie will get you addicted if you watch it but watch it a second time and you will see the mistakes in character development and dialogue. My advice Read The Book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"This movie was so hyped that I came to it with the expectation of a really fine work of art. Unfortunately, that's not what I got. As tragic as this movie was, I didn't feel sorry for these fishermen. They knew the horrible combined storm that was brewing and went out in it anyway. They risked their lives for a load of swordfish? Talk about people who need to set their priorities straight!"},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst movie ever made","review":"this movie is by far the worst movie ever made.....everything about it is poor. i can't believe this was directed by the same guy that directed das boot. go figure that out. i guess we have to blame him since he is in charge. poor performances by all actors involved and the all time worst fit for a music score. james horner should be sent to his room without his synth, orchestral baton and no dinner. talk about purple syrup.......there is a bright side though, if you watch this flick (and i do mean flick ) you should turn the sound down and play some music you like. otherwise you have to witness these hard, tough , monster fishermen acting like they have just been to a new age seminar on male sensitivity.... forget the seminar guys and just drink some more beer and celebrate your scar tissue. WHATEVER.....avoid this one like no other."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Good and The Bad","review":"The Good:Not much is good here. Two words sums it up just right, \\"Special Effects.\\" Thats all for the good.The Bad:Why is it that no directer can successfully turn a book into a movie. Yes, I realize you cant include everything from the book, but come on. This movie is a absolute mockery of an adaption and an insult to my intelligence. Everything that was good from the book was left out or changed in the movie. Just another example of Hollywood dumbing down the script so that people can be entertained. The irony is that the story the book tells is far more interesting and exiting then this discrace of a movie. Ok, if you want make a movie about this subject, fine, but dont call it \\"The Perfect Storm,\\" and dont adapt the movie from a excellent book. Call it something else, call it \\"The Big Storm\\" or \\"The Perfect Disaster\\" because that is what this movie is, a disaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vaguely Interesting","review":"The special effects and the Coast Guard rescues are the only features of this film worth watching.

As it is, it rather crawls along and you have to wonder where it's going."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Perfect Bore","review":"Is there some rule in Hollywood that states that all ocean disaster epics have to have sophmoric scripts? They would have been better off calling this film \\"Titantic II\\" because of the simply awful \\"Cameronesque\\" dialog. The special effects aren't that impressive either, because after a while the endless scenes of massive waves become so commonplace it gets boring looking at them. I can't believe that the man who directed the great \\"Das Boot\\" twenty years ago has managed to sink so low. Read the book instead and avoid turning your mind into jello by watching this perfectly awful excuse for a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"To all of the boaters out there be prepared to be insulted. For anyone who has been out in bad seas, this movie will make you laugh. What ever happened to life preservers? How about the plot - WEAK! If you want to see some of the best special effects for waves, than watch it but you will not be able to watch it twice. Oh yeah, they go out in the worst time of the year for weather and never once listen to the weather. Than they drive right into because the fish will spoil. DUH! The real people who were in this situation are turning in their graves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Movie - Anti-climactic","review":"This movie got so much publicity and such good reviews I was so anxious to see this movie that I purchased a pre-release of the DVD. After receiving it and watching it with my family I was very disappointed in this film. The movie can be summarized as, they go fishing, storms roll in, and they all die. Very little excitement and no heroism. I strongly advise against purchasing this movie. If you are really interested in seeing this movie, I suggest renting it - however, you may also find that renting it is also a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Booorrrriiinng!!","review":"This simply is not a good film. There have been TV programs about this particular storm which I found much more engaging. I have to admit that the special effects where impressive but hollywood has to learn that there is more to movie making than this. By about half way through I realised that I was just never going to care about the characters or the storm, I just wanted the film to be over."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Film Maker of \\"Das Boot\\" Also Made THIS?!?","review":"This is one of the worst films hubby and I have seen in awhile. We were all primed for greatness too knowing that Wolfgang Petersen, who had made our all time favorite high seas adventure, at a fraction of the cost, was at the helm. To say this is not \\"Das Boot\\" is like saying George Clooney is not Tom Cruise. The soundtrack was grating beyond belief, oozing sentimentality and mawkishness. The writing was corny and, boy, they laid on the maudlin element with the women folk with a trowel. Then there are the actors. I know Mark Wahlberg can do better but I think I have given up on ever seeing George Clooney act anything but handsome on the big screen. Fortunately, I got this at my library for free so I didn't waste any money on it. I have the book and I hear it is terrific so I think I will simply wait until this disaster passes from my mind and then read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst movie of 2000","review":"this was the worst movie i saw in 2000.

I saw it on home video and I walked away and came back toward the end when the people actually went out toward the sea. I'm sorry but this movie wasn't that good. Maybe you can see this movie in the afternoon when your bored or you don't have anything else better to do. Like take a nap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perfectly Awful","review":"If you thought tv fishing shows were boring, just wait until you see this film. The first part of the film is a pathetic attempt at character development. Mr. Nice guy loves his wife and Son despite separation. Mr. Ugly guy finally finds love. Mr. 2nd Lead has a girlfriend much too nice for a trawlerman and she is setting up home for them. None of this made me care one bit whether any of them lived or died. The second part contains the worst special effects I've ever seen. Just in case you still don't care about the boat crew, they throw in some dumb helicopter pilots; I cared about them even less. Worst movie ever. I just hope some fool buys this from me on an auction site."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Felt Cheated","review":"While technically I thought the movie was well done, and the special effects were quite impressive, I came away from the film feeling that it had somehow insulted the memory of the crew of that doomed long liner. When you get to the end movie, and realise that in reality there were no survivors, you are forced to acknowledge that everything which is purported to have happened on the boat, before and during the storm, is nothing but a figment of someone's imagination. The words and actions, depicted as being those of the crew, are nothing but subtefuge and imagery created just for dramatic effect. Were one of my relatives to have been lost on that unhappy boat, I would be incensed by the liberties this movie takes."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Film About Stupid People","review":"A well made movie with very good special effects.

That's the best part, and you have to wait two hours to see it. And while you wait, you have to sit and listen to horrific dialogue, watch a bunch of sailors curse and fight each other, and see a bunch of New Englanders sit around a TV and watch hurricane coverage on the local news.

I mean, the actors looked so much like real fishermen, I could practically smell them. Then they opened their mouths... The dialogue in this movie is so bad, it's hilarious. I grew up in a small fishing community: my father fished, my brothers fished, my neighbours fished. It cracks me up to picture the lot of them, on a fishing boat, cheering,\\"Let's fish!\\" like a bunch of high school football players.

Or so I thought.(spoiler alert)They all die. Having chatted at work around the water cooler, it seems I'm the only person who didn't know this. However, that dramatically affected my view of the film - after investing my emotional energy into 'how are they going survive this?', they don't. They die. And I felt like I'd wasted 2 hours of my life watching it.Incidentially, how can this be based on a 'true life' novel if no one survived to tell the story?"},{"rating":"1","title":"George Clooney es muy macho!","review":"I'm just glad I didnt actually pay full price to see this in the theatres because it flat out sucked. George Clooney is too cool for school in this film. His character is irritating and filled with testosterone, but then again...arent all his characters? Marky Mark is o.k., but too much of a woos in this movie. The other guys did this bonding thing midway in the movie which was so pathetic it made me choke on my popcorn. All in all a horrendous movie. Instead of buying or renting this movie. Go out and go for a nice walk and treat yourself to some ice cream."},{"rating":"1","title":"No real Content and Casting wrong","review":"Do the words, Predictable, and overacting ring a bell?...This movie was terrible. George Clooney is still trying to be a serious actor but can't shake off the same predictable acting he used effectively in ER, but gets annyoing in this movie. He is not even believable as a ship captain.....This Movie made money the same reason, Jurrasic Park's the Lost World and Independence day etc made theirs, for Special effects. Great special effects in the storm sequences, but everything is predictable and the director tried to bring it all together in the end which was even dragged out further. My word of Advice: Dont buy this piece of garbage or rent it. This was a waste of my time...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly Disappointing","review":"Critics made this movie out to be the greatest thing in the world. What movie did they see. Some of the scenes were laughable. Mark Whalburg still hasn't convinced me as an actor and George Clooney is just awful.

Do you hate films that have no intelligence? This movie is one you should stay away from. Not only is it overly cheesey, but it will make you stupid. (More stupid if you liked it). They try to tie in sentimental sub-plots, but they don't make sense. A kid cries, which is the most pathetic child-acting job in the world. It's not the kid's acting that is at fault, but the writer and director for letting it happen. They make these people out as heros. HEROS. Ok, whatever. Nothing is real, all tid-bits of dialog are dumbed down for the lower intelligence, for that's how movies make money. A good pointer to add is that the director did NOT use one REAL swordfish during the making of this. Did you think Air force One was stupid? This is worse. Good day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great effects, but no story to keep you involved...","review":"Like I said in the title of this review, there wasn't much of a story to keep you interested in this movie. There were great special effects but you have to wait until the end of the movie to see them, it seems like the script was written so that all of the characters could develop relationships with someone so that once you've seen the end you're supposed to be sad, but the plot develpment seems so deliberate that you don't really care. There isn't that much that happens in between the beginning and end to really move the picture. There isn't very much depth given to the characters to really care for them.

He has breathed life into films such as Air Force One and Troy. This film, however, was still dead and not breathing upon release. The music is beautiful.

Oh, if only it did. Clooney and Wahlberg are wasted talents in this film about a group of fishermen that get caught in a severely powerful storm. To be sure, the storm scenes sound great on DVD; this is a good movie with which to show off your sound system. But the effects, which get redundant after a few minutes, look and feel fake (almost as fake as Diane Lane's Boston accent!). It's as though you're watching not a catastrophe at sea but a video game at a local arcade. Sometimes, digital effects, when overdone as they are here, can strip a film of its realness.

The main thrust of the book is how Eisenhower's decisions in WW II were made, and the tensions that existed in the USA/British alliance during the war. The Anvil/Dragoon controversy is given full length because it was one of the most contended points of the allaince. The fighting of the war is distinctly in the background. It isn't clear to me how much personal analysis David Eisenhower put into the fighting aspect of the book. In a number of places it seems that he relys on the historians. Because of this, I think that it is important to keep in mind that this probably isn't an important book in terms of military history, even though it is very important in terms of understanding the political aspects of the war.

Intelligent machines created by human beings will probably resemble human beings (see Hofstaders \\"Godel, Escher, Bach\\"). Erasmus was nasty, but not at all believable. The Titans were ridiculous. The sorceress of Rossak who is a main character is wooden in her obsessiveness. The only particularly interesting part of this book was the sections which describe the Zensunni on Arrakis.

Herbert and Anderson have produced \\"mainstream SF\\" -- decent characterization, interesting ideas, and adequate plot, but lacking the richness and brilliantly constructed framework of Dune. As other reviewers have mentioned, the authors practically bash you over the head with things they want you to \\"get,\\" rather than let you puzzle it out yourself like the inimitable Frank Herbert did.Bottom line: it's enjoyable enough for a bit of light reading, and for the game of exploring the possible history of the Dune universe, but don't expect anything nearly as good as the classic Dune series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Former Dune Fan","review":"OK - I am done with Dune. The original series, written by F. Herbert, was excellent - it was so well detailed and written that I could almost smell the spice. The Butlerian Jihad, however, has convinced me to move on. This work was poorly written, poorly thought out, and wordy instead of detailed; it was a silly book.The Titans, the evermind, the other thinking machines were all comic caricatures of what they could have been.

I am still reading it so this review does not touch on the story, but rather the lack of quality of proof-reading the Kindle version.It certainly seems to me that the publisher did not re-format the printed version, especially where individual words were hyphenated because of line spacing issues on the printed pages, so there are needless and distracting hyphenations throughout the book. Also, just today I ran across the words \\"for ward\\" when they really were intended to be \\"forward\\". This Kindle version of the book is full of errors and I certainly think that the publisher should subject the text to a word processor for formatting and possible grammar errors, but mostly for the bad hyphenation issues.I may come back and either amend this review or write a new review concerning the content of the book.

I was expecting an epic, tourtured narrative of mankinds near extermination a la Benford's \\"Great Sky River.\\" What I got was brains floating in jars, seriously. How 1950s sci-fi cliche is that? These poor plot choices combined with no real ending made this an agonizing read. I just never believed that THIS scenario created the Dune universe. This is a pulp novel of the disposable kind. Not a bad read in and of itself, but not really worthy of the Dune legacy. I'm going to pretend it didn't happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brain Candy/Cash Cow","review":"I found this book entertaining as opposed to the thought provoking work of Frank Herbert. Something I'd like to read on a plane or oil rig.Reads like a Micheal Crichton novel, fast paced, superficial character development and techno backdrop forced into a Dune framework. Like the House trilogy, this had the same prequel formula, parallel character development leading into a dramatic culmination of events at the end with enough (prequel) sequel nuclei scattered throughout. The obligatory philosophical chapter quote sprinkles started getting blase at the last few chapters.Origins of the Evermind and thinking machines reeked too much of Terminator's SkyNet execept SkyNet had more believeble storyline.Reading the book leaves me with the feeling that Herbert and Anderson are going to milk this cash cow for the next 4-5 years.Will I buy the next Legends of Dune? Sure, Dune's an addiction that I can't kick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very impressive.","review":"I was very disappointed by this book. I know Frank Herbert is dead, and these 2 writers have a different style, so I won't complain about that. The biggest problem I have with this is that the reason I liked Frank Herbert's Dune series is because of the focus on ideas--this book seems like nothing more than a space opera. The characters were all shallow and unsympathetic. Sure there was action, but this was just a page-turner--I mean, sure, it was well-written, but it was very formulaic and predictable. I'll say this--if you love Dune, get it, if not, your money is better spent elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as GOOD","review":"When all is said and done, nothing compares to the science fiction work of Frank Herbert. Try as many might, they can can not match his writing scheme. Untill now, that is. Brain and Kevin have done a great job with the prequels to the dune saga, by competing the house trilogy. But in my opion never did they grasp such a comprehenshin of the Dune universe, as they have in the new book Dune- Butlerian Jihad.

A lot smaller).So I got a copy of Dune and read it again. It is as good as I remember it. This book, on the other hand, is really, really, really bad.

There are also some inexplicably positive reviews. I'll keep mine short. The name 'Herbert' is on the front of the book but I suspect Brian Herbert had nothing to do with this series other than cashing in.

The subject matter is engrossing and the DUNE universe begs to be understood, but it seems that in fullfilling these requirements, the Authors have forgotten how to write.For a novel so full of action, the reader feels like s/he is somehow missing it.

You can read a sentence of each paragraph for most parts of the book and you will not miss a thing! I really don't understand why this book (and others in the series) where so long. And the epitaphs?

The beginning of the Spacing Guild and BG should be interesting as well. I am looking forward to this series. The writing is not as good as Frank Herbert and somewhat space opery, but reasonably well written, readable and enjoyable.

This is one of those. The authors suffer from a severe case of adjective-itis and try to blend way too many story lines and characters together. The characters are one dimensional and hard to identify with. The villians are cartoonishly evil, the science poor to non-existant and the military and battle scenes almost silly.The dialog is painfull and stilted, more like something from a Victorian melodrama than what we expect from modern Sci-Fi writers. The overall impression is something like a bad Sci-Fi movie from the '50's or the old Batman TV series. The only reason I can see that this drivel was published is because it carries the \\"Dune\\" chachet.

(Admittedly, history can change over millenia but back it up with some kind of rationale.) I had thought the three prequels to be the worst perversions I'd ever see; I was wrong.While I'd like to go on and on about how much I hate this book it just isn't worth it.

They continuously tell the back stories of the characters rather than showing them by their actions and interactions. When the story returns to the characters, the authors compound this failure by repeating the back stories.It's a shame the writing gets in the way of the story the authors try to tell. Generally, the story is not bad. There are a couple of occasions when characters respond in ways that seem excessively simple-minded; motivations do not always seem to match to response in the book.I would not encourage anyone who isn't already a Dune fan to pick this book up.

Looking back I wonder how much of that was just taking strong existing characters in new directions.In short I do not recommend this book to anyone other than an existing fan and only then to fill in some gaps.

These books have none of the subtlety or depth of Frank Herberts original books and they are filled with one dimensional plots and characters such as Rhomber \\"er\\" Vernius and Piter de Vries, this second example illustrating proof that the authors have not even read the originals, otherwise they would know that this character's name was in fact Piter de Vried! There are just so many inconsistancies as to make these books laugable if it wasn't so frustrating and a list of these inconsitancies could fill a book on their own. ...In summary where Frank Herberts novels were the pinnacle of the writers art, and perhaps one of the great feats of fiction this book and the the other preludes written by Brian Herbert/Kevin Anderson are in the absolute pit of pulp rubbish. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Outstanding","review":"The Legends of Dune trilogy is absolutely a great trilogy. I found it a little faster read than the original series, but this series still has its twists and provokes deep thinking as much as its founding series. The authors do an astounding job in showing the basis and beginnings of virtually everything in the original Dune series; from the founding of the Guild and the Sisterhood to the significance of the Atreides' hawk. This trilogy is a must read for any science fiction reader, and even more so for the Dune fan. I am not a big reader by any means, but this trilogy kept me turning pages.

I predicted the ending at about the 1/3 mark and after that not much surprised me or engaged me. Imagine killing a massive all powerful super computer with a virus! Oh man, how original!

The prequels, on the other hand, are standard-issue space opera. On their own, they're enjoyable, even though the characters are as wooden as an Al Gore speech. As part of the Dune universe, however, they fall on their face in a spectacular way. I've seen reviews where the prequels have been blasted and \\"disowned\\" by so-called Dune loyalists. Although I do not personally consider the recent books to be within the borders of Frank Herbert's fictional realm I must say to the aforementioned reviewers that you should consider that it IS fiction we are discussing here. As far as I'm concerned, the new ones are fun in a goofy sort of way, while the originals expanded my thinking, so who cares, really? It's still a win-win situation. Have fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Some books are hard to put down, this one was hard to pick up. It took me an exceptionally long time to read it because I found it to be such a disappointment. The original Dune introduced characters with depth. The dialogue was well written, you couldn't wait to see what happened next. The authors of this book have none of the imagination of Frank Herbert and should leave this fantasy genre to write sitcoms. I saw the second installment on the shelf at Barnes & Noble for 50% off, but I could not bring myself to buy it even at that price."},{"rating":"1","title":"By far the weakest Dune book","review":"I love very much the book Dune and its sequels. But this book is very different.

I couldn't get through it quickly enough and onto my next read. None of the complexity of Frank's work. To call the characters \\"two-dimensional\\" is being generous.Is there a synopsis of the following two books? I'd rather not endure the chore of actually reading them.You know what really scares me? Certainly not a moron like Erasmus. Rather, the fact that B&K; are writing two books to follow Chapterhouse. Let's hope they take some of the magic pixie dust that helped Frank come up with such awesome stuff and hopefully avoid the sophomoric tendencies that led to this drivel.But semi-seriously, I suspect the only reason serious Dune fans spend time on these pulp novels is that we are so hooked on the entire Dune universe that we will wade through the horrible writing just to find out \\"what happens\\".

More then satisfied with the transaction, will deal with the seller again without any reservations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dissapointing","review":"The Butlerian Jihad is not a worthwhile book within the Dune series. It takes away the magic of several of Dune's institutions by bringing a corny, trite story that is more suitable for a cheap soap opera than a prelude to the great Dune books. The previous trilogy by Frank Herbert's son had been very good, however I really do not know what went wrong on this one. The language is ghastly (trite phrases like \\"a silence that could speak volumes\\"), or very corny descriptons of a weak love story, weak plot and weak story line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overwritten","review":"Give this one a pass!

Doubt I'll finish it.2 stars for \\"has moments\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Sophomoric at its zenith","review":"Frank Herbert must be rolling over in his grave knowing the series he created has been so shamed. The Butlerian Jihad reads more like \\"Harry Potter and the Evil Robots\\" than anything remotely associated with Dune. The plot is weak, the dialog is forced. This single book should be an end to the story. Instead there are two more to plod through to get to the end. Laced with weak descriptions of characters, flaws in logic so great that even the computer illiterate can see them, the technology seems to be out of the mind of an elementary school student. Read it if you must know how the factions of Dune started, but dont expect a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same Old Things","review":"I have read every book to carry the \\"Dune\\" title. I have loved the series from the first installment, and still love it with the latest work by Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson. Unfortunately, the series didnt love me back this time.I got through the book in about 3 days, but while I was on the edge of my seat (like in the other books), the end didn't hold up as the other aspects of the novel did. I hate to ruin the summary for anybody, but the origins that it claims to explain of the various groups in the Dune universe aren't told in detail, rather they are glossed over without any direct reference.I would only recommend this book to VERY DEDICATED Dune fans, anybody else, go get the Sci-Fi movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rabid Dune fans only, please","review":"This book is worthwhile only in the context of its sire, the immortal _Dune_ and the other lesser volumes in *Frank* Herbert's original series. Read all those volumes before devoting time and money to this pale shadow of the original. The style is weak and the characterization is shallow. The plot is interesting only to the extent that it makes interesting speculations about the historical background of the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"This book, in addition to the story behind the Butlerian Jihad, was supposed to give the origins of the Bene Gesserit, Mentats, Suk, swordmasters, and Guild, at least according to the inside front cover. Unless my copy was missing some pages, it barely touches on the precursors to the BG. The book is also supposed to explain the betrayal between Houses Harkonnen and Atreides. It seems to explain it away as a misunderstanding that is later resolved. So, is there another betrayal later, after the Houses are actually formed?? This book doesn't remotely live up to its potential. They probably just wanted to make some more money. They must write another one to resolve the above issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"Well, if you ask me, the Herbert/Anderson team aren't doing a very good job with Frank Herbert's legacy. The characters don't have any depth, and the plotting isn't much above Buck Rogers. You'd think that Brian Herbert would have learned something about developing complex novels from his dad. Even more bothersome, is that they don't seem to be following the clues about the Old Empire that Frank Herbert dropped here and there. And I don't know how much of the Dune Encyclopedia had Frank Herbert's imprint, but the characters of Butler, Holtzman, etc. directly contradict what's in the Dune Encyclopedia. Don't waste your money on this book until it comes out in paperback..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid fourth installment in the Dune prequel series","review":"The Butlerian Jihad is a very entertaining book, and that is why I gave it four stars. I still read books for the pure enjoyment of it, and discovering the ways in which Frank Herbert's son imagines(and hopefully researched) that the Dune Universe, the one that we all know from the origional Dune, came to be is about as enjoyable as most storylines I can envision. That said, this book is not incredibly well written. The character developement is the poorest of any book in the series so far, and the plot lines take on some awefull turns. The predictability gave way to a feeling of a massproduced science-fiction story that was released more to make money than to pay tribute to the world of Dune. If you are looking for a litterary masterpiece, move on, but if you are looking for a highly entertaining read that is near impossible to put down (no matter how predictable it sometimes can be) look no further."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, Horrible Kindle Edition","review":"I enjoyed the book a lot. I've read some of the other reviews and I can't agree with their appraisal of the writing or story. I was a fan before reading this book and I'm still just as much of a fan.However, my review really should focus on the Kindle version of this. To put it simply, it's horrible. I've read quite a few books now that were done by major publishers that didn't have any errors. This had TONS. There were random hyphenations, strange italics, odd characters appearing in places and dozens of other little issues.For the price that we're paying for this and the fact that it's such a large publishing house putting it out, we should not see so many flaws."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"Magnificent introduction to the known Universe, the time of the Titans, the origins of Omnius, and the great spark that ignites the war against the Thinking Machine Empire. Having re-read the Dune \\"original six,\\" I caught tiny, brief, even one-time references to planets (Anibus), people (Norma Cenva in G. E. of Dune), and others that get massive significant treatment, here.For KJA haters, this whole trilogy allowed KJA and BH tremendous creative license to explore new territory in the duniverse, ancient when even first encountering Omnius, while massively distant from ourselves in this day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good just don't expect Frank!","review":"This is a good adventure story and the characters (especially Erasmus) are well drawn and the story is interesting.

So don't compare it to Frank's work, let it stand on its own, and enjoy a fun adventure!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Done with \\"Dune\\"","review":"To be succinct, this is a bad book. Poorly written, slackly plotted, full of cliches and predicabilities, Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson have succeeded in grinding Frank Herbert's brilliant creation into pure, unreadable hackwork.Their previous trilogy of \\"Dune\\" prequels (\\"House Atreides\\", \\"House Harkonnen\\" and \\"House Corinno\\") was acceptable at best, but at least held my interest, even as I was aware that the overall quality of the writing was deteriorating as the series progressed. Now, however, they cannot provoke even the momentary suspension of disbelief, as every page, practically every paragraph, is larded with indigestible chunks of bad writing.This guys have succeeded in putting me off the \\"Dune\\" universe for good, something that Frank Herbert, even at his worst, never came close to doing. Good work, fellows, you have managed to convert gold into dross."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's just plain lacking.","review":"This book could have been so much more. The subject matter is so rich with possibilities that it should have taken up a trilogy in and of itself. It takes a lot of time introducing characters. I liked the idea of the characters, but found they weren't very well developed- they felt one-dimensional, as if they were only there to hold up the plot line, or satisfy a reference made in a later book.The authors lay out this whole grand plot line of the butlerian jihad, and just when it starts to get interesting they wrap it up. The whole last quarter of the book feels like strung together a bunch of vignettes. It leaves you very dis-satisfied.Disappointing, lacking, ...ugh! I don't have the right words for this. I wanted so much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definately worth a read","review":"No, it's not Frank Herbert, but it's as close as you're going to get. I have read all the original Dune series numerous times. This book, and the books that follow fill in a lot of the gaps you always wonder about. Since they are derived from the great author's original notes, there is validity to the writings. I'm happy I read this book and look at it, as time well spent.IMO, purists should stay away since there are some flaws to be found and the style is not Frank Herbert, at all. But for the rest of us, give it a read, you might like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A cheap movie with a great story","review":"The first time I watched the Great St. Louis Bank Robbery I didn't know what to expect. I had never heard of the historic events that form the basis of the movie, and frankly I had never heard of this movie either.This movie feels more like a play or graphic novel. There are no fancy stunts or even fancy camera work. It's a simple story about a disastrous set of decisions that leads to a lousy day in St. Louis.As for acting, well, the actors over reach and clearly Steve McQueen was still developing his cool guy persona. What makes this movie compelling is the downward spiral of Steve McQueen's character (and the weird \\"time capsule\\" feel the movie projects to modern audiences). In this movie, McQueen could project tough, but cool ... not so much.In keeping with the low budget feel of the movie, the transfer to DVD is low budget too. Don't bother placing this on a high def TV. An old analog TV is this movie's proper home."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT SO GREAT","review":"The DVD that I received was a big disappointment.

I have gained an inch in height in just a few months using just a few of the exercises outlined in this book. That might not seem like much, but for me ( I am over 30 ), it is a BIG accomplishment. As for all these negative reviews, my guess is they either didn't even try the techniques correctly, or they are written by this books competitor.

They will grow taller even though they did not do any exerise.The other readers complained they did not grow taller even though they tried the exercises very hard.
