The colors of most plates are significantly distorted by a brownish (sepia) hue significantly changing perception of the originals, and - thus - rendering the paintings very inaccurately ruining this book's visual appeal. Additionally, a bluish hue destorts at least \\"Lady Writing a Letter with her Maid\\" on p. 147.

There are quite a few without words on this one. Almost every song on this cd is wonderful. A few aren't so hot, like Roberta Tovey's \\"Wait for Me\\", or Jon Pertwee's \\"Pure Mystery\\". But they are by far outweighed by the incredible collection of classics collected on this single cd. \\"I'm gonna spend my Christmas with a Dalek\\", for example. That is quite possibly the most hysterical song I've ever heard. (picture a Dalek sitting around the Christmas dinner table saying things like \\"I Love You\\", \\"Please pass the custard and plum pudding\\" in that mechanical voice) This is just one example of the collection of great songs on this cd. I'm not even particularly fond of instrumental songs and I love the ones on this cd. I would recomend it for any Doctor Who collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK","review":"The music goes no where near fitting any sort of a feel the Dr. Who series usually embodied.

It is one I remember from childhood- I used to listen to it daily, and it is one of the albums that got me hooked on renaissance music.According to a page from medieval.org, \\"Les Musiciens de Provence were a French (Occitan) early music ensemble in the 1970s and early 1980s. Their repertory was centered in the Golden Age of Provence, namely that of the troubadours, but did extend into later areas, especially for dance music.\\" www.medieval.org/emfaq/performers/lmdp.html lists the complete discography.By today's standards, the recording is a bit raw sounding, and some musica ficta are incorrect. Nevertheless, it is a fun old album and for the renaissance junkie, it is interesting to hear how the performance practice (and recording practice) of early music has progressed since the rebirth of renaissance music.Incedentally, the rather raw style may be just the ticket for those looking for music for SCA or renaissance faire type purposes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for color coding DVD copies","review":"Some of the sides became unglued.

Also, there needs to be an overall map of some kind, so you can figure out where in the park the little maps are.

What I heard instead was most amazing. I have simply never heard a better matched fusion between classical Indian music, expressed in very powerful both male and female voices, traditional instruments, but an especially strong rhythmic section (tabla's, etc..), and on the other hand, very convincing rhythmic jazz with keyboards, trumpets etc.. This is neither one or the another, but a new kind of powerful blend, not newagey at all, but nevertheless trance-inducing through its rhythms ... There's also an identifiable African percussion to be heard. I only give it a four, instead of five, because the documentation is very poor, apart from the names of its musicians, you get no background about the project, the musicians etc..."},{"rating":"2","title":"At Last!","review":"This was Vince's last studio effort and, by all accounts, one of the rarest of albums to find. When I bought a new turntable after many years, it was among the first albums I played. Because it was released on Warner, there was despair among Vince's fans that it would never see a CD treatment. Despair no more. Not only has been released, it has been giving loving treatment by the wizards at Rhino.Worth the price of admission if only for Uno Y Uno, on which Vince plays electric guitar, the entire album shows Guaraldi in full maturity as an artist, displaying the jazz/blues fusion and delicate touch for which he was beloved by his fans. Herb Ellis on guitar, Colin Bailey on drums, and a host of other studio greats make Alma-Ville like the last bottle of fine vintage wine you thought was lost forever, but found in a far corner of your basement.

Conn is ignorant of factual history and it amazes me that so many people like his work!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting, but not accurate","review":"As with the other three books, these are great if you want a ripping yarn. They are, however, terrible if you have any interest in Roman history. It is hard to be supportive of Caesar unless you have a strong man fetish, which Iggulden has in spades. What is most annoying is the unbelivable characterisations of so many famous Romans. Brutus as a petulant child,Servilla, Brutus' mother, a paragon of Roman virtue, as a prostitute. Cato, the ultimate Roman, as a dishonest chancer, and Pompey as an ineffective leader!If you want to read a decent book based on the facts, I would suggest Lucan's Civil War"},{"rating":"1","title":"Book purchased was NOT recieved","review":"Book name: Emperor: The Gods of WarMy son, Jerrold A McKinney #573721, did not receive this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Emperor: The Gods of War","review":"I have read the entire series and was delighted when the final book finally became available.

The versions of \\"Ain't That a Shame\\" are clearly different (iTunes samples both versions in the same area). Given that, at least some of the items here are re-recordings. But even the re-recording of \\"Tutti Frutti\\" shows why the original was left off the Dot package - it is an utter embarrassment that shows the worst side of the 50's trend for white artists to \\"sanitize\\" black records. Still, this is the only place to get anything like the period recordings of \\"Tutti Frutti\\" and \\"Rip it Up\\" (the re-recordings were made in the early 60's - only a few years after the originals, and before the embarrassment set in)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Originals","review":"These are not the original hit recordings.

Besides the sound (which isn't all that bad), this is the beard at their progressive best. The musicianship that shines through is breathtaking.The Making of V is awesome. To see these guys at work is inspiring to say the least. They don't check their emotions at the door.

The remote is a great feature and works very well. On the down side, the light is supposed to be 100 Watt. it seems dimmer than that. The other issue is the fan speed.

I was doing my family history concerning the TAYLOR family and was so intriqued by the book that I bought it and invited the author to our family reunion to share Morgan and his adventures. This is a must have book that inspires the basic Civil War buff and the knowledgeable historian also. The style of the writer makes it enjoyable for the reader. It is like reading a great novel, but accurately depicting the events."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest Read of the longest raid","review":"Horwitz brings the civil war to life in this book. The Author captivates the reader by putting this \\"insignificant raid\\",(when compared to major battles at Gettysburg and Vicksburg) on the front porch and in the kitchens of those hoosiers and buckeyes who had thought the war was very far away. Excellently covers the civilians through letters and diarys, as well as the military actions of the two sides. A must read for any student of csa cavalry, or anyone with a taste for an exciting account of a part of our history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Reading","review":"Mr. Horwitz has crafted a superb account of the South's only significant incursion of the western war into the North. Not only does his book fill a void in the literature of Civil War Military history, his book is a fascinating depiction of the times. It conveys how people felt, acted, and thought during our nation's greatest conflict. This book is compelling and insightful reading about General Morgan, his officers,principal antagonists,soldiers, and civilians. Mr. Horwitz is to be commended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Richardson on Carnap and Aufbau","review":"This book is on the book \\"Aufbau...\\" of Carnap and the view of Richardson on it.

It is very much about his life, especially his marital problems, more than any of his work. The greatest (and much too lengthy) emphasis on his achievements is his Mexican burial film.If you're expecting to learn anything about his techniques you also will be disappointed. The DVD seems to explain his work as just random shots taken at will that happen to look good when viewed in the right mood and perspective.Buy a good book instead of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"70th Anniversary Monopoly Game First Edition","review":"My rating reflects a damaged product, that was not replaced.The 70th Anniversary Monopoly Game First Edition comes in a beautiful container and the pieces are so retro and cool.

I've enjoyed the sounds of moe. for about four years now and when it comes to live bands I have to say that these guys are pretty much the best in the business and this is truly a testament to that. I've listened to several moe. shows because of my recent intoduction into the tape trading world and I think, with the exception of a Halloween show (they covered the Dark Side of the Moon), this is the best live concert I've listened to from them. Its filled with really groovin' jams and some just all around fun to listen to songs. You should check it out, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Somewhat uninspiring; much more subdued than Volume 1","review":"Nicely done, but lacks the intensity and energy of Warts & All Volume 1. The jams here are nicely woven and played, but this show lacks the level of overall ferocity of Volume 1 (disc 2 of which absolutely makes every hair on my body stand on end). Don't get me wrong - this is a nice show; I would recommend it for any fellow moe.ron. However, for the uninitiated listener I'd strongly encourage buying Volume 1 first. Another must-have is 'Live 3.1', available only via the band's website. There are indeed some moments of sheer excitement on this new disc (Timmy Tucker and virtually all of disc 3, which includes some nice hidden bonus tracks), but otherwise it tends to be a bit of a sleeper. Hope this helps.... remember, this is just one guy's opinion. Peace......"},{"rating":"2","title":"very few warts to be found...","review":"I've seen moe. countless times since 1997, including this concert in Atlanta...I missed the show the night before (also in Atlanta), but I definitely lucked out by making it to this one. A headbanger buddy who went with me commented that the 1st set was \\"pretty rockin', man\\", and I'd have to agree...other than the quiet \\"Letter Home\\", the boys kept the energy level at a mostly loud & intense pace. The 2nd set kept up the momentum with some excellent transitional jamming, beginning with the set opener \\"Mexico\\" all the way through to the closing \\"Rebubula\\". When the lights came on, I definitely felt like I got my money's worth, and this 3-CD set only confirms it. I'd recommend this volume of Warts And All over the others...superb show IMO."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really?","review":"This video was quite a dissapointment. I was thinking it was in concert form. Nope. It's just a compliation of videos. There was nothing in this video that kept our interest. You truly get what you pay for. If you pay more than 50 cents, don't buy. Trust me.

This movie is the most accurate summation of what is wrong with our health \\"system\\" in America; and more importantly what we can begin to do about it.

We need to reverse the incentives of the system to stop rewarding sick-care and start rewarding well-care.

Good facts presented to support the statements that well care actually reduces health care costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Escape Fire good not great","review":"Although, it was professionally done, Escape Fire, missed a bigger point. As Big Pharma, Big Insurance, and Big Government have totally dominated and decimated \\"Modern Medicine\\", maybe the answer lies outside the paradigm. Nutrition, Naturopathy, etc are arguable better done non-medically..Within medicine the usual \\"mavericks\\" were interviewed, but who died and left MDs king? The answer, my friend is complimentary and alternative medicine as developed and practiced by the natural cognoscenti. Would you pay a premium to your house painter because he had a medical degree? I wouldn't, but unfortunately the people who made this movie would. I enjoyed the film Doctored much more because they were free of this biasis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent but hugely biased","review":"As a medical student in the United States I thought this documentary did touch upon a few good points. That being said however, it was very biased against specialists and instead of having physicians speak it was mostly journalists and healthcare management personnel. One thing I will agree with however is the mentality of treat our bodies terribly and then fix is not the way to better healthcare. Some responsibility must fall of the patient and preventative care. Overall not impressed but was a decent watch. For those not in the field, don't take everything it mentions as gospel truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Right on - direction for change.","review":"This video presents what is wrong with our disease-based system and what we need to make it truly a \\"healthcare\\" system.

Edwards builds confidantly on the late 50s early 60s \\"vernacular\\" of Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, et al. and gives it his own very contemporary spin.

I originally bought this book for my son who has ADHD. After reading the book I felt that Doctor Weathers' approach was novel and might be able to help me too. After undergoing CAER treatment I am able to complete all necessary tasks with increased concentration. The treatment also alleviated my depression and anxiety. As a result, my blood pressure has dropped significantly. CAER has changed my life!-Diane Sugahara"},{"rating":"1","title":"Advertisement not book","review":"The author has some interesting ideas about the genesis of ADHD. However, the only solution he offers is to come to his clinic and try a revolutionary new treatment that no one else uses and has not been scientifically evaluated. Basically this is a promotion for his clinic and not a book about ADHD. Although, it appears that some people have had success with his program, I wish I had known the book was not a self-help book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this a book or a marketing ploy?","review":"I've read a good deal of this book and agree with most of what the author says. However, I don't have the resources to participate in his program. So how do I use his ideas to help my child (and myself)? Answer: I don't because I can't afford it. The book is misleading because it is marketing literature, not a parenting guide. By the way, notice that the vast majority of favorable reviews for this book come from the people who participated in the program. The reviews are not for the book. They are for the program. As such, they should be taken down because they are misleading as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good understanding of ADHD","review":"I haven't read all of this book but what I have read has been very helpful.

The book is an advertisement for his therapy program. You won't find any real recommendations about how to solve the problems for a child \\"with ADHD\\".

Entire headings and subheadings are missing! Granted, some of the omissions are due to the schools themselves, but the APA should certainly know which programs they accredit.

I was a bit hesitant about the width they stated when I ordered the 11-XX, which was reported as EEEE. Well, they fit extremely well, the ball of the foot is quite wide, the underside of the velcro straps is well-cushioned, and the heel has a very cushiony feel to it. I'll update the review after walking on them for a week; but I had a pair of New Balance and they were nowhere near the quality/support of this item and lasted one summer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Book but Not Useful in Kindle Format","review":"This is a wonderful collection of songs but is not useful if purchased in Kindle format. I suppose it is due to the limitations of Kindle but the pages look as though a letter size PDF has been shrunk to fit into the Kindle screen. This makes the page too small for one to read the notes, chords, and lyrics. Fiddle as you will with the Kindle display settings, the largest display one can select is still too small to do the page justice. A magnifying lens does help to increase the size of the text but then it is too blurry. I purchased this edition because I needed to perform Noel's song \\"Inside\\" for my son's school and I had only a few hours to prepare. To my knowledge, this is the only PPM songbook containing this song. The song is wonderful and I would recommend the songbook in the paperback format but the Kindle format will be of limited utility to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sylvia's stuff is so rare!","review":"I recently bought this album cause I only have Sylvia's material on vinyl LP's.

I look forward to more from this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD Really Sucks","review":"I ordered this thinking I would get original recordings of some of the best music made by the 60's English group (Eric Burdon and the Animals). Wrong. These are all recuts of the originals and sound NOTHING like the originals. Burdon has (or had) a terrific voice, but he has a really stupid habit of singing lyrics off-beat and off-key in live performances or recuts... apparrently he thinks it sounds \\"bluesy\\" or hip, but it actually sounds like crap. The classics like House of the Rising Sun, San Francisco Nights, We Gotta Get Out of This Place, When I was Young, White Houses, and the rest are some of my all time favorite songs: this garbage is so bad I am going to chuck the CD and try to find the originals somewhere else. Listening to this CD makes me cringe.. and somebody should pimp slap Eric Burdon for releasing this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nordic Pride","review":"Delicate walls of guitar feedback and rich basslines await the patient listener, but you'll also have to negotiate a disconsolate falsetto and Icelandic lyrics that are pushed up in the mix on this album. Musically, it bears strong resemblance to The Verve circa \\"A Storm In Heaven\\" with the added intimacy of a string section that invokes the quaintest of moods. Sigur Ròs tread a fine line between pastoral melodrama and ornate spaciousness, but when they get it right this album sounds nothing short of majestic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beauty is truth.","review":"Jaw dropping beautiful music.

You really have to hear it to understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"A music of silence and noise. . .","review":"I had never heard of this Reykjavík based band until last night, when I saw them in concert, so I was completely unprepared for the experience. I left feeling as if I'd attended a strange ritual combining classical music, avant-garde rock, and a mass. Sigur Rós manages to bring the ethreal feel of a Philip Glass opera together with the ambiant tone of Radiohead, the serene, tortured vocals of a gregorian chant performed by Smashing Pumpins, with occational ephiphanic peaks of driving drums and impelling base echoing the rage of Tool; and yet the totality is their own. The concert was more like a trance, I wanted the audience to stop clapping between songs so I could simply float between waves of sound and silence in this extraordinary realm the band managed to create - they performed like classical musicians rather than rock-stars, not speaking, not posing, merely playing their ethreal mucis and leaving the audience in some transubstatiatory state. Brilliant."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for bluegrass fans!!","review":"LRB is the best blugrass band out there as far as I'm concerned. This is a great CD and keeps the LRB alive and well.

Neither is it a lesson on the Law of Attraction (as in \\"The Secret\\") that has recently made popular on the Oprah show. The author's abraham is the name of spirit entities.

Unfortunately, there's not. This journalist has difficulty distinguishing between the trivial (e.g. what videos ambassadors watch) and the important. It reads like a term paper in which the student had to write 15 pages with 5 pages of material. I suspect the journalist stretched the thin material she assembled from the limited access she received. At times, she invokes cultural stereotypes that are disturbing. At best, it's a \\"People Magazine\\" view of Embassy Row, focused on the glamour rather than the substance of diplomatic life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor diplomacy","review":"While this book does occasionally give an interesting glimpse at a diplomat's life, it is basically journalistic fluff. The profiles are superficial and often fawning, and broader political issues are largely ignored. It reads like a \\"Visit to Washington\\" column in a mediocre community newspaper. One gets the impression that the author wrote each section with the goal of being asked back to an embassy cocktail party. It was a disappointment given what I was expecting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful briefing on the diplomatic life in Washington DC","review":"A must read for anyone who does business on Embassay Row and abroad.

Once I started reading, I became fascinated with her observations and her journalistic panache. I recommend this book wholeheartedly as a fine reference source. I certainly hope Ms. Scott writes a sequel, it too will find a home in my business library."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great read","review":"Twilight Man is a wonderfully detailed, moving novel about an interracial marriage in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The two main characters, Karen and Conrad, are likeable, warm, and fully developed, and you can't help but root for them. In fact, they stayed with me for days after I finished the book. Lenore DeKoven's attention to detail is wonderful, and the descriptions of the characters' lives in LA is particularly interesting. Their day-to-day struggles to make their marks in Hollywood is made all the more difficult by pressures from both the black and white communities, and by the complexities of negotiating a social life that includes them both. Heartbreaking, funny, and sexy. All in all, a great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anything Goes","review":"Oh what can I say about this book?

I particularly liked it when one guy, some unknown local musician, said that he liked Joshua Tree the best because that was BEFORE THEY GOT INTO ALL THAT POLITICAL STUFF? What, are you joking? There's a bunch of other no names, the only one of reasonable notariety is BP Fallon, but he's about as boring to watch as paint drying. He speaks so slowly and deliberately its like he has a speak impediment without the stutter. You get frustrated just waiting for him to complete a simple thought. Overall, the women who ran the video and interviews is not bad and its worth a one-time watch. At least there is some footage and music. But borrow this one if you can."},{"rating":"1","title":"fan faves?","review":"The disc included was Season 9 disc 2, ....we already had season 9, and expected something that included actual fan favorites.

The keyboard is quite rubbery and perhaps will not stand up to a lot of wear and tear, since after all, it is rubber and is not recommended for children under the age of 4. No, you won't be able to play all sorts of fastpaced music and it is probably best enjoyed just for the fun of it; the piano mode sounds decent enough.

I forced myself about half-way through it and gave up - the characters are cookie-cutter, the \\"mystery\\" - well, you really couldn't care less and are glad the guy is dead and actually cheering on whodunit, whoever that might be (although I peeked at the ending because I can't stand not knowing what happens, and it really isn't what you think) and the main character, Rosie Marie, is a weak-willed, neurotic shrew. The only somewhat likeable character is Michael Nash, her one-time paramour, and even he is obviously an idiot for still liking this walking bag of neuroses. Ugh. A strictly by-the-formula romance fills out the excrable plot, making me want to vomit out of my brain everything I read. This one goes into the \\"sell this\\" pile IMMEDIATELY."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great research","review":"This is a fantastic book if you are interested in a fact based approach. If what you need right now is sympathy and emotion, this really isn't the place to look, but for facts, truth and statistics, it doesn't get any better. With a myriad of books that approach with a sullen, soft tone, this book is straight forward and honest. As a childhood grief survivor I found this approach to be cathartic and emotionally transformative. It takes a solid, unbiased look at what works and what research says. As a child, I heard a strong message that children don't grieve and with many caregivers still ignoring the grief of children, this book is a great way to address many damaging misconceptions in non-judgmental way.This book is a must for anyone who works with children who are dealing with grief."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ecouraging","review":"I bought the book 3 days ago and today my 9 month old did #2 in her potty.

If it wasn't for the book's tips and advice I probably would have waited until she was a little after a year to begin training (or may be even longer).The book has plenty of sound advice in all aspects related to eliminating.

The only time that he goes in his diaper is when I'm to busy to listen or watch for the signs that he gives me when he needs to go.

Both of my children were diaper free in the daytime before age 2 using the principles in this book. I cringe when I think of the environmental impact of how many more diapers we would have used by waiting longer. It is also nice to not have to change poopy diapers because they #2 in the toilet. This is a great book for learning how to toilet train your child in a way that is kind and with common sense. It is easily read in a day or two. However, there should be more information about how to deal with nighttime learning and its obstacles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"Great book. Can tailer to your needs. Author's insights and direction are child-directed but matter-of-fact.

This book was useless for a 2 year old. It just basically went into details on how to routinely put babies on the potty from before a year onward at certain times and go from there. It did not detail a real program how to potty train a 2 year old that had never had potty experience before. The potty training in a day book from the 1970's (NOT TERI CRANE) worked for us. We potty trained our 26 month old boy in 2 days.

In 2000 it crashes the computer, and in a fresh install of XP it just gives a black rectangle.

The laugh and learn table is cheaper and so much better. It has more for baby to do. The bandstand is great because a baby can sit in front of it and play, but it doesn't hold their attention long enough to be useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"boston","review":"Hello, The production is very good with the price of $15 including free shipping.

My sister in law got one for there daughter for christmas and it was doing the same thing right out of the box.I called Fisher-price they said there were no reports of any problems with this and they sent me a form to return the legs and I would receive the replacement toy in 6-8wks.

Before she could pull up, it was a great height for her to see the instruments and the dancing monkey. Now that she's pulling up and standing, I agree that it's a little short, but that doesn't stop her from having fun! One thing that I have found troublesome is that the monkey detaches easily; however, my daughter continues to dance to the music with the monkey in her hand!! It's great entertainment for her!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What An Awful Disappointment!","review":"My mother-in-law got this for our son - who loves music! We were so excited to get it home and set it up. He was 12 months old when he got this toy. One word to describe this toy is \\"SHORT\\". In the commercial and online ad, it shows baby pulling up to this toy having a good time. Even fully extended, my son towered over this toy at 1 yr. old. Because he was so much bigger then the toy - he had no interest in dancing WITH the monkey. Also, the music is awful - absolutely didn't live up to ANY of the advertising! What a waste of money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangers over looked","review":"My 9 month old son received this toy for Christmas. He loves it. However, now that he is pulling up on everything, the toy is too short. The thing that concerns me the most is the spinning monkey. My son was playing with this toy the other day and his shirt cuff got caught on the monkey. Before I could get over to him, it had pulled off his sleeve and was wrapping it around the monkey. I don't know what would have happened if I had not been standing right there. The same day, his pacifier on a string also got caught on it. He is only allowed to play with this toy with close supervision. I will be contacting the manufacturer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money - and I got it for free!","review":"I just picked this up almost brand new from a friend. I was surprised she was letting it go, it's practically in brand new condition. Well, I got it home and figured out why. My son is 9 months old. He can pull himself up on it - although it is too short like many of the other posts say. It pretty much just makes constant noise. It's very confusing and there's no clear connection between baby's movements and the music. It seems like there should be a setting where he can JUST play the instruments but that's not the case. It's just chaotic. My son just goes after the monkey and makes it grind which drives me nuts. I have to keep distracting him so he doesn't pull the head off, which doesn't make any sense. It's a baby toy, I shouldn't have to tell him to stop touching it. If I had purchased this I would return it. It's a good idea in theory but doesn't really live up to it's concept."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite in our house!","review":"My little guy was given this actually as a hand-me down. He is the FOURTH little one to use this toy and it is in perfect working condition still....after years of use! He LOVES it. It is by far his favorite toy and holds his attention longer than any other toy we have available. He has figured out how to pull himself up to standing using this toy and my only complaint is that it should be a little taller when it is extended. BUT I am amazed at the durability, quality and entertainment value of this toy! It is absolutely worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"We LOVE it!!","review":"A friend gave this to us and my daughter and I absolutely LOVE it! I love that the music is not the traditional baby songs, it has kind of a Jamaican theme or something to it, so I definitely don't get tired of hearing it. My baby is 11 months old and she will stand and play with it for a long time. She does like to make the monkey stop dancing so I am waiting for it to break and it is a little short for her but otherwise it's great. She walks all around it and has a good time with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 6 month old LOVES this toy","review":"This toy was purchased at a garage sale and he loves it. It has been a life saver. Sure, it does use up batteries, but probably because everything is going at one time. This is the only toy that he will actually sit and play with. At the higher level, he pulls into a standing position to try to catch the monkey which he manages to do every time..LOL"},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe not the most durable toy, but it's fun!","review":"Like some previous reviews, my biggest complaint about this toy is that the monkey broke almost immediately. But that did not take away from the basic fun this toy provides. The rest of toy still works fine, and my kids never seemed to mind that the monkey wasn't dancing along with them. We've had this for over 6 months now, and it still gets played with almost daily. We have only replaced the batteries once in 6 months, so as long as you're using a brand name battery, I don't really think that's an issue with this toy. For the price I paid at the time, it was well worth the money spent!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your money","review":"We bought this for our little boy who loves music. He hates this toy. He gets more stimulation from a link a doo ring.We have only had it a week and they have already broke it. My little one grabs on to the monkey and stops it from dancing. Now he spins one way gets stuck and makes an awful loud sound.In the store when it was in the box, my boys loved hitting the drum. Now they only care about who can stop the monkey from dancing.I agree with everyone when they say it is too small. It has two height adjustments. One so they can sit on the floor and the other so they can stand. They are taller than the unit.Battery eater. The thing should have been made by energizer. It never stops it just keeps going and going till it eats up all your batteries.If my husband had not thrown out the box, this toy would have been heading back to the store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agreed - boring at best","review":"I thought the toy looked adorable and it sounded pretty good while in the box in \\"demo\\" mode. However i had the same problem as several other folks who mentioned this toy was too short. On the box it looks like the keyboard is as high as the toddlers waist, on my 13 month-old it only reached his knees. As a toddler he only wants to stand or walk and I thought this would be perfect for him to stand/dance with, but no way...it's just too short, even in the highest setting. The music sounded very computer generated and the interactive toys just didn't produce enough interesting instrument sounds."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"What is most disappointing about this product is that once you have bought it, you have bought it. It doesn't come apart to go back in the box to go back to the retailer, and customer service will send you a new one, but you won't have it back in hand until after a total of 1 1/2 to 2 months from your phone call to fisher price. That is too long to wait for a toy for an infant. This toy did not work right out of the box and my daughter will be completely grown out of it by the time the problem is solved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun But Not Durable!","review":"My son got this for Christmas when he was 7 months old. He loved swaying to the music and making the guitar and horn play. It was great until he started standing up and grabbing the monkey as other reviewers have stated. The sound started going and I thought it was the batteries, but upon replacing them, it still didn't work right, so it ended up in the trash. In the end, we got about 2-3 months of use out of this before it deteriorated, not a good track record for the price paid. You would think that Fisher Price would test these toys out on babies/toddlers before selling them. Clearly they would have realized that grabbing the monkey would eventually break the toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring-at best","review":"I was so excited when my son received this toy for his birthday. The box showed a brightly colored toy that he could stand up and play and that he can make his own music. WRONG-Even though my son is short, he could not stand up well with this low lying toy--EVEN AT ITS HIGHEST SETTING. He also could not make his own music. Any touch to the floor pad or to the keys would send off a computer generated sound. My son eventially got bored with it. For the kids that would actually be interested in this toy, the toy is not recommended for them. ONE STAR-ONLY BECAUSE IT'S THE LOWEST ALLOWED!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not a good toy at all","review":"My son loves musical instruments, especially the drums, so I bought this for him for his 1st birthday. I thought I had hit the jackpot when I saw this, because it had everything. It has two height adjustments,(short and shorter)! My son towers over this thing. The dance mat does nothing but turn on the toy when you step on it. The horns do nothing at all but fall off. The toy plays what it wants to, and when the child is hitting the drums or piano you can't hear them over the toy playing its own thing. Like everyone else said, the monkey is a distraction and breaks after a day. This is the biggest waist of money ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"My 16 month old son got this toy for Christmas (2 weeks ago!) and already doesn't play with it anymore. Which is surprising since he loves music. My biggest complaint is that it is supposed to have two levels: one for sitting and one for standing. Well, the standing position is a joke! My son can stand on the mat and at the highest level, it reaches a little bit above his knees. He has to bend down to play with it and he's NOT tall for his age. I would say this toy is more annoying than anything. And I can see what most others are saying about the monkey. My son likes to hold onto it as well and it's already making weird sounds. I would not recommend this toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good toy!","review":"My son pulled up to a stand for the first time on this toy. He loves the red monkey and just had to have it. I was so proud! I think the toy really does encourage pulling up. And for that I think its great. My son is mostly interested in the monkey. He always grabs it and it does make a bad clicking sound but the toy appears to be very durable and it has taken many a beating. He also loves to play with the guitar but he could care less about the horns or the lighted keys. All in all I think this is a great toy if you get it for a gift but I dont think I would have bought it myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad it was a non-returnable gift","review":"Both my girls prefer the Leapfrog Learning Table to this. My 1 yr old continually pulls off the trumpet and is obsessed with trying to detach the monkey. The music or drumbeats that play when you step on the mat is very annoying (on any setting). It plays for about 30 seconds, and it is bothersome for us because our children have already moved on to the next toy before it stops. Sometimes we feel that it never stops....Too bad it was a gift and the box was destroyed when it was opened on my daughter's birthday, because my husband said it was the first thing going in the next yard sale...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps Babys Attention","review":"This is a great toy! My 8 mo old loves it! It can be left on and when the baby crawls onto the mat it will start playing and the monkey will dance. It has three setting so that you can put it on one that will only perform the key stokes and instument he chooses or have continuous music playing. Has real nice up beat samba kind of music. This has inspired him to pull himself up to it by grabbing the bar on the front. He's now coming to the sitting position on his own. He loves to bang and pull on all the musical elements of this instrumental toy. He giggles when the monkey dances and is amazed at it. The elevation of the toy can be raised several inches as the baby grows and learns to stand etc. I highly recommend this toy. It is something my baby enjoys very much! *note: keep C batteries on hand (it takes three and they need to all be fully charged to make the monkey dance around properly)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be called kill the monkey..","review":"My little girl loves almost everything.

My son played with it 4 times and the monkey no longer spins around and now makes a loud grinding noise. I called Fisher Price today and told them the problem and they told me that they would send me a voucher for any F.P. toy and instructed me to send them back the legs to this toy.

She also loves the music and all the different blinking lights. It would be a great toy except that it is potentially dangerous. The problem is that the dancing monkey operates on a motor that makes it go around in a circle. Somehow my daughter's hair got stuck in the monkey. I heard her screaming and turned around to see her trapped face down on top of the toy. Of course the motor didn't stop and the monkey kept turning with my daughter's hair wrapped around it. I was able to turn the toy off and found a huge chunk of her hair had been pulled out by the root. It scares me the thought of this happening to a younger baby. Buyer beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it!","review":"I bought this on clearance at WalMart for about $6. That's about what it's worth.

I wasn't sure if I shoud because the reviews didn't look to great. But My daughter loves music and it just looks like fun so I decided to try it out. Well she liked it when it was still in the box and then for the rest of the day after I put it together. And after that she hasn't touched it since. She could care less about this toy. There just isn't enough to do on it. If she was younger and wasn't able to do all the things she can she would probably like it but it is just boring for my 9 month old daughter. So I am returning it to the store to get something she will actually like. So if your baby is not very eaisly entertained (which some babys are) then don't bother with this boring toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real workhorse, but not for amateurs","review":"The only place I've really used Bron mandolins is in professional kitchens. They are amazing and great for slicing, cutting julienne, and making gaufrettes. It has an incredibly sharp blade and is very sturdy. The guard is a bit useless (as all mandolin guards are), but a few applications might handle it alright. There are two perpendicular blades to cut batons (either thin julienne or thicker like french fries). It is a bit firmer in build than plastic mandolins, so you will get consistent slices, instead of a variety based on the amount of force you use.While I would highly recommend this for professional use, I find it a bit much for home cooks. It is big and a little awkward. It requires care to prevent rust. And it's expensive. A $25-30 plastic Japanese mandolin will do everything a home cook would need."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this one","review":"If I had bought this mandoline (the fourth or fifth one I've owned and used over the years) in a store, I would have returned it.

It is sturdy and will last life time. That said, it is not user friendly, the blade adjustments are not easy, as you have 3 cutting surfaces to adjust. The design may have been great years ago, but any diagonal blade or V blade models will cut much easier and faster then this beautifully slicer. Just try cutting string carrots and you will hate this slicer, the straight blade is very difficult to push raw carrots through. The standard holder will only cut to within 1/8\\" of the blade so to the rest is cut on the board or out it goes.Yes, after spending all this money I am going back to my cheap plastic V blade that is super easy to use.

Marshal Julius doesn't just give a high- testosterone rating to a movie if it's JUST action; he weighs the pros and cons of what makes an action film bad or good. If the plot or performances are off-key, he tells you---like his review of \\"The Chinese Connection\\" mentions that whereas Bruce Lee is extraordinary, the movie's production values are sub- standard. I'll admit I disagree with Julius' high rating of \\"Flash Gordon\\" (with Sam Jones and Max von Sydow), but he's well on-the-mark with the rest of the reviews.

Marshall Julius shows all of these traits in this book. I also suspect that his grasp of beauty anf beauty in film would easily fit onto the back of a postage stamp.His assertion that 'Singing In The Rain' would have been a better film if it had ended 'in a bloodbath, Gene Kelly's guts exposed in a tchnicolor (sic) flash of violence' is plain stupid. As is his rather immature wish that 'one day all films will have the depth of plot and strength of character' as 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'.To conclude, this book is to serious film literature what Jackie Collins is to highbrow fition.

Also it is very thin on the sides. The cost to return a 3 foot long package is probably more than the hat is worth so I will just keep it. I am going to try to use it as a centerpiece somehow.

Putting the least bit of pressure on the hand unit will cause it to slow down and just about stop. (No pressure on the hand unit means it does nothing.) I guess if you just had a manicure a few days ago and wanted to do a tiny touchup, it would be adequate. Otherwise, it may eventually smooth edges and possibly even remove a ridge or two -- but I haven't seen these things happen.Oh, another thing: the discs are not identified in the machine. You have to look at the pictures in the owner's manual to see what the discs are called and what they do. Then you have to look at each attachment in the machine and match it to its picture. Once I did this, I took a magic marker and put numbers on the attachments' places in the machine, then numbered the pictures in the manual.

Each chapter discusses training a specific behavior. My overall impression is that the first step in training is discussed well in each chapter but large gaps exist between the first step and final behavior that are not addressed in the videos. My family gathered around the TV to watch this... we watched it twice... it has gone back in the cabinet and we're unlikely to refer to it again. This video also does not play from start to end - rather a menu is shown and you need to select the specific 5-minute chapter you wish to watch (such as \\"training your dog to fetch\\"). We have found dog training books that are more convenient to use than loading the video. Books can be left on a table and refered to instantly - more convenient than a reference video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed!","review":"I wish I would had read more of the reviews before purchasing this DVD. I really thought it would teach me things I didnt know about training my new puppy.

I had to keep the remote in my hand for the entire video because I was constantly hitting play. There was also a \\"dogs perspective\\" segments at the end of each \\"lesson\\". Why? I dont understand that. Im an adult not a child. Why the kiddie training video?I understand the necessity of treats at the beginning of training any dog however, the amount of treats given to the obviously already well trained dogs was a bit over the top.Basically, waste of money.

The title is misleading. \\"Dog Whisperer\\" and \\"Beginning\\" dog training fall a bit short of my expected content.\\"Whisperer\\" should involve emulating how the animal interacts in the wild. The horse Whisper takes control of the horse by emulating the lead stallion in the herd. A dog whisperer should be able to control a dog by emulating the alpha dog in the pack. This DVD illustrates basic treat reward dog training and has nothing do do with dog whispering per my expectation.\\"Beginning\\" training should include how to house train (not even mentioned in this DVD) and how to get the puppy to stop mouthing/biting when playing (a common behavior that needs fixing). If the DVD touches on this it is very subtle. We have a new puppy (3 months old) and need to solve these 2 problems. This was THE reason for purchasing this DVD but it fell way short. We returned it."},{"rating":"2","title":"the most effective dog training technique ever!","review":"If you're the sort of person who thinks dogs are inherently stupid and need to be bullied into compliant behavior, this training technique might not be for you. If, on the other hand, you've had any first-hand experience with dogs and observed their behavior, you'll completely get this method and understand that it's us humans who need the training as much or more than our pets.This is the opportunity to train your dog with love and respect. No hitting, jerking,choking, or yelling. And no small surprise, a quicker, more joyful route to acceptable behavior. In just one week of starting Paul's \\"Raise with Praise\\" techniques we were well on our way to turning our timid rescued Greyhound into a confident, happy and happy-to-please dog. It's fun too.

I would not recommend to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good information, but not enough","review":"The training methods taught on this dvd are easy to use and work well. I just don't feel it is complete enough as far as whole training. It is basically just a dvd about training animals tricks. It doesn't train you how to house train a puppy. It also doesn't give you any ideas about training dogs on something other than what is on the dvd. The dvd also gets kind of annoying with the dogs point of view clips. Luckily you can skip these. I personally would not recommend this, but if you have an adult dog that you just want to get it to heal or sit or lay down this dvd will teach you a real quick learning technique.Something else I did like is the fact that they teach using very kind procedures toward the animals. I was able to teach my blue healer pup (Abby) to sit, lay down, come and heel in about 3 tries each. I liked the techniques, but it just seems its more of a trick dvd than a full training dvd."},{"rating":"1","title":"He's no Cesar Millan","review":"Not at all what I expected.

Secondly it is broken into tiny segments...you're hitting play every few minutes on the dvd player (annoying).

It was misleading because I searched Amazon on Cesar Millan's name and this was the second result to come up. We figured we'd watch the DVD anyway since it was my mistake. First of all, the formatting of this DVD is extremely annoying and choppy. Secondly, I'm not sure that I agree that feeding treats to my dog until she explodes is really the best way to train her. Third, it said something about puppy training in the title and I couldn't find ANYTHING on the DVD about puppies at all. Could be it's there and I just lost patience before I got to it.

I must say however, that overall I am not impressed with the DVD.In a effort to make this a family friendly experience, this DVD is chuck full of bad animations, puppet shows and horribly amateurish dog voice-overs that would only appeal to the youngest kids. Granted, there is some very very helpful information here, but you have to navigate around the mind-numbing pre-school silliness to find it. Case in point: the teaching hand gestures section is demonstrated by a homemade muppet.My suggestion to Mr. Owens would be to make this into two DVD's; one for adults who to benefit from your obvious wisdom and professional instruction -- then make a second one to entertain the kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"This DVD was so boring and was a waste of money.It also hardly showed much training, it was very short.

Paul Owens' video is a training video for dogs who are in a specific state of mind. This video covers techniques to train a dog that is ALREADY submissive. Cesar says that you can only train a dog when it is in a calm submissive state because they are open minded. If you have a dog that is aggressive, nervous, hyper, disobediant, or have other unwanted behaviors, you cannot train that dog yet so this video would not be for you. The DVD seems a little difficult to navigate, but perhaps the navigation was deliberate and it's not a big deal. Paul Owens' content is clear to understand and is easily outlined so that even your child could do it. Highly recommend for those who want their dog to do more than 'stay'. 4.5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and Money","review":"Decent basics, but signal to noise ratio is bad here. The DVD was annoying and repetitive. At the end of each training section, he repeated the same three things. More attention should have been devoted to teaching behaviors than puppet skits and animation sequences. 8 behaviors is also not enough...he should have had more, this title should be BASIC training, nothing intermediate about it.Also the dog whisperer title is deceptive, it came bundled with a dog whisperer book per amazon, the book was Ceasar, the DVD was owens...somebody has trademark issues..but regardless of who the DVD was made by, I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This guy doesn't even know how to talk to a dog, let alone whisper","review":"*phew* This was a doozy. The only thing I learned from this DVD was how Amazon's return policy works. I laughed my way through the entire thing. The guy sure talks alot, but if you watch closely most of the dogs are on a leash and they are CONSTANTLY fed treats. You feel as if he ever runs out all choas will ensue.I was excited to see \\"Dog Baseball\\" until I realized it consisted of putting dog treats on bases - and he described this as a game to wean your dog of treats.There were some half assed puppets thrown in and some really crappy animation.Overall, if you are looking for a DVD to simply rest your coffee on, it's highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"The way this video is set up with menus upon menus makes it virtually useless. Whatever information it contains is difficult to access because of the menus.

My only big gripe with the book was that it did not come with resource CD (which had around 300 practice questions, all of which were way harder than the actual exam), and it took Microsoft around 3 months to ship it to me.Study hard, and you will pass. This book will definitely help you along the way. Well worth the money"},{"rating":"2","title":"Helped me pass...","review":"I used this book as my primary study source to successfully pass the Microsoft 70-270 exam. While the book is thorough in some areas, it lacks in others, such as IIS, which is needed for the exam.If you don't have experience with Windows XP in a domain environment, I suggest an additional source to use with this one. Microsoft exams are tough. The questions are tricky and lengthy. I would recommend everyone join one of the excellent certification forums online as an additional resource.With that said, the book contains few mistakes.

If you are the type of person that actually enjoys watching your favorite artist perform, you will hate this DVD.

It is like trying to watch a performance through a strobe light."},{"rating":"1","title":"DrumWhacker says.....","review":"This DVD is unwatchable. I love Korn, but this DVD sucks. The editing is awful, like it was done by a five-year old on Red Bull and crack. Camera angles change nearly every beat, adding graphics that distorted the picture so badly that you couldn't tell what you were looking at. I've never been a fan of \\"MTV-style\\" editing, and this it at its worst. My eyes hurt after the first song and had to take the disc out of the player. Save your money and buy something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Damn Good","review":"Fantastic DVD, makes me crave seeing another live Korn performance. Only reason i've not made it a 5 star rating is that i was expecting just a great live show, this DVD has special effects added into the concert which don't get me wrong isn't a bad thing, i just didn't expect it. I would say its another great addition to my Korn collection and its worth having."},{"rating":"2","title":"KoRn RoCks","review":"This DVD is great! The guys are great performers. KoRn performs a Metallica song called One. It sounds much better played by KoRn. The second disc is not as good as the first disc but it isn't useless.

Davis, this guy cant sing good on all songs.The worst song on the Dvd is Thoughtless.

As I went through it, I noticed something very strange and familiar. Most of Korn's fans are kids. Mostly kids buy their cd's. Jonathan Davis always sings about crap that happened to him when he was a kid. I then turned off the DVD when to go for a walk and ponder my maturity. I think Korn needs to grow up. I mean, they still put out good material, but they need a new quality to appeal to. I have their self-titled album as well as Follow The Leader. Why are two-discs necessary?!"},{"rating":"2","title":"essence of hopelessness","review":"This comp is fantastic! It's cheap, and of the 21 songs, ten are previously unreleased! Each Hopeless band has one released and one unreleased track. I bought this cd pretty much just to hear the unreleased Against All Authority song (which is fantastic), but there are plenty of other great songs in addition. Some of the best tracks are by Falling Sickness, Mustard Plug and Digger, but almost all the songs rip. This cd will have you hooked from the first track, and one of Against All Authority's best songs, \\"All Fall Down\\" and it doesn't let up. The cd even contains a cover of Walk Like An Egyptian, and it's actually really good! This is one of the best cheap comps out there.

It definitely grows on you and is extremly moving at times, especially the finale \\"Children of Eden\\". My favorite though is \\"Ain't it Good\\" which I hated when I first heard it. Very good show but remember it is a show and don't get into theological discussions about it's suppossed misrepresentations of the Old Testament. It's fiction and doesn't propose to be anything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good music, but not the power of a Broadway show","review":"Many of the reviews written seem to be by people who've performed the show or seen it at a regional theater. I've never seen the show, but have listened to many musicals. This does not have the great vocal performances I've come to expect with recent musicals.I've listened to other Schwartz musicals and with Children found the music average and the vocal performances weak. Don't get me wrong, Stephanie Mills can sing, but she doesn't have the music to show her talents here. The only song with any real power is \\"Lost In The Wilderness\\". It's the one reminiscent a Broadway-type of song. The singer is great!Most of the songs I would consider nice, but boring. There is no need to get the double box set if you just want to hear a taste of the musical. This is not to say the other reviewers were wrong in their thoughts; it's a great family show, a simple soundtrack for kids, and well written. It's just not a powerful musical with show-stopping performances."},{"rating":"1","title":"Compared to London Cast","review":"The Original London Cast Recording of Children of Eden is the best, and the only one that I listen to now. The artist on the London give the show a certain darkness and depth and electricity that is just lacking in this recording. The Father on this CD is nothing compared to Ken Page of Cats. Eve is definatley not as good a Shezwey Powell. Adam is good, but Martin Smith was phenomenal. And the duet version of Generations I can't approave of."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHAT AN INCREDIBLE SHOW!!!!!!!","review":"I had the priviledge of doing this show a couple years ago (1997) when the show first came out. Steven Schwartz has undone himself with such a wonderful musical. This is definitely a family musical and this cd is a \\"must have\\" cd for anyone who is interested in theatre. This is truely a classic. Well done Mr. Schwartz and I totally look forward to your next musical."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Heavenly New Musical","review":"I had the intense privelege of portraying Eve in the Long Island premiere of COE and I must say that this is a truly transcendent musical. This is not just another Bible musical...Stephen Schwartz truly has something new to say about the first few chapters of the Good Book. With soaring melodies and a bunch of songs that are just plain fun to listin to and even grander to sing...COE is one of those new musicals that proves that just cause it's not on Broadway doesn't mean it's not worthwhile...listin and enjoy!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"POWERFUL!","review":"I've listened to or seen many biblical musicals, but this one is tough to beat. William Solo has a quality in his vooice I wish I could describe. He's perfect as Father. I wish that there were a touring production and that we'd get it in Rhode Island, or that they had videotaped the NJ production as a \\"Great Performances\\" special. This is wonderful theatre music. Buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough bad to say","review":"i got about halfway through this cd when i purchased it (at full price!) when i became super mad. see, i was expecting songs that were kind of interesting, or clever, or sounded at all different from each other. i was expecting at least ONE memorable tune. i was expecting songs that advanced the show along. instead, i got this: \\"Let there be Let there be Let there be Let there be Let there be Let there be\\" and \\"And the next day was perfect And the next day was perfect And the next day was perfect And the next day was perfect And the next day was perfect...\\"you get the idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarrassing!","review":"There's a very good reason why \\"Children of Eden\\" will never make it to Broadway - it's weak. For that matter, many of the songs are just outright embarrassing to listen to. The score has no idea as to what it wants to be, and while Stephen Schwartz (Gee, when's the last time he had a real hit?) is trying to impress beyond his means, the score simply fails to congeal as a whole. The synthesised score is obnoxious and makes the entire thing sound cheap - which it is. No class. No polish. Nothing clever or original. \\"Oh Noah, you go-a all the way back to the protozoa.\\" Are we supposed to take bits like this seriously? One would be hard pressed to find a set of lyrics that were worse! I guess that's why this show will be relegated to the world of second rate dinner theater and high school productions until, inevitably, it is forgotten forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic.","review":"I am Pagan, and yet, this is the most moving soundtrack I have ever heard. It isn't about religion, is it? It's about family. It's about parents learning to let their children go, knowing they might let them fall but also knowing it has to happen for them to learn. The way that Father - AKA God - is just a parent, an angry parent trying to shield his children but not knowing how, really brings religion home. First off, I think every Christian should hear this musical. This is what I always thought Christianity should be: God isn't some big guy, he's a dad, end of story. Secondly, every parent and child should hear this, AKA everyone. This definetly made me appreciate the struggles I had with my own parents.\\"The hardest part of love is the letting go...\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Great voices, horriffic score","review":"I'm all for a great bible-based musical, but the unresolving dissinence in this score makes for a troubling two hours of anything but listening pleasure. If you're out to produce or hear a great musical of this genre, try GODSPELL, another Schwartz score. That, on the contrary to this recording, doesn't sound a bit synthesized, and remains interesting and upbeat for the entire duration. The only redeeming factor for this horrifically compiled recording is the voice of Stephanie Mills, who originated the role of Dorothy in the production of THE WIZ. Her voice can bring magic to any stage, and believe me -- this stage needs some serious magic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun show!","review":"I can remember the first time I heard this musical. My friend started playing it, and I was immediately hooked. I think \\"Lost in the Wilderness\\" has got to be the best song in the score, but all the ones everyone else here has mentioned are phenomenal as well. One of the more unique and thought-provoking things about this musical is the way it treats God learning how to be a father. Everyone on this recording is fantastic! Don't bother with the highlights CD--get this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanting Production --I was fortunate to see it","review":"COE was produced at the Papermill Playhouse in Millburn, NJ.

After receiving the CD, I have to tell you that the tape I made from the original album over 12 years ago sounds better than this-cracks and all. The ladies sound like chipmonks, totally distorting the quality of their voices, which is so sad as their voices are beautiful. The tempo actually sounds faster if that is possible. I gave the rating a 2 only because it's the Clark Sisters-otherwise, I would have rated in with a 1. I won't listen to the CD, I'll use the tape I have and \\"settle\\" for that. Too bad!!!

Thus, I my review is not of their music, but the sound quality of this CD. It is a pure waste of money to spend on any one track or full album purchase because the muffled sound you hear on the sample is exactly what you get. I'm not sure why someone would continue (or even allow) this item to be sold on this website. For the record, this is not the original master recordings. If any of us owned these old albums on vinyl, you already know the vinyl DID NOT SOUND THIS WAY. This reissue was done by some very incompetent people. Conclusively, if you want this music, find a copy of the vinyl and record it to a CD.

Well this is one of the first big male-vocal dance hits of the year, and it's about time that it saw a release in the United States--on MCA Records, no less!

If you've seen JT live, you know there are two \\"sets\\". Both are included here. There are songs from his latest relase and many Taylor classics. I particularly enjoyed the current arrangement of Steamroller and this version of Sun on the Moon. The band is stellar and includes long time alums Jimmy Johnson and the drummer that recorded the original Fire and Rain, Russ Kunkel.A haunting version of Millworker, which begins with bass and guitar, reveal James at his guitar best.Rounding out the set is a jamming version of the standard, Knock On Wood.Finally, the last song is just JT and guitar and represents an absolute highlight of this important and thoroughly American artist's ability."},{"rating":"2","title":"James Taylor DVD","review":"Awesome!

Music and pictures are often not synchronized. In fact I am afraid we partially do not see what we hear. It looks manipulated, and I'm afraid it is.

If you are a casual listener of James you should choose the Beacon Theatre disk.If you are an audiophile or care about sound quality, this one is ok but not great. It sounds like it went through a significant amount of electronic processing. The sound from the Beacon Theatre recording is much, much better.

Your best bet is to seek out a good used bookstore or sf con - a set is usually available. This is a must read for hardcore sci-fi genre addicts, along the lines of Necrom and Armageddon Rag (if you don't know them, find them).

A masterful intertwining of music; especially rock, technology, politics and action. The story is driven by the powerful personalities of the rag tag band of guerrilla fighters of the New Resistance, struggling against all odds to save the world. I must warn that it contains gruesome and explicit material, which only goes to help picture an almost hopeless future. A breathtaking insight into basic human behaviour and a page turner."},{"rating":"2","title":"coordination required","review":"This toy is a girl take on the bop-it that has been around a good 10 years.

This CD features a live concert from the group's first tour of Japan in 1965. It's a very good concert, with the group performing some of their most popular songs. An odd thing about the concert is that most of the tunes are introduced by a Filipino MC, in both English and Japanese. But that doesn't really detract from the enjoyment of the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is a \\"must have\\" for any Ventures fan","review":"This CD contains virtually all of the Ventures' best tunes, played flawlessly.

Larry Zukerman is making me think twice about our involvement. Germany was guilty of war crimes against he people of Belgium. Its behavior during the invasion simply cannot be explained away. The German military did indeed seem to deliberately terrorize the population. Unfortunately, the shabbily put together Bryce Report encouraged outsiders to dismiss all reports of atrocities as mere exaggerations and outright lies. I consider this current review as incomplete. Am I perhaps too reluctant to admit being wrong in the past? Whatever, I strongly recommend The Rape of Belgium to all those interested in the history of this savage war. I will also be adding future insights in the comment section."},{"rating":"1","title":"needs some balance","review":"An interesting contrast would be to read Albert Nock's \\"The Myth of a Guilty Nation,\\" also available from Amazon.

How can they call this a live DVD. As others have stated that this interviews and other items crammed in the middle of songs. The bad thing about it is that music it does play is not live. It is just sync'ed with the video to appear live. I have taken digital video of my band linked it with live recording and come up with live footage better than the footage on this video. I bought this video on clearance as another reviewer did and I have to say that it isn't even worth the clearance price I paid for it.

I have all of his CDs. I am also a big fan of live performances, where the performer usually has the chance to stretch out and expand on the original songs.Unfortunately, Lenny doesn't stretch out live, he simply turns up the volume... on everything. The result is one massive wall of incoherent sound. Perhaps this is done to help mask Lenny's less than spectacular playing as he attempts to take over Craig Ross' studio role as main guitarist.Most of the songs are cut off in mid performance to show clips of Lenny being annoyed by interviewers' questions, Lenny being annoyed by fans on the street and Lenny just being annoyed with the world in general.The icing on the cake is the poor camera work and editing. I wish I had taken the time to read a review or see a preview of this one before buying it. This DVD is a definite dust collector."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lenny Rocks","review":"Instead of treating this as the same old concert video, treat it as a rockumentary. This DVD starts out looking like a live concert but you quickly learn that it is a movie about Lenny and his music. I thought the concert footage was fantastic and the behind the scenes stuff was interesting. You definitely get an idea of the frustration Lenny has with the music industry. I was a big fan of the dreds which Lenny chopped off in favor of the braids. I like his onstage fro and Craig Ross's huge white man's fro, and when they start rockin with their two screamin guitars, you cant ask for better Lenny Kravitz. Pay special attention to the dude in the crowd rockin to Are You Gonna Go My Way.....hilarious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lenny, this dvd - live is a BOMBER.","review":"Interruptions!Interruptions!

WOTC has finally (it appears) to have settled on a format for these guidebooks and the layout is excellent.The prestige classes range from the creative 'Acolyte of the Skin' (who willingly trades their humanity for a diabolic nature) to the Cthulhu inspired Alienist (who bargains with dark forces) to the Marvelous True Necromancer (who brings the Necromancer into their own). The Spell oriented feats are equally well designed and provide for a variety of opportunities and variations as well as allowing casters to tailor their spells to their favored element (Fire, Ice, Sound, etc.).All in all, an excellent book that is (still) unfortunately priced a bit too high."},{"rating":"2","title":"overall, a good book","review":"I found that unlike what other reviewers have said, the prestige classes are by far NOT overpowered...while its true that some (like guildmage) have no disadvantages when compared with wizard, any prestige class that offers a significant advantage also doesn't give spell casting levels every level. One of the major weak points were the spells + items, the items were good, but there were far too few of them, and the spells were just bad...very few are actually useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pamphlet and Blood","review":"Well I just loved the sword and fist, so when the class guidebook for two other classes i like (wizard and sorceror) came out, I promptly bought it. And I must say, I'm satisfied.Although the price was a bit too hit (say 200%) for my tastes and the NUMBER OF PAGES (hence the title of this review), the prestige classes and feats were great. Unfortunately,The \\"description of a wizard's dwelling\\", the usual pointless advice and tables (that any player of 2 months or more already knows) was present, as in the Sword and Fist. A message to WotC: More applicable classes/feats/spells, fewer \\"transmutation is useful\\" paragraphs. The Prestige classes were interesting, fun and overall, well made. My favorites were the lucky fatespinner and the elemntal savant. A must-own for Dm's or magic-using PC's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tome and Blood","review":"Tome and Blood is a great book for anyone wanting to add more detail and life to their sorceror or wizard. It is a must have for DM that enjoy anding new spells and aspects to PCs and NPCs.

Did you read the same book? Do you play a spellcaster? If so, you, like me, will goob over these powers and abilities. True, one prestige class deals with dragons, another with demons, and two with undead, but c'mon, there are at least 12 prestige classes in here, including the Spellsword, the Bladesinger, and the Arcane Trickster. If you're looking for prosaic, try the Candle Caster.Anyhow, this book was perfect for me, and I wholeheartedly reccommend it, even though I couldn't do the same with all the previous builder books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing in it for me","review":"I hated this book. There weren't a lot of interesting things in there for me to explore. I mean, sure, Dragon Disciple, Acolyte of the Skin, Arcane Trickster, Blade Singer, and Blood Magus (especially blood magus) are good prestige classes , the rest blow! I mean, a spellsword? Oh my, you can cast spells through your sword! Big deal! Or the candle caster? That's the queerest prestige class I've ever seen in my life. The feats suck. I've never been one for metamagic feats, and that is the majority of the feats in there. The new spells aren't that great, either. The biggest plus was the familiars. I would love to have a shocker lizard or pseudodragon.Other people praise this book like it is a godsend. I personally don't prefer magic users, though I was one for a while because my party didn't have one. But now my friend, a bard, can cast a lot of spells, so I'm ditching my wizard for a rogue. That is probably the reason why I don't like the book.

Unless you are lying way back and your weight is evenly distributed, it falls back to sitting position. It seems like the manufacturer could easily fix this problem, but hasn't. It is plenty wide for a larger person like me. It's a little bit heavy to carry very far, but I have a cart that I put it in to get from my car to the pool.

The CD really makes German sound very soothing and beautiful. what can I say, 2raumwohnung ist ur genial!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shows The Errors Of The Left Behind Eschatology","review":"This is a great book to give to people that are caught up in the Left Behind series and Premillenial Dispensationalism. It's also good for anyone to read no matter what their Eschatology is. I enjoyed it a lot because I used to be a Dispensationalist as well. It shows what the Left Behind series and Dispensationalists teach about prophecy. Then it shows the main errors of that mode of interpretation. It tells what the Bible actually teaches about prophecy including the time texts and who the book of Revelation was actually written for. This book makes a lot of Biblical sense. It brings prophecy back into a more sensible viewpoint without the sensationalism and hysteria that surrounds so much prophecy teaching today."},{"rating":"1","title":"preterism","review":"I do not like this book. I fully disagree with Gary Demar. Although Math 24 is a important chapter of the bible it isnt the only authority in interpreting Revealation. He uses this chapter more than any of the others that deal with end times prophecy. He closes Revelation with the destruction of Jeruselam by the Romans in 70 AD when he himself says your not suppposed to do that in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"As biblical as DaVinci Code is historical...","review":"Just reading the assertions made in this book shows me that the author hasn't a grasp on what is means to interpret biblical prophecy. Rather than trying to refute the obvious failings of this book, I'd recomment that if the author wants to write fiction, perhaps he should take a lesson from Dan Brown and come up with some really strange ideas that no one in their right mind would believe if they were to actually do their own research."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gotta Love Her!","review":"If you are a true Alanis fan, the first rule is you must own everything she has done.Second is you must love everything she has done!This is a must for any collection to enjoy for years to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Dissapointed...","review":"I love Alanis, but I'm amazed that she allowed this DVD to be produced. First of all, there is an *extreme* drop in sound quality during some songs, as if you were hearing it from a parking lot. And after fve frustrating minutes of wondering weather I had a short in my DVD player, BAM! It came back, and you have lost the momentum. It is also filled with backstage scenes, which are alright, but can become annoying on repeated viewings. If you enjoyed JLP and SFAJ for days on end, son't buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"avoid this!","review":"do NOT get this! alanis just keeps shoving her music in her \\"fans\\" faces just to make more money. DO NOT BUY THIS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A true feast indeed!!","review":"Under Rug Swept was a fantastic album, but the nine songs on Feast on Scraps that didn't make URS are even better than the ones that did! They just rock. The live footage is, of course, incredible. This is a great Christmas present from Alanis. A must for any fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Feast to be Greatful For...","review":"I love Alanis and this dvd cd combo is superb. I love the music on the cd and I love the dvd concert, and the footage in between the songs. The footage in between the concert songs shows alanis' humor and intellect. I laughed and giggled alot. I'm not like most others who talk trash about a performer because there is no need for it, they are doing what they love to do, and that is evident with this dvd... I think Alanis is one of a kind and this dvd is worth buying and watching because you can watch it over and over and not get tired or bored with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Audio","review":"I am a big Alanis fan. I find it hard to believe that she would let this be produced. The audio portion of all her best (IMO) songs is totally destroyed by switching to other concert scenes at random times where the audio is absymal. Most of the DVD concert footage is a single concert where the audio is quite acceptable (given a live concert). However, if her song has been on the radio, the producers decided to really destroy the audio for it on this DVD. If you like her music, stay away from this one. If you like the personal side, then this is a great inside view."},{"rating":"1","title":"More garbage","review":"What the hell happened to Alanis.....up to Under rug she was a goddess, then under rug and onward she is just another Avril.....discraceful.

I purchased her DVD to see her in her most recent state after the release of \\"Under Rug Swept\\". Seeing her in the studio, on stage, and just messing around was very cool. You get to see a lot of aspects of Alanis that you don't see. The sound for the DVD is not very good. Since they used 2 different cameras to film that, she used the sound that went for each camera, and one was really kinda .... That takes away from her sound quite a bit. The Audio CD is totally awesome. There are some very good songs like \\"Offer\\" and \\"Simple Together\\" that are totally awesome. The music is definatly worth it, and it's all studio recorded, so it sounds great. So for the most part it's a good buy, minus the sound problem on the DVD. =)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Scraps are good!!","review":"I'm going to keep this review short.I like the songs.

Alanis is a hottie and I just love every second of this cd and dvd. xxxx"},{"rating":"2","title":"Get it for the DVD, not the CD","review":"Here's the thing. The CD...as an \\"album\\"...is a bit weak. The songs just aren't as catchy or focussed. They ain't bad...heck they're better than most of the stuff on \\"pop\\" radio, but in her canon...they're \\"scraps\\".The DVD is tasty though, and thoroughly entertaining. Lotsa bang for your buck you could say. Almost a \\"greatest hits\\" concert...with little bits strewn inbetween.I dug the scene where she pulls up in her limo, next to a young female fan who is blaring Alanis music from her car stereo. Alanis' gesture and the fan's reaction made for a sweet moment.A guaranteed thrill for diehard Alanis fans, and a safe purchase for those who really enjoy her music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome watch","review":"I have been eyeballing this watch for a couple of years now.

I was surprised that the religious people had such a hard time accepting and admitting that they had been taken. Like God was going to protect them from crooks. It was a fasinating read. You will enjoy it. I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing True Story","review":"I first heard about this book when I saw an advertisement in Car & Driver back in 2005. This book is an account of how two boys from California managed to scam thousands of church members into thinking that for just a small recipient fee they could have the car of their dreams. The story starts off in Larry Flynt's casino where a young man named Buddha, a high rolling gambler is playing with Flynt. Buddha and his friend are the main characters in this book and they fleece America's churchgoers for millions of dollars.I highly recommend this book who enjoys reading about true crime stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother with this one","review":"I ordered this \\"special report\\" out of curiosity having recently taken a class on trading index fund futures. It was disappointing as its 6 pages only contained basic info on index futures and nothing of any real help in trading futures. In fact, you probably could have gotten this same information for free off the web and saved yourself the price. If you want to learn about trading futures, put the money this report costs toward a good new or used book--goodness knows there are a lot of good books available right here at Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Barber of Seville","review":"I purchased this DVD because I wanted to see and hear Joyce DiDonato again after seeing and hearing her sing the role with the New York Metropolitan.

It will be an ongoing enjoyment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truely Amazing","review":"Highly recommend this book. It's an amazing true story about about a simpler time, a simple man, a unique gift and an unseen dimension. Either everyone that ever met Cayce is a liar or Cayce was for real. Some of Cayce's readings seem a little bizarre and I have to wonder if the \\"source\\" was playing with the inquirers. On the other hand, most of the supernatural information is quite valuable and useful. This book is a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book ever written about a unique and amazing man","review":"This is the biggest and best book every written about Edgar Cayce's life. It tells the whole story--and offers insight and compassion about the strange and bizarre lives led by Edgar Cayce and those around him. A must read for anyone interested in Edgar Cayce, or great Americans of the 20th century."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Scholarship-Flim Flam","review":"Although readable, the book contains many exaggerations, poor research and is certainly misleading. The author considers Cayce's reading placing the missing Amelia Earhart Northeast of Howland Island accurate, although her remains were found southeast of the island (her destination-no psychic ability here). The author also, hints that the Cayce reading on the Lindberg kidnapping was accurate although the kidnappers were found in a totally different location.Cayce's documented errors are numerous, Adolph Hitler as a Biblical savior, Atlantis, massive earth changes, failed oil wells, undiscovered treasure troves, health readings for dead people, Jesus 1998 return and on and on. Unfortunately, Cayce's miracles and wonders are largely anecdotal and undocumrnted.Will someone ever write an objective book dealing with the Cayce material?"},{"rating":"1","title":"STUNNED!!!","review":"I was stunned - absolutely STUNNED when I saw this book and had to read it - what a crock of garbage!! Edgar Cayce is a pure quack. back in the days of Webring he had 100's of \\"Edgar Cayces cure for \\"X\\"\\" (fill in the name of every and any disease known to man!) webrings - a pure charlatan! So first he can cure any illness known to man and now he is a prophet!! STUNNING!!! Stay away from this man and the pure quackery he espouses! Next ... coming soon to a small village near you!

Ughh."},{"rating":"1","title":"terminally silly, unintentionally hilarious","review":"Come on! This book can't be intended for anyone with an ounze of common sense. Totally incredible. Cayce at least had the excuse of an accidental nail in his head as a youth. Lost city of Atlantis, channeling, clairvoyance about stocks and horses, etc. Amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite long, in depth and vastly interesting","review":"THis book starts off very slow but like a nice Gravy it cooks nicely this way. It is very interesting and somewhat inspiring, as well as fascinating. It definitely satisfied the appetite I had for Mr. Cayce and his mysterious work. It is amazing after reading this book to see how unknown Edgar Cayce is these days. His accuracy is astounding. I wonder also why a movie hasn't been made about this American Prophet. SOme of this book is very hard to swallow but in all it is very enjoyable and easy to digest. I urge all Cayce wonderers or even Psychic fans to take a long peek at this amazing Biography."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kept Bookmarking Cool Passages","review":"My perspective is I am a professional psychic, so I definitely believe in gifts like Cayce had, but I generally don't like reading books on spirituality. This biography on Cayce I found very interesting. I enjoyed that the biographer gave what seems to be a very realistic and complete view of Cayce's strengths and weaknesses. There are also a huge variety of actual situations and experiences detailed in this book.

If you're ready to get in the game, and start chewing up yards for the kindom of God - buy this book.

Why not make this product without the addition of sucralose? What is the point of making a super-sweet tasing pill, for goodness sake?!

He takes a standard like 'Russian Lullaby' and transports it into Bebop heaven! 'Frelimo' rides the latin/funk train, Bebop and Birks works never sounded better. Pass, Roker and Brown shine here, who needs anyone else when this quartet gets cookin?! September song melts my heart each time.

It takes the magic out of windows programming by showing how to do everything from scratch, which, with windows forms, turns out to be pretty easy.I haven't programmed for windows since MFC, COM, and Visual Studio 6 were considered new. Windows forms makes a lot of the tasks that used to be tedious easy and Petzold as always is very easy to follow.Although this book is not an introduction into C#, it is easy to pick up assuming you already know some other languages like C++ or Java. I didn't know any C# before I started reading this book and already feel comfortable with it.One thing to note is that this book covers .NET 2.0 and the current version (as of April 2008) is .NET 3.5.

My response was that my only recourse was a negative review, and they refunded the cost of the damaged item. These folks will respond, but you have to work at getting their co-operation.

The 6th cut was paying homage to Carla Faye Tucker who was given the death penalty in Texas. Just when you think the CD might be winding down a great track appears at the end. It was nice to hear David cover an old Clapton tune off of \\"Slowhand\\". The cut is \\"May you never\\" and it sent chills threw me hearing it.

It is this secret that makes him do the bidding of an exiled wizard who has his own political agenda.But it is his vulnerability, and Suchen, which threaten him the most.A shapeshifter story, an adventure tale, a medieval type fantasy, a quest story, a gripping romance, an essay on prejudice and beliefs...

And so it went with Pavement, may it (they) rest in peace. My sadness was tempered, though - I was excited to hear what SM had up his sleeve. Unfortunately, not too much. I hope his forthcoming LP is more substantial than \\"Discretion Grove\\". This 3-song cd single is as lightweight as Fresca in a paper cup. It reminds me of how, once Big Star collapsed, Alex Chilton abdicated (to a substantial degree)his pop sensibilities. Malkmus has seemingly put little effort into this recording.

Some people prefer one over the other, but I like both. This album was recorded before years in prison listening to John Coltrane and playing tenor sax altered his approach. This album is emotional, but the emotions are simply different. This is straight-ahead jazz masterfully played by all involved. Without a doubt one of the greatest jazz recordings of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best!","review":"This CD is recommended very highly. One of Pepper's very best records and a great study of one of the all time best rhythm sections. Nice to hear Miles' band without Miles, having to adapt on the spot to a new soloist. The interplay is superb, as is the tune selection. Standards and jazz classics. Dig how they completely revitalize the old New Orleans standard \\"Jazz Me Blues\\".Art's story about the making of this album doesn't quite mesh with his own discography. He in fact had been making some records in the proceeding weeks and months. Art probably was also doing some serious 'goofing', so his memory may have failed him. Plus his story made for better reading. In any event, this is one of the great recordings in jazz history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Komedas best album","review":"Half the songs are excellent, the rest are good to ok.The only complaint is the one song (Campfire) thast not sung by Lena.My freind loved the album too, and he listens to completely different music than I do.Kokomemedada isn't as good (too many songs not by Lena) but its still very good"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, quirky pop oddity","review":"I can't explain it, but this album is great. It's not the writing, it's not the musicianship... it's something else. Imagine if you crossed David Byrne with Abba, and stirred in a generous helping of the Cranberries. You'd get sort of an odd, latin-influenced, poppy-melodic, guitar-oriented confection. I'm really digging this CD.

We all became educated about the game Go from this series and we now have our own board and stones!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better in the Japanese with Sub titles","review":"I know that Anime often uses adults to do the voices of the kids. However, I feel that in this case, either the wrong choices were made for the English version or the voices were directed/coached improperly. I've been a huge fan of this series for years and until recently could only watch the anime on the web. It was nice to see it on DVD but I found the English voices to be fairly annoying--they sound too forced and somewhat childish. Shindo and friends are young, but not childish. I was initially disappointed but then switched to Japanese voices with English subtitles. There's a lot more emotion, interest and excitement in the original Japanese. Now I really enjoy the DVDs in the original language. I recommend the series because the topic is so unique, the characters are well-developed, and the plot easily retains your interest over the whole series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely addicting!!!","review":"I have seen this entire series at least three times in Japanese, and found myself absolutely obsessed with the series. Each character is individually crafted and each has a unique and fascinating personality and his or her own story to tell. The story totally draws you in, Sai is cute and sad at the same time in his desire to play Go, Hikaru is annoying at first but grows tremendously throughout the story, both emotionally and intellectually. It's a story of love, friendship, the search for excellence, the power of persistance, and the indomitable spirit that fills each one of us. As so many others have stated after seeing this, I wanted to play Go too, I want to meet other people who play Go, and the characters now live in my heart for all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hikaru No Go ~WoW~","review":"I just finished watching the third DVD of this series and I have to say this is normally not my cup of tea. I was amazed how much this kept my interest and me asking for more at the end of every DVD. It is unique in the best way. It was nice to see a different story line. I can't imagine anyone watching this and not getting wrapped up in it. No matter what your age is I'm sure you will love this anime.

Plus there are bulges on the sides of the heels and the socks slip forward, which is another sign these are too small.

I have no idea how they can claim 4K production - somewhere along, if it was indeed produced in 4K, someone screwed up. Anyone thinking this will be any sort of showcase for video should look elsewhere - It's quite possibly one of the worst Blu-rays out there.Now on to the content - I found it to be a little lackluster because there seems to be no actual audio of the animals, just mediocre music (which may entertain a 3 year old, but it did nothing for my enjoyment).

The thing that is making me send it back after three weeks of use is that a part fell off.

I like the \\"green\\" factor of the reusable filter however."},{"rating":"1","title":"I do not recommend this coffeemaker","review":"Maxi-Matic EHS - 2055 Elite Cuisine 10-Cup Coffeemaker (Made in China)Because of the low price this coffeemaker may be acceptable for people who do not drink coffee but want to have a coffeemaker handy for company. This entire unit is very light weight so I have to hold the base of the unit when removing and replacing the coffee pot otherwise I'd be chasing the coffee maker all over the counter. The coffee does not come out hot enough. It is one degree above luke warm so I have to microwave each cup. I make several pots of coffee per day I have found this coffeemaker very disappointing.

I figured starting with his short stories would help. I was right.Jin is able to take a complicated idea and distill it to its core. The simple prose and clear discriptions lack any pretension or effort at purple prose. The result is an almost too-real portrait of a China in transition. The disturbing insecurity and lack of control is unnerving to American readers. The result is a look at a side of China, with all its own peculiarities, revealed.You'll get more than you bargain for, with the abruptly ending stories lingering around in your mind, the carefully sketched characters seeking a life in your imagination."},{"rating":"2","title":"Retro Style","review":"I bought these earrings because they reminded me of a pair of gold hoops with similar stampings that my mother had.

It's the best! If you got the Oops!...I Did It Again Remixes (Import) and u were dissapointed, then don't hesitate to get this one b/c it's way better!! Plus it's only like $7 or something. The Best REMIX on the Cd is definitely #5, the Jack D. Elliot Remix. Here are the tracklistings to help ya out a bit.1) Album Version - you know this one 2) Mac Quayle Club Mix - LONG! (almost 8 minutes) Good though 3) Pablo La Rosa's Tranceformation - another long, yet good mix 4) Miguel 'Migs' Vocal Mix - slow and sultry, unique mix 5) Jack D. Elliot Club Mix - ONCE AGAIN, the Best!

She needs to have another number one single people! :) Have fun guys, and happy holidays! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stronger","review":"This new track from Britney Spears is not too bad. I must admit though that the remixes make the song more happening. The most notable remix on this single would have to be the Mac Quayle Club Mix.

Well anyway, it's a good remix and I recommend this single to all club fanatics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid at all costs!","review":"There is absolutely no reason to buy this maxi single.

THIS CD ROCKS!!! (200 stars)","review":"This Cd rules. First of all, there's the album version. Great song in itself, kinda reminds me of Crazy. And then there's the first remix. A good mix. Not the best one on the Cd but good for groovin. And next is the PLA's tranceformation. A really fast stronger. Don't try doing the dance from the video to this one. You'll hurt yourself. I speak from experience. Then there's the vocal mix. Slow and sultry. Let's you hear Britney, instead of the robot type thing, but the music reminds me of Broken Heart. This is probably the worst one. Next, we have the grand daddy of all stronger remixes. We hear Britney at her best. At her peak. This is The best song I've ever heard come from those beautiful lips. Finally, there's the No Shame mix. Kinda Hip-hoppy. Okay remix. Another great groovin song. And thats it. BUY this now! Money well spent. Don't waste it on the 2 track single. BUY THIS ONE!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome, some great remixes of a great song","review":"Stronger is already a great, techno-influenced pop track on Britney's album and is one of my favs. It has a lot of edge, and isn't quite as formulaic as we are used to, it has more of a futuristic and electronic sound to it that music is starting to turn towards. My fav remixes here are 2 and 5 (5 is really cool). Three is also neat, it gives sort of a softer appeal to the song. Four and Six aren't as good, but still worth hearing. My friend had never heard Stronger originally nor did he listen to Britney, but he was blown away by the techno remixes and then I told him who he was listening to. if you like Stronger, you probably already have the album, but it is definitley worth getting the remixes because they will blow you away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I hope I don't hear this again!","review":"Don't get me wrong, I used to think Brit was great when she first came out and yes, I did own both of her CD's and all..but this song..it gets really annoying really fast and her voice is whiny sounding and it drives me crazy.I don't know how anyone can stand listening to this or any of her other songs..as far as I'm concerned, her songs all sound the same.

However it does not mention much about Earth but rather what humans are doing wrong and offers a few suggestions on how to help. As my family is already environmentally conscious, my son just had a look of \\"what the...??\\" on his face while watching this.Most of the songs are not very good or catchy and some are rather heavy handed.I will admit it is my fault for not looking into it more before getting it but just be aware these are lessons in saving the environment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware - Hidden Propoganda","review":"Not only is this collection of new School House Rock shorts nowhere near as catchy as the originals, it is also a piece of propaganda. Every possible good theme, be it recycling or saving water, is somehow tied back to the myth of Global Warming. Worse yet, the packaging never mentions Global Warming. If you are a skeptic like me and millions of others, avoid this video like the plague. Our copy went in the recycling bin.

No. They encapsulate much that is wrong with the current green movement. (Don't get me wrong. I say this as a card-carrying member of the Green Party. I'm dyed in the wool Green, but we have to be able to criticize ourselves.) The idea of \\"humans saving nature\\" is way off base. Pure hubris. Granted, sympathy for cute animals is an easy sell for kids. Teaching respect for all living things is also good, but I'm not sure these videos do that. That would imply a far more spiritual approach. Most of these videos fall into a sort of dreary technocratic mode. In my opinion, the message should be one of survival and reverence: We have to change our way of living as a matter of survival, and we should live sustainably as a matter of respect for Mother Earth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Co-Opted?","review":"School house rock used to be a useful tool to educate by virtue of actual facts and truthful information, now this earth video is pure Liberal propaganda as man made global warming is a Liberal fabricated hoax and our youngest minds are being indoctrinated with their \\"opinion and ideology\\" It's a shame that school house rock has been co-opted to feed little kids with false propaganda for the purposes of promoting an agenda."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looking for education, not brainwashing","review":"This is a brainwashing video on the Global Warming agenda.

Glad I borrowed this video and did not actually buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete propaganda, not to metion its based on non-science","review":"No way my kids get to watch this. The labeling on the rear should be enough. This is an indoctrination video, not educational, I feel a little sick that this and other videos like it are out there. Don't insult your own intelligence. The original series is absolutely fantastic, to this day I remember every lesson. I hope that the same effect doesn't happen with the new video with modern video. The animation and 'lessons' are nowhere near as good, however, so I doubt it, not to mention the government school program teaches kids to have an ultra short-term memory anyway, hence most Columbia grad students can't tell you who the Speaker of the House is...."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"I bought this hoping it will take me through various steps to come up with detailed trading plan.

Anyway, Jade was one of my favorite groups during the 90's when girl groups like SWV, TLC, Xscape, Black Girl, Brownstone, and Zhane hit the charts. My favorites on the album are \\"I Wanna Love You\\" , \\"Don't Walk Away\\", and \\"Looking for Mr. Do Right\\". The singers have excellent harmony and can really sing! The songs are really catchy!

The trio are a lot more talented than their compitition, but fell off with some production issues. The upbeat production of their singles, \\"Don't Walk Away\\" and \\"I Wanna Love You\\", can very well have you feeling alive all of a sudden. Pleading for pleasure from lovers on \\"Give Me What I'm Missing\\" makes you think if there's something missing in your own relationship with this slow sexual groove. \\"Looking For Mr. Do Right\\" is another slow grinder completes the overall appeal to this release. Jade's debut calls on your emotional and listening pleasure by the moaning \\"I Want 'Cha Baby\\". There are a few fillers on this, but the songs that grabs you, captivates you."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must have for your music collection","review":"I own this CD and I love it from beginning to end!

This CD has been in my collection for quite some time now and it still gets continuous spins in my CD player. The ladies sing each song with real energy and emotion.Songs like \\"Goin' Out With The Girls,\\" \\"I Want 'Cha Baby,\\" and \\"Don't Walk Away\\" really get you moving and add some joy to your day.

Very moving, and gives me an understanding of what life is like in areas of serious conflict in the world (with a particular focus on Angola). My only complaint about this book is that the writing could be better (don't get me wrong, it's not bad, it just seems a little choppy). Everyone should read this book.

How can you make a so-called documentary about a great musician like George Harrison and not have any of his music on it? It looks like this thing was slapped together by a small group of amateurs who simply wanted to exploit George's death. Everyone involved in this project should be ashamed of themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Since George Harrison is a great musical spirit, who brought and still brings so much joy to us now, this documentary movie was a severe disappointment. It was so bad, it was almost laughable. It appeared that the movie was made in someone's basement -- the quality, in addtion to the content, of the film -- was very poor.Curiously, there were no words or songs by Harrison in the movie, perhaps, because the producers could not get the copyrights or permissions from Harrison's estate. If this was the case, it was a good thing they did not get the permissions, as this was an awful rendition of what should have, and could have been done to honor this great music giant.There is still a movie to be made, so wait until someone else makes, it, cause you won't find it here."},{"rating":"2","title":"better in order","review":"This is the 3rd in the series. I'd read the second, and was too confused to enjoy it. I was right, I enjoyed the 3rd more than the 2nd, because I was familiar with the characters. Must look for the first one.The Good:Interesting world.Nice mix of characters and kinds of stories.It's fun to see the different authors' interpretations of the world and each other's characters.The Bad:It can be confusing if you haven't read any other books in the series. The individual stories don't explain a lot.The Verdict:It's a fun series, worth searching for, particularly if you read them in order."},{"rating":"1","title":"ARMEN BOLADIAN IS EVIL","review":"The Clark Sisters (and their legacy) deserve much better than what Armen Boladian and his people put together to reissue The Clarks' first recordings for the Sound Of Gospel record label.DO NOT BUY THIS REISSUE OR ANY MP3S FROM IT. It is waste of your money - The Clarks deserve better - just say a prayer that better and higher quality reissues will be released."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent new version of Desert Music","review":"This is a beautiful recording, highly recommended for all Reich lovers and those who want to get an idea of his music. I never would have believed that I could like any version of The Desert Music better than the Michael Tilson Thomas full orchestra/choir recording, but I was quite mistaken. The composer tries to avoid large forces and goes for the intimacy and clarity of fewer voices per part (this means both the choir and the orchestra), and this reworking really does suit his music much better. This album is masterfully produced and excellently balanced. Alan Pierson is a gifted interpreter of Reich's music (see also Music for a Large Ensemble, on the Nonesuch album with Triple Quartet), and we hope to hear more from him and this ensemble. P.S. I, too, was able to hear the live performance last year in NYC!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun book","review":"My daughter and I both love the book.

She brings it to us all the time asking us to \\"Read the paint book.\\" The drawings are colorful and fun - my daughter likes to point out certain things in the pictures, including a dog who seems to be the innocent bystander as the mischievous painter redecorates himself and the house!

This book is it! The illustrations are fantastic and the song is hysterical. GREAT book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes a child want to read!","review":"This book is just so fun! It teaches about colors and the body and in such a fun fashion. I saw a review where it focused on the grammer and that the child was BAD, but the child in this book was just being a child.The vivid colors and the easy reading style just brings a child back again and again. I must have read this book to my grandchildren 100 times...and they still love it! It's a wonderfully done book. Our favorite!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun book to read aloud","review":"Fun to read to preschoolers - Kindergarteners in circle time and to let them come up with the rhyming parts.

It's about a little boy who paints the walls, ceilings, doors and curtains in his house. His mom said that he can't paint any more! She puts the paints up high in a closet. This doesn't stop the little boy. He stacks items and climbs up them to get down the paint. Then he starts to paint HIMSELF!! He paints his self all over until he runs out of paint and he him sees what he's done. Then it's off the tub for our little artist.What did you like or not like about the book?The book is written in wonderful rhyming text , has colorful pictures, and it's FUNNY!Would you recommend this book?

The art is incredible, making you and your children want to look at each page for longer than it takes to read them. The look on the child's face as he/she paints herself is pure joy! Her faithful dog is also along on the paint journey. The nice thing is the child in the book could be either a girl or a boy, so you can gear it towards your child.My two girls ages 5 and 2 love this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dangerous in the best possible way","review":"This book is dangerous in the best possible way, and my 23 mo daughter latched on immediately. By 'dangerous', I mean celebrating rebellion, and if you have a problem with that, knock off a star. There are so many dimensions to the book, I easily understand why it it so compelling. The use of color, and lack thereof, is well done. The colors, shapes, and images invite discussion. The storyline, top to bottom (both figuratively and literally), is logical, with a delayed-gratification (page turn required) rhyming scheme. Highly recommended.A final note: I can't help but wonder if the artist has been inspired by Ralph Steadman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story, but, Southern English","review":"This is a good story and concept.But, buy this if you want your kid to learn Southern English.When we read it, we replace the Southern English with the correct words."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT English","review":"Ain't and gonna and \\"no more\\" are NOT proper English and I have no clue why any mom would ever want to teach their children this.

Also, only half of the article is actually by Linda Richardson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This is really good soundtrack music from biker music and action movies from the mid 60s to the early 70s. It is highly orchestrated, with big waves of sound, and huge crasendos: the type of soundscapes you would hear on, say, the Increadible Hulk, or Batman.For some reason, Phillips was hired to score biker movies and adventure trash, while Jerry Goldsmith, Lalo Schifrin, and Quincy Jones got high end movies and art house fare. So Stu's tone color is not nearly as complex or subtle as those giants-there is no jazz reflex in this material whatsoever- but that does not take away from how powerful and enjoyable this music is. I think you will have a lot of fun listening to this compilation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Need More Rock Music","review":"Of course, the guy did movie soundtracks so I shouldn't complain. I guess I expected more along the line of The Carrie Nations from \\"Beyond the Valley of The Dolls\\" which was probably Stu's crowning acheivement. Never-the-less, there are some good tracks mid-way and threw the end of this CD that have a little more of the hippy rock music I was hoping for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Convenience in a Capsule","review":"This product was recommended to me specifically by my orthopedist following injections for my arthritic knees. I find it works better than the different brands of glucosamine/chondroitin I'd been taking for about a year on advice of my regular doctor. Taking two capsules a day after a few months (rather than three)is a true convenience and easier to remember in my schedule. The capsules are very easy to swallow."},{"rating":"2","title":"love the product, hate the supplier","review":"I think that this is the best glucosamine product on the market, but the supplier offered double dose version for about the same price as the normal dose and then shipped the regular version.

I found that, after a couple of months use, it reduced my need pain meds and anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs). I've now had two hips replaced, and my shoulders are starting to complain, but I find that my discomfort increases if I stop taking the Cosamin DS.

My son absolutely loved it!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice for a Toy Train","review":"I have had no problems at all...it is a great train and my 2.5 yr old loves it. Based on reviews, I put new batteries in it (not the ones that came with it) when I got it. No problems.No problems staying on the track at all. The track is on carpet and actually partially goes over the tree skirt at points. At one point the track isn't even completely level causing the train to lean a little on an outside curve. It has never come off and works great.Regarding quality. I was actually impressed by the quality of the cars for a plastic toy....nice colors, looked pretty well made to me.My only wish is that I could turn off the artificial engine noise and just let it go around the tree, \\"silently\\".Worth the price easily and looking forward to the memories it will create."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pay the extra $ & get a better train","review":"I should have listened to the bad reveiws.

We have a 5 year old 2 year old that love trains and the Poar Express movie. The thing is junk. It rarely makes it around the track and now will not go at all. The train derails easily and cars come apart as well. the sound effects are cute but that is about it. I would not recommend this train to anyone looking for a good train for the holidays."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remote Control is not functioning as a remote","review":"My father bought this for my 3 year old son and we are all wondering how come the train has some sounds when turned on but it doesn't move. We replaced the batteries that come with it with new ones and same result. After few minutes of trial and also reading the entire manual, the train moves when the remote control is touching the train. If it leaves more than a few inches from the train, it stops. My son who likes trains lost interest that he cannot control the train since we attached the remote on top of the train to keep it moving. I checked the manual that the remote should work within 10 feet from the train. Apparently, this is a defective unit. I already initiated the return process from Amazon, but I'm not thinking of getting the same model. It's difficult to put the train on the tracks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wire connection is very frustating........waste of money","review":"We are really frustrated with its wire connection.

I do not like this train at all!!!!!!!!!!!.......but if you are looking for something cheaper you should get this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BROKEN OUT OF BOX","review":"Bought this train July1, for Christmas morning. Kept the train in the shipping box until Christmas Eve, when I took it out to wrap it.Opened Christmas morning for a very excited Autistic child who LOVES the Polar Express only to hear the motor whirr but the engine wheels would not turn. Had to wait til the local model railroad shop opened after the holidays to drop it off. Just found out that the gears in this BRAND NEW JUST OPENED TRAIN are not available, so this new train cannot be repaired. As a single mom on a budget, with a child whose obsession is Lionel trains, and especially the Polar Express train/movie/books.... I AM SO DISAPPOINTED! I may cease ordering from Amazon entirely because this now makes twice that I have ordered items tht are btoken out of the box or filthy out of the bag."},{"rating":"2","title":"As advertised","review":"Nice looking, sounding train. Good for around the Christmas tree. Glad it turns itself off. Uses a lot of batteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked great for 3 days","review":"Worked great for 3 days and then one day it just stopped working - no lights, no movement, nothing. Switching between two new 9.6v batteries didn't make a difference.The engine (when it works) is fast and reasonably well put together. Clearly a kid's toy, not a model train in the usual sense. The track is cheap plastic that doesn't really fit together very well - putting together one curve joint will often partially separate another. The human figures mount on pegs that are easy to break off.Disappointing really... My son really loved it, but I think a return is in order."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work for more than an hour!!!","review":"Just purchased this beautiful train set as a welcome home from the hospital gift for my son from his newborn brother. As it was for christmas, we ordered early as i was headed to the hospital to have the baby, so we set it up on christmas eve under the tree. My son loved it, and was able to navigate the remote without a problem. The issue we have is that the train worked for about 1hour total before it stopped functioning! The train powers up and the whistle buttons work, but when you position the remote to move forward or backward, the engine shuts down. Its not a battery problem, as we quickly replaced them hoping it was a simple solution. It seems to be a potential fuse problem, or defective train altogether. As we ordered early due to the baby's arrival, we are now outside of the 30 return window for amazon. We have no way to replace the train with a working version for my very disappointed son & are out the $$ as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"The train hooks are cheap","review":"I paid too much for a train.

Good news, brought extras just in case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible. Badly designed lasted one hour. Do Not Buy!!","review":"Man, everything is wrong with this train. We got one for our four-year old and it lasted an hour with my supervision. The track is really badly designed and hard on your hands when you try to put it together. The 4 (or 6?)C batteries are in the coal car, and the wire connector dealie to the engine was the wrong size and slipped out all the time. Get an O-gauge. Lionel should be ashamed of this product. We went out the next day and bought one of the O gauge stes, which is really good, Winnie loves it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't stay on track","review":"Cute concept, but it constantly derails and there isn't enough track for the length of the train. I'm stumped as to how how other people report that it runs fine. This was a gift from someone else, so I will not return it but I'm glad I didn't buy it. So far, my four-year-old isn't as frustrated with it as I am."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Pain","review":"I bought this item because I thought it would be a great \\"Under the Tree\\" decoration and toy for the grandkids. It would probably work well as a decoration if you never turned it on. It comes off the track too easily. Difficult to get back on track. Practically have to \\"hug the floor\\" to get low enough to see the wheels and where to place them. Impossible for kids to do. Difficult for grandpa."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great christmas train for grandson","review":"The train is great for small children it has a bell, whistle and an announcement all aboard for the Polar Express. It has forward and reverse and also has steam sounds. I had to lube some parts to make it run better but it does do well. It does require suppervision for small children but the remote controll is very easy to operate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Negative reviews said it out loud","review":"Unfortunately I had read the reviews after ordering .and I was able to relate to all the negative reviews.I was trying to believe that at this cost it just can't be true,but1. It is really difficult to place train on track and connect cars while keeping all on the track.2. Uses up loads of batteries.3.poor quality.My almost 5 year old boy is crazy about trains,he was waiting to get polar express anxiously for two months.once he got it and we set it up,he played with it two times and placed it back in the box. Asked me to send it back to Lionel and to tell them about all its problems,but I live in jordan and had ordered it on the Internet and paid shipping and customs and the box is big so it would cost me too much to return. But we were all so very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke in a week!","review":"The train was nice initially (although mostly plastic) and my 3 year old son loved it. Unfortunately, within one week of getting the train the engine would suddenly lose power and stop. Pressing the on button wouldn't work. Adjusting the connector cable between the tender and the engine would sometimes allow the train to restart, but it would soon abruptly lose power again and stop. Replacing the batteries had no effect."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a good train for impatient children","review":"I spent the whole day Christmas trying to figure out how to get the train and train tracks to stay connected. The whole day my son came to me crying at least 20 times asking me to fix it. I tried rubber bands, string, tape, pliers and it a few were successful however it doesn't look all that good and my son did not want the main battery powered trains connected to the caboose ones. He wanted to be able to unplug it and move the conductor around. So I can say that this train was the biggest pain of my life. I do not know who designed it but to make a train that can't attach to the other pieces was pointless. It is not that hard to make a latch that attaches and detaches."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorely disappointed, cheap product, don't buy it!","review":"Bought it in July right after my son saw the movie. He played with it for a few days and then we packed it up to bring it out at Christmas so he'd enjoy it under the tree and for his birthday. Darn thing wouldn't work at all. It'd been stored carefully in original packaging, with the batteries removed. Hooked it up Christmas Day and...nothing. Got new batteries all around. Still nothing. My son begs me to fix it every time he sees the tree. What an awful experience! No idea what to do now -- return or double down from a retail store vs Amazon since it'll cost me a bunch to return for a partial refund. Oh, and I agree with all the comments about poor workmanship. It isnt the Lionel of old. More money for Brio trains. Don't play the odds, don't buy this product, or at least not on Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprised and disappointed","review":"I found this toy in the end to be very expensive to operate. My son is younger and wanted it running for a couple of hours on Christmas morning and during that time the toy consumed 6 \\"C\\" cell batteries. The Amazon site does not tell you about the \\"C\\" cell batteries only the \\"AA\\" batteries, that is a big slip up. Since Christmas this is about 6 batteries per day! At BJ's those same batteries are about 14.00 per dozen. The locomotive is very detailed and made of plastic, what happens is a young one likes to carry his locomotive around and the plastic bends. I have a choice to make, spend 100.00 on quality rechargable batteries or send this back and buy the 260.00 Polar express \\"O\\" guage set which is very high quality and metal. In the end I'm disappointed in Amazon for not mentioning the \\"C\\" batteries and Lionel for not putting a permanent power source on board. I would tell a friend to save their money and buy the \\"O\\" gauge set over this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"polar express, thumbs up","review":"My wife and I purchased this train as a last minute gift for our 4 yr old. The train seems pretty well built, it comes with quite a bit of track the engine, coal car and 2 passenger cars. My son was so excited that santa left it for him. He has played with it alot and we have had no problems at all. It doesnt derail, the cars stay connected and it runs pretty realistic with sounds and motion. We will have this for many years to come at christmas, overall I'd say its a pretty good set."},{"rating":"2","title":"big hit with my 5 year old","review":"I purchased this train because my son loved playing with his grandparents R/C train every year when they put it up around their Christmas tree. So my son put it on his list to Santa. I researched trains on Google and came up with this one. My son loves the Polar Express movie so I thought it would be great.Well, we got it a few days before Christmas. Perfect timing seeing how I ordered it late. We love it. We used it on just the regular C batteries and 3 days later it is still running fine. I ordered the rechargeable batteries for it, but they have not been delivered yet. We are very happy with this purchase. The train even works off the track on the wood floor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"My son was very excited to get this train. It is wonderful looking but the hooks that are supposed to hold the trains together, do not stay together. It was very frustrating trying to keep the cars hooked up and also trying to keep them on the tracks. I finally ended up taping the train car hooks together!! My son lost interest and went on to play with something else. =("},{"rating":"2","title":"Product Satisfaction","review":"Japan had sent to me, I am satisfied without damage if you are too tightly packed, it arrived very quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money.","review":"This seemed like a good product at first but didn't last long. Very cheap plastic and track parts do not link together very well after a few uses. I would not spend money on this again. My son played with it for several times and then the track was hard to put together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed, Sorry!","review":"What a cute train! I've had the train up for four days. Until yesterday, it has never made it around the track once without shutting down. It says it automatically turns off in ten minutes when not in use. Not so! I had to unplug the engine from the Coal Car and after four days had to change all batteries again.In all fairness, last night, we changed the batteries and it made it around the track four times without stopping. Also, the train cars do not stay hooked. I had to scotch tape the cars together.It's a cute train set and my 5,6 and 7 year old grandsons will love it around the Christmas tree this year, but it's not the Lionel that I remember as a kid. Hope this helps someone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Toy Train","review":"I have loved trains since I was a child. I own both the \\"O\\" Guage and now the \\"G\\" guage versions. There are differnces between the two, but those who love trains usually know what they are buying before they purchase it. This G guage is plastic, not metal like the O, but it is wonderful nevertheless. It has all the magic of a toy train, beautifully built, great sounds, nice electronics that make the engine slow and speed realistically, and the wonderful extras like the ghost on the roof who disappears when you flip him over. I love this train and anyone who know Lionel, will understand and love this train. I give 4 stars because the track does not snap as good as it could, but no problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I seriously considered not purchasing this item because of the negative reviews. However, it was the BIG ITEM on my 4 y/o son's Christmas list. I didn't want him to be disappointed that Santa didn't bring his Polar Express train, so I reluctantly purchased it. Boy, was I pleasantly surprised! Santa really delivered. This train is beautiful! Everything my little guy was dreaming of. It comes in an easy to unpack/re-pack box that is great for putting it away during non-play time. It is sturdy and easy to assemble. It is easy to control. Most importantly, it is absolutely charming with great details. I'm not sure what went wrong with the folks who gave negative reviews, possibly wrong expectations. However, I must say that the item description covers it well. If you're looking for a Polar Express train lovely enough to collect, but simple, sturdy, and inexpensive enough to give to a child, look no further."},{"rating":"1","title":"Santa Failed w/ This Train","review":"We are so upset with this train. My husband bought it about a month ago just thinking it would be fun for he and our 3-year-old to play together on christmas morning. Then by chance our son has started asking everyday for the Polar Express Train. We were thrilled - couldn't wait until this morning. HA - the joke's on us. This train is junk. It doesn't fit on the track well at all to start and the worst thing is the couplers won't stay connected EVER. When family arrived later this morning all he could tell them was \\"I got a Express train and it falls off!!\\" It wasn't just the 3-year-old, none of us could make it stay connected. You can only use the engine and tender and it makes it around one time before falling off. VERY POORLY CONSTRUCTED. I am a LONG time Amazon shopper and have NEVER felt the need to review a product in years... until now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken upon arrival","review":"My 2 1/2 year old son and I were both excited as I opened the box to set up our new train. After patiently putting it together and reading the instruction manual, we turn on both the train and the controller, confirmed the lights were on, and gave the signal for the train to move forward. Nothing happened. So we put it in reverse, nothing happened. I pressed the buttons for the sounds. Nothing happened. It isn't the batteries, because I switched those out. I'm trying to find out whether I should take it to a dealer for \\"repair\\" or if I should send it back to Amazon. Either way, it has been a bad experience and shook my faith in Lionel's quality. It apparently has gone downhill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Starter Train - fun for all","review":"My husband and daughter had a blast putting together the track and playing with the train. I also purchased additional track and it took up my entire living floor space. It was amazingly cool. Looking forward to adding additional cars and engines to the track."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lionel disappoints","review":"Our engine only lasted a little over a year. The warranty is only good for a year and Lionel won't service or sell individual pieces for the G guage trains.

Shame on Lionel for not supporting their products or customers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the O guage version instead","review":"This review is of the G-gauge version of the Polar Express Lionel train set.This train was a real disappointment. This set is just unremarkable when comepared to the slightly more expensive ($20-$30 more) O-Gauge version.This G-gauge version runs on batteries instead of an external transformer; which makes for a limited run-time before it is tme to replace the batteries.I now have the O-Gauge version of this set and am delighted by it. But the G-gauge version is a second class wanna-be version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible customer service, and poor quality","review":"As someone who relies on Amazon reviews heavily please read! This train looked great, we got it as a gift for Christmas for our boys. We took it out and used it that day then put it away. We pulled it out 1 yr later when we put our tree up this year and it wouldn't work at all. We used it for a total of 2 hrs. The company was rude and we had to really push them to get it repaired under warranty, we sent it out and still have not received anything back almost a month later. Repeated calls to inquire about what is going on have lead no where, they don't care and never have any information. I'm not sure what is going on with this company but they have ruined a good name with cheap Chinese toys and lousy customer service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work properly, poor construction","review":"We were so excited for the train set, but after it arrived today we already noticed the cheap plastic construction, which wouldn't have bothered us too much if the train worked! It goes for 5 inches and shuts off. Every single time. My kids were so disappointed! I'm not even willing to try for another unit (I'm sure this one is defective), because I worry that it will break down quickly and not last, as intended, as a train we can set up for many Christmases to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL, just plain AWFUL","review":"VERY VERY CHEAP PIECE OF JUNK!train barely runs, it strains so hard to continue around the track! Also, the train tracks do not connect very well. The remote control is garbage, you really don't have much control over the train, and you have to be within 3ft of the track! Why not just use a wired connection if you have to be that close!Junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this train set","review":"Avoid this set at all costs. This set has to be one of the worst toys we've ever purchased. The engine, tender and passenger cars are cheap plastic and the track segments come undone easily. The wheels are very difficult to mount on the track correctly and perhaps most frustrating of all, the cars do not remained coupled. The supposed couplers allow for the cars to come undone so often that the train is constantly derailing. It's obvious Lionel could fix the problems with this set rather easily and without adding much to the total cost of the set and that they refuse to make these fixes because their expectation is that parents will be forced to buy the more expensove O gauge set. Seeing the expression on my four year old son's face when the cars constantly became uncoupled was heartbreaking. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS SET."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy with purchase","review":"Train engine light does not work nor does it make any sounds. Was assured that this deal was a return-more of an open-box type of deal, and that everything would be inspected and in working order. That just didn't happen.

I guess a lesson learned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all what i expected","review":"This product took my wife and i almost 1.5 hours to put together. We noticed that the tracks would not stay together as there was to much stress on them. it appeared that if one additional piece of track was provided, it would have taken the stress away and allowed the track to stay together. Also, the quality was not what was expected. Our in-laws purchased a train for half the price and its better quality. If you want to spend counless hours putting a track together and continuing to do so along with placing the train back on the track after it hops off, this is the train for you. best of luck to anyone who purchases it."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a pile of junk my kids heart is broken on christmas","review":"So I ordered this as a lightning deal. All my kid wanted was a polar express train set from Santa. He was so happy when he opened it. Well put everything together & the train engine smoked & seized up never even moved. Now my kids crying & upset. What an epic fail & Lionel is a junk company. & on top of it I cant even exchange it only a refund. Thx for nothing. DO NOT BUY THIS or anything from Lionel. & I will never do an amazon \\"deal\\" again because its usually warehouse defective. Never do the lightning deal! You cant exchange it.

I could not have been more wrong! This is the worst quality plastic piece of crap I have ever seen! My son's birthday was ruined because the train ran for about 15 seconds before the controller quit. There is really nothing about this train that is any good at all. I will never buy Lionel again! I am sorry a quality American company has been reduced to this. Apparently they are content to sell Chinese junk with their (formerly) good name on it. I tried to contact their customer service, but they keep bankers hours and there website is a nightmare.

My brother and I had a classic heavy metal (not the Black Sabbath type) set of Lionel but I knew these wouldn't be like those. Nevertheless, the set is detailed very nicely, beautifully crafted and functions very well. It is an excellent choice for the budding train master in your home.I'd recommend it.You get three cars plus the steam locomotive. Remote control included.You'll need six (6) 'C' batteries and two (2) 'AA' batteries (use fresh ones).Bells and whistles (not loud but fun).A dozen curved tracks and four straight ones are included, as are two small plastic characters.If you are going to set it up on a board, you are going to need one at least 6'x5' in size.It's not the 1950's Lionel train set, but your preteen children should enjoy it (and maybe some of the parents as well)."},{"rating":"2","title":"GoodChristmasGift","review":"We got this Polar Express train for our 6yr old for Christmas and he loves it! It's a great train for this age, since he knows to be gentle with it to avoid knocking it off the track. He loves the sounds it makes and especially the remote to make it go fast/slow and forward/back.The train was fun for a month and then he grew tired of it, mostly because it just went around in a circle and he couldn't add more tracks or create his own longer track.Our 3 year old wanted to take it off the track a lot and became frustrated in getting back on the tracks, so not a fun toy for under 4yrs old.So, I'd say it's a good Chritmas gift, but don't expect it to last all year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great train!","review":"Made my 4-year old son's day on Christmas morning when it was running under the tree, just like in the movie.

We were originally searching for a metal train for durability, but weren't finding much in a reasonable price range. We decided on this one, even though it was plastic. So far, this train is holding up exceptionally well. It seems to be well made and he can operate the remote just fine. The sound effects are great. My husband says the track is too short, but I think that is probably an overall male opinion on the matter. :) We are very pleased with the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Polar Express Train for Christmas tree","review":"Gave it to the kids as an early Christmas present on a night we lit a fire, decorated the Christmas tree and did some baking in the kitchen. It was a perfect night. We loved it, kids loved it, loved the little people that you could move around on it. Kids loved the bell, whistle, and voice from polar express. Just had a little difficulty keeping the train on the tracks for long periods of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the money, exactly what I was looking for","review":"I was looking for a big scale train for around our Christmas tree. This train was exactly what we hoped for. Detailed, big scale, easy to set up and take down, and had a lot of neat details and features. I am not sure how long it works on batteries yet, but it can also use a rechargeable battery pack (not included). The train looks great around our tree, and I am completely satisfied, and pleasantly surprised by this purchase. The only thing I would advise is that it is more of a toy train/novelty type of train. If you are a serious train collector or looking for something more expensive, this may not be the train for you. It is mostly plastic and not meant to be an expensive, top grade product...it is good for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remote Control Range is about 2 feet","review":"Remote Control range is about 2 feet, I actually have to follow the train or lay the remote control on top of the train to keep it going.

Our three year old fell in love with The Polar Express story this year. Since we were ready to get him a starter train set we figured what better one. So on Christmas Eve my brother-in-law who is an expert model train collector helped me set it up. We got the track connected with no problem. Problem was we could never get the train to start or lights to come on. Switched out the C batteries that came with it. Also used the rechargeable battery I purchased. Neither worked. Looking at it, even if it had started, I don't think the cars would have stayed connected or on the track. What was supposed to be the centerpiece of our son's Christmas day gifts was a major disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNK WASTE OF MONEY DIDNT WORK AND MADE CHILD CRY ON CHRISTMAS","review":"I bought this for my five year old. it was all she wanted for Christmas, she watched the movie 53 times. Opened at set it up Christmas Eve, tracks kept falling apart, finally got it all together and the batteries in it, and then lo and behold the piece of crap did not work, so ran out to Walgreens and spent another 15 bucks on c batteries and STILL the only thing i got were lame sounds and a front light, no coal light no movement nothing. Christmas morning was horrible, thank God she had other gifts but she cried over this train most of the day. I emailed Lionel and recieved a response the next day ? go get new batteries ( hello I wrote you that I did) and that I should run in in another room. Really? idiots! Thank you KMART for taking this piece of junk back. NEVER EVER will I EVEr buy anything from these people again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Train is a disappointment!","review":"First off, one of the track pieces is quite messed up. It would not connect to any of the other pieces on one end for some reason, no matter what I tried. I finally was able to get it set up just well enough that the train could go around, but the slightest bump made the track come apart again.Second, the couplers don't work. Only the middle two sections will stay together. The caboose and the engine both come apart, making the first two cars only connected by the little cable connecting the power to the engine.Third, the train hardly stays on the track. Again, the slightest bump makes the train derail.Fourth, oh my freaking gosh the noises the train makes when it's not being used are so ANNOYING!In all fairness, my children still love it. But it's driving me crazy! I would not recommend this product. I will be looking to get a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"My train worked around 1hr and it broke","review":"I bought a train, and it worked around 1hr and it broke.

When you do this over ten times the plastic WILL wear and break. Also, the track doesn't stick together, it just falls apart..absolute junkTrain seems ok, but falls off the track due to extremely poor craftsmanship (don't expect much, and NO it's not made in the USA anymore folks, all made in mass in china)Overall extremely disappointed,"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with Polar Express Train.","review":"I loved it at first but it quit working properly after about 20 minutes total of use.

I changed the batteries and nothing changed. I am sending it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"A hassle and a disappointment","review":"When I first received the set (to be used with my grandkids), it was missing a piece of track. Amazon's solution was to send me an entire second set with instructions to open it, fish out the part I needed, pack it back up, and send it back. I did that.Once I had all the pieces, I found it was very difficult to get the cars coupled and keep them on the track, especially the locomotive. I did get it to run for maybe 20 minutes. Then it wouldn't go, and none of the fixes suggested in the instructions helped.This was to be the first train set I had in about 50 some odd years, and it was a big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing Christmas present","review":"We bought this train for our grandson - his one & only present from us.

His 'editor's eye' view of the profession turns the camera back upon the photographers, telling tales behind pictures generally left untold.

He is now almost 11 months, and still loves it. He has always been a highly sensitive baby, and we have struggled with a lot of fussiness. However, this musical toy became a lifesaver for us in the car, during physical therapy sessions, and has even helped put him to sleep many times. The classical music has become familiar and soothing to him,and he still smiles at the caterpillar's cute face. This toy is very durable, colorful, and has many different little tunes, so there is not too much repetition. The carrying handle is nice, and it can also be attached to a crib. I like the volume adjustment as well! My only complaints would be that the numbers are hard to push for little hands, and it is not easily cleaned. Nevertheless, a really great, educational toy for infants."},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughter loves it!","review":"I have a 15 month od and she received this toy last year at Christmas.

It's cute, the music is pleasant and it makes learning fun. The only bummer, and it's a major bummer, is it's hard for my child to press the buttons - and she's 15 months old! The only one she can easily press is the first button. The rest of the buttons have too much padding in front of them and a small area to press to activate it. It makes her frustrated and upset when she tries to press the other buttons and can't. Toys are supposed to be be fun not frustrating. Every once in a while she gets one of the other buttons to work. But I find she doesn't play with it very often probably because it's not much fun for her. I'm hoping that as she gets older it will be easier for her to work it. I can't believe they rate this toy for 3+ months. I hope something positive will come from this toy and she'll learn not to give up! =)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone loves this toy!","review":"My son is currently 2 and still LOVES this toy! We've had it since birth, and it has 'lived' in the car most of the time, but also goes in the stroller, house, and field trips (to friend's houses so they can try it out!) It does not grate on the nerves when it repeats--partly because there are so many options to play, but also because the sounds are so pleasant. We've even done 'dj' mixing to make it say certain things, cracking the whole family up! My ONLY detail not 5 star rated would be the straps...which even a young baby can pull off (so never worked to keep the toy tethered) but this is by all means--a MUST HAVE toy!!

We have had this since before our son was born. The music is nice, and my son likes the colors and will occasionally walk around holding this by the handle. The big issue is: it is not interactive. The \\"feet\\" are too short and fat for a small child to hold (and they don't do much anyway- maybe a few textures?), and at 13 months our son still cannot turn it on or press any of the numbers (it is very difficult to get the music to play- esp. for the target age group). If we turn on the music for him, he likes it okay (esp when he was smaller), but at this age he prefers if he can do that himself. I am just not impressed with this toy. There are much better toys for texture exploration, and you can find other toys that play music on the go. This is one of our toys I would pass on if I had to do it again. HOpe this helps!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buttons are too hard to push!","review":"My daughter was never able to play with this toy on her on. I got it for her when she was 7 mos old ... she's now 16 mos old and gave up on it a long time ago. It just doesn't work unless I push the buttons for her. Other than that - it's a really cute toy! But it's not made for babies."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO HARD 4 LITTLE HANDS TO PUSH BUTTONS","review":"My 8mos old has had this toy since he was born, he has never been much interested in it. He'll look at it, grab at the flowers hanging from the bottom but quickly loses interest after a few seconds. He can't seem to push the buttons to make the darn thing sing or talk. I must press them down, hard I must say, to make the thing go for a few seconds. Then it's over. So far, this toy has not been a good purchase AT ALL.I see the wonderful reviews it gets, so I'm hoping he'll begin to play with it some month. Maybe when he's over a year, maybe...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great concept, buttons hard to press","review":"I love LeapFrog products and so I jumped at the chance to buy this for my 12 month old daughter. The concept is great and the sounds are appealing. I wish the buttons were a little easier for my baby to press. It is quite heavy too. Pretty happy overall however. I think it will be useful in the car/stroller as well as at home."},{"rating":"1","title":"The buttons really are hard to press. Really!","review":"I was going to buy this online, but happened to be in Babies R US today so I went to check it out. WOW Those buttons are tough! And the area to press them is really small. And I wasn't really pleased with the sound (seemed annoying to me). I'm glad I checked it out before buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a scream!","review":"I like the idea of the toy, but my daughter hates it. Every time it plays she scrunches up her face and starts screaming. The first time I pushed the button for her I thought that she wasn't in the mood to play, but I have tried to get her to play with it at other times of the day and other days, but she still scrunches up her face and screams. The lady's voice that is singing on it is kinda scary. My advice to anyone who is considering this or any toy that makes noise. Take your little one with you and test it out in the store. I have found one other toy that she reacts this way to, so now I know to see if she likes it before we leave the store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on this toy","review":"This was given to me as a present and I am glad I did not waste my money on it. My son cannot press the buttons to make the toy play. If you have a Graco stroller it will not fit on it. He really does not play with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of Uses","review":"I bought this for my 2 month old son. He pays a lot of attention to it because the songs are really upbeat (and educational too!). We plan to put it on the stroller when he gets older, but for right now we use it during his \\"tummy time\\". We prop him up a little with the pillow from the Baby Einstein activity gym and he looks down at the baby counting pal. It's a wonderful toy!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Entertainment for little ones!","review":"I purchased this toy for my 3 month old. He loved it from the first day. It is an interactive toy for parents and baby at this early stage because he cannot press the buttons himself yet. I am sure he will be able to when he is older. For now, we play with it together and it allows us bonding time. The learning aspects of this toy are fun, the music cheery, and the toy itself is soft and easy on the touch. The size of the toy allows it to be good for travel. There is a setting that allows you to hit a button and it plays classical music for a few minutes. This is good to have background music in the crib or on the floor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes the buttons are hard to push","review":"My son has had this toy since he was about 7 months old. He is now 2 1/2 years old and every time I try to move it to the donate pile since it is a baby toy, he fishes it out, pushes a button and starts doing silly dances around it while laughing. We both love the toy. The color/number songs are catchy and fun and because of the classical songs (as well as the names of the composers), my older son can name a lot more composers than I could at that age. YES the buttons are hard to push. I don't know why they did that when it is supposed to be for babies. But when my son was younger, he would just play with the bottom parts (crinkle, rattle, etc) and wait for me to push the music buttons. Then when he was maybe 1 1/2 he would push them himself. Overall, I love the toy (can't believe that it is costing twice what I paid for it though)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little Worm.","review":"My daughter has had this worm from the time she was a month old. She has enjoyed pressing the buttons and now \\"standing\\" on this toy. The batteries last a very long time in this toy, as I have never had to change them. All four modes of this toy is interactive, educational, and entertaining. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful and portable toy to introduce colors, numbers and classical music to your child","review":"Our little girl loves playing the musical selections and the counting and color songs. We also like the fact that we can take it with us when we go on car trips. We had one prior to this, however, that suddenly quit working. We tried changing the batteries, but that didn't correct the problem. We're hoping that this one is more durable, but we've only had it a short time, so we'll see. Other than that, it's a great toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy, as always from Leapfrog.","review":"I am very happy with my daughter's caterpillar. She loves pressing the buttons, and listening to the songs and music. She is 7 months old. Her favorite part, of course, is the straps that you use to hook it to the stroller/crib/carseat...lol. My only complaint would be that the velcro straps to use to attach it to a stroller don't accomodate alot of the newer models, where the toy and drink tray is wider. That of course, can be remedied, with makeshift ties, I'm sure. I didn't have any problem with the toy eating batteries. I have been using the same batteries that came with it since I bought it a month ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best for beginner","review":"I totally agree with the reviews below.I'm korean and never knew latin, and this was a bliss.It's so easy and fun to learn latin with this book~"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not suitable for learning","review":"Not very engaging; unsuitable for a beginner. Try Latin for Beginners, from Teach Yourself publishers, for a true introductory course. \\"Learn Latin\\", on the other hand, is just someone writing about the grammar of the language. Nice, but not how you learn. A bunch of newspaper columns bound together in a book with a new fancy cover, isn't enough to learn anything, much less a highly inflected ancient literary language quite different from English."},{"rating":"1","title":"The DJ is Hiding Behind the Mask...","review":"I have the entire Global groove series from Centaur and so I naturally bought Mask when it was released. I wanted to like it. I tried to like it. I just can't help but dislike it. Unlike much of the dance music from this period, the vocals are weak, the choice of mixes just down right odd, and the transitions are anything but smooth. Mark MacEwan was never a big dj outside of Atlanta and after this cd was released clubs here stopped booking him cold. That's probably the most telling review of all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Global Groove Mask","review":"This CD has a great pulsating driving rhythm.

Buy it from Amazon[.com] Canada!","review":"...Sure it took a week longer than I would have wanted, but it was so worth the wait. This DVD comes loaded with complete coverage of the Manu Chao concert from Paris where the Radio Bemba Live album was recorded, and includes songs like M. Boogie that were left out of the CD recording. Plus behind the scenes of Radio Bemba and Manu traveling the world on tour. Quality stuff.But the most interesting section of the DVD is called \\"Infinita Tristeza.\\" It's a half hour of Manu's travels in guerilla states in Bolivia (Potosi), Ecuador (undisclosed), and Mexico (Chiapas). Here Manu and Radio Bemba play for free in front of either a handful of indigenous people in farm communities, or in front of a couple of dozen guerillas, many covering their faces and holding fire arms.

The two creative documentaries at the end are fascinating. They are real art work and the llama killing is family related. It is a tradition in Bolivia. I suggest researching it. It is amazing how Manu captures Bolivia, Ecuador and other towns. I also like to see how he performs with el pueblo. The creativity is amazing and I really enjoy his message. Hearing it is one thing, seeing it as art is another. Manu Chao is a unique artist. His music is for the world to hear and watch. It is family entertainment, beacuse no one should ignore his message.Suerte"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, great, great!","review":"For those who are unable to see Manu Live.

I would just like to make that clear becuase im not slammin' them. I bought this album without really looking at the song titles too closely, which was a big mistake. i could tell right away that this cd was comprised of remixes from other DJs all put into one uniteresting, unoriginal, repetitive, difinitly not-ATB worthy album. the bass drops are ALL the same. in get really mind numbing after a while. dont get me wrong, i love trance music, but this is just bad. go for a great album like \\"no silence\\" by ATB, if you dont have it get it, you'll love it. save this one for the posers."},{"rating":"2","title":"atb satisfies again...","review":"this compilation was some of the best trance/pop i have listened to in awhile.

I hadn't used them yet, so I was extremely disappointed to learn that they were dead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great recording, if you're Creed.","review":"Not impressed. Although it's different than the Blink 182 style of Punk, the musicianship lacks and the songs take a well travell ed path ad-nauseum. I never thought I'd make the comparison of Led Zepplin meets The Get Up Kids, but there you go. Kind of a generic middle gound between the two. The recording is definitely over-produced, and if you listen to what's going on, you'll realize that the production adds a cheese factor to the whole thing. The biggest turn-off for me has to be the vocals. And that is the key. ... They're not THAT out-of-key, but the tone of the singers voice sounds like he had a cold when they recorded and there is a definite lack of style. In all, a pretty lame release. Sorry guys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost it before they had it","review":"Before this CD, there was a demo floating around that displayed the talents of a D.I.Y band on the verge of breaking onto the national indie scene... The entire demo front to end was amazing. Then along came Bob Hoag's inability to mic studio drums, Aezra Records, and an ousted Braden McCall. The end result is The Rumor, an extravegant yet pitiful shadow of what Before Braille was once capable of. This CD is overbearing and ironically severely lacking all at once. Additionally, lead singer David Jensen sounds like he needs to lay off the tranquilizers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"Compared to the demo BB put out with these songs on it, this album is an obviously sad reincarnation of something that was once pure but is now used and sold. The music itself is ok, but the lead singer sounds drained of all life and not into any song on the CD. Also this album was extremely over produced. I was disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Umph","review":"Before Braille has been one of my favorites for a while. This is their first national, full-length release.

These organ arrangements preserve the unique Delius \\"sound\\" ... in almost every instance they are musically quite satisfying. You'll enjoy this CD for those quiet, contemplative times. The organ playing is superb ... the only negative being the sluggish rhythm of the bell player in the Sleigh Ride, which more than once comes dangerously close to being completely behind the organ. Aside from this minor quibble, all is well in the performance. The CD also contains an interesting \\"homage\\" to Delius written by another composer. Interesting music in a sort of Delian style, but the program notes say absolutely nothing about the composer or the work. It would have been nice to have some background on that composition."},{"rating":"1","title":"INJUSTICE","review":"How could a record company release anything like this from one of the greatest singers of all time is beyond me ..

Life there is really different and intensifed in a way that \\"normal\\" school cannot be. This novel, set in the 40s or so, really is a snapshot, in one sense, of a way of life that is fast fading from memory. Boarding schools aren't really set up the way this book describes. But the students who inhabit those schools often act the way they do in this novel. People never change, although the institutions in which they find themselves do.This is a fast read; I would add it to any list of \\"school novels\\" -- whether that is for a course or simply for one's own interest.

I proceeded slowly through very strange sentences and claims about reality to moments of resonant clarity (e.g., regarding the real importance of small businesses in the U.S. economy...). At first, I found finding plausible sentences to be surprisingly satisfying. Then, I realized that my process with the book was tedious not because of its complexity, but because of its incoherence.

The sound system was where the trouble really came in, all the speakers and such. The huge cable of the PS3 fit fine. You to have to stagger the wires a bit to make them fit, push, pull and try again, it's hard to make the plastic cover clip on with the wires.

The instructions aren't very detailed, but assembling the shelves was fairly intuitive, so this isn't too much of an issue.Visually, the shelves are aesthetically pleasing (in plain english, they look real nice). The pictures don't do this product justice. You can move the three shelves to various brackets on the main mount.The one drawback is the cable management system. If you plan on running more than two HDMI cables under the plastic covers, take note: carefully tie two cables in a bundle on either side of the cover/center frame (i.e. two cables tied in a bundle on the left side of the mount, two cables tied in a bundle on the right).

You'll love this album if you are at all into rock/blues/soul. Passionate emotions are combined with catchy, sometimes hypnotizing melodies. \\"Bittersweet,\\" probably the most well-known song by this little-known band, is as the title suggests, and powerfully emotional. \\"Circle\\" is both a passionate plea (\\"I'm asking you to turn around\\"), and a thought-provoking statement about life in general (\\"Rise and fall, turn the wheel, cause all life is is really just a circle\\"). \\"Ellis Island\\" surprises you with its melodic twists and turns. \\"Tomorrow Never Comes\\" may be my favorite. It is quiet, haunting, beautiful even, with its soft percussion, quiet piano riff, and masterful and emotional vocals. Passionate and soulful, this is Big Head Todd at their best. I very much recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A few good songs, but inconsistent in sound","review":"I bought this CD back when it was released because I really liked the song \\"Bittersweet,\\" which I still think is a terrific song. Unfortunately, that was the only song I really liked, even after repeated listenings. I think that the problem for me is that there is not a consistent sound to this CD. Some of it sounds like Hootie and the Blowfish and some of it sounds closer to Phish.

I bought it because of that and its now one of my favorite cd's. Bittersweet is as beautiful a melancholy love ballad as any ever written, and would be right at home being sung by Roy Orbison. \\"Circle\\" is just a great down and dirty hard rock song that grabs you and won't let go. There is not a bad song on the disc.Buy it-you'll love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I bought this CD when it first came out. I have seen BHTTM several times. I love this CD.

It contains \\"Broken Hearted Savior\\", \\"It's Alright\\", and \\"Bittersweet\\", which are three of their best songs, and any radio listener should know them. The rest of the album is almost as good, and I really enjoy the tracks \\"Turn The Light Out\\" and \\"Circle\\" nearly as much as the others. Overall it's a really great disc, and should please fans of both pop-rock, and alt-country just the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"It gets to you","review":"My exposure to BHTM goes back to the late 80s when I was in college and we made road trips to Colorado.

It would ruin everything, although I want them to do well. Sister Sweetly is incredible and will haunt you for a long time. After watching BHTM for so long, it is one of my favorites.

And it's crappy and overpriced, considering its terrible build quality.As for sound quality, when dealing with a digital signal, it's not really applicable. It either works, works intermittently, or fails. Albeit, its bandwidth is important. So in that respect, it does pass 7-channel audio (Dolby/DTS) through just fine.

What a complete waste of space and the trees that were killed to make the paper for this book should start a revolution!I didn't read any reviews on this book before asking my parents to order it. That was a mistake since people seem to becoming wise and wanting books that teach instead of simple problem books that don't tell you the way and how in actual words. If you are simple minded and cannot understand to read words then this book may be for you. If you want to be taught then buy another book.

The vocabulary is simple and the concepts are easy to grasp without having to set up a board or work through long examples. She can read a few pages, put the book down and come back to it later without having to backtrack. It is perfect for where she is now.The book's simplicity is its greatest attribute and also its greatest shortcoming.

It is not a book for really good players! It is a book for people who need to get better. I was noticeably better after I finished this book. I was able to give a real game to a friend of mine who had consistently trounced me before!So five stars from me. I think people who already have done a lot of tactics work, which I haven't, will feel let down by this book. I wasn't let down at all, in fact it has thrown me into even further study. (usually the sign of a good book and teacher!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"2 stars to Mate in 2. For you.","review":"This book is really just a collection of mate in 2 puzzles. The authors seem to think that learning how to recognise mate in 2 will help you play better. That is crazy, tactics, opening theory, Endgame theory, study in these areas and your game will improve.

Some of the mates were sparkling so I did give it 2 stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"A novel approach, very well done.","review":"Please note that these comments are strictly about this book and not its controversial author.It is a series of plates (a diagram of a single set-up), each with a single question, for example, \\"Can white mate in one move?\\" Answer the question and flip the page to see how you did. I found this approach with its terse explanations useful.It starts at the beginner level and builds up in small steps, covering much more than I expected from a paperback book with so little text. I did not feel the need to set up these positions on a board; looking in the book was good enough. This book is convenient to whip out, work a problem or two, and put away again, so I sometimes took it with me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy To Keep Close","review":"A great beginner book on the essentials of chess, if your new to chess or it's been awhile since you played this is a perfect book to go through.

The book also avoids any use of chess notation that is important to go on to learn from more advanced books that are needed to progress. It is not as much as this book is so bad. It is that there are books that cover checkmates, tactics and traps that are so much better now available. Tactics and traps are also important for the beginner to know, not just checkmates.

This book covers only checkmates too but does such a better job that Bobby Fisher Teaches Chess should be retired because it doesnot teach you much and also there are so much better books you can get that teaches you a whole lot more.Look at How to Beat Your Dad at Chess book and if you want a book that teaches you the whole game with all parts covered get the book called Chess For Juniors instead because it teaches you more about everything and includes all the important checkmate positions anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Title is misleading!","review":"This book has the title that made me think there was covering of all points of chess.

If you are are reading this (like I should have read the reviews) then do not buy this book unless you want a bunch of easy to solve checkmate positions instead of a book that has real lessons to learn from.

This is actually a serious drawback.There are much better books containing tactical problems and checkmates available.

He had another write it for him and simply signed his name to it for the money.#2 It takes an entire page to give you one puzzel to solve.#3 The puzzels are so simple that the hardest one to solve took me, being 11 less than 10 seconds to solve.#4 There are no lessons in this book - just simple checkmate puzzels.Get a book by Gilham, called \\"SIMPLE CHECKMATES\\" that is far, far better if what this book has is what you want.Yuk, Yik, and toss this piece of junk in the fire place - then maybe it will serve some purpose."},{"rating":"1","title":"It got it returned","review":"I ordered this book and \\"1001 Brilliant Ways to Checkmate\\". The \\"1001 Brillian Ways to Checkmate\\" had so much more in it I found an excuse to return the Fischer book. The Fischer book is so bad it stinks. Get \\"1001 Brilliant Ways to Checkmate\\" because it has so much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuk!","review":"Why I donot like this book:It only sets up diagrams with positions of problems to solve with solutions given in moves themselves.Bobby Fischer, who I undersatnd is the greatest chess player of all time is not also the greatest chess teacher of all time - understand the differense?There are not explanations of anything - just diagrams with problems to solve and then moves as the solutions. A book should tell in words, not just moves about learning."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Book for Beginner","review":"The quality of the product and the delivery are very good.Though it was very disappointing to learn that this book is for those who do not know how to play chess. Even in this case it is not helpful at all.It would be nice to add some information about the contents of the book, rather than to put all the emphasize on the name of its author.Total disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little good, mostly bad","review":"This is a puzzle book, which the advertizing doesn't tell you when you go to buy it. The puzzles are checkmates and it is also important to learn to win pieces to because this is what usually happens first. I didn't learn much from this book because the easy checkmate problems are very obvious.Arrows show you where the pieces move. This might be good for a person who doesn't want to learn to read chess notation. But, it makes you lazy if you should be learning to read chess moves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chess","review":"It explains the ways to get out of checkmate, how to checkmate the opponent, but not so much the strategy in how to create the situations he is explaining. I guess he leaves that up to us to work on, but I was hoping for a more in depth detail. For what it does explain, it is a very good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Beginner's Book","review":"(Review of the 1970's or so Dutch translation)This is a brilliant book. It teaches the basics of 'chess thinking', that is, looking at a situation and analyzing it for a certain short term goal (in this book: mate, but the skill can be used everywhere in the game). It does not cover grand strategy (but one can wonder if a book could do that), but it does teach a very good start in 'being able to read a position'. The more advanced pattern recognition, again, it does not teach. This is, after all, a beginner's book.The book largely consists of positions with a question. What is sometimes uncanny is that you think of a wrong answer ad on the next page you find the exact explanation of what you missed.When starting with chess (and even re-reading it a few years later) I found it improved my beginner's play tremendously."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't find this book of much help","review":"When I first started playing chess about two years ago I had this as one of my first chess books. I must clearly say that I found the checkmates in this book to be so basic they didn't help me. I found books with good solid analysis such as \\"Logical Chess, Move by Move\\", \\"Unbeatable Chess Lessons for Juniors\\" far more useful along with Polgar's book on many chess problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"You will learn very little","review":"The book is titled \\"Bobby Fischer TEACHES chess\\". This book has no lesson plans, doesn't have any more than the most simplistic positions in diagrams to \\"find a checkmate\\". I ask: how do I acheive the checkmate position first? This book provides nothing. I ask: tell me how to start or open a game? This book provides nothing? How about how to read moves in chess notation and yet again this book provides nothing. Toss it into the fireplace and it provides something!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book for a good price","review":"If you're a beginner, reading this book will likely cause your rating to go up a few hundred points. It did for me when I was just starting out. Even if you're an experienced player you could benefit from this book, you may not learn alot of new things but it's good and easy practice.Some folks might be drawn to this book because of the Fischer connection, but I think the reason the book stays successful is because it's great for what it is. I can attribute quite a few wins to the book that involved back-rank checkmates that I may not have seen otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disapointment","review":"When I got this book I discovered just how little real material it contained. It uses up a lot of space to cover very little. And, this book is very outdated in the since that numberous newer books have been written that cover far more material and provide text that tells you what is going on. Some examples are \\"HOW TO BEAT YOUR DAD AT CHESS\\", \\"ART OF THE CHECKMATE\\", \\"1001 BRILLIANT WAYS TO CHECKMATE\\". Look at these books first and you will not be disapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best instruction book","review":"I don't understand why this book sells so well. The other reviews tell it well, but I want to stick my two cents in too. It is not a horrible book, just not a good book. Each page has one checkmate to find. The checkmates are not hard to find unless you are a super beginner. It doesn't tell you too much about what is going on. I agree with many of the other people doing reviews that the book is not an instruction book so much as it is a book on checkmating positions. I do not care if it was really writen by bobby fisher or not. That is not the point that some others have made. The point is that is is not what the title tells you - it should be called \\"FIND THE CHECKMATE\\" or something like that. I also do not care if it has chess notation or not because you can learn that from other books on chess. I own 1001 BRILLIANT CHECKMATES by Fred Reinfeld and CHESS FOR JUNIORS by Robert Snyder. They are both much better books anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Know what you are getting","review":"This book teaches some basic Chess tactics - and does it rather well. It will NOT improve your knowledge of openings, strategy, or endings. If you want to become an expert on back-rank mates, this is the book for you. If you want to know why Fischer is considered one of the greatest players of all time, read his \\"60 Memorable Games\\". If you are a beginner, this book is totally inadequate preparation for his magnum opus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Find the checkmate should be the title","review":"BOBBY FISCHER TEACHES CHESS in not a book with lessons that teach you like the title makes you think. If you are want a book on one limited tactic: \\"Checkmates\\" and only checkmates (not the pin, not the fork, not the discovered attack or even the x-ray attack or overworked piece) then this book is just ok (I have seen better checkmate books - suggested by some of the other reviewers). I suggest if you are a beginner and want to learn the basics or material just beyond that then get either CHESS FOR JUNIORS by Robert Snyder with twenty great lessons or LEARN CHESS by Alexander and Beach."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a joke","review":"I was looking at books on Amazon and found this book was ranked as number three for sales!!!!!!Oh my gosh people should read the reviews BEFORE ordering. I got the book two years ago for my 10th birthday and have since gotten many more books. This book has a misleading title because it is not really teaching overall chess - ONLY checkmates and the question is why Fischer would only cover very basic checkmates in a book titled about TEACHING CHESS?Apparently he didn't write this book at all with someone tossing together a bunch of simple easy junk checkmate positions (someone of little ability could have written this book)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not like it one bit","review":"This book is an old, old inferior book that I have heard on more than one occassion was not even put together by Bobby Fischer (it has a ghost writter - get the point). He simply put put his stamp of approval on it for the money.And it shows. I did look over the other reviews and agree with the fact it doesn't encourange you to learn chess notation and doesn't cover anything else than the most simple checkmates that would be easy to learn in a beginning book like \\"Starting Chess\\" or \\"Chess For Juniors\\" by Snyder (my favorite) with both being excellent books and much better than this one to learn everything you need to know to be a half way decent player. This book is way over \\"hyped\\" as being good by those who have not really looked over some of the other checkmate books like \\"1001 Brilliant Checkmates\\" by Reinfeld, or \\"How to Beat your Dad at Chess\\" by Chandler.DO NOT WAISTE YOUR TIME ON THIS BOOK. Move on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Your rating will rise after reading this book!","review":"Before reading this particular book,my rating never broke out of the 1200-1299 range. I went out and beat an 1800 rated player immediately after reading it. Whenever I feel that I need a booster shot, I read it again and my play goes back up for as long as I can hold it fresh in my mind. For a beginner or a lower rated player with better retention than I, this book would be an excellent long term resource for keeping your rating up. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice book; good for beginners and advanced players.","review":"If you want a good book on checkmating, then buy this. It's nice and cheap, and will most likely improve your game (especially if you're a beginner). It's simple, and a chess board is not needed. Although I got a little bored of the same questions, this is a must-have for people who are starting off and wish to improve."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book for beginners ever?","review":"A beginner needs to know how to use a fork, a scewer, a discovered attack, etc. thats what this book teaches, in a very freindly, fun manner."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Place To Start!","review":"I've purchased this book time and time again to give to friends who are starting to learn the game. It is a wonderful and non-complicated approach which anyone should be able to easily work through. You don't need a chess board! Just have fun anywhere anytime with this great book. A great follow up book to this would be BRUCE PANDOLFINI'S \\"BEGINNING CHESS\\". It sort of picks up where this Fischer leaves off, exploring more advanced positions with the same simplicity. Both books are above all, challenging and fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best beginner's book","review":"The title makes it seem that this book has organized lessons by Bobby Fischer. In fact there is very little written text. It is basically a problem book with very simple checkmates.A lot of space is used (very big diagrams) and not a lot of material is covered.This being said if you are looking for a good problem book for beginners I really like \\"Winning Chess Tactics For Juniors\\" by Hays.If you are looking for a great first book that really teaches chess using lessons then there is no better book than \\"Chess For Juniors\\" by Snyder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the cheap paper it is written on","review":"Ok! Fischer, the greatest world champion of all time wrote this? I cannot believe he really wrote this book. It has oversized diagrams, over simple problems for the absolute beginner and it contains almost no teaching text. Just simple problems with answers. I am only 12 years old and I could write a better book than this (maybe I will change my name like movie stars and authors do TO BOBBY FISCHER then write a book with the name on it and it will be a good seller)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Know what you are getting","review":"This book teaches some basic Chess tactics - and does it rather well.

Insteat I found it is a narrow minded book with how to finish a game and not how to get there in the first place. It only has positions with solutions and doesn't tell you about strategy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disapointed","review":"I got Bobby Fischer's book thinking it had good lessons like a teacher would have. Instead it is a bunch of simple checkmate positions that are easy to solve - one page and one position! Junk! Total junk. I should have read the other reviews that pointed this out before getting the book. I have the book \\"Simple checkmates\\" which is much, much better if you want a book on \\"simple checkmates\\". Checkmate is the end result of a hard contest and is not what I need to learn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I give this a zero?","review":"Ah, oh my gosh! I ordered this THING ONLINE! Then got it read through the first part of it - then almost cried. Wish I read the reviews before (yes somewhat mixed, but would have picked up on the reviews by those who never read a real chess book).I just finished reading my \\"Chess For Juniors\\", which is awesome!! Then thought I was ready for BOBBY FISCHER!!! The only drawback to my \\"Chess For Juniors\\" book is it didn't warn me about the Fischer Book (joking here obviously!).The Fischer book shows Fischer isn't a chess teacher - just is (now perhaps was) a great player. It is a simple series of problems and answers without explaining ideas.Don't spend your money on this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"CHESS NEVER RECOVERED FROM BOBBY FISCHER'S RETIREMENT!!!","review":"Chess never recovered from Bobby Fischer's retirement, but at least he wrote BOBBY FISCHER TEACHES CHESS during his championship era for us to remember him by.I've always been a lot more interested in the psychology of chess and the people who play it instead of the game, and so the cover photo of Bobby Fischer--studying the board and wearing a suit, a picture which shows him as a genius at chess but someone who just couldn't learn the politics that it takes to become a successful celebrity--makes BOBBY FISCHER TEACHES CHESS one of my favorite books. It's a good book for beginners and is better organized than most books. Fischer understood the value of constantly seeing game situations for teaching chess in a book--he was always ahead of his time!--and this book has better drawings than most chess books.TIME TO WRITE ANOTHER BOOK, BOBBY FISCHER!!!Chari Krishnan RESEARCHKING"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough Material and doesn't provide explanation","review":"I am going reviews on several books that cover checkmates and rank this book at the bottom along with the Kid's Book of Checkmate. You will want to see my reviews on Art of Checkmate and 1001 Brilliant Ways to Checkmate which are the best books of this type.Simple and to the point: Bobby Fischer Teaches Chess doesn't cover very much material using an entire page for one checkmate situation without explanation - just a simple solution. As pointed out by others it doesn't teach beginners to use chess notation like it should."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strictly Beginners","review":"I would consider myself somewhat beyond beginner. I can defeat most people who play casual chess, but I have little success against any real students of the game.The first half of the book was fairly uninteresting to me as it restated what I considered obvious. The second half moved into slightly more complex situations, but nothing that made me say, \\"That's a good idea!\\"Also, there is very little explanation for any situation. In essence, this is a puzzle book where the solution is given in one line.If you're a weak casual player, this may be of some benefit. Otherwise, I would look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Bad","review":"This is a very horrible book. It doesn't begin to teach you what you need to know to make you good.NO OPENINGS, NO IMPORTANT ENDGAME POSITIONS, NO TACTICS THAT WIN MATERIAL, NO COMPLETE GAMES TO STUDY.What it does have are a bunch of positions with checkmates. Now how is that going to teach you chess (what the book claims to do)? Nonesense, simple nonsense!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Best Player, Worst Teacher","review":"If Bobby Fischer thinks that showing a some very easy to find checkmates is teaching chess (the title of this book) then most certainly he must be in this for the money and now for providing real instruction.Bobby Fischer only teaches you the finishing touches of chess, usually once you have used the strategy it takes to acheive the positions given in this book. Therefore the title of this book is not at all what this book covers.Bobby Fischer's Sixty Memorable Games is far better and I cannot believe that Bobby Fischer would allow his name to be used for this book - he couldn't have written it and been true to himself!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT written by Bobby Fischer","review":"I got this book a couple of years ago and didn't like it it much because I felt it was a cheap imitation of 1001 Brilliant Checmates by Reinfeld (a much, much better book if you want checkmates to work on).Then it came out in the news! Bobby Fischer didn't write this book, he was approached by somebody else who wrote it and then agreed to put his name on it. This is because Bobby Fischer who is now in prison in Japan has been in the news again. Finally the searching for bobby Fishcer is now over and this book was found to never be writen by him.Now it is bad because it is misleading to think the book is teaching you by bobby fisher and that it only has easy to find checkmates in it. Chess is much more complicated than only knowing how to find an easy to find checkmate at the end of a game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good practice book for the new player.","review":"Lenin once said that \\"Chess is the gymnasium of the mind.\\". This book is an exercise tool of that facility.The book begins presuming one has never seen the game, and proceeds to take the reader through increasinly difficult themes by use of programmed learning, a most useful device. The new player will strengthen his or her game quickly , and the intermediate player, such as myself, will benefit from refreshing forgotten themes, and occasionally discovering a new one.If you are looking for new opening strategies, or detailed middle game analysis, go elsewhere. This book is very short on theory, but long on training the eye and mind to spot lines of weakness and strength ahead of time. It will enhance most players' appreciation of the endless subtlety of chess, and I recommend it highly, subject to the foregoing commentary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fischer in the News had me buy the book","review":"I have seen Bobby Fischer in the news a lot lately and this made me interested in getting his book. There is almost no written words, mostly positions and solutions. This is not teaching chess any more than when I play my computer that has some stored positions with me trying to find the best moves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Get This but if you Do Do Not cry Over Silled Milk!","review":"I am a kid, but most of you who read this would probably expect me not being as old as you not to know what I am talking about or to cry like a a baby about this book so lets get it over with and you can hear me say Waaa! I was very upset when it arrived in the mail because I saved up money and had my parents order it because Bobby Fischer was going to teach me chess by this book.Well (a true hole in the groud in this case to dump this book) this book has not taught me anything. It showed me positions where I was to finish the person off with the final checkmate and it was so simple a baby could find it. The paper this book is writen on is cheap (mine had yellow color on it), and there are not enough positions to make it worth buying the book.Now why I cannot return it.... I spilled milk on it just after it got here. So, I cannot get my money back. But my advice, get a book that teaches you chess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Written for a baby","review":"I got this book for my birthday two years ago, then got more chess books. I got bored with it when I got the Chess For Juniors book which actualy taught me important things - checkmate is the end of things and you need to know all parts of the game - this book teaches checkmates. A book with this title makes you think it teaches you all about chess. My parents thought this book would be best because it was by a player they heard of. I recommend Chess For Juniors as your first book, not this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bobby Fischer?","review":"Really now? I have great difficulty that the greatest chess player of all time has put together a book that teaches near absolute beginners one phase of chess - How to Checkmate?Fisher also assumes you cannot read chess moves in a book so doesn't attempt to either teach you to read moves with a primer or assume you know basic chess notation. Well, if you don't know chess notation get a good Beginner's Book (i.e. \\"Chess For Juniors\\" for any age or \\"The Complete Idoit's Guide to Chess\\" for adult readers).There is a lot more to teaching chess than just showing some positions to solve a checkmate."},{"rating":"2","title":"My High School Chess Team Loved It!","review":"After reading SO MANY negative reviews I was very hesitant about purchasing this book for my high school chess team. Many of these students are not top readers and I thought they might not find this book useful. Boy, was I wrong. They LOVED this book. Carried it, in typcial kid fashion, bent up in their back pocket, and I found it to be a very useful teaching tool for many subjects. Additionally, the students were fascinated by the idea that if you flip the book over and read it \\"backwards\\" it shows the actual lay-out of many chess games. So be surprised too and order this book if you have lower-level chess players and readers. My students gave it five stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Format, easy to learn from!!!!","review":"This is a great book for begining to intermediate players to learn and improve. You don't need a chess board to follow along, which makes this a great book for using anywhere. I go through this book again about every 3 months just to refresh. My only complant is that Fischer didn't write more books on advanced topics using this teaching method [hint, hint : )]. I reccomend this book to everyone I know who wants to improve both the chess play and chess understanding. Fischer cleverly teachs checkmate patterns, basic tactics and combinations and even some postitional aspects of the game without you even realizing it. I can't say enough great things about this book. It should be noted this book is even recommended by the USCF in their 'beginer's value pack'. Good luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not teach me much","review":"I thought this book was going to provide instruction using lesson plans.It is nothing but a bunch of easy to solve checkmating problems and doesn't cover other important types of tactics which are important to know.This book is only good if you are a beginner who does know the most easy checkmates."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much better books with tactics available","review":"This book I am sure sells because of the name of Bobby Fischer on it. But in reality it is a poorly written book on simple checkmate tactics. Not much material.If you are thinking of getting a good book, for beginners I recommend the Chess For Juniors book. If you are just beyond then beginning stage then maybe Winning Chess Tactics for Juniors by Hays, or even much better yet the new book called WINNING CHESS TOURNAMENTS FOR JUNIORS (this book is great!) should make this Bobby Fischer doesn't really teach chess book look bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book makes a good book for the Fire Place!","review":"My dad got my this book (BOBBY FISHER TEACHES CHESS by Bobby Fisher) and CHESS FOR JUNIORS by Robert Snyder. I did not learn a lot from Bobby Fisher Teaches Chess but I loved the CHESS FOR JUNIORS book. My dad suggested i tell you this because I complained that he should throw away the BOBBY FISHER TEACHES CHESS because it didn't do much to teach me even though i am a good player in my 3rd grade class at school and beat the kids most easily in my class. if you are looking for a good chess book the the CHESS FOR JUNIORS one, not the FISHER one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fischer Couldn't Have Written This","review":"Bobby Fischer has been considered by many as the greatest chess player of all time.If he wrote this book, for real, he is certainly not a good writer or teacher. This book DOESN'T TEACH CHESS.Each page is a very simple chess problem to work on - yes, an entire page with overgrown diagram (I am a kid - but don't need the baby stuff). There is no explanation of ideas - just solutions given to you in moves.If you want a book to teach the basics get CHESS FOR JUNIORS. I loved that one and it gives you real lessons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not compare to my other Fischer Book","review":"I have a copy of MY 60 MEMORABLE GAMES by Bobby Fischer. This is a most cool book with good analysis and I then saw BOBBY FISCHER TEACHES CHESS. Two completely different books in quality.In BOBBY FISCHER TEACHES CHESS he does not explain things - simple position - find the checkmate - boom! simple moves as a solution. There are other books that do this without wasting so much space and you get a lot more positions.Now to compare: HOW TO BEAT YOUR DAD AT CHESS and SIMPLE CHECKMATES gives you a lot more material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skimmply Checkmate Problem Book","review":"Bobby Fischer does little more than set up very easy checkmates and calls this teaching chess. I own Chess For Juniors and the Art of the Checkmate and these books actually teach chess and explain what is going on (look at these two books first and you will not regret it). I am 12 and have been playing chess for two years. I was just given Bobby Fischer teaches chess about two weeks ago and felt it was bad I decided to check out online why such a bad book was written by Bobby Fischer (I saw that some say he didn't write it at all and I can believe that). I also agree with the reviews that say that a person should learn chess reading and writing, that Bobby Fischer teaches chess encourages you not to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a happy camper","review":"It reads \\"Bobby Fischer Teaches Chess\\" on the title.

I gave this book away."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most horrible checkmate book","review":"This book is absolutely horrible. One problem to work on per page, too simple, not well organized by type of checkmate pattern. It taught me nothing.Get HOW TO BEAT YOUR DAD AT CHESS intead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Book Only for Beginner Chess - Nothing from Fischer Himself","review":"Among Chess books, there are many that provide in depth analysis that will elevate players at any level. Bobby Fischer Teaches Chess is not that book as it is specifically geared only to the beginning level player.If you are brand new to chess and would like to learn the basics from one of the greatest players of all time, this book is for you. However, for those thinking this will provide a glimpse into the intriguing mind of Bobby Fischer, you will be sorely disappointed as this book goes no further than simple multi-move mating attacks with no content regarding strategy, tactics, or positional play.I rate this book poorly because the title is vague and misleading. Anyone in the chess world would expect a lesson from Bobby Fischer to be captivating in the least. This book would better be served by the name \\"Someone Other than Bobby Fischer Explains Very Basic Chess for Beginners\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Must Be Kidding - Bobby Fisher","review":"This book is really written by by the world chess champion bobby fischer?Gosh, I thought he would give me some real stuff to learn. But it is all easy to do checkmates.If you are looking for a real book with great problems then get \\"how to beat your dad at chess\\" or the great tactical section with checkmates and other problems to solve, \\"winning chess tournaments for juniors\\". Both wipe this silly book out big time. Check the reviews on those books!Bobby Fisher teaches chess takes an entire page for just one problem to solve. And it doesn't teach reading moves like a good book should. I gave this book to my friend but maybe I am not helping him."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"The book was pretty elementary on his teaching techniques.

A lot of space for almost no material to cover for students."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Basic, Not Much Material","review":"From what I understand this book was \\"ghost written\\" - with Fischer doing little more than checking it over and putting is name on it.It contains very simple checkmate problems and no real \\"instuction\\".

It arrived quickly and the price was also great. Thanks so much!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A waist of money","review":"If I had seen this book before ordering it I would have never bought it. It is a simple workbook of checkmate problems that didn't require someone of Bobby Fischer's ability to \\"compile\\".

Almost every other book written on how to checkmate your opponent is better than this one such as HOW TO BEAT YOUR DAD AT CHESS or ART OF CHECKMATE. These are better checkmate books for a person just beyond the beginning stage.If you are a beginner or just beyond the beginning stage then I recommend CHESS FOR JUNIORS as a book that has all parts of the game arranged as nice lessons."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money and time","review":"I saw this book when I was a kid who owned some great chess books (for example Capa's \\"Fundamentals of Chess\\" or Reti's \\"New Ideas in Chess\\" and \\"Masters of the Chessboard\\").This book is not one you can compare with those great books.It includes only \\"back rank mate \\" examples.Not useful even for beginners."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading title, poor content","review":"The only thing you need to know about this book is that it has almost nothing to do with Bobby Fischer. It is apparent that the authors had every intention of the average reader seeing Fischer's name and immediately buying the book.The only problems included are back-rank mating puzzles. That's 300 simple one, two, or three move problems that all end in mate on the 1st or 8th. It's effortless, even for the average 600-rated player.

I must be better at chess than I thought. In reality it will not outlive me as (this is absolutely true) I needed get the fire going in the fire place. Yup, you guessed it!

It does teach \\"how to play chess\\" in the first few pages since it covers how to move different pieces and how to capture; but it doesn't tell how to open a game, how to formulate a plan and etc. You may use the book at a mate-in-one training book, however, there are tons of others to choose from for that matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't.","review":"He is an ugly person and a racist.

I knew nothing about chess and needed to learn quick - a friend of mine was beating me senseless day after day - it was a long summer off from school and he enjoyed chess (who wouldn't with a victim like me!)This book quickly turned me into a better player than my friend, who never beat me again. So - when recently I ordered a copy of this book for a friend of my daughter's who wanted to improve her game, I was disappointed to find that this re-printed edition is of very poor quality. It is almost impossible to make out the position of the pieces in the many diagrams in the book, and this is a fatal flaw for such a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent teaching tool!","review":"There isn't much I can add to the other comments above except that this is an excellent way to teach chess to elementary and middle school aged children (especially those that are not particularly good or avid readers).

He takes readers through a chronology of his life, however he doesn't spend a lot of time on details. What he does is highlight the major impact his dad had on his life. A significant amount of the book discusses the principles he learned from his dad and how he applied them to his own life. This intangible legacy, the legacy of Christian faith is one that has cause him to say he cares more about his eternal reputation rather than his place in history (which is temporal).

Of all the instrumentalists, Michael Brecker has been a favorite. With his use of modern harmonics and keen sense of melodic use, Michael sustains his level of musicianship with Two Blocks From The Edge. Brecker never plays with any slouches, either. Being at the high level in which he plays and the respect from colleagues and audiences alike, Michael Brecker can choose his bandmates. Pianist Joey Calderazzo is another such statesman on his instrument. Having studied with the same teacher, Richie Beirach, Calderazzo and I have been exposed to modern harmony through all forms of 20th Century music (Takemitsu, Hancock, Shorter, Woody Shaw, etc.). So, for the uneducated reviewer that dissed Joey, shame on you for your lack of historical background and unvalid comments. Kudos to Michael Brecker and band!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Flawed by second tier piano playing, but Brecker is fine.","review":"Having heard Brecker with authentic piano giants like Herbie Hancock, McCoy Tyner and Chick Corea it is a disapointment to hear him with a piano player (Joey Calderazzo) who is not up the task of being his main foil as a soloist.

I would love to hear Brecker more with Hancock - the piece Scriabin on an early record was stunning."},{"rating":"2","title":"good times","review":"this is an enjoyable record... Delta City Blues is a great way to end the record. Sure, it's some showing off, but what a blast.El Nino is a great track. Brecker's ballad playing is very sweet on this one.

Being partial to a good tenor saxophonist its heart warming to hear an artist balancing perfectly the marriage between backing and lead instrument.

Existentialism? Hah! More like pedanticism. Berberian's characters are flat, uninteresting, and tell us nothing new about the Mideast. Where is the conflict in his characters? Where is the multi-layered (and therefore believable) mileu of the cyclist's world? Where are the characters that could provide an alternate perspective on, or at least discuss, the objective reality of terror? Most unforgivingly, where is the drama?

I had hoped to gain an understanding of those last-minute chaotic thoughts that rush through the mind of someone carrying out such a terrible mission, but this novel was a pure waste of time.

Certainly a hallmark for extreme metal! They go from brutal blast beats and tremolo picking to slow, sludgy riffs that form a wall of crushing music, and an overall dark and old-school horror-reminiscent atmosphere that just can't be topped. Plain and simple, this album delivers some of the best death metal I've heard. Highly recommended! Thanks for the time, and peace."},{"rating":"2","title":"you'll get used to this","review":"At first you'd think the vocals were retarded, but you look at the lyrics and combine the complex double pedal drumming, and the dark electric guitars, and it's all good.

I think Morbid Angel is one of the best there is besides Slayer. This is brutal evil metal in raw form for any true metal fan. This CD is just as good as Domination maybe even harder if that is possible. The only thing i have against them is the production is weak on their Cds it sometimes sounds muffled is why i gave it 4 stars instead of 5. MA is what brutal metal should be. Some bands should take notes on how to be extreme and heavy without being ridiculously stupid. This band has talent everywhere vocals are good understandable,clear and David doesnt try too hard to sound like he does. The guitars and drums are perfect and the guys know how to play them which some bands i hear i question that ablity. If you want true brutal evil sounding metal at it's best then try Morbid Angel."},{"rating":"2","title":"DEATH METAL AT ITS FINEST!!!!!!","review":"Yes, I will join these other people in saying that this is probably Morbid Angel's best album to date (Gateways To Annihilation comes close mostly for the fact that I like Steve Tucker's voice more than David Vincent's. Not to mention every track is great.) Songs like \\"Rapture\\", \\"God of Emptiness\\", and \\"Angel of Disease\\" are some of the best songs these guys have ever written. And I think I can say that Pete Sandoval is one of the best drummers in metal music and its a shame that he doesn't get the right attention. I have never heard anyone do double bass like him. Buy this now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enter The Blackened Void","review":"The songs on Covenat are not as catchy as their previous albums or the super catchy Domination. So here you have a Morbid Angel album stripped down to the brutal foundations requiring no or very little catchy riffs and leads.

The vocals consist of a continuous monotonous bark..Overall this band is boring to listen to.. Their music pretty much involves repetitive background rythem and an occassional solo mixed in.. This music stinks, Morbid Angels perception of being some type of Death metal pioneers is all hype without any substance that can be backed up in their music.. Any body that likes this is seriously disturbed..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Im done with morbid angel !","review":"Okay, im done with morbid angel because they truly suc like a vaccum, and, if any of you think i do not know deathmetal because i hate ma think again---blessed are the sick is also a terrible album so im not even going waste my time rating that crap!

He has learned the coin names as well as the demoninations and whose portrait adorns the front. With each coin inserted, the child is subjected to a short lesson about the coin with a small amount of variation.

Highly recommended!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Money removed too easily","review":"I was hoping to re-create the bank I had when I was a child. You set a goal and the bank would only open when that amount was reached. It's great that you can set a goal with this bank, but it doesn't matter because the money can be removed and reinserted EASILY. In fact, that is my kids favorite thing to do. I wanted to teach them the value of saving, but it is not possible with this bank. The learning values it teaches are great and it is fun to put money into it, but the value of reaching a goal is lost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Teaching Tool","review":"This bank has been a good teaching tool when helping my son to understand money. It teaches the child about the coins and what is on them, and it tells you the value of each coin. This also encourages the child to put their money in a safe place and uses goals to help save money instead of spending it all. When they see the money adding up, they get excited and want to save more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Idea","review":"This bank was a great idea. Both my 6 year old and 3 1/2 year old love it. My oldest got it for Christmas. Problem is, his younger brother likes to remove the back and start reinserting the money. Would have been better if it had a parent controlled lock on the drawer and as others mentioned the drawer isn't big enough. But overall both kids are impressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"To get the most out of Ray Dream, You must get this book","review":"This is a great book for learning to use Ray Dream.

More sections cover the though processes of modeling, lighting, mood, shading, composition, & animation. There are some wonderful step by step tutorials on modeling. A few include making rocks, foliage, an easy spiral staircase, and a gazebo. There are many lighting, camera, animation, and rendering technique tutorials as well.

As co-authors whose backgrounds and life experiences are quite different, both women compliment each other perfectly and come together to provide a warm, inviting place where both single and married women can come to be renewed, encouraged, and challenged in their walk with Christ. Using contemporary and Biblical examples of romantic relationships along with their own life experiences, Kathy and Dee portray the love and longing Jesus has for each of us in a romantic way that many of us have never experienced before.

So far...none have failed and the CD install makes it easy for any Luddite to install.It's not the most feature rich unit out there but it is reliable and the firmware appears to be compatable with all DSL provides and Comcast Cable.As with any piece of equipment, you may have to upgrade the firmware and alway's check the DSLReports.com Hardware forums for any possible compatability or functional issues with your specific provider before purchase"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sending it back","review":"I've had great success with Belkin wireless products in the past. I've installed several for friends and everyone has been very satisfied. My lucky streak has ended with this device.Setup was not successful with the CD. I got things working through the router's web interface. I always feel a bit uneasy about equipment that starts working for no apparent reason. Once up, the router worked great for wired computers but has a habit of dropping the wireless connection.I updated the firmware which was problematic as well. The \\"Update Firmware\\" shortcut on the web interface connected me to what I later discovered was an outdated file that the router would not accept after multiple attempts to update. Had to go to the support website and download the updated firmware there. Come on Belkin, that's just plain sloppy. Had no problems updating with that version.Wireless continued to be problematic.I hate to do it, but I'm sending it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"My parents never adopted me. Oh wait they did.

As if that wasn't bad enough, this collection doesn't even have all of the group's Top 100 US hits.

His The New Central Asia is an excellent examination of the creation of new nations that emerged from the end of the Soviet Union in 1992. He contends that while these new republics are in search of identity (in essence creating new nationalisms), they have also inherited the older Soviet system of rule and institutions, which were not democratic and more oriented to personality cults and heavy-handed treatment of the opposition. This explains the difficult path countries such as Uzbekistan and Tajikistan have had through the 1990s and into the next decade. For anyone looking at the problems of development as well as wishing to obtain a better understanding of a pivotal geo-political zone, Roy's well-researched book is worth the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"brooklynstar*","review":"Pictures are great computer genarated but did not like the sytle the book is written.

The best part of this book was the detailed artwork, but search Google for little while and you can get similar art.The writing is a terrible mess. It is unfocused and confusing.

(Five of the pieces are derived from Monteverdi's opera L'ORFEO.) It features the versatile English tenor Charles Daniels and the Montreal Baroque ensemble. Made up of Renaissance and Early Baroque vocal and instrumental pieces, it is skilfully put together, very well sung, and nicely played. Daniels has an attractive and extremely flexible voice. His work on nine of the tracks is exemplary. The remainder of the pieces are instrumental realizations. These are attractive and charming.The SACD sound is absolutely superb.This disc is an all-around winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"allegory","review":"The only thing I might add to all the previous reviews is that it isn't about the tree 'baby'?

It's a quirky little story constructed from an old fairytale. As odd as this movie is, I think it might be the most conventional Svankmajer film I've seen, but no less amazing than the others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspension of Reality","review":"This film suspended reality for me - I was entranced - the stop-motion technique alone lends to the eery feeling little Otesanek brings to the screen.

Fabulous recreation of a disturbing fairy tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd Give It Zero Stars If I Could","review":"This \\"movie\\" was the worst thing I've seen in ages! It was stupid, gory, and long. I couldn't force myself to make it to the end, but what I did sit through was terrible! I don't know what movie everyone else saw, but this thing really stunk! A woman wants a baby, her husband makes one out of wood. It comes alive, eats the cat and neighbors, leaving blood and bones - then, a little girl \\"befriends\\" it. I kid you not. The \\"animation\\" is pathetic, and the story is putrid. Excuse me, as I will now go and try to erase it from my memory! P.U.!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique film","review":"It's based on a Czech fairy tale called \\"Greedy Guts\\". A woman badly wants a baby but both she and her husband are sterile. One day her husband digs up a tree root and it looked a little like a person. So he carved it to make it look more like a baby as a joke (seems like a sick one to me) and gave it to her. The mentally unbalanced wife immediately fell in love with the ugly piece of wood and treated as a baby. This \\"baby\\" comes to life and boy is it hungry! The little girl who lives in the same building notices stuff going on and finds the truth in a book of fairy tales. She wants to save little Otik and does her darnedest.I don't want to give away too much of this movie. It's in Czech so you have to read the subtitles (unless you know Czech!). It's very good. Even the little girl's family is somewhat funny. My only complain is it could have been made shorter with good editing. I felt it got bogged down with prolonged scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't read this particular brand/type on one of my computers","review":"Can't read this particular brand/type on one of my computers.

Naturally I wanted to put a picture in it and the screws on the back were virtually impossible to loosen.

It was good timing for me and also a well done documentary. I loved the non-judgmental stance Merchant takes, particulary with the LGBT population. I didn't feel it was slanted one way or the other, just advanced a message of loving one another better. I recommended this to people of all faiths."},{"rating":"2","title":"A candid look at how non-believers see Christians.","review":"The interviews with believers and non-believers are real eye openers to how Christians are viewed by non-believers. While Dan Merchant keeps it light, very serious topics are discussed. I particularly liked the interview with Tony Campolo and Don Miller's friend. Every Christian should watch this, some to reinforce their behaviors, others to identify behaviors that need to be changed so that they can be a better witness and reach more of the non-believers for Christ."},{"rating":"1","title":"no one has ever read the bible","review":"Jesus\\"If anyone comes to me and does not hate father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters--yes, even their own life--such a person cannot be my disciple.Luke 14:26"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must see.","review":"This is a very good documentary.

The host is clearly biased toward his Christianity, and his ridicule of non-believers is prevalent in just about every opinion and comment he makes. This documentary is pro-evangelical Christianity masquerading as a secular documentary. I recommend you pass this one up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not \\"Fair and Balanced\\".","review":"The intro looked like it might take a legitimate look at the issue of personal belief systems. The guy walks around with a coverall with a Darwin fish and several heretical symbols on it. The story then descends into \\"How us Christians could have done a better job about expressing our message\\". Sophomoric. What a horrible piece of crap. You invite me in to the conversation with the pretense of reconciliation, then you mock us? Good job!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Documentary About a Man with a Mission","review":"Another one of those \\"if all Christians were like this\\" films. It happens to me sometimes.Dan Merchant walked all over the US with a white jump suit covered with bumper stickers and auto fish symbols. Both religious and non-religious, even anti-religious sentiments were expressed. His idea was to get people talking. And they certainly did.He interviewed \\"experts\\" of various types, went to events of a very, very wide variety, and apparently had himself a great time. In fact, it was not until pretty late in the movie that I figured out he was himself a Christian.This is a really enjoyable, quite eye-opening movie no matter what you believe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't we all just get along?","review":"This movie seemed to start out well, but quickly went downhill. It completely missed the true point of separation of church and state (government should be neutral in religious matters), and instead floated the old canard that certain religious displays offend people. They might, but no one has a right not to be offended in this country. He actually said he felt persecuted when he went into a store that was decorated for Christmas and there was no baby Jesus. I don't think he knows what persecution means. He went completely over the edge when he misrepresented the ACLU, who have defended the rights of individuals against the state no matter what their religious beliefs. This flick needed more research and less bias."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good movie.","review":"I enjoyed this documentary, as a Christian. There were a few things that I feel didn't portray Christians truly (like the gameshow. We aren't all ignorant of non Christian culture! We weren't always Christians, ya know...). It made me laugh a few times, and even tear up somewhere close to the end. I think it's good for Christians to see, so that they don't make the same mistakes that some are making, giving Christ a bad name when in fact He is the answer to every problem known to man. I would recommend it, and I'm pretty sure anyone would enjoy this movie, not just people who love Jesus."},{"rating":"2","title":"10hp Muffler - Tecumseh","review":"The muffler installs relatively easily once you get the proper screw driver to install the muffler to the engine. There is very little room on the left-hand screw where it attaches to the engine - a special driver it necessary but costs like $3 at a hardware store.Once fired up the muffler works okay - not as quiet as I expected but it is an improvement over the generic muffler that comes with the engine (on my generator in this instance).

It's math of a more advanced level but the language holds the interest of a younger student, without talking down to them. And it explains the higher mathematical concepts in the way a younger child's mind would work! It's like the author remembers well how he thought when he was a kid and wrote the book from that POV. You can see the light go on in the child's eyes when that algebra or logic concept clicks!This is the way math SHOULD be taught and if we gave kids a solid foundation and then gave them a challenge like this, and taught them like this, they'd be far and above students anywhere, I think, because it's not a book of tricks, it's solid math, and FUN."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warning for those living outside the US of A","review":"This is a great book. It has lots of word problems and the strategies to solve them rather than just learning by rote.However, those living outside the USA should be aware that many examples in this book use inches, feet and miles for distance and pounds and ounces for weight, with the metric system been treated as a special subject. So the weighting of questions for a metric country is the wrong way around.Money problems are of course in dollars and cents which is not a problem for most countries using a decimal currency. However, the references to nickels, dimes and quarters might throw some kids (in Australia we have 5, 10, 20 and 50 cent pieces, with no colloquialisms for them)."},{"rating":"2","title":"staying mom","review":"Our local public school uses this book for gifted children.

It's bad enough that the publisher has jacked up the price into the stratosphere, but to rub it in with black and white pictures is just wrong. Shame on McGraw Hill. Shame on the author.

I figured \\"why not support a local writer\\" (actually someone gave me the book - she was going to use it as kindling). . I couldn't have been more disappointed. This book is poorly written, amateurish - no substance whatever. I guess I'm just not a beach reader. I don't like trite storylines in books or movies.

I was never amused. I spent the whole novel wondering how it ever got published. The characters are annoying, the situation plodding and predictable, and the format was hardly groundbreaking, as it is often credited to be. The prose is juvenile.

I was excited to read it (having enjoyed the movie \\"Must Love Dogs\\") and thought that the style of writing entirely as a series of one-sided e-mails was intriguing. However, the main character's total self-absorbtion and whininess got old really quickly! She essentially stalks her neighbor, while constantly complaining about her inattentive husband. She is insecure, and - did I mention - whiney! Her most annoying characteristic, though, is her total and complete selfishness. As she is going through her mid-life crisis, she never thinks of anyone but herself, including her children, and shows no strength of character in her choices or actions.

I saw so much of myself and my friends here. Claire Cook has written a great first novel and I'm already waiting for her second."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ready to Fall","review":"I loved this book! The characterization was really strong, and the one way e-mails just said it all.

There's not a single word anywhere in this book that conveys anything other than Habe's utter boredom with his subject. Two-dimensional characters, both American and German, move through occupied Berlin just after the war, trying desperately to give their lives meaning. They fail just as much as Habe does in trying desperately to give the reader any interest.Thankfully, Gunter Grass came along to write much better stuff about occupied Berlin a couple of years later, and this faded into well-deserved obscurity.

There were few stories, and most of them were by a select group of the same authors, which also happened to be the people who put the book together. In previous books, I've found more stories from a number of submitters. This format seemed more comforting and provided a better book instead of just a bunch of inspirational jib jab by people who get paid to do it.

Stories for the consummate, naive, irrationally sentimental, all-American moron.

The video files created by the capture were huge, although I assume you could shrink such a file using various divx encoders.

In the second chapter he warns the ready about the writing becoming technical challenging but does a fair job of bringing the technology to the beginner's level. Perhaps more business books should help executives understand Internet technology so that the complexity could be appreciated in a realistic light. As with many books which try to predict future trends in Internet technology in business, Hagel works from a limited number of examples and tends to overuse some. The main weakness of the book is what many who purchase IT consulting services understand too well - early applications of new technology can easily be overpromised and deliver disappointing or more costly results. However, the book's strength is its forward-looking application of a technology that does indeed have great potential."},{"rating":"2","title":"How distributed data can bring new horizons","review":"This book is supposed to describe the benefits of using Web Services and XML to join data of various resources from different organizational units or cooperating enterprises into a single entity, but if you omit this particular \\"Web Services\\" technology, you will get a high-level outlook of problems and solutions of information technology in the modern world. You will see how the inability to processing data in correct way can slow down the development of a particular service or product. And you will see how distributed data can bring new horizons. Take fixed or cellular operator as an example. Lots of improvements have been postponed just because there was no correct billing software ready. There are many real world examples in the book to support the author's idea. All these examples are very noteworthy. I can recommend \\"Business @ the Speed of Thought\\" by Bill Gates in addition to this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"good insight, not much to execute on","review":"Well Hagel has managed to as least salvage some of the venture money that was pumped into 12 Entrepreneuring. So THIS is what he was working on for the 2 years he was there. A solid documentation of all of the work that he and the employees did. And he is smart to be making some $ from the whole thing. My sense is that Hagel is selling his reputation with this book, and not much content, and certainly less actionable content. I don't think John Seely Brown wrote anything other than the preface.The good news is that there are several clear \\"bullet point\\" type of take-aways... but nothing that isn't obvious.In summary, Hagel is a classic consultant: very good at talking about what to do and deducing \\"notions\\" --- but there is a definite business execution component missing.

He makes blanket statements which are just \\"let me tell you what to think about this\\" without backing them up.Having read at least five other bios of Philip, my estimate of this one is that it no where near does justice to the man, his spirit, character or reasons for his decisions.Walsh's is the most interesting and best researched, even forgetting that it was written long ago. He has the most love for his subject. He really shows Philip's heroic character and immense pressures, along with flaws.Kamen's is an interesting read, though it almost ignores the Catholic aspect of Philip."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for.","review":"This item is very cheap.

It's a bit unfair of them negging this item, since they were the ones gullible enough to go and buy Vista, which is the source of many software incompatibility problems. Stick with Windows XP! But that's another story.I've been using many previous versions of WinDVD, all the way back as far as version 4, and I'm very pleased with WinDVD 8. The old VGUI was a bit clumsy and inconvenient to use- this new one is much more streamlined, and runs faster as well. It supports the new H264 codecs as well, so that's handy if you're running the latest HD-DVD/Blu-Ray software. I'm very impressed with the new look- functionality is the same as previous versions of WinDVD, and it works great on XP Pro.

In the Compsons, Faulkner has craeted a family not soon forgotten. It is not a family to be admired and their circumstances should be avoided at all costs, but the Compson family is very easily identified with. The book draws the reader into the thoughts of the dying South and all that the \\"South\\" entails. The book is a challenge but gets pleasantly simple after the first two books. Faulkner's style either gets clearer or you as the reader become more accustomed to the style. Either way, the book is truely a classic that I would recommend to any of my friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much for the Average Reader","review":"I read this book, not knowing that Robert Whitlow was a christian author. I read the back and it seemed interesting(how I choose most of my books). I was overwhelmed, and not in a good way. The born-again christianity hidden within what would have been a decent story, turned me off. It made me doubt my very existence, and I think that should have been mentioned somewhere on the dust jacket. Don't misunderstand me, I was raised Catholic, and am not anti-religion, or anti-christian in any way, but the feelings that the characters described as hearing God were unrealistic, and for those of us who apparently lack this \\"calling\\" it made me feel like I was worthless, and frankly had a very negative reaction to the book with a severe emotional breakdown. Please don't try to \\"save\\" me.

I don't know what happened at the end of the book, and frankly don't think I could have stomached the relentless preaching to find out.

Rob Lamont does a superb job of narration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Objection!","review":"The story idea is interesting and captures you immediately, but like many of the reviewers have said, Whitlow uses most of the book to try to tell you his denominational views. I almost expected Renny to start speaking in tongues. There's also a few stupid things in here (like someone who should be smart, as he is a lawyer, trying to break into a mansion, only to have a security system go off...wow, who would have thought that a mansion would have a security system). There are some interesting characters in here but instead of developing them, he uses his time focusing on a prayer room and discussing topics that I as a Christian don't agree with.

His new friend has a strong faith and does not miss the spiritual connection within the group. This book chronicles Renny's journey with the group and the battles, both physical and spiritual, for his attention and his soul.I couldn't put this book down and ended up reading it all in one day.

They discover The List has a powerful evil dark side, will they be able to overcome its grip? Will Renny succomb to the longing for big money?

Foiled Again!","review":"Whitlow's novel enveloped me in its opening premise of a secretive list that offered the hero instant fortune. Set in the South, the plot meandered occasionally into locale descriptions that added a lazy, summer afternoon feel to the story. This slowed the story, but added richness and dimension to the characters. Whitlow's eventual unveiling of the curse attached to the list added a sobering spiritual touch to the story, but thankfully the curse was foiled by young Renny and Jo's faith in God. The spiritual aspects, though accurate, came into the story strong early on, and I feel might alienate those not comfortable with \\"church talk.\\" But if you can press on past that barrier, the message and story are well worth your time.

You will not just learn opening lines, but the most common tactics and mistakes found in the openings.The three hundred traps are organized by opening type with a diagram covering the most critical part of each trap. You get one entire trap per page.This book gives you a good way of studying tactics that are most likely to happen in actual games. This is extremely helpful to gain better results in your play.Since the book wasnot written recently there are some newer openings not covered and there is not a lot of detail in the analysis, but not much explaning needed in many cases anyway.A good opening trap book (or two) will do most players a world of good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"There are many more chess books than anyone could ever read, so you have to pick them well. That means skipping this one. Chernev was a great teacher, but this book is not one of his better efforts. If you're imagining that by reading this book you will learn traps you can use to win games, think again: the positions you see here are unlikely to arise in your games; if they do, you won't remember them; if you do remember them, the time you spent on the memorization would have been better spent studying tactics.

Not too many movies incorporate \\"The Green Fairy\\" in script and visuals but THAT being said, \\"LOVE IN THOUGHTS\\" features a stellar cast and gorgeous cinematography. The subtitles are clear and unobtrusive. Lead actor Daniel Bruehl first came to my attention in the Judi Dench/Maggie Smith masterpiece \\"Ladies in Lavender\\"; Anna Maria Muehe is a newcomer to these tired eyes but if I were 50 years younger she would definitely turn my head.

Very happy with this educational toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A DEFINITE MUST HAVE!","review":"I purchased this for my grandson for Christmas when he had just turned 2 and I have to say it definitely keeps his interest. When he is visiting and I am busy in the kitchen I am able to hear the sounds of the toy along with his reactions knowing he is entertained. Not only has it taught him the animals, the sounds they make but also learning where and how the pieces go. He thinks it is also very funny when he creates his own silly animal. I also find that when my older boys (high school and jr. high) have friends over they all seem to turn it on and start playing thinking this is pretty interesting. The pieces have been dropped and abused many times and it is still holding up really well. I would definitely recommend adding this to any gift list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish the magnets were stronger","review":"My son (16 months) really likes the toy, but I wish the magnetic pieces were a little stronger magnet.

HOWEVER - this toy is lots of fun for my twelve month old but he can't seem to get the pieces to fit in the barn yet. I'm sure he will enjoy it more when he is a little older. He likes to hear the banjo play and likes to get the magnets off the fridge, or press on a match that I've made for him. I also like the fact that a wrong match plays a funny song like sheep-cow = baaaa-moooo. I love the fun facts about the animals.

What's not to love with fridge magnets? The thing is, wrong body parts match to make silly creatures.

My nephew will be one in August and I assure I will be giving him this toy for his first birthday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cute toy","review":"I love this toy. My son dances on it more than he plays with the animal parts. He was 2 years old, when we got it for him and very quickly mastered the task of putting the animals together in the farm. Then, he started to experiment to put pieces of two different animals together and then, listen to the words the barn says. I must say, the things the toy says are cute and interesting even when the animals are not put together correctly. The colors are nice, the animals look cute and the melodies are rhythmic and playful. The toy is durable, because my boy carries the farm around with him, sometimes bangs it or throws it and it is good as new. I had seen this toy at friends' houses and wish that I had found it sooner for my child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading Picture","review":"This is probably a good product, but it has a \\"choking hazard\\" for children under 3, and a picute of a cute baby holding the product...., and the kid is under 3."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!!!","review":"What a fabulous toy.

The sounds are great, but it's hard for little hands to manipulate the magnets into just the right spot to make it work.

The main song is repetitive. I wouldn't buy this toy again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daughter loves it","review":"My daughter loves this toy and uses it a lot. We got this for her when she was 16 months old and she is now 2 and still enjoys it. I personally am not thrilled at the purple cow.

She used to just push the buttons to hear the songs, but now at 17 months she changes out the pieces and matches up the animal halves like a pro. I do have two small complaints about the item, which is why I only gave it 4 stars: 1) the magnets holding the barn on the fridge could be stronger, 2) the paint is chipping slightly off of the duck pieces (the most played with.) Otherwise this is a wonderful, educational toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"A pig-cow? That's silly!\\"","review":"Overall, I think this is a great toy. My daughter loves farm animals and music, so this is a good combination. Able to keep her interested for a good amt of time. My main concerns are as follows: if you choose to not store it on the fridge (because our Leap Frog Fridge Phonics takes up most of our fridge surface), it is VERY hard to keep track of the pieces, they do NOT stick to the back of the toy like they're supposed to. also, the songs/sayings get a little monotonous for adults to listen to (although my daughter loves them). So a few beefs, but overall an excellent toy with fun and educational value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute, but not good for some fridges","review":"I enjoyed the toy along with the catchy tunes (caught myself singing along often). My daughter has played with it alot. My only complaint is that it scratched the surface of my new fridge. So the 2nd fridge game I received was never put on the fridge. A little disappointed in that, but overall a cute game."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Cow Duck? That's Silly!","review":"This is my go-to toy for a first birthday gift.

Great toy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"cute, fun, a godsend while cooking","review":"This fun little toy helps entertain my daughter while I do dishes and get dinner ready. She initially just had fun fitting the pieces into the main toy; now she brings the magnets to us and says \\"horse\\" or \\"cow.\\" It's the rare educational and fun toy that makes sounds but isn't terribly annoying. There are also two volume levels, which is good for the parents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest educational toy!!!","review":"I bought this Fridge farm for my daughter when she was an infant, knowing that she would play with it as she got older. She is now 18 months old and plays with it multiple times a day. I feel that my daughter enjoys playing with it and has learned most of her animals and animal sounds just from playing with the Fridge farm. I have bought it for multiple birthdays and Christmas's for friends with young children. Each of those children have loved it as well as the parents. I highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"like it!","review":"I am usually NOT a fan of electronic \\"interactive\\" type toys. I really do like this. My 1 yr old and my 4 yr old can play with it on the fridge while I\\"m working in the kitchen. They like the music and completing the puzzles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for small children who eat toys","review":"Would have given this a 4-star rating, except we noticed yesterday that the paint is chipping off of every piece that our child has eaten over the last 2 days. Not that this toy is for eating, but if it's being sold to 1 year-old children, expect it to go in the mouth. We're hoping the paint is non-toxic.That said, if your child isn't an in-the-mouth-goes-everything kind of kid, it's a lot of fun for them to mix and match animals. What's quite nice is that there's no \\"wrong\\" answer; even animals that don't belong together teach a lesson of mix-and-match, and provide appropriate animal sounds. Downside for small hands is that the magnets are relatively strong, and fit well inside the \\"barn doors,\\" which means getting them out if your a little person isn't so easy.So, would have been better if not edible, if easier to use for small hands. For older todlers and children, would certainly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"You made a match, look what you've found. A fridge farm!","review":"My daughter received this toy as a Christmas present when she was three months old. She was far too young to even grasp what it was. However, eight months later, she still plays with it several times a day and it has well earned a permanent home on the refrigerator, well mostly on the floor in front of the refrigerator. Although she still hasn't mastered placing and matching the animal shapes, she enjoys every minute she spends with it.This is as close to being a favorite dolly or blankie as a plastic toy can get.Clever, imaginative toy sturdily constructed with sounds that do not annoy adults. Great on batteries (no lights). Fridge Farm is worth its weight in gold."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST MAGNENT TOYS EVERY ONE SHOULD HAVE","review":"This toy is sooooooo much fun for both the baby and the parent!

The pieces are easy to take off and put on and the animal shapes are very cute!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for car rides too.","review":"My two year old son immediatly started matching the animal parts.

She loves the sounds the animals make, the songs that the little chicken plays, & the songs that play when you match or mismatch the animals! I love the fact that it all goes on the fridge. I really like that fact that the magnets are not exposed and can't be pried out by little teeth.I did have to help her for the first few days.

He also loves the songs it plays and will dance around to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good investment","review":"I have used this toy in severe/profound classrooms and liked it so well I bought one for my son. It is a great way for kids to interact with math, sorting, colors, shapes and matching, along with much more. It even has two sound settings so the parents/teachers can survive it. I highly recommend this toy for the classroom or home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for my 2 & 3 year olds","review":"my daughters both like this toy. They love making the wrong combinations as much as the right combinations (there's a funny song involved with each wrong combination).

Same was true with the other leap frog fridge sets we owned.The novelty is wearing off quicker than I had hoped, but the toy is great for the age."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best toy ever","review":"I think the title sums it up.

It is our go-to toy and I recommend it for anyone and everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Choice","review":"This LeapFrog Fridge Farm is fantastic! We bought it for our grandson and he loves it. He is learning about matching the animal front to the back, colors, it reinforces the animal sound and even tells a fact about the animal. The music is lively and we sing along to the songs. It keeps him happily occupied while we are working in the kitchen. I will buy this item again for our other grandchildren!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps my 23 month old entertained","review":"This set does keep my 2 year old entertained for brief periods of time while I am cooking and I love that it has a volume on it. The songs are cute and not too annoying. ONly reason it lost a star is because I wish the animals were the color they are supposed to be. The sheep is purple for Petes Sakes. Kinda card to teach my toddler correct animal identification with this. Just a small annoyance to me like schools that use K's in their name KIDS KAMPUS SKOOL.....ummmmmm really?Otherwise I would recommend this toy. Funny enough, my 10 year old son likes mixing the animals up (1/2 cow - 1/2 sheep) for my 23 month old who thinks that is hilarious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very fun!","review":"I bought this magnetic LeapFrog set for my goddaughter who just turned one.

Now he is a little over a year and still plays with it on the fridge. Because you have to match the pieces up, which he can't do well yet, he will be playing with this for a long time, which I think makes this toy worth the money.

This set comes with five animals in two pieces, head and tail, per animal. What I liked about this toy is that it reinforces when a match has been made, BUT if a child isn't developmentally able to do that yet, it makes up a name for the animal the child has \\"created\\" by mismatching the tail and head (for example, a \\"sheep-cow\\"). I liked that it saw a mismatch as silly rather than wrong... good for very little ones who have low frustration levels. This is a quality toy, with clear sound and easy-to-grasp pieces... I'm a picky person when it comes to toys, and I highly recommend this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great toy - I wish it had more pieces, but my child loves it.","review":"As my son has grown he's switched from playing with the animal pieces to playing the farm/country song button. These are songs that should be familiar to anyone. It's nice for him to have some music on demand. But when he was playing with the animal magnets, I found myself thinking it would have been better with 1) more animals and 2) better/more accurate coloring of those animals.I like that it has positive reinforcement when a match is made and even when one is not (kids love coming up with goofy matches). The volume switch is handy as kids toys are always way too loud.The magnets are strong and it will provide a lot of fun for your child."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely adorable","review":"If you put the front end of one animal and the back end of another it will call it a combination of both names which is great fun.

My son received it for his 1st birthday. My son LOVED it but the paint chipped off within 2 weeks of him playing with it. I found this out when he had weird green and yellow flecks around his mouth. I quickly figured it out that it was from the farm set. I contacted LeapFrog and let them know that. They said it wasn't a concern to them that the paint flakes off. If we wanted a replacement or credit towards another toy, we'd have to ship the toy to them and pay for shipping on a new item. I found that to be ridiculous. I had a couple problems with some Fisher Price toys and they shipped out replacements right away, no questions asked, no money required.This toy would still be a part of this household if the paint didn't chip off. For that, and for LeapFrogs' lack of proper customer service, it went in the garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Year the horses came","review":"I found this story VERY hard to stick with.

What few details there were, seemed to portray some tribes as free loving of everyone and everything and the other tribes as viscous killing rapists. I read the reviews of this author and this series,and started reading this with high hopes of a great and enthralling tale. I MUST say that I am very disappointed. The story ended abruptly, and in an odd way, as if the next chapter was on the next page but that was it. I WOULD NOT recommend this book to any youngreader due to some of the killing and raping details. I had purchased all 3 books in this series so I will read the other 2 and hope that they're better than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is good","review":"If you like native American fiction you will enjoy this book. Compassion hate romance all that good jazz. I am already through the second book"},{"rating":"2","title":"I have had a change of heart.","review":"When I first read this book I found it lacking in depth, the good characters are VERY GOOD and the bad..you get the idea. I was stuck a train station and looking for something to read and low and behold I find a battered copy of this book.This is a good read, kinda along the lines of Brenda Gates Smith and Joan Wolf. I did like the love between Marrah and Stavan and the dangers they face.But, I haven't changed my mind on the \\"memory song\\", it went on forever and was annoying and only means something to the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"What time period in history is this?","review":"This book is very confusing to read. When and where in history did something like this take place? Who is she talking about? I know it is a book of fiction, but is there any historical fact in it? One of the reviews inside the book says \\"The beauty and complexity that existed 6000 years ago\\", and \\"Mackey joins the company of Jean Auel and Elizabeth Marshall Thomas\\"!!! Unlike Mrs. Mackey, Auel and Thomas research their books and set them in a real time in history. That is what good Historical Fiction is all about."},{"rating":"1","title":"SUCKED","review":"This is the worst book I have ever read. Almost little or no characterization, too many contradictory points, boring predictable plot, and elementary style writing. I mean come on, an English professor can do better than that. (Even the title is lame.) This book is not even fit to be in the garbage. It deserves 0 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"exciting, romantic and beautifully written","review":"I fell in love with the characters. Her description of the places and events was such, that I could see the places. The story was so romantic and touching. I cried and cheered. Thank you, Mary.. there was one problem with the book.. it had to end. I could have continued reading it on and on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely extraordinary","review":"What's amazing about these books is their power to invoke a bygone age, and the exquisite pacing. The author takes you on a journey with the characters and you can't put it down. Not only has she done her research into the details of the Neolithic -- but she tells a fine tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have spent more money","review":"It looks cheap, it is cheap.

I threw away the bowl I cooked after one bite, and I will prepare the noodles from the other bowls with any sauce other than the sauce they came with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sauce not tastey at all!!","review":"The sauce has a vinegar flavor not like regular teriyaki. As a matter of fact the thai noodles don't taste like thai sauce either.I would not buy this product if you care about taste.Noodle okay, spongey though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting Never Again","review":"I bought a package of these noodles and one from simply Asia brand. I tried the simply Asia ones first and they were so gross I had to throw them out. I was still hungry and decided to go for the Auntie Chuns but that was it. The noodles are so nasty they smell like plastic and I don't know why they call it teriyaki flavor if all it tastes like is soy sauce with extra sodium. I would rather eat ramen noodles for a month than have to eat one of these again. I am definitely staying away from Asian microwaveable foods."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful. A salty bowl of dreadfulness.","review":"Okay. I have to admit that I usually don't eat processed/pre-packaged foods. However, I was desperate for something for lunch and picked something that looked halfway decent. After picking myself up off the floor after looking at the sodium content, I decided to just go for it. I would just limit my sodium intake at dinner this evening. I only used half of the teriyaki (?) sauce and my lips are still puckered. There are so few veggies in the dish that I don't know why they even bothered to put them in there in the first place.Never, ever again. I'll stick with Amy's instead of Annie's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Practically no veggies; just noodles and sauce","review":"I agree with Audes, the picture on the front amounts to misrepresentation. Even calling the tiny amount of dried veggies in the packet \\"topping\\" is stretching it. And the procedure for draining the water from the bowl (in which I lost yet more of the topping) is downright dangerous. The noodles and sauce taste fine, but there's nothing to the product but that, for all practical purposes. Will not purchase again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't believe...","review":"GROSS! While preparing this I kept saying to myself, \\"I can't believe I'm going to eat this\\". After I took one bite I said to myself \\"I can't believe I thought I was going to eat this.\\" So yeah pretty nast. The noodles on their own smell funky.Btw I am definitely not a health nut."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good for this type of products","review":"This Teriyaki noodles could not, of course, compete with real teriyaki noodles.

I couldn't even finish the bowl; had to toss it. Would not buy this flavor again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annie Chun's Noodle Bowl Teriyaki - Pain, much pain!!!","review":"I had this for the first time today and I am in so much pain.

Could this be poison?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as pictured!","review":"I expected a bit more from the photo on the package. We all know they exaggerate a bit, but this was ridiculous! I am not kidding, there were maybe 5 kernels of corn, 6 peas, and broccoli??? NO broccoli was in this... there were some green flakes and maybe 10 tiny dried tofu cubes. The oriental noodles are spaghetti and mushy at that. We did NOT overcooked them. The flavor itself if tolerable. If you get it, be prepared to add a significant amount of veggies to it for it to resemble the photo on the packaging.We won't be buying any of these products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"Looked good on the package, seemed worth trying for a quick dinner at work. All I can say is \\"ugh\\". The noodles are acceptable.

I learned from this dreadful experience to always read the reviews first! Yuck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Sauce","review":"The sauce is the deal breaker for me. Its basically just straight soy sauce. It is not Teriyaki sauce. The noodles are fantastic however. If it only had real Teriyaki sauce it would probably be pretty good.

I will be eating the last 5 meals with store bought sauce."},{"rating":"1","title":"Edible.","review":"I think I've had this flavor; they're all so bland it's hard to distinguish them.

The people who love them must not get out much....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really 3 stars but I don't care for ramen noodles","review":"For a fast alternative to junk food this was hearty, easy to prepare and fast. I would have liked to see more vegtables in it. It enclosed a tiny vegi season packet and terriyaki sauce(sweet). Flavor was good but if you pour this sauce on ramen noodles, they would taste good. Why 4 stars? I like the way the noodles are packaged. I bought this a grocery store and would not buy again or buy this on Amazon. I ended up throwing some chopped up noodles in mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the...","review":"This is terrible food. It tastes like chemicals... even the thick 'teriyaki' sauce they give you can't hide the noxious flavor. On top of that it is so grossly over packaged I actually felt bad trying to get to the food, yet on the back they say they're \\"saving the earth one bowl at a time\\". I looked for further information on this magical plastic bowl, but found none, and they invite you to donate 19 cents, but fail to mention their donations to this cause. Classic \\"green\\" company, all marketing, no substance and making more bad food for people to digest. I don't know about the other products, but the Teriyaki Bowl is awful. No debating that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noodle sause has bad taste","review":"Although the shipping was quick, the taste of the actual product did not appeal to me. The sauce packets used in these noodles (and all of their other products, it very similar) was not very good. It was too sour and had a distinct off-flavor. I ended up not even putting in any of the sauce packets just to finish the carton off. I prefer the noodle bowls and ramin sold in supermarkets to any of the Annie Chun noodles, and the store bought versions are much cheaper, but may not be as healthy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor sound quality","review":"I was very disappointed with the sound quality, which can only be described as \\"muddy\\". Sony appears to have favored the bass with these earbuds thus high frequencies are attenuated. I did a side-by-side comparison between the Sony earbuds and a pair of $15 JVC earbuds using both my phone and an MP3 player. Five out of Five people felt the JVC earbuds were much better, and all five would not buy the Sonys. Unfortunately with a 50% restocking charge and return shipping it isn't worth returning these - $35 out the window. Hopefully others will learn from my mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great feature, poor craftmanship","review":"yeah I got this handsfree for my sony z710i,the device was horrible compared to the oem headphones that came with the phone. I lost reception on radio signal, and it was tempermental depending on how the wire would bend. Basicly it only lasted me 1 month worth of use. The only good thing about this handsfree set is the earbuds, much better than stock. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone,since it's poorly made."},{"rating":"1","title":"shotty craftsmanship","review":"This headset would have been great.. if it didn't break within a week of use.. the part that plugs into the phone cracked and now won't connect."},{"rating":"2","title":"My very first JSB novel - and I'm hooked.","review":"I picked this book up because of another author and I've found a new favorite. It's a fast-paced courtroom drama, full of believable characters and a plot that kept me surprised to the last page. The crime is straight-forward and the antagonist is definitely guilty, but the path taken to the last page - well, it's NOT straight, that's for sure! This is my first James Scott Bell novel, but I'm hooked. I like Grisham and Grafton, but Bell is now my choice for this genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suffer the Little Children","review":"This story was very similar to Jodie Picoult's book \\"Nineteen Minutes\\" about a kid who goes out and shoots & kills children. The answer in the reader's mind is Why? Miss Field smells cruption and mental child abuse. The same as in Picoult's book, only a differnt kind of Child Abuse than Darren's. Both authors make you feel sorry for the killer that they won't have to go to prison for the rest of their young life to be sexual abused and what not. These kids are damaged in some way. Not like the ones in Columbine who did it because they could.I think Mr. Bell should write a book at Mona and her husband and how they almost lost their faith and marrige."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't realize this was a \\"Christian\\" book...","review":"Well, at least I didn't realize it until the \\"God\\" references started cropping up in an otherwise interesting story. Amazon didn't bother to mention in the Product Details section that this was a book in that genre. If they had I wouldn't have wasted my money. Looks like I need to do more research before I spend my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enjoyable in the least","review":"Bell is definitely a lawyer...not a novelist. His characters are stereotypical in every essence and not very well developed. I found myself disliking each of the characters more and more as they stumbled through their own journeys of typical and unimaginative self-discovery. The twist at the end of the book was not very believable nor was the storyline well developed. Overall, I would not recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful twists and turns","review":"This was the first Jim Bell book I have read, but it won't be the last. The characters are revealed as the story moves along. They surprise you, right until the end.He has been compared to John Grisham, but I think he gives his characters more depth. Wonderful character study.. Why do people act as they do? The plot is not what it seems.Good book for a study group."},{"rating":"1","title":"distractions!","review":"so far the book is only ok-what drives me nuts is the appreviated \\"laywer speak\\" and the sloppy kindle layout with cut off lines. very distracting"},{"rating":"2","title":"RELAX","review":"Everyone needs to listen to the music and see it for what it is. sizzla is still holding firm on top of the reggae forum. What everyone needs to criticize, are the fassy hole labels that censor the albums. Every sizzla album is tight and should be listened to. Stop comparing his new tunes to his old ones.

Weak album Sizzla. I had expected so much more. Who ever it is that's making you're music, get rid of them star. Bless upI'm sorry, most distinguished gentlemen/ladies above me here, but I'm comparing this to the albums sizzla puts out that I cant bear to stop playing. Yes he is changing with the time but with his production schedule, he's loosing the gut feel he always portayed through his music/lyrics.Sorry, still a **"},{"rating":"1","title":"What ARE these people talking about?","review":"I want to start by saying that I think \\"Praise Ye Jah\\" is one of the greatest reggae albums ever made. That being said, Sizzla has gone completely off the edge. His vocals sound like garbage, and he's off-key most of the time. There's also some wack falsetto stuff that he tries to do which just sounds ridiculous. There are a couple (count 'em - 2) nice tracks, but the rest is filler, and bad filler at that.Respect to Fatis and the Exterminator crew, but Sizzla's lyrics and performances have seriously deteriorated in the past 3 years. Now its just a matter of churning out as much as he can and counting on syncophantic reggae fans to buy it all. Don't believe the hype.Steer clear of this record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Orderly But Condescending","review":"Helpful as a comparison of Rabbinical Jewish beliefs from the perspective of (Catholic?) Christianity. Topics are ordered according to Christian theology.The author uses this book as a perch from which to snipe Jews. Even as a former Christian, I found the author's condescension hard to stomach.His mistranslation of the Birkat HaMinim is just the sort of thing half-educated Christians need to justify a future pogrom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money if you want music!","review":"Once again, those who want to make money shamelessly off of Deep Purple fans have done it again. I am certainly a big fan, but this disc was a disgrace to the \\"Machine Head\\" name. I had hoped that this disc would FINALLY be THE disc that gave us complete live performances of the fantastic tracks on this album/CD. There were none that I saw. After wading through the \\"primary\\" material I lightly checked out the \\"bonus\\" material. As it didn't seem much different I gave up. I am thankful that I chose to rent it via Netflix before purchasing it.

Otherwise, don't waste your time nor money."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS HAS NO MUSIC AT ALL!","review":"If you are expecting to see a music overall video of Machine Head or even a few videos of the songs (what I expected), you are in for a great desception. If you are into boring explanations by Roger Glover of how they wrote the songs or a couple of music bars by Jon Lord sitting at his Hammond, then you may like this DVD. To be honest, as much as I like Deep Purple and consider this album the beginning of Heavy Metal, the band members seem half dead or just too stoned in it, mainly Ian Paice. I mean, he is without a doubt the best rock drummer in history, but in this video he may have had a few Valiums when he taped these interviews. We are talking of over an hour of blah blah blah blah, with a miserable couple, repeat couple of music notes that only tease you into hearing more, but heck, this ain't worth my time. Personally, I think this DVD stinks and am in the process of returning it to the merchant. You have been warned..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep Purple Rockumetary","review":"I need to qualify this by saying I am not a Purple fan. But my husband is from back in the day.

Well, most of the live footage was overdubbed with studio music and some of the footage or I should say very short snips of it was overdubbed with a different song than they were playing live!

They didn't include some of the songs the actors sang either. I don't think they really thought it through before they released this album.

It has less than half the songs on here and most of them aren't the ones most people like anyway and if they are then they are sung by different people rather than the people like River and Samantha who sang them in the film (Personally I think that they did a way better job than the guys on the CD anyway). It's just such a shame that such an amazing and inspiring film could have such a rubbish soundtrack.

Joe's sounds, playing and accompaniment are out of this world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Music","review":"Joe Pass and Ella Fitgerald created an amazing music on this album (and others as well), displaying an amazing sense of swing and melody. It is stunning how subtly Joe Pass complements Ella Fitgerald, and how she opens the heart of each song she sings. It is obvious how much each are listening to each other by the way they create such beautiful music. I would highly recommend this album to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heard it all before","review":"Divided Multitude sound like a band that has developed its skills just enough to be able to copy its influences. I was reminded (and not subtly, either) of Pallas, Dream Theater and Symphony X, and even Queen in some of the vocal arrangements. That being said, Divided Multitude lack the virtuosity, speed and creativity of these bands. The singer sounds like every other singer in the genre, and the lyrics are poor. They probably should have sung in Norwegian - that might have made the album more interesting. As it is, there are some really predictable, cliche and hokey forced rhymes - and thinly disguised Norwegian accents. Nevertheless, the music is often catchy - even entertaining if you play it loud enough. It's not a bad album, per se. It's just desperately lacking in originality.Is it a convincing attempt at progressive metal? Yes. You know what they're up to and recognize the contours of the genre throughout. Is it an impressive attempt at progressive metal? Hardly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like it!","review":"Actually i lost the tape for this...had to order the cd instead...Always liked CMB music.. had a HUGE love/crush on the lead singer (bryan abrams).. very good looking man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"I thought that this album was great, but some of the songs weren't my favorite.

The characters dressed and acted just like my friends and I did during that time period and certainly listened to the same music. Though I was an adult rather than a student the era was the same. I am so pleased with the soundtrack it never leaves my CD wallet. Anyone who loves the rock of the late 70s and very early 80s will be glad they bought this album. The best artists, terrific songs, a good time will be had by all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Classic Rock Soundtrack","review":"If all movie soundtracks had this many great tunes from various artists there wouldnt be anyone buying individual artist albums/cds.If you like classic rock you will love this soundtrack period! I think movie soundracks in general are good because if you liked the music while watching the movie you know you'll like the soundtrack. How many times have you bought an album or cd of one artist only to find you only enjoy a few songs from it. Soundtracks offer various artists and usually only pick hit songs so you get more quality music and dont need to fast forward or rewind to enjoy them."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"DAZED AND CONFUSED ABOUT THE ADVERTISING\\"","review":"I was looking to get the DVD of DAZED AND CONFUSED but got the CD.

However, many of them still get heavy airplay on classic rock stations. Not one song on this album is bad. Personal favorites include \\"Cherry Bomb\\" and \\"Tuesday's Gone.\\" Other solid tracks include \\"Low Rider,\\" \\"Tush\\" and \\"Love Hurts.\\"If you've seen the film, you already know that it lives and dies by the music that's constantly played in it. Much like \\"Swingers,\\" \\"Dazed And Confused\\" is a very good film, but the soundtrack selection makes it great.I gave this album four stars because there are some key tunes missing (most notably \\"Hurricane,\\" by Bob Dylan). Also, the classic rock vibe is broken up by \\"Jim Dandy,\\" which doesn't quit fit in as well as the rest of the tunes. It's still a good song, though. This is an excellent album, and if you enjoy classic rock or grew up listening to these tunes, I'm sure you'll enjoy it (and the film). Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only 2 weak spots on the entire CD","review":"I would have given this 4 1/2 stars, but considering there is no 1/2 star, 4 stars it is. All tracks are fabulous 70's fare from heavy metal to AM friendly pop songs. One problem: They included uncut versions of STRANGLEHOLD & HIGHWAY STAR, but gave us the edited version of SLOW RIDE. The weak spots are LOVE HURTS & TUESDAY's GONE. Other than those 2 tracks, this is the ultamate party CD ! The surprize highlight of this soundtrack: CHERRY BOMB!!! It's a hoot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music for a cool movie","review":"I loved the soundtrack to dazed and confused.

I read this book wanting to discover an author I've never read from before. Out of all of the myriad of novels I've read in the past couple of decades I have to say this was my least liked.

With many books under my belt--I must admit this was one of the most excellent written books out there!The words just seem to flow. You just get started into it and before long, you notice you're on page 100. It's written in a way that make you feel all the emotions Av Ludlow experiences, as if you were in his shoes. Anyone who has had a beloved pet taken away from them and violently killed by a ruthless, sadistic person, will surely be able to empathize with Av's situation--and feel like standing up and cheering for him!This is the first book I've read by Jack Ketchum. I plan to read more of his works because I was so impressed. Don't hesitate to pick up this book and read it if you get the chance. You won't be sorry! :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge fan but not of this book","review":"I love Jack Ketchum's novels but never got around to reading this one. I was a bit disappointed by the lack of horror in this novel and the slow pace. Especially since the novel is basically a novella. Also some of the character's dynamics didn't make sense to me,,, for example the young reporter that falls in lust with the main character. Ketchum doesn't give any backdrop or anything for this encounter other than describing the man as a less than desirable physical speciman. But we are to believe that she falls in love with him INSTANTLY?????? The novel is too short to give an in-depth character study but yet the book isn't intense either like some novellas are.for example, the novella that it's packaged with \\"The passenger\\" is much better at pacing and intensity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This is the first Ketchum book I have read and I really enjoyed it.

There are so many 5 star reviews here for Red I have to wonder if I read the same book. I was incredibly disappointed. The writing itself is nothing more than competent. The characters are cardboard cutouts standing in for real people and the plots are wholly unoriginal. The story seems to be there mainly for Ketchum to set up violent scenes just for the sake of having violent scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"minus horror","review":"The first chapter of this book shows incredible promise; dark, malicious, moody. A dog gets shot in the head by some mean-spirited rich kids. Aha! A tale of vengeance.Unfortunately, the first chapter is the high-water mark and each following paragraph spirals into sentimental and meaningless exposition which never seems to scratch the surface. There was a premise here, something with which Ketchum could have pressed further into, and we the reader would have been treated to a real macabre insight as to what makes people mean, what revenge does to the person seeking it, and what happens after that.Instead, Ketchum treads softly, tapping into fear like the Sci-Fi Channel taps into science fiction, amusing ridiculous characters and simple-minded explanations then wrapping it up quickly so he could go to bed or watch CSI.I knew there was a reason I rarely wander from the literature section. Some writers just don't have the balls."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for preparing our birth child for adoption","review":"We have a 5 year old son and are planning to adopt a child through county DHR. We looked everywhere to find a book that explains adoption to our birth child. This one did the trick. It is written to the adopted child but we were able to use it with our birth child.

The load of laundry that I washed with them was also covered in lint. The sheets are very thin and not that warm. I've purchased flannel sheets from LL Bean that are far superior in quality...they are much thicker, warmer and don't leave residue in my washer and dryer.

This opinion was based on the price being under $20. Boy, was I surprised. These sheets are a thick flannel and are so cozy and comfortable. They have not gotten \\"scratchy\\" and I have washed and dried them several times. I have bought other flannel sheet at retail stores and have found them to be rather thin compared to these sheets.

It was a very happy surprise and I will buy more of these sheets when the need arises."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Deal for Cozy Sheet Set","review":"The Pinzon 160-gram flannel sheet set is a great buy for the cold winter months.

The pills that showed up after washing were ridiculous and made the sheets look as if they'd been used for years and feel rough to the touch.I bought two other sets at around the same time because the price was so low (expectations weren't really high, thankfully) and didn't even think about using them on the beds after the first set, but since they were on sale, I didn't throw away a bundle on them, and so decided to keep them, cut them into smaller pieces and use them as the inner layer of rag quilts, where the pilling won't be visible, anyway. For that use, I'd probably buy again if the price were low enough.On a positive note, the sheets didn't seem to shrink an unreasonable amount and would've fit the mattress fine had I been tough enough to sleep on them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flannel sheets","review":"The cal king flannel sheets are great. It was wonderful finding a fitted flannel sheet that fit our mattress. They are very comfy and warm.

Maybe that will stop.OVERALL They are Great!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great price, low quality!","review":"We anticipated receiving some great sheets at a great price.

We have alternated between two sets on our King bed for years now and have not witnessed any piling. I don't believe we had as much dryer lint when they were new either (there is obviously none now). These sheets were also more expensive though.We have washed and dried these new sheets twice now (right out of the package) and the amount of dryer lint and sheet piling has been staggering.Would I buy these again for this price? - maybe, but I would not expect even standard flannel sheet performance.

And I am picky about my sheets."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for...","review":"I read many positive reviews on these sheets, so I decided to give them a try. They are indeed sheets. I am giving the company the benefit of the doubt and will accept the premise that they are flannel. As far as the quality goes, one wash and they already began to pill, as did the matching duvet cover. The pilling has increased with each washing. These are not sheets you would want to put out for guests--they look worn and somewhat skanky even when they are just out of the dryer. They feel somewhat stiff but not hair spray crispy--certainly not baby soft flannel. For the price, I probably shouldn't have expected much better. For $50, I have a duvet cover, pillowcases and one sheet set. I would not buy from this brand again, even with the low price for the set. Pretty crap overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flannel sheets pill and shed","review":"I purchased these sheets because they were a good buy but not so cheap that they would be uncomfortable.But, I never figured they would pill so badly. When I first washed and dried them I had to empty the dryer lint filter twice on that load. But I thought all of the loose material would get out of them that way. No, they are still shedding so I cannot recommend them. They are soft though but the pills stick to your pajamas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Very Satisfied","review":"The first time I washed these they had all those little balls and I was a little dissappointed, but otherwise very satisfied especially considering the price.

Scotti blatently rips off her predecessors' accounts of the 1938 Hurricane, particularly Everett Allen's. She is writing for the obese Oprah's Book Club-following 40-something American woman who likes Crystal Light, Julia Roberts, and People magazine. No analysis in Sudden Storm is original; nearly everything Scotti introduces can be found in an earlier work. To the uneducated reader Scotti tells a wonderful and exciting tale, but to anyone who's familiar with the history beind the 1938 Hurricane, Sudden Storm is a pathetic attempt to cash in on the trend of thick New England middle-aged women's sad hobby of glazing over history and then swallowing the commercial output (Sudden Storm) like they would a hot Krispy Kreme."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic read","review":"As a life-long resident of New England and more recently of Westerly, RI, I was fascinated by the story of this hurricane.

He is mostly known for his collaboration in Muddy Water's band (\\"Chicago blues\\"). This recording documents his outstanding abilities as a solo piano artist and singer. The recording was made in a studio in Denmark using high quality audio equipment, so despite its age (over 40 years) the sound quality is excellent (which, unfortunately, can not be said about many of the other Otis Spann records). Otis Span plays the piano in a very beautiful way. His left hand is on par with the right hand leading to a very rhythmic and powerful sound which impresses not only by clarity and technical perfection, but also by a great dynamic range.

HOWEVER, the CD player is downright pathetic. It will not play any homemade CDs and I suspect it might have something to do with the company that built it (Sony is well known for their hyper-strident stance on copyright issues). So, we can't use any of our friend's productions (I have several musician friends who record their own music) and we can't play any of our own compilation CDs in it. Bummer. CDs that play in every other CD player we own but not in this one. In addition, older CDs have a tough time getting kick started. Newer ones (last 10 years or so I guess) are OK.

Rosey reviews are wrong.","review":"Sorry guys, but I've evaluated this radio carefully now for months. And while you can move the powercord to improve reception, it is station specific, and a bulky powercord is just not something you should have to move around all the time, and worse: have hanging around your countertop. The entire POINT of this radio is to have it up and out of the way.Secondly, the \\"mega bass\\" is a joke. The sound (CD too) is horribly tinny. I have speakers of similar diameter which produce far more balanced sound. How dare Sony put out a product like this. If it hadn't been a gift given to me several months after purchase, I would have returned it instantly.1. Do not believe the rosey reviews.

When we contacted Sony we were informed that our only option was to mail it to their repair center at our cost and have a refurbished model sent back. Shipping set us back about $25 (not including the cost of packing materials).

The CD player worked for 3 months. I shipped unit back to Sony for repair. Lasted another 3 months and again same problem. Shipped it back again this time it only lasted 1 month. Again back to Sony it lasted 1 month and back to Sony! This time it lasted 2 weeks!! The first return they sent me a refurbished unit. Then after that they supposively repaired the unit...NOT! Service was awful too. They talk to you with canned script. Major LEMON! I see others have had the same experience. Yet Sony denies this is a major problem. They act like I was the only one having this problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I just got this unit and it is great. The installation was alot easier than I expected. All I had to do was use the sheet of paper that came with it, marked and drilled three holes, and screwed the screws in. Simple.The sound is better than that of the Philips boombox that it replaced. And it doesn't take up any counter space and even has a remote that sticks on the fridge. I highly recommend this product to anybody that likes to have music while cooking."},{"rating":"1","title":"No aux jack","review":"This has been a workhorse in our kitchen, but as soon as I started using an iPod, it became almost useless.

Not only was it incredibly easy to install, but it's just the right size and fits perfectly under our cabinets. I hardly ever listen to the radio, so I really can't comment on the FM/AM reception quality, although it seemed to work just fine when we tested everything to make sure it worked. The unit was easy to program and the CD player works great. I was pretty amazed by the sound quality, which is very good. The bass is also very impressive, and the volume can be turned up very loud so we can enjoy music throughout the main floor of our house. The remote control is also very handy, and it even has a magnet on the back so we can stick it on the refrigerator without worrying that it might get lost. All in all, this radio is excellent, and it's a great value for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked great -- for a month","review":"The FujiFilm cameras seem like an exceptional value with excellent features, but how reliable is the xD card storage medium? I purchased the 256 MB card and it worked just a few weeks before it began to malfunction. When it was inserted into the Alladin kiosks, now at many stores, it had to be reinserted again and again. Then when the pics are printed they are too dark. Apparently one of the metalic contacts has become damaged. Upon close examination it appears far to easy for this to happen. Given the many removals and insertions that may be required using the xD card it seems less well constructed than rival cards. Sadly, this also impacts the usability of the camera. When I contact Fuji, I find a knee-deep phone menu with plenty of deadends, and the customary \\"due to unusual call volume ....\\" message.

It was nominated for 6 Golden Globes and 2 Oscars. It won the Golden Globe for Best Comedy. Set during WWII when Italy surrenders to the Allies. Anthony Quinn plays Bombolini. He becomes the town mayor and has to devise a plan to save the town's million bottles of wine from the now occupying Germans. Hardy Kruger does an excellent job as the German officer trying to take the wine.My favorite scene is when Bombolini finds out that Fabio, the local hunk, was making love to his daughter, Angela. He says, \\"I'm going to punish that boy so that he remembers it for the rest of his life.\\" In the next scene we see Fabio and Angela leaving the church as a newly married couple.See the other comments for the VHS version of this film.The Secret of Santa Vittoria"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo! Bella!","review":"\\"Secret of Santa Vittoria\\" is a wonderfully flavorful comic drama whose major fault can be overlength which is apparent in the film's second half. Anthony Quinn, whose made a garden industry out of playing earthy peasant types(I wasn't a big fan of Zorba), is totally winning as the town clown, Italo Bombolini, foisted into the position of mayor on the eve of the German occupation in the waning days of World War II. The town's lifeblood is it's wine supply and the German's intentions are to abscond with it and it's up to the fool Bombolini to outsmart the master race. Hardy Kruger is equally fine as a German officer torn by gentility and his desire not to look foolish in front of these \\"barbarians\\". Anna Magnani shines as Bombolini's hard-bitten long-suffering spouse. The film looks great and you get a real sense of community here.

But one might expect a movie not to be a travesty of the book. Anthony Quinn is charming and lovable as always. But his performance could not save the film. The characters were portrayed as ridiculous simple-minded caricatures. If you've read the book, don't bother with the movie - it will only tarnish your experience of the story.

NMTB dealt with abortion, the Berlin Wall, government corruption, narcissism, and the incompetence of the press, and a whole lot more.If only they had a proper manager and had left John Beverly (aka Sid Vicious) in the audience.

NO."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not particularly informative or entertaining","review":"Basically this book was a dissapointment. Written by a well meaning but hapless couple who seem more interested in putting down stakes in a live-aboard community than cruising. I knew going in that there would be scant information on the technical aspects of sailing and cruising but I was at least hoping for some enlightenment on on-board living. It is replete with lame advice like 'try to shop around for the best fuel prices' and other obvious tidbits. The live-aboard etiquette section was quite interesting although the description of the lifestyle seemed more like squatters than cruisers.

I'm there! This movie has much more to recommend it than fleeting moments of eye candy. Caan's portrayal of devoted son trying to make the most of a bad situation.

The son of the great James Caan, his pedigree may well be taken care of, but he still had a lot to therein live up to. And he did so in an amazing list of acting jobs that include 'Gone In 60 Seconds,' \`Novocaine,' \`Varsity Blues' and even the cheesy 'American Outlaws' and 'Ready To Rumble'. In 'Speed of Life' Caan is the central character that takes care of his \`fast-fading' father in much the same way a new mother would take care of her newborn. Finally pushed to levels he never realized he could feel, Drew (Caan) turns to drugs to relax, but ends up losing his job, his common sense and finally his judgement. That all said, it's Leo Burmester's ('The Abyss,' \`The Neon Bible') role as Caan's relapsed father that steals the show and the heart strings well before the tortured end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartbreaking but very good.","review":"I thought this was a very good movie.

Yes, I got tape 2 of 4 from one program, 3 of 6 from this program, etc. etc. The seller eventually refunded my money but it was an adventure in patience.When shopping for this item, try to make sure you get the workbook.

The author's liberal bias is not only evident, it's the purpose of the book. The intended audience is young, naive teachers with a very weak or no background in math or science and with no background in economics, i.e. gullible neophytes who can be conned into believing anything by someone with just a bit more knowledge. From that starting point, the author plays on the reader's emotions to \\"teach\\" false economics and encourage readers to think along politically correct lines and buy into left wing agendas. The book is filled with so much politically correct nonsense and economic fallacies that any usefullness is lost. The books primary intent is not to make mathematicians and scientists critical thinkers. Rather, it's to encourage mathematicians and scientists to place multiculturalism and other goals of the far left as central in their pursuits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ben Harper: Narcissism and self-worship","review":"This video is a great snapshot into the mind of a narcissist.

The songs are basically good - they just cry out for a good singer to deliver them. Book of Liars is the standout tune and the one that suits Walters droney voice best.

The rhythms from the guitars and drums are quite funky in a slightly unusual way. The special effects particularly on Hard Up Case, Lucky Henry, and Hat Too Flat are quite interesting. However, most of the songs are very identical in song structure and style. Most of the songs consist of a few chords usually with the same progression repeated over and over again. Pretty annoying after a while. In addition, Walter seems to sing each song in the same manner. Furthermore, most if not all the songs seems to have a sleazy overtone to it. Just read the titles. After a while, this can really drain on any listener. There are a few worthwhile cuts(Down At The Bottom, Junkie Girl, Hat Too Flat, Book Of Liars) and a few good moments here and there among the remaining eight tracks. However, when compared to any of Steely Dan or Donald Fagen recordings, it rates as its title suggests."},{"rating":"1","title":"Initial Disappointment....","review":"This is the first Steely Dan, Fagen and/or Becker related album that I didn't like and find totally addictive on first listen...I'm going to to give it a couple more spins but, initially disappointing : (11 Tracks Of Wack S**T"},{"rating":"1","title":"Steely Don","review":"As a long time Steely Dan fan (as far back as \\"Can't Buy A Thrill\\"), I thought that perhaps I passed over a hidden gem in this album.

I tried to imagine what it would sound like if the tunes had been sung by Donald Fagen but that wouldn't even help this weak effort. I honestly can't find one redeeming thing about it. Walter's vocals are about as unemotional and monotone as one can get. The compositions are predictable, uninteresting and amateurish and I've heard better production values in people's studio bedrooms. It's amazing to me that Mr. Becker is half of the writing team of one of the most brilliant writing duos of our time.

For example, I doubt that by reading this book, a child would be compelled to free an opossum from a roof gutter. Yes, I suppose that could happen, but realistically, I doubt it. What this book does really well is get kids and their parents talking about the respectful treatment of animals. It also encourages children to treat animals with kindness, which is fantastic.Matilda Mae: The Dog Who Needed a Name"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly decent movie!","review":"For a flick that never made it to the theater, this movie was surprisingly good.

Someday, I hope to be able to make their spectacular Seikaiha (Blue Ocean Wave). Fortunately, however, the book says that the Tsuri Fune (FIshing Boat) is fairly easy to make -- and it, too, is very beautiful.In short, I love this book, and highly recommend it to anyone interested in this form of origami.

From the heart pounding intro to the last song, Pac, or \\"Makaveli\\" easily cusses his way to classic status. \\"Hail Mary\\" is one of 2Pac's better songs, as his eerie voice sets the mood. \\"Toss it Up\\" has him dissing Dr. Dre and talking a little about thug love. But it is when Pac adresses the obstacles in life is when he is absolutely flawless. \\"Blasphemy\\" is an informative and intersting track. \\"White Man'z World\\" is another rhythymic PSA. But for all of his songs with good messages, a hardcore thug life song is soon to follow, and in this case it's \\"Me and My Girlfriend\\", where the man adresses his love for the gun.

Supposedly the wrath of his alter-ego Makaveli, this CD covers no new territory, sticking to the same \\"been there, done that\\" themes on \\"All Eyez on Me\\".

It is on par with 'All Eyez on Me' (which is also one of the best hip-hop albums of all time) in terms of production, surpasses it in terms of quality and only falls short of that masterpiece in terms of quantity; and the quality of this album is evident in each and every track...I consider this one of the best masterpieces in hip-hop history.

Readers join Dallas (a successful pastor's wife) on her descent from a mega-church ministry into jails and seedy motels on a quest for truth--a truth that, if revealed, could cost her marriage and her husband's ministry. As always, Bell weaves subplots and dizzying twists into a mind-bending story.Memorable characters, engaging dialogue, and page-turning plot twists made this a book I couldn't put down. I loved the dramatic court case scenes, as well as the tender scenes between mother and children.It's not mere entertainment--it contains a message that many apathetic Americans need to hear.

I used this tool to realign the lights. As I backed the adjustment stud out to aim the vertical aim of the headlight it trapped the wrench on the 4mm hex end because there was not enough clearance between the hex end and the radiator. I had to screw the hex back in with an adjustable wrench after removing the radiator shroud cap, removing this tool and making the adjustments with the adjustable wrench, then replacing the radiator shroud cap. About four times the work of not using this tool. I gave this tool away to a friend three days after it arrived.If it were an open end wrench of the same design it would be great but the closed design causes problems in tight spaces.-Pete"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good price on a Hard-to-Find Tool","review":"Could not find this tool locally.

The long handle makes it simple and quick to make adjustments. I saw in other reviews that the space in other Ford vehicles is tight, but there's plenty of room in the Ranger.It's not obvious which way to turn the screws for up/down or left/right, so you have to experiment. You just flip the wrench around to turn the other way. Unlike regular \\"clicking\\" ratchet wrenches, the fine-ratchet capability on this tool makes it easy to do micro-adjusting, and it also makes sure that you can turn the headlight screw even if you have only a short swing on the ratchet handle.(FYI: for the Ranger, the bottom screw is vertical, top screw is horizontal.)A great tool, makes an otherwise crummy job simple."},{"rating":"2","title":"Natural Health Remedies","review":"I think this is an excellent resource to have in the home for continual review of different health conditions and natural(herbs and vitamins)waysof treatment.

Form took a front seat to function. It required too much strength to pry apart the sides to mount a new roll. We'd also tend to crush or crunch the inner cardboard paper towel roll in the process. The rolls would always catch because the black rubber balls are ... rubber! Rubber and cardboard present a high friction combination, and the roll would not spin. So you'd end up having to force it to spin to find the perforation. Finally, when removing rolls, the black balls would pop off easily, bounce and roll away.

He is so gross and odd. He meets this hottie and follows her around like a puppy. It is so easy to read this book because you just want to know what will happen next to Greebee and this chick. The structure of this book is so unique--every other chapter is devoted to a chapter in Greebee's self-help manual called CUTLAS. If you are addicted to self-help books, but never seem to learn anything from them, you should read this book. It is what all self-help addicts deserve! Great concept."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like it!","review":"I really wanted to like this book, I just couldn't get through it. The premise was confusing, and I found it the book boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great premise, terrible book","review":"The title and description of this book make it sound really good - a scrubby 40 year old writes a manifesto on how to live your life without watching what you eat, how you exercise, etc...you know, sort of like Fight Club. However, within a few pages our overweight, disgusting narrator meets a beautiful young girl and proceeds to spend the rest of the book with her and her tall, hot friend. The book goes absolutely nowhere and by the time it ends with a ridiculously pornographic (and not to mention LONG) section in a bizarre sex club, you're thrilled that it's over. Dissapointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy this Book if you are Plus Size","review":"The book description states it is for any size but then only supplies patterns for S-M-L."},{"rating":"2","title":"Use this book as a starting point on your new wardrobe!","review":"This is a wonderful book for anyone who wants to make more than silly frou-frou things and other stuff that collects dust. I prefer utility, and these clothes are utility and fashion at the same time. I've made two tuxedo shirts, two dresses (one cowl-necked with a matching scarf), seven pairs of slim pants, one t-shirt, and plan to make a lot more, plus some I haven't done yet. These are the clothes that look good, are easy to make, easy to wear, and have endless variations. Soon I hope to make a nice poly/wool jacket, and maybe a cool-weather dress with a vest. I'm still thinking about trying the palazzo pants, but I didn't buy this book for that. The other garments are not going to be out of style anytime soon, even if the palazzo pants are. Unfortunately, I think about how to make these clothes while I'm driving, which is not safe in Houston. But really--measure twice, cut once, and enjoy the easiest to make modern clothes around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brand New Book from Amazon, But No Patterns???","review":"I only just received my brand new copy from Amazon, and have been scratching my head. I read all the other reviews about making sure to buy a new copy - - - NOT used - - - because of the supposedly included patterns that the book is based on. I don't quite understand. I should have gotten patterns with this book - right? It's brand new, with the price to prove it! Not from Amazon Marketplace or used, NEW. WHERE ARE MY PATTERNS???I can't use the book without the patterns --- if there were minus stars, that's what I'd give this book - because they sold it to me with the understanding that the patterns would be included - so minus the patterns equals minus stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Make SURE you get the patterns!!!!!","review":"This looks like a great book - if you can stand Sandra's shameless self-promotion...she's a good sewing teacher. The styles are mostly loose and comfy-looking and quite straighforward - the kind you can afford to make up in expensive fabric. BE SURE you get the patterns with the book - I bought my book used, and it didn't have patterns. As I began to read, it kept referring to the patterns...so what patterns was she talking about???? The ones that were marketed WITH the new book. The patterns can be purchased from Sandra's website for US $12, plus shipping, so you'll have to decide it if's worth it to buy used or buy new from Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"BE CERTAIN YOU GET THE PATTERNS W/BOOK!","review":"After reading the book, I feel that Sandra Betzina is an excellent sewing teacher and the patterns are loose-fitting, easy-to-sew classics. HOWEVER, I bought my copy USED from Amazon and did not get the patterns which SHOULD BE INCLUDED with the book. She also includes instructions for modifying the patterns to fit various sizes and body shapes."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like the speed sewing techniques","review":"I like this book very much and have made several of the patterns that are included. The palazzo pants are quick to make up and flattering as well as comfortable. The wardrobe advice is nice if you need to develop your own style. If you have been sewing for yourself for a while you don't really need it. I like the classic styles and her speed sewing techniques make this book a good one for beginners or advanced sewers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Patterns, patterns, where are the patterns?","review":"I just did the same dumb thing that everyone else has done...I bought what I thought was a well priced book (which I understood to be in excellent condition). Unfortunately, the term \\"excellent\\" appears to have been misused, since the patterns were not shipped with the book. Yes, I can go to the website and get them (which I'll probably have to do), but I've learned a HUGE lesson in not paying one bit of attention to what a seller (Amazon sponsored book seller) says, and ask questions anyway. Looks like a great book, but if I'd purchased it to just read, I would have bought it for Kindle. :-("},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Ideas","review":"Liked the book. Good layout.

Many of the designs feature over-sized clothing, but are still flattering. I especially like the tuxedo shirt - it's a twist on a real classic.Still, I'm wondering whether pull-on palazzo pants are \\"classic\\" or if this is just elephant pants revisited from the '70s that will be out-of-fashion in 2 years? Some of the fitting advice doesn't make sense -- for example, to adjust the crotch depth, compare whether the pants you buy are long or short crotch depth - now, really, as if one would knowingly buy pants that fit poorly! Ignore the wardrobe advice section - it's absurb to still read the dated notion that all women over 30 must wear makeup."},{"rating":"2","title":"three TV episodes edited into a movie","review":"Three episodes of the show were edited together to make this movie for folks like me. I enjoyed Black Scorpion 1 and 2, but I hadn't seen the show. Sting gave me a chance to see what I'd missed. I watched and ended up enjoying it. Michelle Lintel is a doll. Scott Valentine is well cast. Frank Gorshin is superb. Sting really grew on me. I ultimately bought the complete TV show, but it made Sting obsolete. The same three episodes are included in that set too. I think the complete series is a great buy. You might want to get that instead of Sting. It's more expensive, but a great collection for Scorpion fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Good Adventure","review":"My friends and I started this adventure about six months ago and just got done with it about a month ago.

I recommend Volume Three with Stephen Covey, Deepak Chopra and others. This book is not a deep study of one particular business topic. Instead, each author tells their story of success from their own perspective while focusing on their particular business expertise. By the time you're read all twelve authors, you've got a plate full of new insights and inspiration. I like the intervew format. It's a quick, easy read. Great for airports and soccer practices."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Series, product display not good...","review":"I went online and finally found a review on this ultimate collection and found out that the discs were all on one single spindle and like a cushion to keep them from moving around. I didn't like that but I wanted this series for so long and when I knew I could get all three for a lower price than spending much more for each one individually it was perfect. Anyway what I did was I ordered a 6 disc dvd case from One Stop Outlet here on Amazon.com, and got ten cases for a low price. Once I received both items I simply placed the discs in the nice 6 disc case and placed the cover art through the case sleeve. I did find out that the cover was a tad to big but all I needed to do was cut a small strip off the back cover without taking to much of the art off and simply slid it in there and it fit perfectly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little More Than Sensationalist Fiction","review":"I read this book when I was actually in Borneo where I spent over a year, visiting many of the places described in the book.I found it plainly ridiculous!The real Borneo is nothing like the mystical \\"deepest-darkest\\" fantasy-world described in this story, nor was it even when those travels were supposedly taking place...It is amazing that this book got such good marks from other readers and probably the best example of how many high tales a writer can get away with about far-away places where most readers haven't been. :-)A more realistic description of the same places on a similar trip could be read inA Stroll Through Borneoby James Barclay."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story","review":"If you have ever wondered what it is like to go native in the rainforest with the indigenous people, this book is tailor made for you.

There are many struggles and laughs along the way as he places his life in the hands of strangers, viewing a way of life among the jungle dwellers that probably no longer exists in our times due to logging and capitalism. Educational and entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterful story telling","review":"I read this unforgettable book several years ago and recommended it to one of the reviewers in your home page! I remember the unusually captivating style that transports you right there in the seething rainforest with Eric, Bok and Weng. His descriptions of the language and culture are accurate and helped me see the linguistic and cultural connections between Borneo and a certain Filipino tribal group (Pampangos) I never realized before. Truly an adventurous experience that I have rarely enjoyed with other books. Eric Hansen is one of very few present day writers that I enjoy. A must read for those who enjoy a break from this concrete jungle and sometimes mean-spirited world we call civilization. That jungle will seem more civilized than some places you've been to in times past."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nomadic Penan now official settled","review":"[...] I just watched Ian McKenzie - in a documentary called the Last Nomads [...] It is heart breaking as I had read Eric Hansen's book. I knew that the Penan nomadic culture would face extinction but I didn't realize that the time has already arrived. McKenzie has recorded the traditional Penan culture as much as possible. [...] So Eric Hansen's book is obviously a Westerner's take on the Penan but I remember the book being truly inspiring - not to mention the unhindered defecation. haha."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even my 6 year old daughter thought this book was idiotic.","review":"My review title really says it all.

I can't wait till his cd comes out. This first track is off da hook.

This song was incredibly slept on, which is a shame because it's my 3rd favorite Maxwell song behind 1) Cococure and 2) I'm You. Maxwell is known for having that thumping bassline that gets you going and lyrics that actually mean something (if somewhat confusing at times). And his adlibbing is splendid. Luckily, on \\"Now\\", Max once again teams up with Sade musician, Stuart Matthewman (multi-instrumental genius) and gives us nothing short of a spectacular album. I just hope I don't have to wait another 3 years for one my favorite neo-soul artists to come out with another album."},{"rating":"2","title":"One for the heart","review":"For all residents of Southern California past, present, or potential, there can be no better book about this unmatchable part of the world. Past residents (like myself) will sigh with fond remembrance, current residents will be amused, and potential future residents will be astonished. All will be entertained. The land, the geography, the history, and the weather. They're all discussed. The social outcasts, the wierd misfits, the kooks, the characters, and their schemes and dreams. It's all here, along with so very much more. Written by a longtime resident in a very entertaining style that combines dinner conversation with classroom lecture, this book will be a joy to anyone who has a love for the irreplacable experience of Living In Southern California. You will truly FEEL as though you are there. This book is one for the heart as well as the mind. Oh Los Angeles, how I miss you. Carey McWilliams, thanks for taking me back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pricey, but worth it.","review":"This slide bar has a great feel & nice weight. Very easy to play with. It's a little extra $, but worth it. I use it with my arch-top & am planning on getting a lap steel soon. It's much easier to play with than a finger slide. It's more accurate and heavier, so it has better sustain & doesn't bounce around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lucado says what he wants","review":"Reviewing a book such as this is tough. Lucado presents a heart warming philosophy. More of us should adopt it. However, Lucado tends to focus on what he wants. Using scripture to inforce what he is saying, ignoring either verses that counter his point or arrogantly misquoting scripture. Either way you can find books that are truer to scripture and more satisfying also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Patronizing Tone That Never Delivers on Facts about Jesus","review":"For any thinking individual this book lacks deep substance and mimics common patronizing Christian dogma. The title and author's note leads one to believe that the book deeply accounts Christ's life and what He stood for...however does not deliver in any meaningful way. I was very frustrated hearing the story about the leper which Lucado made up...it was redundant and did not illuminate any deeper understanding of Christ; it was a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"Lucado has done it again! This book is so great that I have bought several to give away. No- it's not intellectually stimulating- I don't think the author intended it to be- it is \\"heart\\" and \\"spirit\\" stimulating. Anyone as intelligent as Lucado could write something too difficult for us to understand, but he chooses to use a style that all of us can relate to- Just like Jesus did (and does)"},{"rating":"2","title":"My first Lucado book-- it won't be my last. Great!","review":"I had heard so much about Max Lucado and his books. I finally bought one and now I see what everyone is talking about.

I liked it so much I have ordered two more to give as Christmas gifts."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Suspended Literary Work\\"","review":"A well of pondering this book brought out in me. Max Lucado suspended the time of Christ applyed it into my life today. The book \\"Just like Jesus\\" revealed the \\"not so good\\" in the \\"pretty darn good person\\" and how to evolve into a Christ like figure. I would give this book to my best friend and my worst enemy. A Superb peice of material to read, especially if one is a first time reader of this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic text to help you improve your walk with Jesus!","review":"Max Lucado has once again presented the world a means of help in understanding how to improve your Christianity. This book is like a step-by-step guidline on how to better open yourself to the world and walk as Jesus walks. My Sunday School department is presently using this text as a study guide with the Bible, and we enjoy it thoroughly. I HIGHLY recommend this to any church or person who wants an insight on better living your life for Christ and the Father in Heaven!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good stories, no meat","review":"Like most of Max Lucado's work, this book is a good compliation of stories with very little to offer in the way of thought provoking writing.

I had heard good reviews from local christians, but the book was much more simplistic and less enlightening than I had expected. The ideas are simple, but he repeats them often enough to have the ideas sink in. For some, this may seem like manna. I was looking for more substance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"It is written by Max Lucado! Nothing else needs to be said. Simple to read, yet profound in subject matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book to take Christians further","review":"Lucado does mankind a great service introducing this often humorous portrayal of Jesus. Not since Patton's breath-taking \\"The Autobiography of Jesus of Nazareth and the Missing Years\\" have I read anything like this. Both Patton and Lucardo breath life into the man history refers to as Jesus in such a way that he is pertinent to our daily lives. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better every time I read it.","review":"I have owned this book for years, and have many others of Lucado's books. I've taken this from my shelf and read it numerous times and each time it gets better. I know -- the book can't actually get better, since it doesn't change. But I am changed each time I read it. I love his analogies and stories and other ways of illustrating his points. I find no fault at all with his theology.

In fact it is just the reverse, and Lucado, whether accidentaly or by design, makes some poor theological inferences. There are some endearing things, that along devotional lines will warm your heart. But overall, there are far better works to read if you truly want to know Christ, and be just like Him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for Bible Study","review":"Our women's college bible study used Mr. Lucado's book as a focus last spring semester - I enjoyed the way he fused humor, anecdotes and Bible passages...his writing truly made God's Word come alive!! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"great content, interesting font","review":"So I love this book. It's life changing, moving, beautiful. It's one of those books that tells you why you should be just like Jesus, but then gives you real tools to do so. Only problem with it was when they sent me the books (I bought them for our Community Group) they were the \\"comfort print\\" which means the font was so big there's only about three words on a page. It didn't say that's what I was ordering which bugs a little. Anyway, I highly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeping my husband busy","review":"This was actually purchased for my fourty year old husband who hadn't put a model together in probably 30 years.

He is now five months old and this calendar, which I LOVE, has copious notes of his life thus far. It has allowed me to keep track of his milestones and development in a very easy way. It was particularly useful during the first four months when I could only write little bits at a time due to acute DeQuervain's tendinitis. The calendar is attractive, especially if you are like me and shun cutesy, pastel-laden baby goods, and I found the layout and the stickers to be very well organized and user-friendly. I would recommend buying some high quality permanent ink pens (e.g. Staedtler) in a couple of different colors (black, blue, red and green) and thicknesses (.05 mm and .5 mm). It's nice to have the ultrafine pens to write small notes into the calendar. I am going to buy this for all my friends who are pregnant. It is definitely something you want to get BEFORE you have your baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Record Book for New Baby","review":"I loved this calendar because it makes it so easy to keep track of baby's \\"firsts\\". After loving the one I had for my first child, I got one for my second child when she was born - by then my older child was 4. Then I was able to compare the timing of their first sitting, crawling, bath etc. very easily. When you are too busy to fill out a conventional baby book - this one is great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated Calendar Design!","review":"I was disappointed with this calendar. There are not very many milestone stickers and the pictures are outdated. Each month looks very similar in design which I feel would make it less interesting to look back when the baby is grown. I will not use this calendar. My older child had one that was much more visually pleasing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate this thing","review":"First let me say, it's a hassle because you have to write in the dates of every month because it is all blank. Some may say this is nice but I found it very difficult to keep up with. I need the simplicity of one already made up ready to write in. The stickers are a nice addition. The thing that was the most frustrating is that there isn't enough pages to have the final month in order to write their first birthday or anything. There are only tweleve pages. That was a little frustrating to me. If I could go back I would have just used a real calendar. It is much simpler. I will give it credit for being cute and a nice keepsake."},{"rating":"1","title":"All pictures, no text","review":"Each page has a bunch of pictures, with a caption. No detail, no text.

This book is fun to read and has wonderful pictures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just a cookbook -- a sociological foray","review":"Just as in the original \\"White Trash Cooking\\", there are recipes here, but more of an emphasis on cooking for groups. The various situations that call for group food are presented -- quilting bees, funerals, reunions, obligatory holidays. Each chapter is prefaced by a short story illustrating the heart of white trash. The photos are truly astounding, and as in the first book, a big part of the book's appeal. These people don't ever apologize for being white-trash -- they're simple, unvarnished, and neighborly. So is their food.The recipes are even more outrageously white-trashy than in the first book -- while there are several recipes I tried from the first, there aren't as many that I'd call accessible in this one. I also find dialect-writing difficult to follow. Still, the last chapter is truly touching: An eloquent plea for people to cook with their own hands, instead of relying on store-bought \\"mummafied\\" food. Well said!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Do it again.","review":"If you've seen #1, then this is more of the same. The stories are so good, you'll laugh out loud.

The authors show how the revolutionary political and religious upheavals of the mid-17th century in England spawned a floating, multiracial \\"motley crew\\" which provided the street mobs whose demonstrations gave impetus to the breakaway of the American colony. They also deal with the counter-revolutionary reaction to the many-headed hydra as ruling elites took extreme measures to suppress the mob.

I wore it one day to a pirate parade in Tampa, and I had to throw it away after that. As soon as I went to put it on, the material was falling apart on me. The laces on the cuffs broke off, and the straps on the pants came off. There was no way to tighten the pants and they kept falling down.

Don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont' believe the hype!","review":"I thought that this product looked interesting so I read the reviews regarding this product and made my purchase based on that. I have to say that based on these ratings I was disappointed in the taste. It's almost indescribable. Because of the chicory root it has a slight coffee taste which is fine if you are expecting a mocha but this is supposed to be chocolate fudge and it is only slightly sweet with a weird taste. I had to doctor it up by adding fat-free milk and a little sweetener to improve the taste. I also poured it over ice to chill it. I have to say I would not buy this again and my kids didn't like it either. If you are able to try it or buy it in a single container do that first rather than ordering a case of it. I now have 11 containers that my family does not want to drink and is only going to waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as RightSize Smoothies...","review":"These thick things are no match in any way to RightSize Smoothies.

I thought it was just me.

But the last few times that I've had them, my stomach has been gurgling for several hours from the excess gas, and I've been in pain. While I like them, the discomfort outweighs any benefits. Maybe it's just some digestive systems and not everyone would experience it, but for me....uggghhhhhh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Snack!!","review":"They taste great! They really are satisfying!

I down it! I drink Lightfull mid-afternoon to tide me over between lunch and dinner. It fills me up, and the chocolate fudge flavor especially satisfies my sweet tooth.

For fellow Weight Watchers, this translates into a one point snack that is delicious AND counts as a milk since it is yogurt/nonfat milk based. Yes, I am way excited when I find stuff like this.

And since my women friends are getting tired of my bugging them for date ideas, this book is wonderful! Not to mention that my women friends are releived I'm not bugging them anymore. But seriously, this book contains literally a ton (well ok maybe more like 75 or 80) ideas for dates. And they are for the most part \\"alternative\\" ideas and not ones like the dreaded \\"movie\\" or \\"dinner\\" date. Things like live theater, train rides, planetarium or factory tours, film festivals, bird watching, etc.Not only are the ideas mentioned, but also background information about them. For example, the author lists playing pool as a date idea and then lists the different types of pool games there are. I never knew that.

(1) the obvious: movie, window shopping, dinner, etc., (2) the silly (lunch at a hot dog stand--do you really need instructions?) and (3) the ones you wish, like share a bath. Hint: if you and your date are taking baths together this book is superfluous.Of course there is the usual, film festival, wine festival, bike ride and so on.

While this film, in my opinion, doesn't live up to TITA, it is still a killer film in it's own right. Worth every penny. Cinematography is stellar. Soundtrack is good. Riding is solid. It just didn't quite measure up to Travis and company's last one. But that is an unfair comparison. I doubt any movie will ever be as good as TITA. This is a close second. Travis kills it as usual. And the rest of the crew are no slouch.If you have never seen \\"That's It, That's All\\", buy this first, prepare to be blown away, and you'll be left wondering, \\"How can any snowboarding film ever top THAT?!\\" Then, go watch TITA, and you'll have your answer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Artfully Energetic","review":"If you're looking for a non-stop heart pumping thriller with punk rock blaring in the background to get you stoked before your pre-run, this might not necessarily be for you.

I'll admit that I haven't spent oodles of time with this book, so I'm not sure how helpful others will view this review.

It introduces you to music theory, how to read tablature, etc. Unfortunately, I haven't had the time to heavily invest in the harmonica; however, my wife's started recognizing little riffs the book has introduced me to, and the cd sounds promising. It makes you want to play better with the band that's in the background, and Gindick has lots of enthusiasm for playing.Other reviewers may not like the whole 'caveman' motif, but it's not that bad.

Both are excellent. While I was no longer an absolute beginner, this book would still be suitable for someone with no music experience at all. Even so, there was PLENTY of new and useful material for me. In fact I have a friend that I consider an advanced blues harp player, and he still enjoys these books and finds them very useful. The CD is packed with good instruction and music to play along with as you advance. The instruction is on one channel and the background music is on the other - cool idea to give you more control.

Got a Hohner Pro-harp and Jon's book, and discovered a whole new world out there. If you want to learn Blues Harmonica in theory and practice in a really fun, but no-nonsense way, this is the best I've seen. The book covers all the basics - a bit of music theory, diatonic harmonica theory, riffs, bends, hand effects - all you need to know. But best of all is the companion CD, which Jon talks and plays you through. You'll just want to listen to this for fun. But you WILL learn. Jon has a unique style of teaching that really works, and speaks volumes for his ability, knowledge, and desire to teach you. I want to ultimately get more of his follow-up books and CD's.

For beginner, I suggest that you stick with the manuals. Only buy this book if you are already experience in Maya. I agree with the comment that the editor and proof-readers of the book did not do a good job. So, you will expect to see mistakes here and there. But you should get the latest updates from the book's website. If you're experience, you will be able to spot the mistakes and carry on with the tutorials. But if you're beginner, I wish you good luck! For effects wannabe, this book does present a good overall idea of what to expect and how to use Maya to work out those effects. Pretty decent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good!","review":"I'm a student taking some graphics and animation courses. I bought this book for study of Maya since my school teach maya. Before I read the book I dont have any idea of production. But now, I got a much better idea of what happens in production. I agree that Maya is just a tool. And there are many things needed for a real work in a production environemnt. One thing about the book, I think the publisher did not do a good job by editing it. Also, whoever proofed read the book must be half asleep. This cause the book with several errors. But lucky the book is still contain good stuff. In conclusion, I recommend it to people who like to learn effects animation, especially using Maya to do effects and especially if you are student like me."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was in a rush to be the first Maya book printed.","review":"Perhaps this book deserves two or three stars, but I felt I had to offset the bizarre five star reviews that this book has been getting. Some of the techniques might be useful, but the final results of the tutorials are not worthy of the potential of Maya (except the cake tutorial). Most of the expressions don't work if you type them in straight from the book, and the printed screenshots border on useless. It would have been nice to have a little more explanation on WHY a certain shader utility was used or a certain expression, instead of just following the instructions. This is sure to be a favorite among warez users because of the lack of Maya documentation available though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alright","review":"This is an alright book with miss printed error like those that said below.

People somewhere in the middle may learn a thing or two, but overall I believe this to be a waste of money. If you have the program, you have the manuals, and they will play a better role in helping you with Maya than this book. The front cover is a testament to the rushed nature of this book, and the almost careless attitude with which it was released. The art samples, done in Maya from some of the tutorials in it, are [bad], and as soon as I saw the cover I became very nervous about the hard-earned money flying out of my pocket to the land of lost cash.

It is poorly written, with the grammar and punctuation errors causing me to wonder if English was the author's first language.

At times it is clever and interesting, at times just juvenile. Most of the time, the authors are trying too hard.

So I had high hopes for the 2nd Grade Leapster cartridges since the 1st Grade cartridge was fun and educational. However, my daughter and I had such a hard time physically moving the characters through the game jumps and leaps that we did not move ahead educationally. Even as an adult, I could not get the character to jump to certain clouds (if you miss/fall, you have to restart that challenge area again). Therefore, when you are at a more advanced level of the game, my child cannot even reach the next question, even with my help. Very Frustrating!

But this isn't one. In this book, a child loses her parents and is found by another tribe who distrusts her because she looks different. They fear their spirits won't accept her. The medicine woman and cacique (leader) take her in. As she grows, she wants to learn about weapons, which is forbidden. When she reaches adulthood, she is raped, and later banished. Sound familiar? If I hadn't already read \\"Clan of the Cave Bear\\" I probably would have enjoyed this story more; it's not badly written.

Seven weeks of blissful nothingness, with no demands on one's time or space? Well, that's the kind of \\"vacation\\" Doris Grumbach took during one Maine winter. While she did make some inroads on the novel she was working on, she found herself spending more moments in personal reflection -- about past experiences, about friends and family members, about being alone, and about writing in general. The result is this slim volume of musings. Readers who are writers will get the most out of these pages. Anyone considering spending some time alone will benefit as well. For it is only after we know who we are on our own, that we can understand our connections with others."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mere gathering of musings, indeed!","review":"I was disappointed , I couldn't get over the fact that the title of this book is not totally about solitude . The author went into town to buy goods, she spoke to the postman on occasion and ups delivery service,.She had access to a telephone with a tape message machine and access to the internet. I believe she spoke to the neighbor,as well.Internet access-- now. thats a connection!Her musing were boring, They were very subjective--the authors experience.I felt forced as the reader to look into her life and her experiences and interpretations. Such a heavy title , not represented well throughout the book.The fact that she had access to the internet, a phone and T.V. by the way, she would listen to the news and whatever,strips the imagination of desparateness, survival and immediate thoughts and feelings. Perhaps pure reflectiveness without connectiveness would be more poignant.Nothing to ponder or to learn from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good...","review":"This was the case I picked up when I got my iPod to protect it from scratches. I've learned that there is no point - your iPod is inevitably going to get scratched, they are ridiculously prone to this.But, this case does little to help. It doesn't protect the corners of the unit, which is a minor annoyance. What really isn't good at all though is that the loose stitching and hard pattern that keeps the screen protector in place scratches the front of the iPod!!!! This is NOT very impressive for a utility that's supposed to do the opposite!As well as this, you can't use your iPod in a dock while it's in this.

Oattes opines about all manner of topics, from 'conspiracy theory,' to love, to the visual/emotional simplicity of \\"Watching Planes\\" (the cut that made me buy the album). \\"Frame By Frame\\" gets into my iPod mixes with the likes of Al Stewart, Jim Brickman, and the mighty Chris Rea.

There are not an overabundance of sample exercises as in some physics texts. Sample exercises are well worked out and quite readable. The text is presented in a little more personal manner than most.

First, he sees beneath the surface of things. He goes to the heart. Powlison shows how our anger is often rooted in heart attitudes and unmet expectations.

His questions are challenging but gentle, aimed to draw out our hearts to deal with anger in a God-honoring way."},{"rating":"2","title":"A class act indeed","review":"This is a very visual account of the life of one of the greatest decorators of our time.

It's a fast, riveting read with crisp, visual writing. It's thriller, romance, travelogue. The characters are well drawn and developed, the locations so beautifully described that you are there.

It lingers for a day or so when I spray it on my clothes. But unfortunately it really doesn't last at all - I get no sillage with this fragrance & on my skin it disappears after a few minutes.

Watchman Nee was a great servant of the Lord, and while disagreeing with his theology is the right of anyone, slandering it is disgraceful. It is a grave disservice to God, and a tawdry human task, to seek enemies among friends. Surely there are wolves among the sheep, but Watchman Nee is certainly not one of them. That Mr. Roberts would entertain and lend credence to the spurious claims of infidelity leveled against Nee is to make libel and rumor the equivalent of fact. I could not finish this book because of its disagreeable, haughty tone. Perhaps Mr. Roberts ameliorates his attitude later, but I was unwilling to find out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"I have to put my thumbs down on this book because I find it highly biased.

THE TITLE OF THIS BOOK IS EXTREMELY DECEPTIVE!","review":"The author presents this books as pro Watchman Nee - when it is a blatant attack on Watchman Nee. Roberts is entitled to his opinion, and can write a book against Watchman Nee's teachings if he wants to. But I take issue with the extremely deceptive presentation of his book. Anyone looking at the book will be tricked into thinking the writer is fairly presenting Rev. Nee's teachings. BE WARNED - HE IS NOT!

The raw voice intertwines with lovely, delicate music on some songs-- exotic Spanish-style guitar on the softly moving \\"The Last Rays of Sunlight\\"-- and a more raucous arrangements on others. And the lyrics! There's a lot of optimism, but also some forays into loss and regret... \\"It Is What It Is and That's All\\" is a standout for music and words: \\"...you'll look backwards an' long for/ the things/ That you'll find it's then too late to do\\"; but while he can bring you up short with such a masterful turn of phrase, Forbert will always offer perspective and solace, as exemplified by this song's title. The only downturn for me is \\"Don't Talk to Me\\"-- too raunchy, seems misplaced here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality","review":"This film ensures the best photo experience ever.

In one section, where Chopra discusses the \\"connectedness of the universe,\\" there is an attempt to bolster his argument throught the use, or misuse, of presentation of a quantum physics theorem. His own understanding of Bell's theorem consists of a deep misunderstanding of what quantum physics is and how one may generalize from its theorems.All-in-all, a bad book, which free mixes science with pseudo-science to yield an unpalatable concoction"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunate and sad","review":"I had the misfortune of acquiring this book and found it filled with unproven, at times absurd theories supposedly linking ailments with some obscure physics theories. Sad to say, but ''quantum'' seems to be the buzz word these days, and is marketable in its own sense. Add ''healing'' to the title and you have a seller, no matter the content. It was a stroke of marketing genius, but morally speaking, is a sad addition to humanity's written legacy.I won't get rid of it by selling it to a used book store. Some other unwitting buyer might stumble upon it (cheap) and buy it, thereby losing his time and, worse, possibly get false hope.I have a degree in physics by the way, and though I do not claim to be an authority, I know gibberish when I read it.Fair warning to anyone considering purchase of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring & Hopeful","review":"This book is inspiring and hopeful, though it has been heavily criticized by many circles. If we could view the book from a neutral standpoint and not simply focus on hating the author's philosophies and assumptions, the basic message is that we could benefit from investigating what constitutes 'placebo', and if we can in fact encourage this not just when we are sick but for every day health as well. Lots of good information here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read with a quantum of scepticism...","review":"Clearly book has good content - and I believe educating oneself is vital in dealing with disease. However, Dr Chopra's credibility totally vaporises when he tries to give a physical explanation for the link between mind and body; his scientific/spiritual jargon is well chosen to snow-blind the reader. He makes vague, untestable (nonsensical) assertions to sew his his work into a reasonable sounding and *marketable* form. I am not in the pay of big pharma - I have no particular axe to grind - and the book is certainly not all bad - but as someone who knows physics I can tell you that Dr Chopra is abusing it. Also, while you are still thinking for yourself, google the 'appeal to antiquity' fallacy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete nonsense","review":"Deepak might be correct in his assertion that one's mental state affects the healing process, and that certain practices of eastern medicine offer great promise in treating a variety of ailments. But by dressing up his stories, anecdotes and blanket assertions in scientific terminology like \\"Quantum Healing\\" Deepak is telling what amounts to a lie. What passes for scientific \\"reasoning\\" in Deepak's book would cause a four year old to howl in laughter.I don't understand why the other reviewers can't see this for themselves. I have a simple question to ask the reviewer who wrote:\\"If you are into learning about how molecules of the stomach (neurotransmitters), are the same as those in the central nervous system, and therefore, think, then this book is for you\\"Following the same logic, many of the molecules in a lump of coal (carbon) are the same as those in your brain (again, carbon).

It is not pure liquid sucralose, so you'll add more than a single drop to your recipes or drinks, and there are other products if you want it more concentrated.For this product, 1 teaspoon is equal to 8 teaspoons of sugar (or 4 packets of powered Splenda). I find this to be a good compromise in cooking since I can measure a bit more precisely if needed, unlikely the more concentrated versions of liquid sucralose which tend to be about the same sweetness per drop (hard to measure smaller than that). I've used the product in flavoring drinks (including coffee) as well as things like cheesecake with very good results.I would, however, recommend picking up the product at netrition where the product cost is a bit lower and the shipping cost is much lower (I picked up 5 16oz bottles and only paid $4.95 shipping)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as REAL liquid sucralose","review":"I tried this hoping that it would be a cost-effective alternative to using REAL liquid sucralose, which I love!

What little spiritual content there was was buried within tiresome big business rhetoric. The chapters all run together unidentified, without titles, the editing is choppy, the colors very dark and hard to see in daylight hours, and the production values very poor.

The triple-flange sleeves are designed to get you a better seal in your ear, and they do accomplish that (in comparison with the other plastic sleeves originally included with the earphones).Nevertheless, these sleeves have a big drawback: they're extremely uncomfortable. They are very long and often feel like they're putting pressure on my inner ear, pressure that extends almost into the throat area. If I were to do it all over again, I would buy a pack of replacement foam sleeves instead. I believe you can get a 10-pair pack of the foam replacements for $20. The foam inserts are simply more comfortable (more like a soft earplug) and, if replaced often enough, create a seal with relative ease."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better sound isolation!","review":"These tips help the headphones stay in the ear much better than the tips the Shures come with. they are fairly soft and comfortable to wear and provide a better seal resulting in better sound.

These tips a must have if you use your headphones during physical exercise. they actually stay in."},{"rating":"2","title":"great enhancement for noise cancellation and sound improvement","review":"These sleeves worked great for increasing the effective noise cancelling capability as well as the overall sound quality of the E3c earphones. They most noticably improved the bass response - as they make for a much more secure fit. They fit better if the stem is trimmed to be flush with the flange itself, and although they were specifically noted to be for the e1's and e5's, they work great on my e3's. Overall - a great way to enhance the earphones that I would recommend to everyone that uses them."},{"rating":"1","title":"They fit pretty well, but sound quality suffers","review":"Happy with the three tips included, I decided to try these for the heck of it. While they go nicely and comfortably deep into the ear and don't dare come out until you intend for them to, for some reason, they diminish the quality of the sound greatly.

I believe While We Cry was recorded in Kenny's home town of Shreveport at a festival called the Red Rvier Revel, but that could be wrong. It's a very good live performance and impressive when you think of how young he was when it was recorded.

Practice tests in this book don't include critical reasoning, nor do they cover most of the sentence correction topics covered in the real GMAT. The math questions don't include anything with prime numbers, integers, or inequalities, all of which are prevalant on the real GMAT.

The woman (heroine?)was a victim of her parents and was willingly manipulated by an awful father. Her husband? I actually liked him better than her since he at least acknowledged he had a problem. What I really find shocking, though, is the attitude of the reviewers. One calls the issue of beating up women a \\"controversial\\" subject. One relegates this violence to \\"political correctness\\". I really thought beating the h--- out of someone smaller than you was universially deplored (except by the perpetrator). There's nothing controversial or political about beating up women and children. It's quite simply disgusting and the bully who does it is a scum bag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"I somehow managed to finish this book. I found the characters dull, the plot boring.

An abusive husband, best friends sleeping with husbands, I don't care that they were already divorced, you don't do that to a friend. I probably get too involved with the book, but this is my escape, I would prefer their life to be better than mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like a story where a real problem has to be solved.","review":"I read some of the previous reviews that focus on the domestic violence and whether a man could ever really recover, and I think they did an excellent job, so I won't go over that ground again. All I want to say is that I get incredibly tired of stories where there is no real problem that the hero and heroine have to solve, so the plot has to revolve around some stupid misunderstanding that would be resolved if the two principles would just talk to one another for 5 minutes. There is meat to this story. I enjoyed it. Thanks, Mary Jo."},{"rating":"1","title":"1st Review Ever for Worst Book by Favorite Author ever","review":"I'm sick to my stomach.The author has the heroine blaming herself for not staying in an abusive relationship to try and fix it. That she only put up with it long enough for a few ER visits and then got out without giving her marriage a real chance by fighting for it.I read until almost 100 pages until the end, hoping that she'd finally stop being \\"discrete\\" and not \\"gossiping\\" or \\"airing dirty laundry\\" and finally tell her mother why she left the man her parents adored as their own.Her mother said one or two things about how awful it was that he hit her and that they never could have loved him like they did if they'd known, but within a few sentences was praising the virtues of forgiveness.This is a sick book and the message it sends hurts my heart.I'll take a bullet for my husband as long as he's not pointing the gun.This book says that, if you're a good wife, you'll have found a way to make him put down the gun and treat you right. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"DISTURBING","review":"As some of the other reviewers, I too have witnessed violence against women, and found this book very disturbing. When I first realized where this book was going, I started to put it down, but decided I would see how she handled the subject. I admit this book was well written and emotional, I had knots in my stomach every time Donovan got mad, I was not convinced he was \\"cured\\" maybe just simmering... I loved Mary Jo Putney's previous works, but this one... a mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Plot, Broing Development","review":"Putney has a good plot line. It's too bad she didn't develop it better. The characters are not endearing enough to get the reader emoitionally invovled. Also, she depends too much on the dialogue to get the story out. As a result, the characters have conversations that seem forced and unnatural. They also tend to use words and phrases every so often that people do not use today. As a first attempt at a contemporary story, this is a good effort. However, Putney needs to put away the behaviors of her period books when writing for today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give her other books a try!!","review":"Overall I thought it was just okay at best. If I had not read some of her other books, I would not do so now. All of the demolition stuff bored me after a bit. The mystery of the cause of the problems seemed obvious. I did not like Kate, her mother, her father or her friends. The only one I liked was Donovan and I felt bad for liking an abusive guy. I was happy that the retelling of the violence was not too detailed or too violent. I have read much worse in \\"Romance\\" novels and was led to believe that this one was difficult to read. While I think no one should put up with being hit even one time and should definitely not feel shame as though they were the cause of the violence, I think that the way this story was written one could believe that Donovan was no longer dangerous. Kate seemed to come from a pretty messed up family and I almost felt that the reformed Donovan deserved better. In the end I just didn't care about any of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"good writing, unbelievable story","review":"I have always enjoyed Ms. Putney's historical romances very much. And I found this to be an engrossing book to read, but I found the treatment of abuse in this relationship to be too simplified. The heroine stayed with her abusive husband until she became violent in response to him, and that's what finally made her leave? Please. I also found it completely unbelievable that she did not tell anyone why she left her husband, and then put up with attempts to get them back together from her family - and the main reason she did this was to save the relationship between her father and her husband? No way. Finally, the \\"cure\\" of her ex-husband was mentioned only briefly - he went into group therapy after she left - but he was still having violent reactions to her by the end of the book. I never believed that he was \\"cured\\" (for lack of a better word), and that their relationship would ever be a healthy one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just couldn't read this....","review":"First of all, I must tell you that I ADORE Mary Jo Putney's work. Some of her books - The Rake, Shattered Rainbows and One Perfect Rose- are on my keepers shelf forever. But this one? Nope. I knew there was trouble when on Pg. 1 the background profession was going to be demolition. Boring. I knew there was going to be more trouble when I could put the book down and NOT want to pick it up. Those other 3 books I mentioned? Family and domestic life stopped until I finished those! But I kept telling myself that this was Mary Jo Putney and that the story was bound to improve. Well, when Donovan hit Kate across the mouth and sent her flying, I almost vomited. I knew I couldn't read this book. I know MJP tackles \\"issues\\" (alcoholism, etc.) and I knew this was her first foray into contemporary but it wasn't the book for me. As everyone else has said - try it - and decide for yourself. But I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dissapointing","review":"In the past, I have enjoyed every one of Mary Jo Putney's books, finding them well written and a real pleasure to read. That's why \\"Burning Point\\" was such a big dissappointment. As Ms. Putney states very clearly at the end of the book, domestic violence is WRONG! She should also have remembered that once a man gets a taste for slapping his wife around, he will NEVER stop, until she leaves or she's dead. His prostestations of love and being sorry are useless when the woman is lying there with a broken jaw and a black eye. I'm rather suprised that Ms. Putney wasted her time on such a subject.This is not a man you'd want around. And, once again, we are assaulted with the sterotype of the drunk Irishman.... Give this one a pass, and perhaps lousy sales will send Ms. Putney back to what she does better than anyone else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second Chances","review":"I may be in the minority here but I thought this book was very well written and thought provoking. As Ms. Putney has stated at the end of her book: she writes about second chances and forgiveness. It's easy to jump on the bandwagon and say this book was terrible because everybody else said so but I ask each of you that read this review: read the book and decide for yourself. Spousal abuse is wrong, wrong, wrong but everybody deserves a second chance if they are deserving of such and that is what this book is about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poignant Read!","review":"Kate Corsi's family business is explosive demolition. When her father dies in an explosion-gone-wrong, Kate returns home for the first time in a decade. There she's not only forced to confront demons from her past, but according to her father's will, she has to live with her biggest demon -- her ex-husband -- for the next year.Patrick Donovan knows that the blame for his marriage to Kate falling apart a decade ago lies squarely on his shoulder. But though he's changed many things in his life there is one thing that's never changed -- his feelings for Kate. Because of her father's will he has a chance to prove to her that people can change for the better, and that their love is still there, just buried deep and waiting to be resurrected.The Burning Point is a powerful story of a love that never died, and two people who are brave enough to reach into the recesses of their souls to find it. Mary Jo Putney proves her contemporary \\"voice\\" is every bit as strong as her historical \\"voice.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A Contemporary Romance?","review":"A Burning Point focuses on a difficult subject. Having gone through this situation myself, I believed the premise. My problem was the book itself.Ms. Putney's characters, for me, displayed only surface emotions. I never understood their behavior patterns--the problems that drove them apart. Or, the problems that drove them together. And, probably as it SHOULDN'T be, I actually liked Donovan better than Kate.Secondly, I found the story going in too many directions, with too many characters. The problems of Tom, Kate's brother, may have belonged in another novel. Also, the secondary romance, while nice, distracted me from what was probably meant to be the \\"burning point\\". Add to that the \\"mystery?\\", you've got a book, that is, only half done--in several places. Also, I found Ms. Putney's contemporary-speak, uneven.Will I try another contemporary by Ms. Putney. I kind of doubt it. For me, it wasn't the subject, but the story, which made this a read I didn't enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful new novel by this fine author!","review":"A complex psychological novel of redemption, love, responsibility, change, and forgiveness, this is probably Putney's most mature novel to date. It represents a terrific entry into the contemporary market after her many wonderful historicals, and she's made the leap with a difficult, well-researched, wonderfully-written story which only an author this talented and skilled can deliver with such clarity and honesty. While it may not be for everyone, since it moves well beyond the boys-sings-song-and-gets-girl feel-good type of romance that some readers prefer, I believe this bold and remarkable book will attract many new, demanding readers to Putney's fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unease","review":"I never miss a Mary Jo Putney book - but I did not like this story. The subject of domestic violence deserved more than the treatment it received here.I am left with the very uneasy feeling that violence will occur again in this relationship. Donovan's renaissance as a man in control of his anger seemed only on the surface - and the heroine discovers her OWN violent side. In most of Ms. Putney's books, I feel satisfied that the main characters have come through great problems and dangers and are going into the future as two people who belong together. I get no such feeling from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOESN' T WORK","review":"I've always admired Mary Jo Putney's willingness to tackle difficult topics and my admiration has not waned because I couldn't believe in this book.She is still a fine writer and she should be commended for her willingness to take chances on scenarios that aren't going to be easy reads. But, that said, BURNING POINT doesn't work for me. And it doesn't work because the hero doesn't work, not because of the topic. I found that I couldn't really believe in him. He was too much of a textbook case and his reasons for his behavior, while logical, didn't seem to spring from the deep inner core of his being. He was flat. I wanted to believe in him -- and in his problems -- and I couldn't.I do believe people can change, and I do believe in the redemptive power of love. I'm not saying I don't think second chances work. And I don't believe it's irresponsible of Ms. Putney to imply that it's possible. I just didn't believe in these people. I wish I had."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hunter Ceiling Fan","review":"I always buy Hunter fans. They are in my opinion the best.

Very atmospheric stuff, and you can really hear all the intricacies within.As for the previous posters comments, I agree that Thordendal comes out with some real off the wall solos, but if that is all you look for in solos, then I think you're missing a lot. I love the feeling Azagthoth adds to his solos, and I think each guitarist is great in what they do. Thordendal's solo album is especially great. I don't really worry about which one I think is better, because better how? How exactly do you base something like that? I just know that I enjoy them both. By the way, Gorguts \\"Obscura\\" album is in my opinion much more alien in sound than Thordendals work.I don't see the point in gauging music by seeing if it's the \\"heaviest\\" or most \\"technical\\". In the end...does it move you? That's the key here I think. And for me, this album does."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Disapointment","review":"Why oh why do people love this album. The album is so overproduced; the drums sounds too triggered and/or computerized and the vocals are downright bad. The best part about the album are Trey's solos, which stand out very much. There are a few good tracks: Dominate, Where the Slime Live, Hatework, but the rest of the album seems like filler.With regard to the vocals, David Vincent did an excellent job on Morbid Angel's first three albums, but on this CD, David sounds really cheezy. I saw Morbid Angel when they toured in support of this album. It was a very disapointing concert. David seemed to have no interest in the music or the crowd and it was obvious that he was burnt out. Listen to Morbid Angel's album, Entangled In Chaos, and its painfully obvious that David's vocals were in decline and that he was holding the band back.A poor follow up to Covenant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Morbid Angel Has The Potential...","review":"...But it's their singing I can't get by.

Jazz and swing/big band is now my music genre of choice, being a performing artist weekly of many of the songs that appear on this album.The classic songs of the swing era on this album never go out of style. Couple this with the inimitable CHICAGO sound and vocals, and it doesn't get any better.

Chicago never disappoints and have always loved the music of the Big Bands."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine album","review":"This to me was a border-line between a 4 and a 5(so I rounded this up to a 5). This isn't, of course, Chicago's best album, but it is still a wondrous effort. There's are a few strange melodies along the way, as well as some pretty wild tunes. People who like the original recordings of these songs will probably freak out when they hear this, but Chicago fans should add this to their collection(as well as some daring music listeners). \\"In the Mood\\" was rather unique, \\"Moonlight Seranade\\" was beautiful, and \\"Night and Day\\" was a rather peaceful piece.

Does it sicken you to hear classic rock songs reworked as elevator muzak? It's no worse than what Chicago does to these Big Band standards. Desecration is not too strong a word. \\"In the Mood\\" is a fine example: you hear that great brass riff at the beginning and think YES! -- Then they start to \\"funk [sic] it up\\" and it's like fingernails across a blackboard. If you haven't listened to big-band music lately, try out the originals, or (in contemporary digital recordings) Claude Bolling among others to hear how it's meant to sound. It's like, well, night and day.

Caravan is just a killer track, not only with the horn arrangement but also with Joe Perry's guitar. Night and Day has grown on me over time and is really a nice track. Blues in the Night blows me away every time I listen to it. Sing Sing Sing would not have been my choice for this album's entry on Only the Beginning. Sophisticated Lady and Don't Get Around Much Anymore are Ellington tunes that get nice treatments. In the Mood has also grown on me over time (I heard it live -- even better there). Jimmy Pankow does a magnificent job in the arrangements -- taking the 3 horns and making them sound much larger (although you can usually hear when the big band comes in). Like most of the reviewers have said -- you either love or hate this CD. Listen to it for what it is, not what it isn't. I thought (and still do) that it was at that time their best effort in years.

The Pyle can barely keep from tipping over with my little SM58 in it. This isn't a heavy-duty stand either mind you, so don't buy this expecting it to hold $5,000 tube mics with the boom fully extended unless you have good insurance.

Serves its purpose well.","review":"I received this as a gift with my Blue Yeti USB microphone. The Blue Yeti is a little heavy, and this is where a better weight to the base of the stand would make it better, but it still works fine. I just have to have the stand placed in such a position that one leg sticks out parallel directly under the arm. So a better weight at the base would have been nice, but again, the Yeti is a bit heavier for a microphone.Also, I've heard a lot about the clips that hold the wires breaking a lot for people. Especially the one around the bottom. I just want to throw in that I've had no trouble with the clips and have had to take them off and put them back on several times now with no problem.

Went to tighten the boom knob and the knob and fitting disintegrated into a dozen pieces. My crummy product may have been a fluke. Seller replaced right away, but the recording session had to be rescheduled and that cost time and money that cannot be recovered."},{"rating":"2","title":"just fine for what it's designed for","review":"it's a mic stand that comes with a boom attachment... it's black so it's minimally reflective, all adjustments work as they should, not much more to say.

Just set it up for a Christmas party and the stainless rod with 2 balls that is the main adjustment had a ball fall off. I assumed it just needed to be screwed on and found that it was not threaded. I am shipping it back. Thinking about returning them both. Wish I would have invested in something more durable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Always Falls Over","review":"I always buy things on amazon and never write reviews but this thing makes me mad so much I had to get on here to warn people about itIf you are using a tiny tiny mic, it might be ok, but if you have a professional mic or a condenser mic, this thing is horrible.It works perfect if you use it completely vertical, but if you extend the arm out, and you barely barely touch it, it falls over.The legs need to be twice as long.If you are using a really small mic that weighs nothing, then get this"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stand","review":"I was doing a lot of searching before I took a chance on this stand because my mic, the Rode Podcaster, is a really heavy microphone.

I wouldn't buy it again; I should have purchased a more expensive, quality stand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stand","review":"This stand is good. My only concern is the weigh balance when the boom arm parallel to the floor. I have an AT2020 mic with a shock mount, and when the book is extended toward me while I'm sitting the weight balance wants to lean it forward.The obvious solution is to pull the arm back for better weight balance. But that pushes the mic further away from me than I'd like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Took a while but it worked in the end","review":"When I got this I thought something wasn't right. I have the at2020 microphone this came goes with but the micrphone wouldn't go on. I figured out that you had to take out the inner screw in the desk mount the microphone comes with and screw it on the stand after that it worked fine, but it was a long process to figure it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy and adjustable, needs a heavier counterweight.","review":"This stand works perfectly for me with a small modification. I have the stand at its full height with a heavy condenser mic/shockmount on the boom. The pathetic plastic counterweight is not nearly heavy enough to keep the stand from leaning. I added a couple items I found around the house to the counterweight to balance it out. With that simple modification, it works perfectly. All the fittings for adjustment work well and I had no problem setting it up at the perfect height for me and I had no problem adjusting it for another musician. I wish it had come with a heavier counterweight, but otherwise I recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Microphone Stand Review","review":"The clamps on the stand are not the easiest to secure, but then again it's not a very expensive stand.The thing that bothered me about this purchase, and the reason I took off points, is that the stand arrived with three scuff marks and a previously opened box.I do not know whether it is the manufacturer or Amazon who was at fault. But when I purchase a new item, I expect it to be new."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boom clutch doesn't lock down tight enough","review":"I second another reviewers' thoughts that these are of inconsistent quality.

I have a Shure SM58 in it and with the boom extended out real far I have felt the stand wanting to tip.

We found out Christmas morning that we needed to buy a separate part to have a stand that will hold a microphone."},{"rating":"1","title":"DUH, COMPLETE WITH ICE CREAM CONE TO HEAD","review":"Well, I'm just curious whom the genius was that put this mic stand and boom package deal together? The boom's female end diameter was too big to even bite at all on the stand male end threads.And then all of you wonder why a lot of our jobs are going overseas, because you don't even have to speak English fluently to have gotten this one right, had you even minor skill in fitting things in the right hole. Or were you deprived of those kinds of toys when you were a kid to have led to this shortcoming?I'm disabled, so I hate having to deal with refunds and the whole nine yards of post office ridiculousness to reconcile such returns, and consequently am eating the cost on this one. Does Amazon screen these transactions at all, or are they equally negligent in these sorry excuses for comedic oversight?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor manufacturing quality","review":"This stand is barely passable. The main problem I have is that the part that holds the boom did not thread cleanly onto the stand. After fiddling with it a while, I managed to force the parts together, but to get a reasonably secure fit, I had to use a couple of pairs of pliers. The result is that it can't be disassembled and the paint is scratched off the upright part of the stand.On the positive side, it wasn't very expensive, but in the future I'll steer clear of the On Stage brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fool me twice","review":"So, this mic stand was recommended to me by an audio salesman to go with all of the other things I was purchasing. When it arrived it looked pretty solid, some of the joints maybe felt a little loose but that's to be expected. So it's working just fine for about three days and then the little nub on the end of the boom with the threads on it came loose and began to spin around, so my mic would flop around and only ever point down. I called the company about it and they were really nice and sent me a new one and even let me keep the old one. So I get the new one. about two weeks and the threads on the thing that keeps the boom in place strip, somehow they just become completely smooth. So I go back to using my old broken one and after a few days the same things happens.Just figured I should share my experience. I seemed to find all positive reviews about these stands but they SUCKED for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tippy","review":"I wasted my money on this.

Unfortunately, the money spent was a complete waste for that purpose. I could find no mention, not a single comment, about this all important topie. \\"Normal\\" removal in my definition is removing reasonable sums of deferred money from accounts, between the ages of 59 1/2 and 70 1/2. While I have since discovered what I needed to know, I find it most odd that there is no mention of this topic.That said, IF you wish information on the topic of either removing deferred money BEFORE 59 1/2 or AFTER 70 1/2, I would rate the book a 3 star on those issues. However even there, I would dig for details on some topics and find only general information.As they say \\"the devil is in the details\\" and that certainly is true when it comes of tax-deferred investments and the IRS.

In other words, the book describes what to do before and after retirement so that you maximize your funds and minimize taxes. The authors make their work understandable, while raising the discussion at least one step above what you might find in a \\"Retirement for Dummies\\" volume.I have friends on all points of the retirement continuum.

The 1911 one was crap, laser was not a dot, but a huge 1.5\\" splotch at just 15 ft. and the slide release was made so poorly it took all my might with two thumbs to release the slide. I didn't even try to shoot with it, just sent it back. The one for the G19 was about 3\\" off at 20'(not horrible) but jams the bullets about 1 per clip. It NEVER jammed before installing. You can feel the drag on the guide rod as you pull back the slide and slide does not seat fully when released(guide rod laser too thick?). I will keep using it, hopefully it will eventually break in, but doubtful. The one for the G22 was fairly accurate and did perform as expected. These are cheaply made and quite expensive for what they are. NOT WORTH THE MONEY! I would look at other brands of lasers.

In any event after you use about 70% the salty taste will overpower the cheddar mix and become distasteful. Its obvious that the cheddar taste is MIXED with salt and its not a container of 100% cheddar flavor.

As a source for insider tips and real-world advice for high-tech entrepreneurs, the book is unequaled. The book is crisply and succintly written. Everyone interested in high-tech entrepreneurship should have a copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Startup book I've read so far","review":"This book is a nice collection of practical, how-to advice with little hype. It does a good job of giving you a good road map. Emphasising \\"unfair advantage\\" coming out in the business plan - amazing how many I've read that don't ever mention why they have an unfair advantage! Only downside is the price - a good one to check out at the library!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Insight Into VC Behaviour","review":"Its the inner workings of the VC I am after but this one is in a condensed enough form to hit the jugular. I wish I had bought the book much earlier. Just wish that this book will be updated soon with more internet company cases."},{"rating":"2","title":"On the mark for the US Venture Capital/high tech world","review":"Key assumption - the reader is seriously looking at starting a high tech company and is using a US equity model. With this in mind, the book is required reading [at least based on my experiences in Silicon Valley.] The content is directed to the founder/CEO. It covers the issues related to starting a company as viewed from an investor's perspective. It is not a guide book for running a company. Very focused on raising capital and how to shape a company so that the funding aspects of the company make sense in the US VC community. The numbers are a bit dated. The examples are from companies that went public a few years ago. From my recent experiences raising capital, the message and the averages still largely hold true so nothing has been sacrificed."},{"rating":"2","title":"O verwhelming Info","review":"The book is so informative, it so hard to stop reading when the book is fun and full of ah ha and hmm. The author give a precise info on how the start-up company can obtain VC funding. Most of the reviewer are right about their comment on this book, it should be the bible of start-up company."},{"rating":"2","title":"Te main content not updated much since the last edition","review":"It is a very good book for anyone interested about high tech startup. However, I found that the main content, especially the case studies, have not been updated much since the last edition. The only change seems to be the tables outlining the growth of valuation of Yahoo and Netscape. There must be something more to add to the book about them and other successful internet startups."},{"rating":"1","title":"B.A.D.","review":"I was very excited to read this book as it received such good reviews from others, but I have been nothing but disappointed. The guidance is trite, the wording uncomfortable, the list of his personal accomplishments in the \\"white hot spotlight\\" of Silicon Valley a bit nauseating.

The rest is a waste of time. Go to the chapter with Janeane, and you'll be alright..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dramatic and funny!","review":"It is rare for a film to tell a story which is dramatic and funny at the same time. \\"Bye Bye Love\\"'s director achieves this fine balance and delivers great performances from all cast members, especially Reiser, Quaid and Modine. The story evolves around 3 male friends who are divorced parents and who each cope with their situations differently while managing to keep their respective children the center of their individual lives. The story is highly entertaining and touching. A great family movie to watch!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie. Fast shipping","review":"Thanks for getting the movie here fast. Lots of great stars. Good movie just like I remembered."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic Comedy about our Schizophrenic Relationships","review":"Three divorced dads are forced to analyze their multiple new relationships via numerous classic comedic set-ups. Rob Reiner is smooth as the hypocritical radio psychologist (who has been divorced 5 times). The every other weekend children exchange triggers many standard divorce situations. Paul Reiser still longs for his remarried ex-wife he can never regain. He abhors being referred to as the \\"birth father\\" by his troubled daughter's new stepfather. Randy Quaid and his classic blind date from Hades - Garofalo - generate the best restaurant scene in movies (surpassing When Harry Meets Sally). She has low expectations for a date - she's looking for a mammal! Nobody knows so much about how not to order from a menu as Garofalo. Savor the classic irony and classic comedy of schizoid feelings and relationships. Worthy of multiple viewings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, Touching, Love Randy Quaid and Jeanine G.","review":"So glad this movie is out on DVD - it's got all the little warm fuzzies, funnies and poignancy that I love about a movie.

And artificially sweetened at that.I still can't figure out why I bought this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've got good News, everyone...","review":"This followed 1993's simply incredible \\"The Vanishing Race\\", and it certainly does not disappoint. It starts off with \\"Someone\\", a song with a really wonderful rhythm. \\"Just Between The Lines\\" is next; a heartfelt, quiet, haunting piece that the guys used to sing way back when they were still doing Jesus Christ Superstar. Their rendition of \\"Unchained Melody\\" is a really amazing song, and, in my opinion, even better than the Righteous Brother's original version. \\"Feel For Your Love\\" is one of my favorite tracks on the CD; it's very upbeat, and uplifting. The title track is simply incredible. Their harmonies are flawless. \\"Always\\" is surprisingly powerful, and another of my favorites on the CD. The album slows down a little with the next four songs, but it's all good. Very highly reccommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Here's one for the Ages","review":"This is the first volume of what was originally a two record set released after Evan's untimely death in 1980. Both volumes document Bill's last working trio, which he compared favorably to his \\"classic\\" trio with Scott LaFaro and Bill Motion. Both volumes are essential. The performances are crisp, well recorded and remastered, and briskling with a quality that is intoxicating to the ear. As a single representation of the final trio at work, this might be the best, IMHO. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of His Best","review":"I have many Bill Evans CD's. I truly believe this is one of his top five releases. His playing is at its peak and the interplay between him, bassist Marc Johnson and drummer Joe LaBarbera is trancendental. A \\"must have\\" in my humble opinion! This applies to The Paris Concert Edition Two as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The idea is a good one, but the execution is not quite right. The problem is that the blunders are nicely highlighted, drawing attention right to them. The corrections should be right next to the blunders, enabling the reader to immediately see the difference. Instead, the corrections are included in plain text, after, or interspersed with, the explanation. The result is that the incorrect version is actually more memorable than the correct version. Too bad, because otherwise this is a good list of common mistakes and their corrections."},{"rating":"1","title":"good but needs improvement","review":"A good light review of the different areas of the italian language for first or second year italian students with an emphasis on common mistakes. Unfortunately, I agree with another reviewer that the format of the book with green boxes identifying the blunder but with no correct version next to it was a constant distraction. In fact, it became so annoying I had to ignore/skip the green boxes. Be careful, this book doesn't aim to teach you every area, e.g. subjunctive, and rightly so. If you don't already grasp the concept, you will probably be left begging for more and some examples may not instantly make sense. It is helpful that the book is heavily divided into small sections."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissatisfied","review":"I bought a deluxe players strat, and wanted to change the look of it a bit so I bought this pickguard. It fits fine, but it definitely doesn't look new. When I recieved this pickguard, it was scuffed and scratched straight out of the package.

It wasn't in a place where I could screw it into the studs, but it comes with wall anchors. Because it's only got the two screw points I'm kind of concerned if it gets full of heavy winter coats, but for now with our hoodies and fleece and my purse it's holding like a champ.Possible packaging issue - the baggie holding the screws was sliced open in transit somehow and the screws were loose in the box. I'm lucky I found them all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coats slide off hooks easily!","review":"This looks really nice on the wall, and is well made...but it's not functional! Hooks are perpendicular to base (instead of having them at a slight, upturned angle) and there's no little knob or anything at the end of them...so coats, etc don't stay on the hook! Installed 2 of these in my mudroom, but a complete waste. Design flaw means coats spend most of their time on the floor!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough spacing","review":"I am really disappointed with this product.

The instrumental stuff really is just muzak, and pretty pointless.

No resemblance whatsoever to a great album. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's just not Dan like I know him....","review":"I started listening to this CD and had to make sure that I had the right one in the player. Really.

This seem to pick up where \\"Twin Sons\\" left off. The music is put together nicely and makes good for easy listening. One drawback would be how similar all the songs are to each other, but each one is well played. Anyone who enjoys Dan Fogelburg or Tim Weisberg would like this one. Both Dan and Tim proved that they can still work their magic."},{"rating":"2","title":"twin sons of different mothers part 2","review":"this seems to be the second part of their first collaboration-\\"twin sons of different mothers part 2\\" great vocals by dan and i really love the way tim plays the flute. way to go dan and tim! will there be a part three?"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!","review":"If you liked Twin Sons of Different Mothers I would highly recommend you get this one today. I wasn't sure about it but now that I have it I really regret not having in my collection a lot sooner. It is an outstanding follow up to Twin Sons and I think Dan's voice really shines especially on The Face of Love.

It doesn't assume that you know anything (except being familiar with Visual Basic) and starts from the basics. By the time you're done with this book, you'll be able to program high-quality games, including even making level editors. In fact, the RPG and strategy games that are included are worth the price of the entire book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Overall Game Examples For Any Language","review":"This book goes through the details of many types of games, from card games to rpgs. These examples are good no matter what language you wish to program in. So if you are looking for game ideas, then this might be a good place to look. It comes with code for each game/example, and visual basic is easy to follow along with. They go into detail and explain all the code that they show you, which gives you good insight into some of the framework and details you need to think about before programming any game. I did not give this 5 stars because, if you are a knowledgable vb (or any language) programmer, then you could probably put these games together on your own without this book. Visual Basic is not a great language for programming games, but the simplicity of the language makes it simple to learn the basics of design and framework"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy If You Want To Make Solitaire","review":"I hoped that this book would have tips on creating mainstream type games in Visual Basic. Instead, this is a whole book dedicated to programming card games. It's nice to know how to program your own solitaire, but the authors almost totally disregarded the fact that DirectX 7 and 8 are both fully supported in Visual Basic. Of course, there is a very short appendix for DirectX, but even that can't satify the desires of VB game programmers who want to make games like Metroid, or Quake. There are many books that deal with C++ game programming in DirectX, but there are NO Visual Basic books that deal with it. So people who want to learn how to create games in DirectX will be wasting their money on this. If you want to learn how to program games in Visual Basic in DirectX, use Internet tutorials, as that's all there still is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great for good games","review":"This book shows you the basics for producing very cheesy freeware games. The only real thing I got out of it, is that I should have purchased a more in depth book. If you are just starting out in VB then perhaps this is for you, like I said it covers a few of the basics."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for any one wanting to program games","review":"If you are new to programming games and you want to start in the right derection go with this book. even though when you start it is kind of slow it gets going and on chapter 13 you are ready to create you first full game. there are some things that i would get ride of but for any one new this is highly recommended. Even if you are advanced its still fun to read and has great ideas to start you off on your new game. also a great reference for VB Game Programmers considering theres only like 4 good Vb Game Programming books out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"A look at the world of game programming...","review":"I'm a middle-school computer teacher with a computer club that meets weekly after school. The \\"Circuit Scramblers\\" - mostly 9th graders, fight over use of my copy of Clayton's game programming book at the meetings. While my VB6 background probably isn't as developed as some of the other reviewers, I can comment on the interest these students have for this book, and on the degree of care shown in developing each topic. While some of the reviewers have suggested that the book doesn't cover some important VB features, I would suggest that perhaps Clayton might cover that in a vol. II....which I look forward to buying..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was looking for","review":"I was really looking for a book that teaches how to use DirectX with Visual Basic.

But, it's definitly not for experienced programmers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Billy Bob does it again.","review":"This is a slightly complex movie full of great performances. Depending on your point of view no one is entirely sympathetic. And while the story line is plausible, in real life guys like Billy Bob don't get within 100 feet of women like Patricia Arquette and Sela Ward. Come to think of it, real people don't look like Patricia Arquette and Sela Ward, do they?But that's what makes this a quirky and not entirely predictable story. Pretty entertaining. Knock off one star for William Devane's ludicrous fake southern accent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad","review":"I thought this movie was pretty good. It is very likeable to the south and things that could happen in this culture.Billy Bob did a good job as did the other actors. The movie does have several plots to it which makes it anentertaining movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real sleeper","review":"Billy Bob does a great job as a Louisiana sheriff saddled with solving a murder that gets him into trouble with the local power brokers who may have been involved. We see scenes of New Orleans while he tries to track down clues that seem to lead him into a world of transvestites and political intrigue. You could do way worse than to spend 90 minutes watching this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite a few original classics","review":"Bobby Caldwell sings with that slight raspiness of a Mel Torme or Bobby Short, but with his own smooth sytle. There are moments of similarity with Sinatra and Harry Connick Jr. I was surprised to hear how accomplished he is on guitar also. Several of the songs on this album are modern classics, heard often on the radio even in 1999. This is almost a \\"Greatest Hits\\" album without the title.

It makes the diary seem fake...but the important thing it, the story-line is still the same...this truly is someone's diary, except reworded.

It's not realistic at all. She is constantly saying she is a negative thinker and going off to the park and crying with her friends or mother and just making all of these connections that a real teenager never would. There are too many CAPITALS and exclamation marks!!! With everything she said its almost mocking, that teenagers are total idiots. Its distracting from the story, that in reality isn't that good. It's hard to explain, but I was not surprised a psychiatrist wrote this. This person obviously was just trying to tell teenagers not to have relationships with teachers, and not writing a good book. It's a disappointment. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. This person needs to stop writing books, they are horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh....","review":"This book was ok... After reading a few pages I had to assume that this was not a realy diary. It is tto preachy (like how she is always scolding herself for being sad or mad at someone, just not something a real teenage girl would do). Also after a while I started to hope either something interesting and realistic would happen or the book would just be over. The ending is too perfect and abrupt for an \\"actual\\" girl's account of her affair with her teacher. I have read quite a few diary books and this one is not one of the better and more believable ones. It made me kind of depressed for this girl who is being used and I am not sure whether or not it was a waste of time to read it. Either way, teenage girls might want to read it so they can see the signs of a teacher who wants more that just good grades from you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Treacherous Love","review":"This book it is in diary form and the main character is Jennie.

He traps girls to trust him and then fall in love with him. When Jennie finds out who he really is she does nothing but stay in bed.I thought this book was very good to relate with a true-life teenager. It shows some of the problems they have and how one problem can wreck their lives forever. This book was very emotional and easy to relate to.

I was skeptical at first, but as I began to listen to it I was amazed at how talented this band really is. This album has excellent guitar riffs mixed with a distinct brand of vocals. I especially enjoyed the vocal effects used in A Synthesis of Classic Forms. I also liked the songs Coagulate, Exile Etiquette, and Hindsight. The only negative comment that I have is that all of the songs start to sound the same after a while. I had to take off a star due to lack of vocal variations. All in all, this album is worth buying. I hope that this review helps."},{"rating":"2","title":"RIP Snapcase, 1991-2005!","review":"I have owned End Transmission since it came out in 2002, and it is one of my favorite cd's by Snapcase. It is a cd I never get tired of. Granted all of their music was great. End transmission was a slightly different musical change for them, many of the songs are a bit more melodic at first, but just as powerful in sound and meaning as their earlier releases. It is a shame that this great band had to break up, they were a truly great band and will be missed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"There is no comparison.","review":"Snapcase are undoubtedly set in stone as to where their musical feet are. Ever since the early 90's they've been innovative and a step ahead of the program. I'm sure I don't need to tell you any of this considering you're taking the time to read this. This band is one of the greatest bands ever in my world and is just as good as ANY huge rock act: I overuse Tool. This whole cd is an all around perfect album. If I don't have to skip a track it's good. Like so many of the other Snapcase albums this is through and through groundbreaking. Unlike other Snapcase albums it is VERY much more experimental and has elements of even early 80's new-wave in it. People say after Rage died so did political rock: what about Snapcase and Boysetsfire? From start to finish this cd burns into your skull. This cd definately will put them AT LEAST on a map to where most people will know who they are.

The complex plot held together all the way through and kept my mind engaged. I liked the combination of familiar locations in California interlaced with the exotic Amazon.

The science appears to be well researched and some of the jungle attack sequences are downright creepy. A few of the key characters drifted into predictable stereotypes, and I prefer a more clearly defined protagonist, but I've read worse on national bestseller lists. Overall I'd rate it a strong freshman effort and Copeland's next book will smooth out the rough edges and his talent will shine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!","review":"Having recently finished this book, I wonder if the other reviewers were reading the same book as I. Paralysis has an interesting premise- stealthy biotech industry development of a deadly virus while various \\"good guys\\" begin following clues to unmasking the scheme- but the plots never gel. Budding love stories are clumsily injected, with mind-numbing repetition of the protagonists' various phobias and quirks. The purpose of the plot is never fully developed, and the would-be heroes neither decypher it nor foil it, but in the end are rescued by external agents whose provenance is never really explained.The author does set a scene well, and individual scenarios are well described. It is the overarching lack of a narrative which hangs together and ties up the loose ends which disappoints. On the whole, an unsatisfying read, and with so many good page-turners out there to choose from, I strongly recommend you avoid wasting your time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adolescent romance","review":"I found the business and biological mystery interesting.

He came to terms with his sexuality early in his life and he didn't let small minds stop him from becoming successful -- including his own. Did you know he auditioned for Cirque de Soleil? His talent was throwing enormous styrofoam triangles into the air and then catching them behind his back. He didn't make the cut, but he vowed that he would drink a gallon of Dr Pepper everyday from that day forward.

This book has no redeeming value, except as a substitute for Syrup of Ipicac. While Rosenhaus gloats about the athletes he has somehow convinced to hire him, he makes no mention of the careers he has ruined, such as that of Errict Rhett, a top NFL running back who Rosenhaus advised sit out an NFL season rather than honor the binding contract Rhett had with an NFL team. As a result, Rhett lost a year of pay, was demoted to second team the following year when he returned, was traded to another team, where he is presently collecting splinters in his rear.

Brüggen and the Orchestra of the 18th Century performed these live in concert. But don't be worried about audience noise, for it's obvious the listeners were \\"in the moment\\" and were respectfully attentive throughout. Also, the sound quality is very good. Brüggen's band uses period instruments, which make their unique voices heard both generally and in many special moments. These are all outstanding accounts. Orchestral playing under Brüggen is always thrilling and highly eventful, and consistently more exciting and spontaneous.I'm a big fan of Colin Davis' recordings of these very works, but after doing the \\"side by side\\" comparison, I feel Brüggen's have more life to them.

Yes, Bruggen is amiable, casual and free, but totally unrefined. It is as if he assembled his gifted players, started them off, and left the room. There is no exploration from phrase to repeat, no delicacy of shading, no interpretation. This music is great but it cannot speak for itself. I also find Davis cheerful but interpretively weak.

I had hoped for a lot more exciting personal battle accounts gleaned from the battalion's veterans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Symphonic Black Metal","review":"I bought this album when it first came out and still listen to it. The first time I heard them I was on their web site and got a sample of Genuine Pulse. It impressed me enough to buy the CD. The best way I can describe it is symphonic black metal. Somewhere someone may have broken it down to something a little different, but that is MY description.The music is heavy on keyboards with strong guitar background. The lyrics seem mystical, dark, and beautiful. I guess they are lyric poetry set to very heavy music. I don't really know the deep meanings of any of the songs but I like them all. The album rocks right through to the last cut, which is kind of mellow.These guys may be black metal but they go beyond that. They're a great introduction to black metal without all the pseudo \\"Satanic\\" overtones. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"By the look of the cover you might think this is Viking Metal but it isn't.This cd is more about the universe.The production is ok. The vocals and guitar is 2 low.The songs are good.Vintersorg does a great job.This was for me a expensive but a very good album."},{"rating":"1","title":"OVERRATED","review":"This CD I thought would be pretty decent, but is not a worthy CD in Black Metal. This band isn't bad at all but I personally didn't care for the sound this release had. The only song that caught my attention is the first track(The Genunine Pulse)which is a decent song but sounds a bit to radio friendly for my tastes. I GIVE IT ONE STAR FOR THE FIRST SONG AND FOR THE FACT AMAZON WON'T ALLOW A ZERO STAR RATING."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dark Side...","review":"It is abouttime that the OTHER side of the Force is reveled. I like the book as a Star Wars fan and as a role-playing sourebook. I like all the stats, the background on the Sith and information I didn't know. I can't wait untill the other sourcebooks come out. Until then, pick up a copy and KNOW THE POWER OF THE DARK SIDE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inadequate Dark Force Powers","review":"I had high hopes for this book. They were dashed by the low number of Dark Force Skills and Feats the authors decided were acceptable. One would think that the fearsome Sith, having existed as a separate culture for tens of thousands of years, would have many more applications of the Dark Side of the Force. The Force powers included in The Dark Side Sourcebook are insufficient to warrent the fearful reputation of the Sith. Also, the powers do not reflect the EVIL of the Dark Side. For Instance, \\"Sith Illusions\\" are simply visual, there is no tactile effect(i.e. PAIN or other discomfort). Bottomline - The Sith have been powered down to satisfy some demographic. I give this book one Gigantic YAAWWWNN!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad delivery","review":"Hey men !what's up too long delay. wait from february and now in May still waiting until july !!Hope that you give me a discount for items due to the lack of buisness."},{"rating":"2","title":"best invention EVER!","review":"Love this for campfires (or wood burning fireplace)! SO much better than huffing and puffing inches from the flames, or fanning with a paper plate.Everyone who comes over for a camp fire is crazy about it and wants one for their own back yard. Also makes a great log rearrange-er! LOVE IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This really works!","review":"After struggling for years to get a consistently great fire in both the fireplace and the charcoal grill, I bought the FireDragon. And it works better than I ever expected! If the wood is wet or if its humid, just a few puffs of air and the embers are glowing, without flying about the room and scaring me half to death. It's so easy I can't believe it took me this long to try it! It is the perfect length and keeps you from getting too close to the flames. I recommend it highly to anyone who wants to get a fire going quickly and safely."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Sorry\\" to all reviewers who purchased the DVD; but \\"Thanks\\" for the heads up","review":"I am truly sorry to those who purchased the DVD. I read ALL the reviews and some critical scenes seems to be left out. I would have been totally pissed because I know this movie like that back of my hand. Obviously for those who never saw the movie/VHS, they got to enjoy the movie as is, but for those who had the opportunity to see this GREAT movie uncut, I feel the anger and frustration via your words.I will not get this DVD, because I believe you all when you say they screwed up this DVD.Maybe we should tell Oprah about this? Flood her with emails about how they chopped up HER film. With Oprah...you never know!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Women of Brewster Place","review":"I saw this movie on TV years ago and fell in love with it. Superb acting and story line made this a truly enjoyable and touching story. I saw it again recently on the Lifetime Channel and decided to purchase the DVD. To my great disappointment, there were quite a few scenes that were deleted!!!! I have no idea what they were thinking when they decided to botch this movie. I do hope that in the future they will correct this horrendous butchery and re-release this movie in it's ENTIRETY on DVD again. I'm truly surprised that Oprah had nothing to say about this, let alone allowed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"5 stars for movie minus 10 for editing","review":"I loved this movie ever since I first saw it. So, when I finally found the DVD, I was excited to see it again. But as I watched it, I was so dissappointed at the scenes either cut short or removed. Scenes deleted include Mattie finding Ms Eva dead, Basil complaining about the prision conditions, the kids going to see the play, Theresa helping the little girl who fell, and the \\"meatloaf incident\\". Other scenes are cut short. This DVD definitely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"bamboozled","review":"I have both dvds, cut and uncut. Anyone noticed that they are both almost the same amount of minutes? 180 and 182. Now how does that add up to 30 minutes of extra footage? You can't get the whole thing unless you cut and paste from both editions lol. About to write my letter to oprah, i know she gotta have some type of say so in this, she can do better. Uncut my foot, crappiest xmas present ever given to me. Wish i didn't have to give it a star at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"A total RIP-OFF!!","review":"I was a kid when this movie came out on t.v. I can't count the # of times I've watched it and I can remember it like the back of my hand... I'm heartbroken at the way this movie was put together! Where are all of the important scenes in this movie!!? The DVD isn't even worth buying because of all the deleted scenes!! This movie is a classic and now has been completely butchered!! The editing in the film is crappy to say the least...black screens show up where the original scene should have been...this DVD version is not good at all!! Whoever was in charge of editing and releasing this film did this film a major injustice...I waited so long for this film to FINALLY be released on DVD and sadly, I am really disappointed...for those who are familiar w/ the film, don't waist your hard earned $$ on this movie..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read Reviews Before Purchasing!","review":"I am highly disappointed with Amazon; they usually sell such quality products, but this was a disaster. I grew up watching the original 2 VHS set; the movie was that long. So once I saw it was put on DVD, I was ecstatic and didn't even bother reading the reviews. If I had taken the extra 2 seconds to, I wouldn't have spent my money on it. There were critical scenes deleted, when I swore that movies put into DVD format were supposed to offer MORE, not TAKE AWAY. If you have never seen the movie, then I guess it's no problem, but if you are like me who used to curl on the couch with my mother and laugh cry get angry along with the characters, then DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS CRAPPY DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am very disappointed with the deleted scenes!!","review":"I remember my mother having the 2 tape VHS movie in her collection. I've watched this movie so many times that I know the scenes verbatim. I was excited to see that it was finally on DVD, but once I got it home and watched it, I was disappointed at how many scenes had been deleted. When Mattie finds Miss Eva had passed on...Basil in jail...the play at the community center, and my favorite \\"the meatloaf scene\\". I would have much rather bought the VHS set. Please read the reviews of other buyers who feel the same way I do before you make your choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cut so many parts of this version!","review":"I have this version and I was so disappointed when I got it!

That's what I did!Women of Brewster Place: Original Uncut Version"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware!","review":"This is one of my favorite movies, but this version has cut out so many scenes that it jumps like a bad bootleg it's not worth the price you pay.

Thank God I have the movie on VHS which was purchased by my grandmother who brought the movie when it first came out. I fell in love with this movie when I first watched it and I wanted to add it to my collection of DVD's. When I read the reviews about it been cut up and major scenes being deleted I was so disappointed. So I guess I have to hang on to my VCR a little longer than I wanted. Thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Every Woman should see this amazing film.","review":"Oprah really can act. I was surprised! Her ability is comparable to her performance in The Color Purple. But everybody is great in this film. It shows a diverse group of people, who share two factors in common, they're black and women. But that's really it. This film was one of the few that really shows black women as individuals and not as a mass. It shows the myriad of trials that effect the lives of women and African-Americans. I found my thoughts expressed in many of the charaters voices. Vanessa William, Lynn Whitfield, Jackee Harry, and so many others really gave every ounce of passion they could into their roles. Powerful and gripping! I'd give it ten stars if amazon.com would let me :-). END"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION!!!","review":"PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE READ BEFORE YOU BUY!! GO BACK AND SEARCH FOR THE UNCUT VERSION AS THIS VERSION CUTS OUT SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT SCENES!! I AM SO MAD BECAUSE I ORDERED THIS IN OCTOBER & AM JUST NOW OPENING AND WATCHING TO FIND THAT THIS IS NOT THE RIGHT VERSION... UGH SO UPSET.. SO I AM GOING TO ORDER THE UNCUT VERSION NOW AND JUST PASS THIS ONE ALONG TO MY MOTHER!!! LOVE THE MOVIE, BUT THIS IS NOT THE VERSION YOU ARE LOOKING FOR AND DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY IT IS BEING OFFERED!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"kristen's super cool review","review":"This movie doesn't live up to the book. The characters emotions are downplayed and the details are barely there. The movie left out a lot of information the book provides. The movie left out some very important scenes, such as the one that shows how spoiled Basil is by his mom. I think the movie depicted the characters the same way as the book, but did a poor job presenting the movies different scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad screenplay, bad directing, bad acting","review":"Women of Brewster Place by Gloria Naylor is a powerful, wonderfully written book. I admire Oprah Winfrey for what she's done in the media - and getting people to read. But this is just a stilted mess, with one scene jerking into the next, no character development ... really a disappointment. The acting is flat; no affect - As if saying the lines and raising eyebrows is enough.Not enought fleshing out of the characters to be able to relate to them."},{"rating":"1","title":"brewsters place","review":"The movie the women of brewsters place was a bad movie because there needed to be better acting and casting. It seemed to jump from one scene to the next without having any conection. I thught that it might not have made as much sence if you hadn't read the book which is bad because it should be its own story and not read another one to be able to understand it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Brewster joke","review":"The Women of Brewster Place is a good book but then when you go to see the movie they made on the book you see the movie is a joke. In the book Mattie the main character has a rough time dealing with the baby until she met this one special person named MIss Eva who takes them under her wing. In the book Miss Eva is viewed as a loving caring friend that wants to help Mattie and the baby but in the jokeful movie Miss Eva doesn't give any real likingness to Mattie which destroys everything the book had said. Each character in the movie did a poor job in bringing the book's characters to life. the Depth of the book did not come out in the movie which to me made it a complete and total joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"No offense to Oprah.","review":"Oprah, performance excellant, The movie from this store was Thumbs downcause of quality and the blurry and fuzziness of the movie.The store whom sent this needs to review their movies for quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"SHAME ON YOU, AMAZON!","review":"Certainly, this film is excellent. However, the version sold here is incomplete. Several key scenes are missing including Cora and her children at _Midsummer Night's Dream_ and the infamous meatloaf scene. One of the only drawbacks of our new virtual world is that you must buy something and open it before you find out it's not what you wanted. There are two versions sold here; I bought the more expensive one, thinking it would be more comprehensive. Buy the cheaper one! You can't miss more than I've missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Now you done made me mad","review":"I remember watching this made for TV movie a few years ago. However I was disappointed with the DVD. You can actually see where it was sliced and diced.Some parts in particular: Oprah finds Ms. Eva to be \\"asleep\\" after Ms. Eva did not pick up the kids after school. Oprah returns to the house with the kids. She calls out Ms. Eva name several times. Once Oprah touches her, she realizes that Ms. Eva has passed.Then there were obvious cuts where there was nothing but a blank screen. Another cut scene: Basil was in jail and Oprah came to visit. \\"Basil don't you want to sit and talk for a spell? No mama, unless you came to bail me out I have nothing to say\\", or something to that effect.This was a hard to find DVD and I was thoroughly disappointed by it. It would have been nice to view the movie in its entirety but I didn't get that."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you can't do right leave it alone!","review":"What a botched up job!!!!!! I really think the producers of this DVD were on drugs when they edited out hours of this black female saga.

I can't say enough about the hack job that has been done to this classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"I got Shafted!!!!","review":"When this movie came on T.V. many years ago, I recorded it, edited out the commercials and everything. So when it finally was released on D.V.D. I jumped at the chance to have a better quality version.I even gave my V.H.S. copy to my mother. Man, was I ever disappointed, the movie is missing critical scenes. Too many to even describe in this review!! I thought because [...] that that was the problem, but after reading so many other reviews that basically are saying the same thing, I can see I wasn't the only one who got shafted.And to make things worse, my mother won't give me the V.H.S. version back!!!"}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},B={class:"card-container"},M=["disabled"],x={key:0},N={key:1};function H(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=y("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",B,[(a(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",N,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",x,"See more"))],8,M)):b("",!0)])}const W=d(O,[["render",H],["__scopeId","data-v-5ea8af52"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotesmag/48.md","filePath":"quotesmag/48.md"}'),R={name:"quotesmag/48.md"},G=Object.assign(R,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(W)]))}});export{j as __pageData,G as default};
