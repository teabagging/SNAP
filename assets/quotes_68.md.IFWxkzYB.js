Throughout the story, Jews are the villian. They are racist. They are evil. They rape women and defile mosques. When one character blows himself up killing 5 soldiers, there is no end of praise.These items would already make for some troubling reading.

Do not expect to use this book as any type of historical reference. There are just too many details missing. The author's writing is also very biased.

For example his discussion of the inquisition argued that it 'wasn't that bad' and a \\"considerable advance in the treatment of criminals\\". By the end of the book I was so distrustful that his words conveyed a realistic portrayal of history I made notes and researched events myself.Lastly he jumps around chronologically a bit, making the reader have to look back and forth between pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy - you get what you pay for","review":"This is a flimsy little cutter.

You don't really see exactly where the cut is going to be once you lower the arm, and since the cutter is so flimsy the pictures tend to move or slide out of the way once you lower the arm. It takes 2 people to be able to use it semi-smoothly. I will probably move to a different type of cutter.

Mr Clifford has excavated the world's first pirate ship and belittled the act by penning a self-promoting, opportunistic, poorly-written account of his involvement with the Wydah expedition. Though it is peppered with interesting history and unique insight about the salvage trade, the story degrades into a petty attack on crew members and endless complaints about the \\"interfering\\" academics and authorities. I started reading with a keen interest and open mind, but the story leaves you skeptical about Mr Clifford's honesty and integrity (why are there several pictures of the late JFK Jr. if he only spent one summer of the 10+ years of excavation?)

I have read her other novels and was so bored that I thought someone else must have written them, but to read a Richard Jury novel that has run amuck is unacceptable.Is Grimes on medication, or is she just sick of writing about Richard Jury? This novel reads like the mental wanderings of someone going crazy. Her attempt at cleverness by writing from the POV of Mungo the dog was an abysmal failure. Why allow the reader to know the thoughts of Jury and a dog, but nobody else? What's the point? And that's the conclusion I reached about this novel--what was the point?

I believe Ms Grimes now simply uses a template and fills the blanks therein when she authors each new volume. We all know to expect some new waif in distress with an animal sidekick of uncommon intelligence. Her characters are caricatures of what a North American perceives the English to be.

I don't think anyone who starts the series with this book would ever get to any of the others. It was just goofy.

It had no ending which truly appalled me. It was wicked short. There are only about 339 pages, something like that. Lots of blank space on these 339 pages. Lots of short chapters. The \\"plot\\" was just ridiculous.I know if I read this review or any of the other incredulous reviews, I'd still buy the book anyway since I've been buying these books for so many years, but I'm warning you now, and I'm very sorry to say this, you'll wish you'd skipped this one.

Not only that, but she doesn't bother to fill in any backstory or character history for those who are new to her books, or even those who have read the previous ones but may need a little refresher. I never did quite figure out Carole-anne's relationship to Jury.Despite all this, I continued to slog through because I wanted to see how it would end.

My interest perked at that point, but the follow-up was so unsatisfactory. Why was this woman murdered? Where had she been for the previous 9 months? why didn't they find the chewed rope in the cellar? Why is fridge spelled frig? How come sand dollars are washed up on Brighton beach? Why does everyone say San Gimignano is near Florence when it's closer to Siena?

Did the car ever come to the attention of the police in any way after the woman, boy, and dog disappeared?And Martha Grimes never tells us about the condition of the dog upon its return. Did it look well-fed, rested, and have a glossy coat, like someone had been taking care of it? Or did it look hungry, tired, and have mangled fur, like it had been outside and had walked a lot.

Like Elizabeth George, Martha Grimes just doesn't have the class system right. Her Inspector Jury is just too precious. The jokiness doesn't work either--it's slap-happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Addition to Jury Series","review":"I have read all the previous novels in the Richard Jury series and was very disappointed in this one. The cast of characters has become trite and formulaic, seemingly only trotted out as breaks in the storyline. It was almost as if the author simply cobbled together filler material from previous novels.In addition I found the story tedious and wildly improbable. I love cats and dogs, but not as literary protagonists in a supposedly serious mystery. The non-ending seemed an obvious segue into a sequel. I hope it will be better written than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best work","review":"I've been a fan since 1983. That's when I discovered Martha's Richard Jury series. The Old Wine Shades was such a disappointment.It was not well thought out. Mrs. Wasserman didn't figure at all.The platonic tension between Carole Anne and Jury wasn't there.What's with this two page chapters bit?"},{"rating":"1","title":"What?","review":"I love this series - but not this book. I'll never stop reading Martha Grimes but this was so boring, my eyes refused to stay open."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Again!","review":"I will neve again get sucked into buying one of her books. I should have stopped reading them 4 or 5 ago but kept hoping that she'd change. This is formula writing at it's worse. I agree with the reviewer who asked if she really wrote this one. It's the same old people doing the same old thing in the same old places. The only thing that changes is the plot and in this book it's ludicrous.Martha, if you're reading this just know I'll never buy another one of your books. It's a shame too because in the beginning they were delightful. Oh and get back to your editor - too many errors and inconsistancies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"This was my first and definitely my last Marth Grimes novel. This book was a true waste of time. The premise of this story within a story could have been done well but this story was off track from the beginning. The meandering into string theory was a waste and boring. Then the reader gets the dogs' point of view and things continue to go downhill from there. The only salvation for this book would have been a clever ending but be warned --THERE IS NO ENDING. When I see that Martha Grimes is supposedly an accomplished author I can only say that she should be ashamed. I bought this book from the bargain rack and even though I only paid $5 for it I feel ripped off! Don't waste your time; there are too many good authors out there. The total lack of any type of ending is very disrespectful to the reader. It was like even the author was totally bored with the book and just stopped writing... I wouldn't even give this book one star but you can't rate a book with zero stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Little More Reality Please","review":"Martha Grimes, one of my all time favorite authors, takes what should have been a great story and turns it into a hodgepodge of science and fantasy.A better title should have been 'Mungo, The Wonder Dog'. Next time, lets leave the heroics and thinking to Jury and friends, not to a dog.Also, what is this obsession lately with having young girls who freely talk to Jury, a complete stranger?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who-done-It with No Answer.","review":"Martha Grimes should never have put THE OLD WINE SHADES in the Jury/Plant series. It betrays the genre of a detective who-done-it. If she wanted to move in another direction she should have given the characters & places new names, no one who have known the difference.The character of Harry Johnson and the dog Bingo has no substance. A drunk is a drunk even if he's sipping fine wines.Nash Black, writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Grimes usual best","review":"I have loved Martha Grimes books, but just sort of, not quite, liked this one. The inconsistencies, many and glaring, that another reviewer mentioned were extremely irritating. What I found most peculiar about this book is that everyone who heard this story was in total disbelief at what an extraordinary tale it was. Page 73...Melrose says \\"that is the strangest story I have ever heard\\". Page 76 Jury says \\"The whole damned thing's fantastic. Page 95...Dr.Phyllis Nancy after hearing the story \\"shakes her head in near disbelief\\". It is an unfortunate and tragic reality that people go missing every day, and are never heard from again. Why in the world would a group of law enforcement people find this so strange and unbelievable? That and the many inconsistencies throughout the book, and the Mungo part made this book really difficult to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go to the library!","review":"I usually love all of the Richard Jury mysteries. This one sucks. There is no conclusion to this story. I can only assume that there will be another book to complete this one. I would not mind, had I known up front, but to wade through chapters and chapters of various theories, to no real conclusion, is so annoying.The only reason I gave it a two star rating, instead of a one, is all of the usual wonderful Jury characters are in the book. This however doesn't save it.Trust me; borrow this book, don't buy it. That's what I am going to do for the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disaster","review":"I've read all the Martha Grimes books and have looked forward with eager anticipation to each new book. How disappointing this one was. I think she has gone mad. Richard Jury looks like an idiot, Plant and his friends are brought in because it is a necessity in a Jury book. None of them has a role to play in solving the mystery and Carol-Anne is just window dressing. The dog is smarter than anyone else in the book. What in the world is going on here?? I think Martha has become obsessed with the idea of the paranormal and that does not mix well in a traditional murder mystery. I'm sorry I bought it and I don't think I am going to purchase any more of Martha's books. The plot made no sense, the people made no sense, and the ending was absurd."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Last Martha Grimes?","review":"Have long followed the Richard Jury Mysteries, enjoying the flamboyant characters, intellectual dialog and the clever turn of phrase so oft employed by Ms. Grimes. I was all but dumbstruck by the last chapter, I cannot call it an ending because it just rudely crashed and burned, book done. One of those times when you actually inspect the motives of the author and seek an answer for such a waste of time. I wish Ms. Grimes did not appear to be resting on her laurels, the trap that so many authors fall into after many successful pieces. OK, the quantam physics and alternate universes bore some reflection of flickering interest. I was deeply disappointed in this book and glad that it came from the library because if I had bought it, I wouldn't even have donated it to the library and thus agitate other readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Ended?","review":"This is the first time I have ever reviewed anything on here, but I have just finished The Old Wine Shades and am stunned. First of all, I'm reading and when I turn the page, it says Epilogue. Eiplogue...you're kidding! I didn't realize it had ended to have an eiplogue. On top of that, there is no ending. Nothing. If there is a hidden meaning, would someone please explain it? I can't believe I read this book and suffered through the superstring theory nonsense, and it has no ending. The only thing I will say for this book is at least she doesn't kill off any children. That was my main gripe with Martha Grimes' books, it seemed like at least one child was always killed in each book. Overall, I am very disappointed in this book and that I took the time to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weirder and weirder","review":"Ms. Grimes manages to write a mystery with no conclusion. This is by far the weirdest book in the Richard Jury series. The book contains way too much filler discussing \\"string theory\\" and other arguments surrounding the world of physics, having very precious little to do with the story line. The best thing I can say about this series is that she should have let Jury die several books ago when she had the chance. I will not be buying anymore of her books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't completely hate it","review":"This was my first Martha Grimes novel, and quite possibly my last. I found this book to be very hard to slog through (I can put a Sue Grafton away in about 4 hours). I really didn't appreciate the constant references to previous works (at least I think they referenced previous works, there was no explanation).No, the dog didn't belong in the book, but was the most entertaining part!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read this at night if you're an insomniac.","review":"What WAS Martha Grimes thinking? After 80 pages of physics explanations, I fell asleep for the night. In the morning I gave it another try and fell back asleep after one chapter. This Jury mystery is easily as unexciting as her other non-Jury fiction, notably End of the Pier. One more non-starter like this one, and her Jury books will be off my list, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Book","review":"This book was a great next book in the series. It was nice and comfortable visiting with old friends. I am glad I got it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drat, not her best","review":"I've always loved Martha Grimes's work, and was eagerly looking forward to this one. Alas, this is clever, but not her best. Especially, as another reviewer mentioned, the business with the dog. Please, I'd thought we'd gotten past that sort of thing.No need to mention the plot, no need for spoilers. Unsatisfying, indeed. Finally, and this may be from watching too many CSIs, but once you've read it, think about the ending -- and the dog's presence -- and testing for evidence. Couldn't that have been done? I can't say more because it will give the plot away. Hopefully some of you will understand what I'm trying to say LOL.Suspending of disbelief is something readers usually have to do, but Ms. Grimes definitely has tried this fan's patience with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pull the shades, the party's over.","review":"I am conflicted here, because I am a long time reader of Martha Grimes Richard Jury mysteries. It is, undoubtedly difficult to keep the same characters fresh and the stories clever. But, I have a bit of a crush on Richard Jury, so I continue to plod through these books. The Old Wine Shades has many vintage Martha Grimes elements--oppressed, yet wise and brave children, round table discussions at the Jack and Hammer, Aunt Agatha scarfing down too many fairy cakes--but even these old dependables can't save this book. Sadly, the weak threads, lack luster dialogue compounded by a problem-solving dog and cat, along with a tedious science lesson, make the book unbearable for me. I've walked into my last pub with Richard Jury; I'm really going to miss him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I just finished this book and feel cheated. Way too much talk about quantum mechanics and superstring theory, way too little plot! I have read every Richard Jury mystery and they haven't all been great, but at least they had an ending. I loved the dog, but that was about it. Not enough Melrose Plant (my favorite character) and what there was was grumpy and out of sorts. Come on, Martha, you can do better. This series just went from \\"must buy\\" to \\"get on the waiting list at the library\\" for me. I wish I could get my money back! (This book also needs an editor: many spelling and grammar errors throughout.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Sorry Tale","review":"I couldn't wait for Martha Grimes book to arrive having read all the Richard Jury novels. What a disappointment. I found myself turning a few pages at a time, and I thought if Jury met with Harry Johnson one more time I would scream. The dog was the only likable character. I seldom let a review influence my purchasing, however, I'm sorry I didn't pay attention to these. Maybe the well has run dry for Ms. Grimes."},{"rating":"1","title":"where's the ending???","review":"While I am a big Grimes fan (love the Richard Jury series, and have read them all), I actually found this book to be rather a frustration. You see, the beginning really pulls the reader in--there's this fantastic tale Jury is told at a pub, and the story is rather a brain teaser. Well, and the intensity just builds from there...keeps you guessing the whole time...you stick through page after page of suspenseful dialogue between the characters (sometimes it feels like the characters are talking in circles around the plot)...takes you through all of this, only to drop you right after that. Yes, that's right...the book just drops off. Doesn't really give you much of an ending, which is frustrating to no end, since this book is really a story within a story. Rather a disappointment to have stuck with it through over 41 chapters, and then have it just fizzle out. Quite unsatisfying, that.\\"Man walked into a pub...\\"(Bah humbug to that! Where's the ending???)"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was bizarre!","review":"Ordinarily I love this author's books. I have every one of her books. But this book was very strange. The book was not up to her usual standard at all. I won't give away any spoilers, but the plot was just too far fetched for me, what little there was of it. I loved her last book Belle Ruin. Maybe she should concentrate on that series instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"How disappointing","review":"Ms. Grimes must be getting tired of writing the Richard Jury books. The dog was just ridiculous. This series is not supposed to be science fiction or fantasy.The early books are terrific, but the last few have been disappointing, with this one being the worst. Perhaps the author should just wind up the series with the next one and call it a day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maverick","review":"I have read and liked all the Richard Jury mysteries. This one I did not like. Too much of the book dealt with Physic's theories and not enough basic detective work. I was disappointed in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?","review":"There's no way I would have expected this unfolding \\"tale within a tale within....\\" from Martha Grimes. It was the most unsatisfactory read I've ever encountered. Not only is it boring in it's telling and retelling of the tale, but there's quantam physics involved. Then it has the audacity not to end! Or shall I say, it felt like a short story masquerading as a novel and was utterly terrible.I can't imagine what Ms. Grimes' purpose was in this book, but PLEASE, NO MORE OF THE SAME!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for the paperback, and then wait a little longer","review":"This is a hard book to review, because it's enjoyable (the characters are like comfortable old shoes, and the dialogue is often very funny)BUT the plot is ridiculous, the perp's motives and methods make no sense,and the ending is really, really, really unsatisfying. Ms. Grimes resorts to making a dog -- who plays a prominent role here -- a sentient being and an action hero. Give me a break."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grimes Lost The Plot","review":"A great plot concept falls flat on its face!What happened half way through? A body is found and the story becomes farcically and unbelievably, should I say, boring! So much research and clever twists gone to waste I'm afraid. I couldn't wait to finish it and start a safer Reginald Hill."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's the worst Martha Grimes book ever!!!","review":"This book is truly awful. Without giving anything away (and believe me, there isn't much of a story to give away), the book focuses more on quantum mechanics and a psychic dog (no, I am NOT kidding) than on an actual mystery. I don't know if Ms. Grimes was under contract to write another book and had a huge case of writer's block, but whatever the explanation for the inanity of this book, just save your money and skip this one. Usually, I am a HUGE Richard Jury fan, but this book just went from bad to worse as I read on. SKIP IT!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My Last Investment in Martha Grimes","review":"The Jury mysteries have completely lost their appeal for me, and perhaps even Martha herself is tired of her characters, when she makes a dog and cat central to her story. PUH-LEEZE! Ah, I forgot to mention there are more orphaned children in this one as well. This was a page-turner for me, all right. I turned lots of pages quickly (unread) to escape all of the cute and (not) clever discussions of physics.

Bizarre is too interesting a word to use for this book. More like muddled, drawn out, and difficult. The story within a story is an intriguing idea, but it went nowhere. The plot is weak, the characters' actions unbelievable, and the ending disappointing. I have enjoyed reading this series, but to be honest, this book was a waste of time. I think it's time for Jury, Plant, and pals to be put to rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"The dullest yet.","review":"When I read the last Jury book I promised myself I'd never buy another \\"hard cover\\" however in a weak moment I bought \\"The Old Wine Shades.\\" This is, by far, the worse of the series. After this I doubt I'd even spend the money for a paperback. If I wanted to read about physics I'd go to an expert. Also, Jury and his friends are getting rather \\"long in the tooth\\"; older but not wiser. Another reviewer mentioned the ending - I never got that far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quantum Physics for Dummy's","review":"This book was a horrible let down, The title would have been more believable as \\"Quantum Physics for Dummy's\\". Half of the book was more hypothetical drivel about theories of mathematics and physics than an actual mystery. I kept waiting for something to happen and unfortunately it never did. I am not even sure that the book had an ending. A complete waste of time and money. Very disapointing as I have always enjoyed her characters and stories. If I had wanted to read about quantum mechanics or physics then I would have bought a book about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird!","review":"I read another Richard Jury novel, Dust, and was totally baffled by it. Knowing the author's reputation, I gave her another shot. Shouldn't have. This is worse. Looks like she has moved from writing mysteries to promoting a sort of soap opera of cartoon characters with ongoing activities and no resolution of anything. The only conceivable reason for ending the book with as many loose ends would be to get people to read the next one in the series. Didn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"A total waste of time.

As others have commented, the lack of a decent printed manual is a drawback.Knowing that the TI-89 Titanium is functionally almost identical to the Voyage 200, I called Texas Instruments and ordered a TI-89 manual. Customer service was very friendly, the manual was cheap ($4.95 + s/h), and it arrived quickly.TI really should package this manual with the Voyage 200, and maybe they'll start doing it in the future.

Plus, the 89 has 2-3 color codes per key, making it hard to read. The 92-Plus, and the 200 Voyager, eliminate that hassle for ease of entry and use. It is true that it is much larger, but so what? I have used it to actually try to learn math, and it has been very rewarding for me, eliminating drudgery.

The first book in the series, Midshipnman's Hope, was stering and I rooted for Mr Seafort. The second book, Challenger's Hope, was the begining of the downward slide with Seafort brutlizing everyone and beating them. A real leader is not a Captain Bligh. This third book, Prisoner's Hope, does have good action sences, but by this time I was very tired of the yelling and crying and beating and moping. I started skimming to move past all of this to see what finally happens. I have to admit that the story is compelling and I want to see how they win (maybe, I hope) against the Fish. These books are like a really bad movie you stay up to watch, and at the end you ask yourself, why did I waste my time. And you answer, you hoped it would get better, and at times, it does, but you keep on watching because you want to see how it comes out in the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much tortured soul","review":"This series is a painful one to read. Nick Seafort suffers from two problems: the typical hero's being in all the wrong places at the wrong time, and his personal and bizarre code with which he tortures himself at every turn. This story is worst than most, as more and more characters seem to have this trait of unbreakable personal codes for which any violation is unforgivable. It makes any character interactions painful to read as you wonder who will say or do the wrong thing to offend honor or duty and be eternally ostracized. The science fiction, however, is gripping. If Feintuch were to devote more to SF and less to gloom, he'd be fantastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crazy Hope","review":"The series started out with a bang and has hewed to the formula.

However, as other reviewers have said, the bra baby fastener is made poorly and falls off. (We frequently find it in the bottom of the washer and manage to repair it for awhile.) We decided to try the bra wash bag and completely ruined two bras. They held their shape and were clean, but were snagged all over; on the cups and all around the band. We only washed them with t-shirts, so I can only assume that the snagging came from rubbing against the bag. We're getting ready to try to bra ball since it looks like a better made version of the bra baby. It is a shame that the bra baby makers can't just improve the fastener because it's a great product otherwise."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bra-saver.","review":"I've got one for me, and loved it so much, that gotten more for all my friends.

They do help to hold the shape of the bra while it's washing. I'm a D and I could fit 2 bras in there. They are difficult to fully zip and even more so to unzip, because the zipper ends up under a little elastic thingy and is hard to get to. The most disappointing thing for me was that the bags started to fall apart after what I thought was a minimal amount of use, on delicate cycle only.

John Lee Hooker had such an incredible voice and it's as if his singing and playing encapsulates all misery imaginable. He extracted so much emotion from these songs that made me feel as though I'd actually lived the experience. It's so incredibly painful to listen to in places that I expected the heavens to open up in response. This is a man who knew what he was doing.The band is in top form and John Lee uses them to get the crowd rocking as he works his magic. Everything is spot-on! From slow, painful numbers to upbeat, rollicking shuffles, John Lee Hooker and his band can do it all.This is a landmark album that shows a man (and a band) at the top of their game and it's something no self-respecting blues fan should be without!

I anxiously opened the box and started playing around with it. It is a bit more complicated than I bargained for. I have played with most of the options and I spoke with Casio's technical support.

Turns out the camera will accidently turn on in your pocket or purse and the lens cannot fully extend. These cheap plastic rings break and the camera is useless.

I was not sure that I had not caused the damage. One day after getting it back, the problem resurfaced and the repair people fixed it again. This was the second long repair time. About 2 months later I was at a music festival, went to turn it on and guess what? Yep, the zoom mechanism was broken again. I am not going to bother fixing it.

If you know Florida, you'll recognize the brilliantly-drawn landscape and the optimism of those who go there to enjoy it. But even if you don't know Florida, you'll recognize the characters' determination to pursue their dreams, even when the pursuit doesn't take them where they expected!

The animation quality is way better in this season than in the previous 2. All of the characters return and so do the Arm Slaves. The AS's are even more awesome in TSR. The voice actors are all the same and the music is still great. My only complaint is that the ending leaves you hanging really bad. It pretty much ends with all sorts of bad guys ready to pounce and the team of the TDD ready to take them on. I loved this series but was very disappointed by the ending.

Beautiful animation. Some funny stories.

This last volume of The Second Raid is definitely a fitting way to end this arc, but it also leaves the door open for more FMP. If you haven't seen the first Full Metal Panic things might be a little confusing, and I would definitely recommend watching it on Youtube or something, but they do a pretty good job with flashbacks and getting you up to speed on the older characters. If you have seen the whole series than you'll definitely enjoy volume 4 of TSR.

There are so many positive aspects of the book it's hard to describe in under 1,000 words. One of the benefits that may not be obvious at first, though, is the ability to have better relationships with others around you. Reading the book helps you to understand not just how you tick but how others around you tick as well. So for me, \\"Be Yourself\\" allows me to appreciate not only my own gifts and abilities but other's as well.

If you took out all the repeated phrases, this book would probably be half as long as it is. Okay, I may exaggerate, but not by much.

The worst thing is one calf is 1 inch longer than the other, and it was too obvious to be ignored when I tried them on.

It will suck all of the fun, laughter and joy out of the Star Wars universe. I never thought it would be possible for me to not like Luke - but could not help but be annoyed by him. The story is dull and fails to create suspense in any way, shape or form. To be honest I didn't even finish it - which astounds me because I make sure to finish every book I start no matter how bad. I put it down a few chapters from the end and have no regrets. Avoid this book like the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't make this your first Star Wars novel...","review":"...Or you'll never read another. I have been plowing through all the novels and this is by far one of the worst books I've ever read in my life. The other books in the series (with the exception of the Calrissian Trilogy) are among the best books I've ever read. The only reason I committed to finishing this one is because I'm on a quest to read all the Star Wars novels. This one was brutal. Too descriptive where it didn't need to be (ie author decides to up and describe some inanimate object which doesn't even help the story line along), not descriptive enough where it needs to be (ie author must assume you know what they were thinking when they wrote the book). If this had been the first book I read in the continuing Star Wars saga, I would never have picked up another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing......","review":"First let me say I read purely for entertainment. I don't read books to critique them. With that said i had a really hard time reading this book. The Luke Skywalker parts are just ok. The Han and Leia parts are soooooo boring i only made it to page 158. I thought about just skipping Han and Leia and reading the Luke parts but decided against it. I wouldn't pay attention to any of the 5 star reviews about this book. You can trust the ones that are 2 or 1 stars. I will say that this is the first time I've had this problem with any star wars book and i've read the entire New Jedi Order and X-wing Series.

At least I didn't have to waste my time trying to figure out what happened at the end. Not that it mattered anyway. The only reason why I bought this book was because of the dazzling cover by artist Drew Strutsan. (I shouldn't have judged this book by its cover) A note to Barbara Hambly: Please do not write anymore Star Wars books. It is very painful to see the once-great SW books fall into a mediocre Star-Trek-like book series. Don't mess with the Star Wars characters. Write about Spock and Co. if you will, but not about Luke, Han. Leia, Chewie, not even the Jawas. Thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"How Does Lucas Allow This?","review":"Only reason its not a 1? Its still a visit to the Star Wars Universe. Nonetheless, this is a pointless, boring, and torturous book.

Along with the Force, the fantastic military machines are what make Star Wars special."},{"rating":"1","title":"Children of the Jedi","review":"If you know anything about Star Wars at all(the author does not)you will hate this book. The author(who has no place writing a Star Wars novel)fild a choppy feeble story line with tons of bad description \\"gluey wind\\" and lame dialogue. The Author has no sense of who the characters are so you end up with old characters doing and saying things that they wouldn't do(Luke Skywalker is a feeble minded wimp). The story just plain sucks.

I love Star Wars books, but this one was ridiculous. Here's what I don't like... Callista had her chance to live, she lived. Yeah she was brave giving her life to save hundreds of others, she's DEAD, the end! OK, she needs to pass on to the Force, where she belongs. You have one life to live, you live it and you die 2. I did not like the way Ms. Hambly viewed Mara Jade, as having a relationship with Lando. Those two just don't mesh. 3.Irek and Roganda Ismaren didn't even scare me.

'What if they...'NO SUSPENSE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, if you value your sanity, DON'T READ THIS BOOK!!","review":"I don't even know where to begin with what was wrong with this book. It was so boring. Ms. Hambly has somehow managed to make even the most beloved of SW characters annoying. And am I alone when I ask WHAT WAS GOING ON?! I couldn't even bring myself to finish this book it was so bad. And why did Luke constantly leave C3PO alone? Those jawas would have ripped him apart for scrap metal in seconds (and why weren't they re-enacting battle scenes like those freaky plant-people?).

This was probably the worst.If you like books where you read a lot of diolauge, unnessicary discription, trailing off, weird ideas, and blandness, then this book is for you.If you do decide to read this book, I have only one thing to say:May the force be with you."},{"rating":"1","title":"stupid","review":"it was stupid it had no plot she is the worst author in the world. please send me some cool star wars stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"it should get negative 5 stars","review":"i hated this book. the charaters were all gay. they should stop have affairs with eachother. but there was one good part. and that was the part with the flying coconuts. that part was pretty cool. and then when the army of flying rats came and started singing and dancing to some where over the rainbow i got so excited. but then i read the rest of the book and got very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Star Wars author","review":"I love the star wars expanded universe. I have read over 100 of the novels, and Children of the Jedi and Planet of Twilight are my least favorite by far. I usually fly through a star wars novel, but I kept putting this one down, having a very hard time getting through it. The writing style is choppy, and parts that should be full of emotion and excitement feel dry and boring. I didn't realize Planet of Twilight was another Hambly book until I started reading it, and then the style was unmistakable. If you are looking for a good Star Wars book, this isn't it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two thumbs up !","review":"I thougt this book was very good. But there was one part I just didn't understand. When Leia is druged and laying on a cot in the smuggler's tunnels, the book says that she begins to start runing through passageways because someone is after her. Is this her using her Jedi senses inside the jedi practice mazes?

Usually I finnish books in one week...."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Children\\" not a book for children","review":"\\"A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away\\" would correctly sum up Hambly's book \\"Children of the Jedi\\", as the book seems to stray 'far, far away' from the rest of the Star Wars saga. With a confusing plot and some relativly weak characters, Hambly -unfortunately- successfully manages to turn a star wars space opera, into a soap opera. But I'm not here to thrash and trash this book like so many of the others, because unlike them, I actually understood and enjoyed it. I still cannot recommend this book to anybody though other than hard-core star wars fanatics who MUST read every book that's been published. If you're someone just looking for another series to start on, Then you might want to consider skipping this one for now."},{"rating":"1","title":"STOP!","review":"Oh man I can't even finish the book its waaaaay to boring.

I reccomend not wasting your time on it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"out of one mess and into another","review":"I thought I'd enjoy Hambly but her style was to slick for me. She jumped around way to much leaving me totally confused and in the dark(just like the ship luke was stuck on).

After i finished that I read Darksaber wich seemed like the light at the end of the tunnel even though he' really not that impressive (after Hamblys book anything would seem as refeshing as Zahn). Then because I've dedicated myself to reading ever novel and in order i might add, I forced myself to choke down her second book (or try anyway). I was hoping she would improve but shes only gotten worse. I gave this a 2 only because I'd give Twilight a 1."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch","review":"Well, here we go. Luke keeps passing out all the time, the plot is boring, Mara and Lando together are disgusting, Luke and Callista's love story is impossible to stand, that story about the Emperor having another Hand was also hard to take.

But still, the book is bad and boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"AN AWFUL, UNREADABLE BOOK.","review":"I do not agree with anyone who said this book was good. Callista was boring(I preferred Mara Jade). Every two pages Luke would start whining about his leg. It felt like someone scratching the blackboard with their nails. I was going to scream with torture. I should think that Luke, the powerful Jedi Master, could heal a simple wound on his leg. All that stuff with Han and Leia was boring. The beginning was pyscho and confusing. The only reason I did not give it a 1 was because of the Jawas and the Affeytechans. How can coffee exist in the SW universe? That makes it seem normal & boring. The topatoes & pittins were also silly. Changing one letter does not make that much of a difference. At least change all of the letters and make it exotic sounding. To sum it up, Hambly needs to take a few lessons from Zahn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful. A read like being stepped on by an AT-AT.","review":"This is a book that makes you wonder why some writers even get paid.

This one was a struggle to pick up. The first 150 pages were confusing beyond belief.( How did Luke end up on the ship and what was Han and Leia even looking for?) If you can get past the first 150 pages, it does get better. It wasn't a very good love story either. Luke and Callista's pairing was more like two lustful teenagers who couldn't control their hormones than a love story. It's a confusing read for this simple mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not The Best SW book for sure","review":"Callista should just go back to the past. Some of it was realy confusing, but it was ok.

Children of the Jedi is easily one of the worst books I've ever read and is a black eye on the Star Wars franchise. I don't know how this book ever saw the light of day.

I don't want to compare this book to others in the series, because of the range different authors, but I think I have to if there is going to be any continuity in the \\"big picture\\" of the story as a whole.

The story contains some interresting parts and ideas, but unfortunatly, none of those ideas are used to their full potential. Next to that,the people in this novel do not appear to have anything to do with star wars, exept for their names, the only ones that behaved a bit like themselfes were Mara and C-3PO.

It's a DREADNAUGHT!!!! Not a super star destroyer. How can it be so devestating? And whatever happened with the children? Does anyone know?

If us, simple-minded yet die-hard starwarsians, wanted something deep and meaningful, we'd look elsewhere. What we want (and pay for) is Star Wars - plain and simple. I can't understand why Lucas/Bantam allowed Hambly to write a novel that would alienate half their customer base. And I recently discovered that it doesn't end here; they allowed her to write yet another SW book; a grave oversight me thinks! Oh and another thing, who the hell does she think she is contradicting Yoda like that.

The reader doesn't earn the revelation of Irek's power over droids he just comes out \\"it's me!\\" tada! And with Luke badly hurt most of the work on the Eye of Palpatine revolves around Luke hobbling around and 3PO taking the lead on moving around the ship and getting Luke to safety. Very out of character for a protocol droid. Why did they put a restraining bolt on Nichos and not 3PO. Just a sample of plot holes so big you can get the entire rebel fleet through it.

You're stuck reading this elaborate and way too wordy paragraph describing a tree or flower that does not have anything to do with the story.I've read just about all the books in the SW universe involving the main characters (Luke, Leia, Han, Chewie, the twins, and Anakin). Some are better than others, but never have I not been able to finish the entire book.......until now. I don't know how George Lucas let this book be released. But now that I think back to the 3 prequels (Episodes I, II, & III), maybe I do understand how."},{"rating":"1","title":"endolev","review":"Very painful reading.

I tried so hard to get through it but it was impossible! Once those retarded plant people (what was up with that?) showed up I couldn't take it. I didn't think it was possible to make me annoyed with Star Wars, but Barbara Hambly did it. She should do Star Wars fans everywhere a favor and STAY AWAY FROM STAR WARS!!! YOU'RE KILLING IT, FOR GOD'S SAKE!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"STUPID book!!!","review":"This book was SOOOO boring! There was too much description of everything.

I would recommend them instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a good book","review":"This is a good book for the brain-dead. The characters are extremely boring.

Andersson corrects some of the mistakes in Darksaber"},{"rating":"1","title":"children of blah blah","review":"I started reading this book and put it down about half-way because it had nothing I could get interested in and the writing wasn't good. Also, the premise of a Jedi outside of Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan, Yoda and Anakin retaining her identity after the death of her physical body is contrary to the newer G-canon from the prequel movies. So this is yet another novel that is rendered impossible by Lucas' superior offical continuity. I guarrantee I will never finish this book now.Instead of this book, I highly recommend the following 5-star novels that are extremely relevant to the film series:Cloak of Deception (Star Wars)Shadow Hunter (Star Wars: Darth Maul)Labyrinth of Evil (Star Wars, Episode III Prequel Novel)Dark Lord: The Rise of Darth Vader (Star Wars)Shadows of the Empire (Star Wars)"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Star Wars Book I Have Ever Read","review":"This Book Sucks Is Looooooooong And Drawn Out and most of all boring But to keep the continuity of the series you have to read it sorry"},{"rating":"1","title":"Would have made a great comic book","review":"This was an interesting story, but it would have made a better comic book or short story.

I'm sorry, but it does, no question. When I tried to read it... it did not make any sense. Who are the Children? What is the Eye of Palpatine supposed to look like? Why are there Gamorreans, Jawas, and other creatures on board dressed like stormtroopers? And what's up with Luke and his feverish dreams? I can never tell whether what I'm reading is his hallucinations or reality!!! I have barely made it through once, and I didn't understand 99.99% of it. It was extremely boring. It made me queasy to think that Bantam's standards had gone soooooo low as to allow this garbage into the Star Wars universe. I later bought The Courtship of Princess Leia, which restored my faith in Bantam. As for you who have not read the book, SAVE YOURSELVES. It's too late for me but you still have a choice... don't come down this path, it leads to the Dark Side."},{"rating":"1","title":"When did Star Wars become melodrama?","review":"This was a poorly written novel to say the least. I understand that a sci-fi writer is allowed some dramatic license when s/he pens a novel, but, c'mon. The least s/he can do is stay true to the title \\"star Wars\\".

It sounded good. I was WRONG! This book was incredibly boring! One or two things were okay, but I think overall, this book is thumbs down."},{"rating":"1","title":"HUH?","review":"This book was the worst Star Wars book by far. I did not understand the plot and I my mind kept wandering while I was reading, it was that boring. And where did Callista come in? Luke couldn't talk to her one chapter and she suddenly had a voice? The whole thing was just unrealistic. Even if she was a Jedi. How can you be trapped in a computer for so long and not have made your presence known? And why was Luke the only one to snap out of the brain-washing thing? And there was another Emperor's Hand? I would think that Mara would have had SOME clue about that, she can't be that brain dead. The book sucked, big time. Don't bother reading it, it's a total waste of your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Children of the Jedi is a horrible novel","review":"I thought this book was the worst I ever read. I wasted my time reading it. It made no sense what so ever. Where did this writer learn to write Star Wars novels.Children f the Jedi is a dumb title. I didn't like the character Callista, Luke deserves someone better. In some of the Star Wars novels I've read Luke meets better women that might suit him better besides this dumb Callista.But Luke never ends up with them.I thought some parts were good,but then it got boring again.I wasted my money.I wouldn't read it again!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"To say it lightly this book sucked!","review":"I read this book because I thought it would be fun to read because Luke falls in love finally!I mean I love HaN SOLO like all but I kinda felt bad for Luke.Any ways THIS BOOK STUNK!First of all being only 14 this book seemed to grown up.Well to Grown up for Star Wars.It was grown up because number one the plot was confusing(and boring)and because it was all lovey dovey if you know what I mean.(I really dont feel like saying it on-line-)but I dont want to trash this book any more because even though I disliked it a lot,I enjoy the character of Callista and it was nice to know there was somebody out there who fixed Luke up with a nice girl!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One Word: BAD","review":"This is probably the most confusing, most boring, and pathetic Star Wars books ever written. Hambly forgot one element in this book: a plot. I can find more excitiment in reading a disclaimer. This book was so confusing after I read it I had to get the cassete from the library to understand and I still couldn't get the plot. Not worth spending money on. Plus Callista is a very useless character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfocused writing mixed with boring plot","review":"I found \\"Crime and Punishment\\" and \\"War and Peace\\" a faster read than this book. I consider myself a avid fan of the Star Wars Universe (reading the novels, playing the game and the like). When reading this book, however, I found myself hoping Luke and Leia would die just so the book would end. The usually witty dialogue of the main characters was replaced in this book with looooong thought bubbles that were not in character. Any action in the book was slowed down by irrelevant factoids making one believe that the author had to do this to expand her short-story-idea into a novel. Those that approve all work to go into the StarWars Universe really fell down on the job with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's bad!!!","review":"This book is the worst Star Wars book I have ever read. I read Star Wars novels for enjoyment, not for improving my attention span. If I wanted to read a poor attempt at writing a figurative and classy novel I could read one of the suggested reading books my school gives me. I'm sorry, but this was torture."},{"rating":"1","title":"BLEAH.","review":"This was the most uncomfortable book I've ever read. It was long and uninteresting, with no purpose. Ms. Hambly never gave any reasoning as to why a character was doing something, and most of the content was very unlogical. Is Callista dead or alive? Hambly needs to make up her mind. All the new charaters are stupid, dull, and unconvincing. This book isn't very important to sequencing, so here's what you need to know: Luke has a girlfriend, Callista. I have yet to confirm her mortality. Read Darksaber instead. It was like a drink of clean, fresh water after a terrible drought"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Too Swift","review":"I have read a lot of Star Wars books, and I like almost all of them -- even the mediocre ones. This one is SO terrible that I just forced myself, after reading about half of the book, to skim the rest so that I had the plot down. That way if it is referred to in other Star Wars books, I would know what the author was talking about. Basically, Luke gets trapped on an automated ship that's on a destructive mission for the now-dead Empire, and he can't escape (he's too injured). The entire time, he's in excruciating pain and wandering around this ship. Leia and Han are on a distant planet, looking for clues about some supposedly mythical descendants of Old Republic Jedi. It just goes on and on, and then on and on some more. I really DO NOT recommend this book. If you're interested in Star Wars, PLEASE start reading the X-wing series instead of this :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"breath of fresh air","review":"I might be new to the whole SW thing,but after struggling through the Jedi Academy books,this book was like a breath of fresh air.The writing style that everybody else is complaining about is exactly what drew me to this book in the first place- I want to know what everything looks like,not just a quick, rudimentary description and then continue with the business of blowing thins up.(If you think these descriptions are lengthy, try reading something like Les Miserables) Luke also seems to have regained that inner vulnerability and sensitivity that first drew me to his character, that just wasn't there in the previous books. So skip this book if you're looking for straight out action, but I think the series could use a few more books like this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've read *A LOT* better!","review":"Ugh. This was a horrible book. The reasons why are stated over and over below me: no plot, bad characterizations, ect. I think the story had potential and could have been entertaining ... maybe if another author had written it. I read it once; and forced myself to read it again - in the hope I'd understand it better, but halfway through I just decided to drop the attempt. Unless you're really a hardcore, gotta-read-everything SW fan, stay away. Otherwise, steal or borrow. This thing is not worth the cash you'd pay for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good!","review":"I thought the book was very good (the parts on the Eye of Palpatine, that is). It brings in a new character that I love and I hope you will too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll make this review simple","review":"The writing style is too choppy to be considered a decent narrative. The plot is very weak. The characters are flat, especially Luke's love interest (who isn't even human). It is almost painful to read. The story even contradicts many beliefs of the Star Wars universe. I wouldn't even consider this a Star Wars novel hadn't the major Star Wars players been involved. I do not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coffee cups??","review":"An already mediocre book in which the author places \\"coffee cups\\" in the Millennium Falcon. The author appears to have been simply cashing in on the book deal without any real understanding of the Star Wars universe. She could have called them anything else, and this reader would not have wanted to blast this book out of the air lock."},{"rating":"1","title":"A review on the first 62 pages","review":"I have now done something I have not done before. I have put down a Star Wars novel and will not pick it back up to finish it! This story is HORRIBLE. Just when you think something is going to happen, the brakes screech to a grinding halt, and you're forced to read through pages of verbiage that makes William F. Buckley Jr sound concise!There was one pleasing thing to this novel, and that is that I checked it out at the library. I didn't have to waste a single penny!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost in Space !","review":"I truly wish I had not bothered to buy this book. At 11, perhaps I'm not old and literate enough to fully appreciate Hambly's work; though I did understand and moderately enjoy reading Planet of Twilight.I found it difficult to concentrate on this and at times, I even felt like skim-reading and skipping pages - something that I never thought I would feel like doing with a Star Wars novel. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone my age. You don't have read this to follow with the continuity of the other novels. All you need to know is:Boy meets Ghost. Boy and Ghost fall in love. Ghost becomes Girl. But Girl no longer has Ghostly powers. So Girl runs away from Boy. Boy goes looking for Girl. But Girl simply doesn't wany Boy anymore.Perhaps I'll come back to this in a couple of years but I'm not holding my breath. For now I think I'll stick to Zahn, Stackpole and Crispin."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY? WHY? WHY?","review":"I had a very hard time understanding this book. Hambly spent too much time describing and detailing the surroundings. I found myself falling asleep (literally) while reading many of the chapters. The book could easily be 100-150 pages shorter and still tell the whole story. It's a shame that this book can be considered essential to help understand books that take place after the events on Belsavis. The only reason I read it was for this reason. I'm surprised that with the style of writing that Hambly uses, she is considered to be a great science fiction novelist. It bores me out of my mind! Maybe the rest of the Star Wars universe should be written by authors like Timothy Zahn, who honestly has not written a Star Wars book which hasn't been great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably the best book out of the Star Wars series!","review":"This book is one of my favourite book of them all, because just for once someone managed to give Luke what he usually seems to lack: a sense of humour, and a good deal of sarcasm (and he is ever so wonderfully miserable). You can sense his frustration about the fact that he is once again stuck in an impossible situation, yet he takes it all at his pace, miraculously gets out alive and is rewarded with the love of Callista. Great! Barbara Hambly's humour is superb, so is the pace of the story and the fact that the characters involved get what they normally seem to lack: depth and humour (Han excluded - he always makes me laugh!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cant even get through this book, its that painful to read","review":"IM sorry but this just might take first place in the worst star wars novels list. Its really painful to read. Im trying so hard to finish but its just so bad I get bored and a bad headache after 1 or 2 pages. Nothing makes sense, we got talking gamoreans wearing stormtrooper. The author tries to make everything sound important by making up long strange words blended with long words I dont think she even knows the meanings too. Luke is a wimp and keeps passing out. Its just really really painful. There are some books in star wars that should be skipped. I havent even finished this mess and I can tell you its already one of them. In fact I may just go ahead and stop trying with this piece of trash. Dont believe me, well I and it seems most reviewers on here tried to warn you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who let this woman write a Star Wars Novel","review":"This was by far the worst book I have ever read. I had to force myself through each and every page. The writing does not flow. She spent a full page to describe a stone wall! Bantam should do with this book, what Lucas Arts did with the Xwing vs Tie Fighter game. They should deny it was ever made. I cannot express how deeply I feel this book has insulted Star Wars. If you have a copy of this. BURN IT!!! I know people are a bit touchy about burning books, but if they read this one, they would make an exception. That is if they don't take a power drill to their own head, half way through the book or sooner. It is that BAD!!!!! :(And Amazon won't let me give it less than one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Instead of nipples, I saw a flower and a circle. Thanks.","review":"They are comfortable and seemed like they would stay on, and didn't tug skin or *anything* when I peeled them off...BUT! Instead of poking nipples I saw the flower-shaped outline and an even worse circle inside. VERY noticeable even under a shirt with which I could go bra-less without nipple showage. Would NEVER work under something sheer (like most new *affordable* t-shirts are made, perhaps it's the recession) as opposed to merely clingy.I also see there's a new re-usable version, which these seem not to be. However, when I misplaced one on, I was able to pull it off and immediately re-stick it correctly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch!","review":"Yes, they work holding in nipples - but peeling them off hurt!

I, of course, wanted to read this book before my children do. This book will become as welcomed addition to our home library.The author, G.A. Mercer, does an excellent job of sparking the reader's imagination. The book takes you from the plains of Montana to ancient Italy and ancient Egypt. Justin Flowers, the thirteen year old, with the ability to time travel must defend history against the evil time traveler the Raveler.

I would highly recommend this novel to everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I bought this movie based on all of the positive comments and was deeply disappointed in it. It is so predictable and shallow. The basic relationship issue upon which the movie is based was resolved in less than three minutes of dialogue.

Other than being comprehensive, the greatest strength of this book is the detailed geographic, county by county, distribution maps for every species. Another useful feature is that the months that each species is in flower is given. I have not found it necessary to buy this book myself since I personally find the Dover edition of Britton and Brown (which is fully illustrated, but not specific to Indiana) more useful. Besides, when I need this book it is at my library. Never-the-less, I give this book five stars since it is the only complete flora of Indiana, and often the author has useful comments on subspecies that are not found in other flora. I am reviewing the 1940 edition.

Suzane's vocals were quiet and her arrangements were simple, making her mark with her debut as a cross between her past Joni Mitchell and her contempoaries Tracy Chapman & Enya. With songs like Marlene On The Wall, Freeeze Tag, The Queen & The Soldier and Crackling from her debut and her classics from Solitude Standing Luka, Tom's Dinner and the title track, have lead her to more experimental types of music.This collection pulls it all together and includes rare tracks like Left Of Center (feat. Joe Jackson, from Pretty In Pink) and Woman On The Tier from Dead Man Walking. It even includes the track Rosemary from her first Collection called Tried And True. It contained 17 songs.

They come out as low-quality, sometimes unreadable JPG-type files, or, if there is mathematical notation within the flowing text, it is basically garbled (square roots rendered as capital V, powers rendered as links to footnotes etc.).

I do have a degree in engineering, but it's been years since I've had to do this sort of math. What I find disappointing is that Nahir does not investigate whether i is a necessary quantity or not. If we had different arithmetic conventions would it still appear as an 'imaginary' number? Also, the book has the same problems as any book on a difficult topic: the author is so familiar with it that he over-explains some points and under-explains others.

It is not leaving split nails, but I have some difficulty seeing past the length guard (to keep you from cutting too short) to the actual toenail.

I prefer talc-based powders, because cornstarch is irritating to me. I do not put talc near my face, as to not inhale it.

There's some computer animation that's kinda obvious, but it just lets them push more stuff in, like submarines, ice chunks flying, the Bat-Wing and a breathtaking chase scene between Robin and Freeze.If you even halfway dig Batman or even cartoons in general, pick this up; you won't be disappointed.

One expects a coherent novel but this is neither pastiche nor personal monologue. Kear is the person to write such a novel but what we get are vignettes and verbal cuttings from a scrap book. Anecdotes perhaps.The book may have been written over some time because the style and mood shifts restlessly rather than relevantly. The finest moment is in South Africa when the intrepid traveller gets picked up by a local and the dialogue is deeply insightful.But at the expense of plot.I bet he is mad that Garland wrote The Beach when he was sitting on it ten years earlier."},{"rating":"1","title":"mammoth duplicity","review":"This is such a mammoth undertaking to make a single point that was never lost. I took the time to read the author bio and I have to presume that 1)his university studies didn't sufficiently hit upon Keynes (which is common given time constraints) and/or 2)the author assumed that since his colleges didn't give Keynes credit due that it was his duty. That is admirable.I am very sorry that so many pages were needed to self-publish this repetitive text. A vanity publisher such as Xlibris will never question your project as a traditional publishing house would. Further, since this is non-fiction, you would need only submit a proposal to a traditional publisher and they would have had contracted for expertise to determine the need."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Best Hard to follow","review":"You know those books that use too many of these. . . 1888 (ci) [belg.] having to do with or related to: (types of) {relative to}. . . Kinda hard to follow with all that jargon. Simple phrases aren't in there. Index doesn't really organize the words or phrases well. It is almost written like a dictionary but not in alphabetical order. The book didn't focus on phrases as much as it did single words like \\"cannibal\\" and \\"catacomb\\" and so on.Not what I expected (very big and bulky book).

Broken into three sections; spiritual, emotional and romantic connections, Life Expressions is definitely the poetic autobiographical account of parts of the author's own life, as he shares his joy, pain, success, failure, love lost, and lust in each verse. Wilder tells his life's tales, but as a reader one will be able to smile and laugh and feel wistful and think with his poetry, feeling a connection between the poetic verses and their own life. Some personal favorites of mine; \\"12-Round Love Bout,\\" \\"A Message to My Mother,\\" \\"God Bless My Cybersoul,\\" \\"There's No Distance Too Great,\\" \\"Black Like Me,\\" and \\"Forever Moving Forward.\\" If you're looking for a unique, yet poignant poetry book, look no further than Life Expressions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clueless Heroine","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. I have read many of Ann Major's romance novels and this is the first time I've been so disappointed. This is also the first time I've been tempted not to finish a Silhouette novel - it was that bad. Still, I forced myself to perservere to the end, continually hoping it would get better. The heroine, Celeste Cavanaugh, fits the stereotype of the dumb blonde from beginning to end. Her thought processes work in a circular loop with no end. She seems to be unable to articulate her thoughts or present a cogent argument as to why she must continually hide information from the hero, Phillip. Meanwhile, Phillip seems to be obsessed with Celeste's body and spends little to no time focused on any other reasons for falling in love with her. Finally, the title is misleading. There's nothing shameless in this book except how it shamelessly fails to make for a good solid love story about two interesting people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something Completely Different!","review":"The first thing you'll notice about \\"Gadget\\" is the art. The characters in junior high, but they look like elementary kids. They're all chibi. I really thought the art made it unique though, and you can't help but like the characters.The story is unusual, too. Toriga loves fixing technical machinery and UFOs, but doesn't have much luck with girls. Then he gets to know his classmates, Tirai, and some weird stuff starts happening. One part that stood out to me was when Toriga is talking about Tirai's unusually high voice. Machines seem to respond to it, and Toriga concludes it's because the machines like her.If you're tired of the usual genres, give \\"Gadget\\" a try.

Si Amazon quiere fomentar la lectura a través de libros electrónicos con sus Kindle (tengo uno y me parece fabuloso), tendría que tener más cuidado con los libros que permite vender a través de su tienda.

On top I put on some heavier lotion.I have combination skin that's acne prone. With regular night moisturizers, I often wake up to a layer of oil which makes me look like I just spread butter all over my face.

I wouldn't quite call it a \\"platform\\" sole, but the proportion of the sole/heel is noticeably thick. Other than the sole design, it's a pretty decent looking shoe, just like in the photos. Unless you happen to like the thick sole design, my recommendation is to forget this brand and instead buy a similar looking Sketchers or Timberland."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guitar Excellence!","review":"This guy is great, can't be bested on the guitar.

I suspected it was because of the dual-voltage aspect, taking its toll on the little guy while I was in the UK and Europe. However, I started noticing a pattern when I bought MY THIRD Andis 33805 dryer in the USA. With fairly normal use (once a day at the most) and careful care, this dryer still didn't last A FEW MONTHS before it started getting too warm, lost its \\"turbo\\" power, sparked and ultimately fried. I guess you get what you pay for and I'm not ready to shell out for Andis turbo #4, despite my previous love affair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great size, but only the high speed works on the 250 setting","review":"Bought this hair dryer for our trip to Italy. Perfect traveling size, but when using the 250 voltage setting - only the high speed worked. It got way too hot on that setting to use comfortably. I ended up not being able to use it because it burned my skin and blew my hair too hard to style it. I started washing my hair at night and letting it air dry. The low and high settings work fine in the states on the other voltage, but it was a waste to buy it specifically for the dual voltage piece and then not be able to use it anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple and Practical","review":"I have been using this product about once a week for the last two months.

I was so impressed, I ordered one when I got home and use it as a spare when I go to the gym. There's a lot of power in this little dryer; two speeds - high and low. I prefer high and my hair (which is fairly long and thick) dries very quickly and seems to wave extra nicely with this dryer.

I tried the low and high revolution at home before my trip in it worked perfect (off course I used the voltage that I have to use in the USA). When I tried to used in Paris the high revolution did NOT work (Off course in this case I used the voltage for Europe), so I have to dry my hair with the low revolution, it took me long time ...Then, tired of doing this every day I decided to plug the hair dryer to a voltage converter in order to use the high rev.(In this case I used the voltage for USA because I was using the converter) it worked for a 3 minutes and then it burn out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless dryer from Amazon","review":"I bought this hair dryer because it said it was \\"dual voltage.\\" I took this to mean it was comptaible with England's voltage.

Great on regular power here in US, but with a converter plug it can be used anywhere in world (just be sure to use on low fan speed when using 220). We used it in Amsterdam and Cyprus....great. It is compact, easy to hold, light-weight, good fan speed, and reasonable price. Even if you never use it in international drying situations, it is great at home. I would recommend it to anyone for use in either situation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Hair Dryer","review":"I bought this item because I was going to Europe for a month. I didn't want the hassle of using a voltage converter because you can only use one electric item at a time, unless you buy more than one converter kit. You do need a plug adaptor, (these are relatively inexpensive), then you just switch the voltage, plug it in and it works great. I used it in Switzerland, France and Italy. When I came home to the States I just switched the voltage back and I now use it at home. It is small and takes up very little space in the suitcase. I would recommend it for anyone in need of a hair dryer traveling abroad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for styling","review":"Bought this for European travel plans. Tried it once and it seemed to work well, but does not fit my needs, so I will be returning it. I use a blow dryer to style my hair and usually use a dryer with a longer barrel. The shorter barrel on this dryer made the airflow blow my hair all around, preventing me from styling. The longer barrel lets me concentrate the airflow to the area I am styling. For just getting your hair dry, this one is probably fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't switch voltage!","review":"I bought this dryer to take on a European vacation with me. I was thrilled with the size when it arrived. I used it a few times in the States before I left and it worked great here. When I got to Europe, I tried to change the voltage on it and was totally disappointed. The voltage changer looks like you would use a coin or a screw driver to turn it. When I turned the knob, it fell out of the appliance completely revealing that it wasn't attached to anything within the appliance!! It was just a hole with a little black plug that seemed to be put there to make it look like it would change the voltage. Of course, as soon as my traveling companion plugged it in the 250 volt outlet, it began to smoke. What a rip off!!! I have hair that must be styled and I had to buy a hair-dryer to use while in Europe. I would never recommend this to someone buying it for overseas travel. It simply doesn't change voltage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little dryer","review":"We travel quite a bit, including back packing trips, so size is of issue.

I'm in eighth grade and I had to read this book for part of my schoolwork.I didn't really like this book for more than one reason. 1) This book doesn't talk about or include God. 2) You can't know all about yourself. 3) You can't be confident all the time, and this isn't even a good idea. Sometimes you need to look to others for help. 4) It's embarassing because it talks about your private body parts. 5) Not all teenage girls need to have boyfriends are participate in dating. If you're old enough to be married, fine, but that is not something which teenage girls should be encouraged to do.There are things that I liked about this book. It described situations that almost all teenage girls go through, so it's nice to know that I'm not the only one who feels like I've lost a dear friend, or wants to lock myself in my bedroom and cry for no reason.

I really hoped that the main character would grow stronger from her time in the Kingswood. Instead, the next hundred or two interminable pages dealt with her misery and how she ended up as a camp follower. And she was still a camp follower. And nothing seemed to be happening. And I decided I really didn't even like the character so much, and I didn't care if she ever stopped being a camp follower. So I stopped reading it. Truly, from reading the first few pages I expected a completely different (and more interesting to me) book than what I got. Oh well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Dissapointment","review":"I am probably not the only one expressing my distaste for this first installment of a fantasy trilogy which, we may hope, will NOT be continued. It boasts an attractive title and cover picture, but that is its best.I found myself admiring the author's style at first; full, lush, fantasy-suited descriptions that almost made her original world materialize in the reader's mind. The story, however, is of a peasant girl who, throughout the course of the story, becomes a \\"sheath\\" for a travelling nobleman. And, you guessed it, the story is filled with sex, sex, sex. A description in almost every chapter. Halfway through the book, the heroine is an abused sex toy. And this is what they call a modern fantasy novel? I pity an author who can find no better thing to write about.Please don't waste your time with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective","review":"Be sure to check your book before you leave the store. The copy I bought had pages 312-345 missing. Great job, printers. Not really all that impressed with the story anyway.

Very annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid","review":"I found it impossible to like either the stupid and cruel \\"hero\\" or the stupid and whiny \\"heroine\\" so the story left me completely cold.And the advertised feminism is on a level with most bodice rippers. He hits her repeatedly, he cheats on her in a very cruel way and yet she keeps clinging to him, because he really, really loves her. What kind of feminist message is that? And she has the chance to make some money and become economically independent and her friend has to practically force her to accept. For a woman in her situation incredibly naive, but of course everything will be allright, because he really, really loves her. This has nothing to do with the medieval setting. In the real middle ages, many women were perfectly able to earn there living without selling themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as they said","review":"I was motivated to hunt for this book since I read some good reviews in here. But when I got it (luckily at a Red Cross Sale) then read it, I wished I never even bother with it.Yes, it's true, the author tried so hard to describe the surrounding and the people. However, the description itself is blurring the essence of the story and I found myself didn't care about ANY of the character. I also think some parts can be chopped out and make a slimmer book with more content rather than \\"ancient gossip\\". The book itself felt like a 'Dear Diary' but with 'Entertainment news' mixed in with no 'division'. Not that I don't enjoy diary styled writing (I was hooked by Jaclyn Moriarty's books).Furthermore, it is a trend nowadays to leave the ending of a book hanging so that a sequel can continue what's left but, come on, at least finished 'SOME' of what are at hand. What a waste of time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Original and well-written; can't wait for the sequel!","review":"I've read this book twice and am eagerly waiting for the sequel. Not only is this book well-written, the plot is original and I enjoy the author's gritty realism of what it might have been like to be the girlfriend/camp follower of a soldier on the campaign road. The main character is very intelligent with a lot of spunk. There are frequent sex scenes (and some rape scenes) but they are not the main focus of the book. Highly recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was good","review":"In this book, Jess and Jeremy have to make decisions about College.

I find that extremely inadequate. However, if you have the CD, there are multiple practice tests on it. My honest opinion is that this type of review manual is not going to be helpful. It is just lists of things to memorize.

She repulses me because she refuses to take singing lessons. Well, if it makes you happy!!! Edit out Mary and Cheryl and you have a great show. At least Eric had the good sense to include Tessa Niles and Katie Kissoon, unlike the 2001 tour!

While there aren't many photos in this book, it gives very detailed info about all the various vista sites along the Parkway - helpful to know what one is looking at.Good to have had both guides - Best of the Blue Ridge has many nice photos, but not much info on things other than what the author has deemed \\"best.\\"Based on both books' reviews, we stayed at the Peaks of Otter Lodge along the Parkway which was very nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great vacation companion","review":"Every year, we spend Thanksgiving weekend in Black Mountain, NC. I brought this book along with me last year. We spent a pleasant morning exploring the Blue Ridge Parkway near Asheville.

It made me want to travel more of the Parkway when I have the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blue Ridge Parkway - Must Have","review":"The book is printed on very good paper. It should hold up well for many parkway trips. Content is detailed with information regarding what is located along the way, listed by mile post number and what plants are blooming when. The book is very informative.My only negative issue is numerous pages contain sections that are intended to deliver information on side subjects, such a White-Tailed Deer on page 44. The problem is that the printer used black text on a dark blue/gray background making it unnecessarily difficult to read. The rest of the book is easy to read.I would recommend it to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Worthless Guide to the Blue Ridge Parkway","review":"If you want to know that the overlook at milepost xyz.a is scenic, this is the guide for you....all 200 or so overlooks are so described. If, on the other hand, you want to learn abut the history of the BRP, about historical events (e.g. civil war battles)that took place nearby and offer worthwhile side trips, or restaurants and lodging within easy on/off reach of the BRP, this is not the guide for you. Mindnumbingly boring, repetitive, without a scintilla of originality! A waste of money, especially if you are driving the BRP south to north, in which case you have to read this guide backwards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I have visited the Blue Ridge parkway on many occasions, and purchased this as a reference for out of town visitors I intended to take there. The plan being for them to read it and select the places that appealed. Unfortunately this book offers very little, with the exception of a milestone planner which helped us find things as we travelled along. The truth is that the host of free publications you can collect along the way, or even now online were equally informative to both previous visitors and first timer alike. I'm sure there are many very good books on the subject out there, but this is not one of them.

This file always runs in the background in the form of a happy face.If I had one dislike about all of this it would be that you need to manually close the DVD43 (happy face) every time you turn your PC on. If you do not do this every time you put a CD or DVD the program will attempt to decode it and what ever your trying to do wont start.

It breaks the book of Daniel up, and then in between sections rambles on an on as if a mad-person was providing social commentary from an insane asylum for the severely overly old-testament thumping misleading confusing dogma where poor grammar and excess use of capitals and exclamations are commonplace. In other words, it reads as that sentence just did, but worse. It provides no common sense or rational insight into the book of Daniel, his roll in the bible, nor does it provide anything resembling an educated well researched reflection or objective view of the text. Avoid this book, it will disappoint you. Let me put it another way: I put it in the yard waste bin to become compost. Yes, it's that bad.

The larger holes are perfect for cooking the underside of the pizza to perfection and the non-stick finish works well. The soft touch handle is really of no consequence to me - I use a pizza peel to take it out of the oven. Even without the pizza peel, I would be using a potholder. You can buy the same pan for even less, without the soft touch inserts on the handles. We have found this medium pizza size to work a lot better than a large 16\\" pizza when serving a large group. We have many fewer leftover pieces when we make this size as compared to a large. Amazon's price is a bit high for this item (currently $18.89 - you can buy it at Kohl's when it's on sale and also apply a coupon, or buy directly from Farberwarecookware.com for less than the Amazon price).

I purchased this to cut and peel UPC labels off products for rebates, and it works fantastic.

Obviously this is a fantastic tool for any job where you need something sharp. It works well as a box opener and it works great on those awful clamshell plastic packages. You can use this to cut around all the seams, leaving your new product (and your hands, fingers, and sanity) unharmed.One important note: although this isn't the cheapest knife on Amazon, I would highly recommend getting this particular one for one reason: the cap. I've had Xacto knives floating around in tool drawers and plastic bins before and let me tell you - you don't want extremely sharp objects just \\"floating around.\\" Invest in the cap.

I am satisfied with it - it is of good quality, small and portable when traveling, mounts on wall out of the way, is powerful, and was a competitive price. The only negative is that I wished there were more than just 2 power settings. I find that my hair is now dryer, simply because I must now use a higher heat setting than with my previous dryer.

I sought a small, efficient hair dryer that could hang up in my very small bathroom and be unobtrusive but effective. The cord - hanger is a plus, allows the coiled cord to be placed out of the way.I disagree with some reviewers who found it very noisy on high setting. This dryer is just fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"too small","review":"I was surprised to see how tiny it is for a wall hang-up. I got one with the nightlight for another bathroom (doesn't come in black!) and it was much larger.

Too small, which was hard to tell from it picture online. And its VERY loud. Sounds like a shrill airplane taking off. My daughter hates it and wants to cover her ears when I use it on her hair, even on the lower speed setting. Of course being a hair dryer it has to be used around the ears so...I would not recommend it, and suggest you turn on a bunch of hair dryers in person before buying it online. BTW, it dries just fine and blows air quite far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this product","review":"I bought this hairdryer as I was moving and needed to leave my older one in the house I was moving from. I bought it in advance of the move and it stayed in the box. I have now opened it and hung it on the wall. After I turn it on it shuts itself off fron overheating in less than one minute. I am past the 30 days to return as I didn't open and use it when I got it. It is a piece of junk. Don't buy it.

I thought I would like this book, but didn't. 'Disjointed' seems to best describe it. The author spends only a page or two describing places and events before popping off to someplace new. These one to two-page vignettes lack a sense of flow, lurching from one event to another, neither beginning nor concluding. This choppiness made it difficult to truly understand the depth, or escence, of the places he'd visited."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outa Control Ego maniac","review":"Wow, this man is worse than the guy who invented the internet . . .

Must have been his wife !"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Reason Ghostwriters Exist","review":"Having enjoyed immensely Pelton's prior work, The World's Most Dangerous Places, I was thoroughly disappointed with The Adventurist. As another reviewer aptly noted, Pelton's latest book was a rambling 220-page self-aggrandizing press release. Worse yet, the prose is very choppy (jumping abruptly from narratives about the front lines of Afghanistan to discourses about his stunted childhood) and lacks compelling detail. Just when a narrative starts to become interesting, it simply fizzles out. In short, The Adventurist is a collection of short, disjointed passages that bluntly, flatly, and shamelessly portray the author as an intrepid hero, as opposed to a woven narrative that describes the author's experiences and allows the reader to form his own opinions about the author. The Adventurist would have been better served by a ghostwriter with a sense of literary style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seems too much ego! Almost like one large PRESS RELEASE.","review":"I'm also a fan of Robert Young Pelton's Dangerous Places Series of Books, but this book was a BIG Disappointment.The author was too busy displaying his EGO in this book.

For designs created during a time when tatting is thought of as being mostly doilies and edgings, this collection is pretty creative. Some of the most unique designs are the baby bonnet, earrings and boutennieres. I love looking at the models for some of the designs, everything is so vintage. My only problem with this book is that the patterns are written in longhand, making it easy to lose your place while tatting."},{"rating":"2","title":"A delight!","review":"This lovely book is a reprint of patterns from several books from the 1930s and 40s. There is a wide range of items including a huge selection of edgings, some lovely doilies, collars and baby wear and some exquisite table linen.The patterns are written in the old fashioned longhand style of their time. The reproductions are of reasonable quality considering the book was published in the late 1980s. There are no diagrams though most of the photos are quite clear.Most of the pieces are fairly simple though some are quite large, and most people will find it fairly easy to work them once the instructions have been deciphered.

The author unfortunately perpetuates the right-wing-Republican-only stereotype believed by many outside evangelical Christianity. She battles as much for her political leanings away from gun control and in favor of all Bush administration policies as she does for the truth claims of the gospel. Indeed, in reading some of the chapters, it is difficult to see that she has any concept of a Christian worldview that might veer in any part from Republican platform positions. This is really too bad, because she makes many good points and appears to be courageous in her positions. I would not have begrudged her political point of view at all, had she made a clearer distinction between that and her theological position."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Resource","review":"This is a great book to use as a Resource to search out some of the old places of Utahs past."},{"rating":"2","title":"Revolutionary and Bold New Look at Revelation","review":"This is an unprecidented interpretation of the last book of the Bible.Peter Lorie's view may change your whole belief system if you are a Christian.666:The Mark of the Beast is discussed with an explanation that may shock you!The way the general public and the Church interpretes Revelation may be all wrong.You must try and find this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"The critical reader who is looking for enlightenment regarding the Book of Revelation will find this book practically worthless. It is filled with unsupported claims and poorly reasoned arguments. The book's attempts to blend Bible prophecy with unrelated facts, myths, and superstition assumes relationships that don't exist. Statements that directly contradict both themselves and universally accepted Bible interpretation serve only to confuse and further obscure the Revelation prophecy. Overall, there is far too much conjecture for it to be a credible resource on the subject, therefore it is ultimately of no benefit to the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What You May Expect","review":"I purchased this book with the expectation that it would give me some guidelines on how to conduct an interview as a social worker but the book wasn't totally what I expected. The majority of the book are evaluations that rate YOU as an interviewer on your interviewing abilities and each lesson contains a checklist of things that should be done in your interview. Some of the contents of one checklist include: open and accessible body posture, directly face the client, congruent facial expression, and so on. I would personally recommend not purchasing the book.

However the continual defense of Oppie's leftists views get tired and cliched after a while. It's true that Communism had not been a proven failure around the world then as it is now that we have seen that it fails everywhere that it is tried (eg. Cuba, Soviet Russia, North Korea).But there were plenty of men even then (especially military men) who knew that the Soviet communists were not to be trusted.Thank God one of those men was Harry Truman who was not one of those cliched, America-hating, liberal Democrats that pass for leaders today.I give the book two stars because of its extensive research. But it could have been much better if the authors had not injected so much of their own liberal bias into the book. But I guess you cannot expect anything else when the main writer of the book works for The Nation magazine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typically PC","review":"Plenty of detail and typically PC.

A revolutionary time for physics, culture, and politics."},{"rating":"2","title":"All you need to know about Oppenheimer...","review":"This book is a quite comprehensive look at his life and took me a while to get through. But it was worth the time I invested to learn about this fascinating American. The impact he had on science obviously is huge, but I didn't realize what an interesting person he was beyond the science.The political aspects of the story are quite interesting, we don't see too many people in the science community today garnering national attention on the scale that Oppie did in his time.

Einstein's commentary on Oppenheimer's political assassination was thus: \\"people acquiesce without resistance and align themselves with the forces of evil\\" and it is because of this book that one can get a sense of how great the blow to America (and society as a whole) was dealt by maligning a man who, as one person quoted in the book put it, gave credit to humanity by the pure brilliance of his intellect and personality. An incredibly compelling biography loaded with deep personal insight and historical context."},{"rating":"2","title":"American Prometheus: The Triumph and Trqagedy of J.

I think that for many Americans the threat of the bomb is a distant memory, associated, as it is for me, with jumping under desks in grade school. Bird and Sherwin remind us that the bomb is here and now and that its dangers are beyond imagination. The book is beautifully written and remarkably easy to read.Many years of research have provided a rock-solid foundation for the complex telling of the development a bomb capable of destruction unimagined in past history. One of the strongest messages of the book is that this horror has been in the hands of intelligent but greatly flawed human beings, whose priority lists are topped by petty grievances and personal vendettas rather than a concern for the peoples of the world who will suffer at their hands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pink Tinted Lenses","review":"A terrifically interesting, detailed and well researched book, as it should be since it took 25 years to write. Clearly, however, the authors fell in love with Oppenheimer and seem to have lost balance and objectivity.

Very hard to get the blade to slice through the nail, and when it finally gives way with a loud whack, it jaggedly cracks the poor dog's nail and leaves broken edges, torn bits of nail that remain and you have to cut off, and worst of all, it cracks and chips pieces of nail above the point you are cutting. This leads to pain for the dog! All other people's reviews on other sites of this product have stated the same things I have here. Even one groomer who rated this clipper and said she had been a professional groomer for 20 years said \\"it's the suckiest clipper ever made.\\" No one believes this clipper is any count at all except Millers Forge themselves!

Now my Tissot is an hour off for a week or two twice a year. With great effort, I followed the manual instructions to reset the start/end dates of DST in my time zone... to no avail.

I jumped into 802.11a wireless when it first came out thinking that it'll be just as easy to install. 4 out of 4 laptops that I had crashed and locked within 5 minutes as soon as pc cards come close to the router (even with non turbo mode). After changing the router, it seemed to work ok for few days. Now, my Sony picturebook still crashes so I can't use pc card at all, signal kept getting dropped every 30 minutes or so on my other laptops, and sometimes it locks everything and crashes my server.

Granted, I have paired this with Netgear's HE-102 which probably contributes to the quality perfomance.As I write this I am approximately 25m away from the WAP with about 1.5 walls and 1 floor. This gives me a 74% signal and a 24-48MBps transfer rate and a 36-54 MBps receive rate.

If you are a Heads, Hands, and Feet collector, then you have, or will want to have, this recording. Do not expect the energy of their other works, for the balance on this early work in more ballads, more Tony Coulton.Now that is not necessarily all bad, for Coulton is a great vocalist. But tracks like Friend of a Friend and Windy & Warm, for instance, are not going make anyone's compilation CD. On the other hand, Bringing It All on My Own Head showcase the band's vintage harmony and energy. Achmed is a curious little gem. Home from Home ranks up there with Simon and Garfunkle's My Little Town as one of the bleakest depictions of a town on record. Make Me Feel Much Better is trite, and the rest of the tracks may or may not prove engaging.Still, these early songs show that HH&F were clearly on to something fresh and worthwhile, and this early promise does blossom more in their subsequent efforts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of Colton...

If, on the other hand, your a fan of Tony Colton or with Heads Hands and Feet aside from all of Albert Lee's talents, then this is a \\"must-have\\" album. The point is that on this album, Albert Lee's guitar can only be heard on a couple of tracks. I think that I've only identified one song where he has a lead of any significance (\\"Can You See Me\\"). Each of the three \\"known\\" Heads Hands and Feet albums are FULL of Albert."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"The main reason I bought this CD was to hear the opening theme song from the \\"Road to Avonlea\\" series.

So I thought this CD would be great with 41 tracks of Avonlea music! WRONG! This is the music that plays between scenes of the show - the background music that's pretty but not actually a complete song, just a few short measures of music. Nice when you're watching the show, but not something you want a CD of. Besides even that, many of the tracks are slight variations of the same tune! As another said, it lacks the theme song, Gus's music, and basically anything that comes to mind when you think of Avonlea music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking","review":"The music is generally from later seasons and lacks a lot of the meat of the series. There are songs referencing Gus Pike and Felicity, yet none of the beautiful sea music that always accompanied Gus's scenes are on it. This is most likely because they are actual sea shanties and not composed for the series. The title music is also not there.

Wright. I have to admit, though, that I didn't find it as enjoyable as Surprised by Hope. Still, overall a very enjoyable read, a great option for recommended reading to any laypeople who are interested in thinking further about the meaning of Christianity.My only real negative comment to make is that I think his treatment of homosexuality in the book was somewhat shallow and stretched (it was brief though, it's not the main theme of the book by any means). He makes great comments on sexuality in general but his remarks on homosexuality seemed to be making stereotypes or relying on them.For many Christians, that would not be negative at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, Historical, Essential","review":"This book does more than explain what it means to be a Christian.

I really hate to give the CD 2 stars because my love for Chante but I heard nothing other than what was mentioned earlier that made me go Wow. For those considering the purchase of this CD, be forewarned - if you don't like remakes, this is not the CD for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless Re-Interpretation of the Classics","review":"I am disappointed with Lattimore & Moore's latest compliation, mainly because I am a fan of Lattimore's previous productions, and clearly - this album's only merit is that it shamelessly copies the classics (everything from Teddy P, to Angela, to Minnie Riperton). I think the album would've been much better if they'd just written their own material - I can already appreciate Gamble & Huff's work with my favorite Teddy P CD. That's not to say that some of their renditions aren't interesting - I'm a big fan of their version of Close The Door. Even the concept of \\"improving\\" over the originals is ridiculous. If you really want to cause pregnancy, get the original songs from the masters..."},{"rating":"2","title":"OMG-Excellent CD","review":"When I first heard this CD, I fell in love with it.

Kenny Lattimore is top 3 of all current R&B artists & has an incredible voice & sound. I guess I've been spoiled by his first 2 releases that were excellent & turned me into a big fan. Kenny's 3rd alblum maybe led into the weakness of this one, which was also a big disappointment. The man can sing like no other; new songwriters/producers are desperately needed for him or he will quickly fade back to obscurity. With the 100's of cover's they could have done; Truly (Lionell Ritchie)& the Billy Preston/Syreeta remake?? Horrible. Visionary, creative help is now needed for Kenny's career. What a shame. Incredible talent & potential."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable","review":"I got this after I purchased the Uncovered/Covered CD. In my opinion, this is not as good as that project (I liked EVERY ONE of those songs), but it's still very nice. My favorite songs are You Don't Have To Cry, Love Saw It, Close The Door, and Here We Go. My least favorite song on this disc is Still. It doesn't work as a duet and it sounds like an afterthought."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this CD with a passion!","review":"If you are looking for a CD that will add spark to your romantic interludes or that will remind you of the golden days of REAL soul music,then this is the one for you. Each song carries you through the dance of love as these two singers take you into their world of love. The songs go from playful to borderline erotic and back again. If you purchase, I guarantee you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"There's nothing else to say.

I've always enjoyed their individual projects (my CD collection shows the 3 KL CDs and 4 CM CDs), so this project was highly anticipated. This was the best [$] ever spent! This CD makes you excited about being in love, and if you're not in love, it makes you want to be in love. This CD was perfectly released right before Valentine's Day. When was the last time you bought a CD, every song about being in love, and let the CD ride? It's been a while right? The wait is over. This CD takes those of us who love to be in love back to the old school when being in love was cool. It's about time us \\"new school\\" lovers of love can have a CD just for us. THANKS KENNY AND CHANTE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"REALLY NICE","review":"Great album. This is one of the best DUET albums I've ever listen to. Chante and Kenny are two talented singers whose musical careers haven't really been a mega success but they surely deliver. I love this album and I would recommend for purchase or download."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a beautiful album","review":"Let's get something straight, this album is great but nowhere near as great as Chante's earlier albums. But let's give credit where credit is rightly due - I think she wants to sing it from the hilltops that she is finally exhaling and who cares if the words to the songs don't rhyme or that she is not exploiting her full vocal range. I remember the painful lyrics on her previous albums (except This Moment is Mine) and I thought she so deserves to sing about true love. This album is a story of the love that she has finally found.Sorry, I'm a bit slow on the uptake. I don't think I have ever heard any of Kenny Lattimore's music (give me a break, I'm British). But his singing is super fine like wine.All the best of luck for the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frolicking Fun Romance!","review":"Once again Blanche Marriott gives us a heroine to root for and a hero worthy of her.

I'll tell you what...I laughed so hard in the first few chapters I thought I pee my pants. I know...TMI, sorry.Anyway, I really, really enjoyed this book. Callie was a real spit fire, and Rand was the type of hero all woman wish for. Tyler on the other hand was a total snake in the grass. This story contains everything from laugh out loud situations, sweet romance, quirky characters, suspense, and a little mystery thrown in for good measure. The writing was excellent, the story seem to flow effortlessly, and the plot was so different then most stories I've read lately. Tell me.....what more could you possibly ask for?Would I recommend this book?

But this time, she's escaped to a Wild West reenactment town. Rand is the town's charming gambler. Within minutes of their first meeting, sparks fly between the two. But both have secrets that make it difficult for them to trust their hearts. This romance was fun and wonderful. Callie was a complex character who knew she needed to grow and Way Out West, while meant to be an escape, becomes the means for her to find her courage. Rand is the ideal hero with a lot of charm and a quick wit. With delightful secondary characters peppering the village, this story kept me enthralled."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun town, wonderful book.","review":"What a wonderful story! Living in Arizona I am very familiar with tourist towns of the old west. I am always a sucker for a romance novel but rarely do I give them 5 stars.

Please tell your college professors to get a better book for their courses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Publisher Should be Ashamed","review":"Wadsworth, the publisher, should be ashamed of itself and anyone buying this book now needs to know they're getting ripped off. Be aware -- this book was originally published in 2000, and IT HAS NOT BEEN UPDATED SINCE. So you are paying $120 for a book describing the state of the Internet and online education 8 years ago.For example, the book notes how access to the public Internet is done almost entirely through dial up connections. It talks about the cutting edge technologies that make up RealPlayer and CuSeeMe. There is a section on MUDS/MOOs. Most of the websites highlighted in the book disappeared years ago.Reading this book is a bit like stepping back in a time machine to 2000, but that this book is still in print at such an exorbitant price is outrageous. It is this sort of nonsense that makes students rightly detest textbook publishers so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughters love this book!","review":"My four year old loved making a reindeer out of a candy cane and my older daughter enjoys some of the more complex projects.

This six-hour series greatly exceeded my expectations. I produce live music shows and am always doing research into the history of different music styles. The content of the Roots of Country was rich with historical information supplemented with scores of interviews and performance footage. The series covers country music from its early rural beginnings through the modern country of the mid 1990s. None of the video was the least bit boring. In fact, it kept my interest during the entire series and I will certainly watch it again.With the eventual disappearance of available VHS players, I hope the producers release the series on DVD so that more people will be able to enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for quick, more experienced knitters","review":"I am using these right now with a wool-blend yarn (NaturallyCaron.com Country) and cannot stand these needles.

Using these needles more than tripled the amount of time to complete my project (fingerless mitts).These needles may work better with a silkier, non-wool blend yarn.

The result wasn't anything better than using plain Chapstick, very disappointing.I've read that this product may help reduce the appearance of fine lines around the mouth, so perhaps it would work better with someone who has more aged skin than mine, but I really didn't notice any change on or around my lips."},{"rating":"2","title":"soft & smooth lips","review":"Easy to use and no mess.

It gets hot enough to toast your sandwich in about 3 minutes and the pivoted top plate lets you come down square on your food with just a little re-locating of your food. It would be nice if the top plate came down with a parallel arm mechanism, but that is probably too much to expect for $50.It's biggest problem, and it is not a big one, is that the protrusions in the heating plates are too deep. That means that parts of the bread that cannot get to the valley bottoms (all bread, actually) do not brown. Someone else said this is a silly affection to get the grill marks that some people seem to associate with paninis.

This is sounds trivial, but the things are ugly and unaesthetic. Definitely not the panini of my youth.If I were buying again I'd get anImusa Cuban Sandwich MakerThis machine IS a good buy if what you're after is a retro looking George Foreman hamburger grill. It's got deep ridges in the top and bottom plates, which leave nice looking faux-grill marks on hamburger and steaks.But if what you're hoping for is food that tastes grilled and has the texture of grilled, remember this is not really a grill.

Sits upright in our kitchen cabinet.3) Nice grill marks (I use olive oil on the outside of the bread.)Cons:1) As with all these types of small appliances, if someone could invent a removable grill section, it would make it much easier to wash.

I don't think I would use it as an indoor grill because the drip cup is rather small and is hard to keep track of since it is not attached to the machine.

Since I've been using it more, I now wish it had closer 'ribs', as I think this would cook the sandwiches more evenly and quicker (as in the Krups).The directions that came with it were not very clear, and the positions of the lid was 'reversed'; I had quite a time getting that clear from the manufacturer. And it was supposed to come with a 'comprehensive' cookbook; the one that I eventually had to send away for was just a small one, not what I had expected. Being a first-time user, I needed all the tips and recipes I could get!A plus is that it does have variable heat settings.I wish it had an on-off switch! You have to pull out the cord to cut it off! For something this expensive, I expect better quality!Also, the locking mechanism that keeps the two parts together keeps locking together when you don't want it to - very annoying!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great grill, great price, and great results","review":"This grill is fantastic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I have used it for both panini sanwiches and grilling meat and have had great results.No on/off switch though, kind of a hassle, but compared to old wolfie's grill, this is top of the line.clean-up is easy, temp control is a plus and very fast cooking time. 1\\" chops in 8 min WOW!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY HAPPY WITH PRODUCT","review":"I was very happy with the panini press....

I figured it would do pretty much what the grill did and more. I was right! I use it to cook bacon, sausage, burgers, and chicken, as well as panini. It actually works better than some of the one styled as just \\"grills\\" since it has a temperature gauge that goes from low to high heat.

The lid on this grill is heavy as the job it is designed to do requires it. the only negatives are no power switch and the temp dial seems to be a little on the cheesy side.

Just 4 minutes on medium and I get a perfect evenly grilled panini every time. I think because it automatically adjusts to any thinkness when you put the top of the grill down.

I thought it would be another one of those kitchen appliance that stays packed away in a cabinet somewhere, out of sight - out of mind. But we seem to think of it whenever we make a plain sandwich. It is super easy to clean.. simply wipe away the melted cheese/oil/drippings. I have read that people have used this to grill items other than paninis but we use it strictly as a panini grill. You won't be disappointed in the quality, it is heavy, feels solid and well made. Typically when we pull it out of the cabinet.. it stays out for a few days because the paninis this makes are addictive! A great buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Grill","review":"The grill works really well. I like the fact that it cleans easily.

My complaint is that it is really hard to clean. The plates don't detach and once the grill is cooled enough to clean it the food is pretty stuck on. My trick is to wet a small towel and when the grill is cooled I put the towel between the plates and shut the lid. It softens the food enough that it can be wiped down more easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing...","review":"I bought this product a month ago for my wife's Birthday and we've used it multiple times since and it's perfect. I chose this item because of the dial option on the front. I liked the idea of being able to control the temp. the unit gets rather than plug it in and wait for it to get hot. Clean up is easy, I love every aspect about this. And Amazon's price was perfect for this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I purchased the Retro Panini Grill as a Christmas gift for my husband. This is a sturdy, well made grill for a great price. This is not junk! In just a matter of minutes, the panini is done...crunchy on the outside and hot on the inside of the sandwich with melted cheese. We have also used the DeLonghi for fish and chicken. Again, in just a matter of minutes, you have delicious food! The top grill of the panini maker automatically adjusts to the height of the food placed within the grill.

The problems do not adequately serve their intended purpose of reinforcing the concepts.

We used this textbook and it was just really, a waste of our money. The textbook did nothing to help us learn physics in any way at all. It just confuses you more when the author takes the most complicated path to teach you a concept when it could be explained so much simpler. I had already taken a college-level physics class before this, and there are so many other better textbooks out there than this one.

I was forced to use this \\"book\\" (if you can call it that) during my freshman year at the University of Minnesota, and at the end of the semester, I was thoroughly confused about a subject that I previously considered myself very knowledgeable. I recommend that this book no longer be printed, that it no longer befuddle the minds of otherwise promising young scientists and engineers. Full of confusing and irrelevant derivations, this book does not accomplish its goal of developing the minds of young students, but rather it hinders development in an amazingly bad way.

It should not be used as an introduction to Physics, but should rather be used for higher level teachings. The book is filled with proofs of laws and theorems, which are absolutely unecessary from the point of view of a student learning basic principles of Physics. Examples are scarce and sometimes do not completely relate to the topic being discussed. Questions at the end of the chapters always involve information not provided in the chapters, and sometimes puzzle even the instructor(as in my case).

However, in this book, the problems were, for the most part, irrelevant to the presented material in the chapter. My professors supplied much of the information necessary to complete the problems - not the textbook. Also, the book was written in such vague and unnecessarily lengthy terms that it made even the simplest of concepts difficult for the student to grasp.

I would like to ask these \\"apostolic\\" apostates, \\"Where were you when our Lord Jesus was walking the earth?\\" I don't hear a reply. Oh, well, perhaps you should attend classes on biblical exegesis at a reputable school of theology, not the correspondance course you took.

Is Wagner seriously asserting that modern-day apostles will arise? And if so, are they identical in function to the apostles of 2000 years ago? If they are, then we have a situation where the Bible can be added to, or at least ignored so that the new apostles can be listened to - apostles who will be able to infallibly interpret the scriptures in their own authoritative manner.Wagner has been sailing close to the wind for some time now, and this book leads me to believe that he may have crossed the line between \\"bad teaching\\" and \\"heresy\\".

That is quite an accomplishment for such young people, and these musicians are an unbelievably talented bunch. Justin, with his deep brooding voice, sings with a thoughtful passion that brings a distinct quality to his lyrics. His melodies are beautiful, and his creative guitar arrangements give the music a superb touch. Nick sets himself apart from every other young drummer in the business. With a complex style, his rhythms bring the music to life. And spunky kid sister Hannah, probably the best bassist anybody will ever have the privilege to listen to, plays intricate, funky rifs that will have you completely hooked on justincase.

Sony has always been a market leader when it comes to camcorders. They have invented almost every format we use today. Needless to say this camera is the best you can get without going to an HD Camcorder. Many people ask why pay for this camera over the HC38 or others. It's the lens and the final result. The HC38 and lower models only produce a final picture of about 350,000 pixels. The HC48 for a $100 or less difference has over 600,000 pixels. That's almost double the picture quality. You be the judge if it's worth it to you, yet to me it is!!! Also, on a personal preference get a polarized lens filter for your camcorder, is protects your lens and improves your picture quality by cutting out sunlight issues and other picture effecting causes. Happy Shopping. :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a shame this thing broke","review":"We got this camera for a christmas gift when I was pregnant with my son, seeing as how it was my first child, I wanted a video camera to capture his life!

This camera had all the features I wanted, and it was a good price. Unfortunately it stopped working after just a couple uses. The part that you put the tape in is stuck open and it won't close. It's never been dropped or abused. We used it ONE time and that was to film the birth of my son and then it stopped working. It's unfortunate because it's hard to find cameras with comparable features to this one now days.

I've never had a bit do that.The second star is for the off-chance you need all of these bits for a project that requires minimal torque."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly manufactured...","review":"The drill bit set is complete. The problem is that the handle will NOT hold any of the bits. It is made of plastic and immediately breaks. This product is poorly manufactured.

I am returning this, I wish I didn't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Might as well flush $10 down the toilet","review":"I bought this set mainly for the torx bits as I needed to tear down (and remove the platters from) several old hard drives. The first thing you'll notice is that the handle is made of incredibly cheap plastic that, as soon as you need to apply any pressure, bends out at the tip where you insert the bit and you have to fish the bit out of the inside of the plastic case. I broke the handle and the bit is almost unrecognizable (due to the soft nature of the metal) on the first of 10 hard drives that I needed to break down. UPS delivered this set at 4:15 (it's now 5:57) and I've already thrown it away.

The plastic driver breaks after light use and doesn't tighten well, if you are buying assume there's no driver included.

Overall not worth the money, you can buy other 32 bit kits on amazon WITH a metal driver for about the same price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap and flimsy","review":"This item is cheap and flimsy. I purchased it specifically for the torx attachments. However the item description was not clear - the torx attachments do not work with torx security screws (the ones with a pin in the middle). Also the handle is cheap plastic, and if you twist too hard the support rod literally spins within the handle. Do not buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good tool set for the price.","review":"Haven't had the handle problems that other reviewers have reported.

The tightening knob is cheap plastic, and it is impossible to tighten it enough to hold the bit, so don't push on it or the bit will sink into the handle. Lastly, when the driver is turned hard, the body of the handle will turn as if it is made of a rubber hose. The HANDLE seems to be less than TOY GRADE, but the bits seem OK. Now WHERE am I going to find a proper handle to fit these small bits?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Handle is cheap plastic, bit fall out","review":"This set is pretty much useless. The handle is cheap plastic and the bit holder won't hold onto the individual bit, so each time you lift the screwdriver off the screw, the bit falls out of the handle.

You can forget doing anything with wood screws. The bits are fairly wide, so you can't do anything that's recessed, either. In short, you'll need a second set of screwdrivers for a lot of jobs, which defeats the purpose of a set like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"Poor quality.

Now, don't get me wrong, these bits do work. But the extension piece, which is required to use this screwdriver set, is garbage. The extension has no way to stay secure so it slips down into the handle every time, no matter how much tightening is done around it. The handle is ridiculously cheaply made plastic and feels as if it will break in your hands while using it. If you need an extremely cheap precision screwdriver set with no reach that is for light tasks then this isn't that bad of a set, but if you need a set for specialized, harder use then you probably aren't looking at this set anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great kit for small electronic work","review":"This kit has many different pieces for taking apart small appliances, electronics, and toys. If you are doing any work on you cell phone you will need some of these bits. The drivers worked great, but one of them stripped out after only a few uses, and that may have been my error for trying to get the screw tighter than it should have been, once stripped out they bit is trash, and replacement of these bits may be hard to do. The screwdriver that comes with it is not magnetic so in order to hold the but in place you have to lock it in place by twisting the screwdriver to tighten the connection, which only takes a few seconds. For the price and convenience there is nothing bad about this set, just be aware if you are a beginner to not over tighten the screws and always be sure you are using the right size so to not strip out the screw or the bit.

If these plastic pieces were made of metal or at least a heavier grade of plastic, I would give this set a 5 star rating.

I found myself skipping tracks to find the 'well known' ballads, and was disappointed to find only track 3 that comes close to 'In my life'. After all 12 tracks I was hugely disappointed and throwed the cd on the backseat.A few days later I realized that I was thinking about some songs in my mind. Strangely enough the cd caught my curiosity and it went back in the cdplayer and played it at least 3 times a day since then.This cd is something different and is very addictive. Raye has produced a good album again. Give every song a chance and you will be surprised by some of them.A Collin Raye fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Augh!","review":"I agree with the previous review.

We each wore 2 sticks connected as bracelets and out of the 8 bracelets, only 2 were still glowing after the show was over at 9:30pm. Had extra bracelets in my bag and we each put 2 more on...those were out by 11pm. I'm very disappointed to say that the least. The 8-12 hour claim in the description is nowhere close to the reality. Also, when my mom cracked on of her sticks, the stuff oozed out all over her hands. That glowed pretty nice until she washed it off. I also found that some of the sticks were glowing in spots before we even activated them and most had empty areas even after shaking.

This is the fourth very similar product in the Andis line I've owned. With at most two uses a day (that's uses, not abuses...) the life expectancy on these units has been generally about a year, and certainly no more than two. Electrical faults (failure of the speed/heat setting switch, and in one unit a *major* blue-fire producing short where the coiled power cord meets the dryer itself) have been the most common mode of failure.Having previously installed the mounting bracket on the wall, however, switching-out the defective dryer for a replacement is a relatively simple process."},{"rating":"2","title":"Andis Pro Turbo hangup wall mount hair dryer","review":"This is a great unit.

I am VERY disappointed.First, the wall-mount...these screw anchors are the largest I've used on such a small device. My last mounted hair dry used pilot holes almost half the size. My son's book shelves used smaller holes than these things! Then, once you get these beasts into the wall, the unit mounts onto the mounting plate with a single turn screw. So the white plastic unit still wiggles every time you use the hair dryer!Second, this thing only runs for 15 seconds before overheating (yes, I timed it)! Sure, you could turn it down so the heating coils are off, and the fan still in high, but what's the point?My wife, with shoulder length hair, refuses to use it because it turns off so quickly.

The new one made clicking noise when I was installing it. Took it apart and saw a piece of white plastic inside. It was not broken off from the dryer itself.

Between myself, a friend and Meriam and Kraige I was able to score a pretty decent mark, and much more importantly understand what it was all about.The book has fair to good examples, plenty of diagrams and a fairly accessible approach. Being an incipient engineer rather than a mathematician, I found that I coped very well with the style, which while it covered the maths, it focussed on what was happening.A very solid text in a subject that is impossible to cover well for every reader.

A key element in learning Statics, which makes heavy use of FBD's, is to see many examples of how forces act so that one can internalize how to determine how they act. This text, however, has the worst examples which are hardly related to the problems given later on. I find it funny how those who liked this book generally claim they had a good instructor: I have a theory that the textbook is utter garbage and those people learned the material well beforehand from their instructor before cracking open this book. If at all possible, this book is junk, so find something else to study from if your lecturer sucks.

This novel was a more thoughtful story than the previous ones, the clues a little more subtle and the characters interesting. I found Betsy's love interest a little shadowy...not very well defined...and if this is the first book you read in the series, you might find yourself at a loss to connect with many of the people in the book. Betsy, herself, came alive a little better than previously. I am a needleworker, but I think people who aren't, and read these stories, would find her constant references to specific needlework items and people a little disconcerting.

I have not had the benefit of reading the original work so cannot compare but this was very hard work, which was extremely disappointing.As it is a self-published book/edition (by Holst) it contains some annoyances with the main one being that the index is extremely light and unhelpful. Also from an academic point of view there are no references. As the book is based on a work completed nearly 100 years ago its insights are visionary and inspiring but for a more informative approach I would recommend examining other works in the relevant areas that are more up-to-date - probably quantum physics is a good place to start!It is a book of philosophical concepts that embrace science at an extremely superficial level by today's standards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Foolishness from the ivory tower","review":"I am still amazed that the author, evidently intent onwriting a \\"serious\\" book on Gettysburg, would include hisgrocery list (literally) in the text.

If you would like a more technical work on warefare and how it is fought and why Gettysburg was so costly read \\"Carnage & Culture\\" by Victor Davis Hanson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!!!","review":"This was a great cook book.

This is the first time I ran into a problem. These rings were defective and unusable. I contacted Millet and sent them photos. They said they would replace them as soon as they could. The last I heard they took some more out of their warehouse and they were also defective. It's been 3 weeks and I'm still waiting. I returned them to Amazon and got a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this rubbish","review":"It's full of crap and is not historical research as we mere mortals understand it. It's packed full of lies, distortions, falsifications and worse.Just to quote an example, Weinberg claims that the assasination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand by Serbian terrorist in 1914 was stage managed by the Germans! That all plebiscites held in Germany and Austra since Hitler came to power were rigged! Now that are only some of the most outrageous and ridiculos claims by this German hating moron."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time","review":"Gee. This book's so badly written, I can't imagine how it got published. The plot's derrivative and predictable. The characterization is worse. The \\"high tech\\" backdrop is horribly researched, and not all that whiz bang. They'll probably make it into a movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent spy thriller!","review":"This was an good read. It jumped around a lot in the beginning, but the location headings helped. There are some inside jokes for Michiganians and U of M supporters. I would recommend the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't believe 5 stars...","review":"I had to balance these folks who are giving out ***** reviews willy-nilly. The gentleman who complained about the ubermensch characters hit on the head one of the several nails in this book's coffin. Others include the very predictable plot, the insignificance of the technology (which was supposed to be the core of the whole thing), and some places where my disbelief was unwilling to suspend itself.I gave it the extra star from my 1 for 2 reasons: the writing was not so poor that I couldn't finish it, and the technology, while not central, at least was for the most part plausible and correct. That's always a plus, even more so since Grace avoided a heavy \\"gee-whiz\\" factor that often accompanies mainstream use of technical gimmickry.And I was glad I got it at a serious discount..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Internet Farce","review":"I bought this book thinking that it would be better than Tom Clancy's attempt at Internet terrorism. Alas it was just as bad, with simplistic technology twists, and the reliance of a Navy Seal character for the tense action. The story is simple, with nothing in it other than a sense of purpose to keep you turning the page. If you want a decent techno-thriller I recommend the Cryptonomicon. This is squarely for the younger audience who are still wanting to read simple tales with simple characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmm...","review":"My problem with this book is the characters. Does everybody have to be a super-man or super-woman? I like characters I can Identify with, not super-powered brainiacs who could rule the world if they chose to. Its hard to identify with ex-navy SEALs who also have advanced degrees in every discipline known to man. It was like watching an episode of Baywatch where the characters were smart and good-looking.I appreciate that the other reviewers like the fast-paced plot, and it is well written, but the dialog sounds like a bad soap opera (\\"As you know, Bob, I...\\"). It was hard to finish. Buy it at a discount if you like these kind of thrillers, but if you want characters, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very enjoyable read...","review":"I found this to be a very enjoyable read. Although the plot was complex, the author did a nice job of bringing everything together. Being in the IT business, I found the references to technology interesting. However, if you are not in the least interested in technology, the references may not sit so well. But if you can overlook that, the story itself is pretty good and well worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great comedy show - Poor DVD transfer","review":"Its a real shame and disappointment that Ive waited this long for my favorite TV series on DVD to see how bad the video quality is.

Went out and picked it up today, popped it in my DVD, fired up the plasma and yikes an old VHS tape looks better than this. Nothing was done to clean this up for the DVD and by todays standards this is almost unwatchable. Universal did a much better job on the DVD transfer of the almost decade older Magnum PI series.

I would highly recommend Wings!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"I love Wings the show, but Wings the DVD is horrible!

Crystal Bernard is BABELICIOUS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wings on DVD finally!","review":"I have waited a long time for Wings to come out on DVD! I'm glad they decided to start with the first two seasons, instead of just the first one and us having to wait a long time for the next season. I only saw edited reruns of this show on cable, and after watching this DVD I saw all the shows unedited in their order of airing. It was like watching them for the first time, and there were some episodes I never saw before. This DVD is a must have for everyone who enjoys a good laugh.

I've waited for years for this and was thrilled when it was finally announced it would be released. I ordered in advance and and felt like a kid waiting for Christmas! When I put it in the DVD player and started it, I was, well, surprised...unhappily surprised. The video quality is out and out POOR; it reminds me of a worn out VHS tape. Video quality aside, there's no special features, not even subtitles for the hearing impaired. As for the cover artwork, I've seen better work from kids off their home computers. Disappointing all the way 'round."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good show if you like hitting yourself in the head with cinder blocks","review":"I was offended by the lameness of Wings. I personally know of two individuals who died while watching this show. 100% of me will consider it 0% fun. I'd rather take a bath with a week-long dead possum than sit through this dvd."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Classic Here.","review":"Sorry fellow reviewers I do not get this show. Outside of Shaloub the acting is lame and the scripts are dull. All In The Family, Mash, ElR, and Cheers put this shallow show in the dumper.

Despite it's plain design, this is the best guitar chord book I have read so far and it has helped me learn more about the guitar then I thought I ever would.

I believe he says something about being able to have too much of a good thing. Whilst I don't agree with his reasoning, (I don't believe one can ever have enough of Mr Fry), I did see his point so I have been enjoying A Little Bit of Fry every night before I am taken away to the Land of Nod by the Sleep Fairy. This book is thoroughly entertaining. I do so love the way Mr Fry looks at the world and the silly creatures who inhabit it. If only the newspaper and radio station owners of Australia would employ people with half Mr Fry's intelligence, wit and talent, our country would be a much better place (and breakfast radio wouldn't be such an assault upon one's yet fully awaken sensibilities).

The smaller model was installed in the guest bathroom and this larger one in the Master bath. The night light feature on this model is a little brighter than the other model we purchased as well but still is really not something that would really be considered a night light so that's why I did not give it 5 stars.

The product is difficult to install as the back plate is hard to align, and comes with the tiniest screws. Also, the manufacturer ships the product with the cheapest wall anchors. I had to purchase expandable Mollys to properly anchor the dryer to the drywall. Once installed I discovered that the night light does not work on one of the dryers, and the night light is not replaceable.

Attached to wall surface and plugged in to nearby electrical outlet. After several hours, we began to smell an \\"electrical\\" odor. Upon investigation, we discovered that the hairdryer (around the nightlight area) was SO hot that we could not touch it. In fact, it was so hot that it actually blistered the plastic housing around this area. We immediately unplugged it and have requested a replacement. But we will be watching this item very closely for the the first few days.

The first one lasted six years and I used it almost every day, then it eventually started to overheat and would turn itself off almost immediately after turning it on. It is outstanding and that's why I bought another one. I personally like the light on it because it makes a great night light in the bathroom. However, there is one problem and that is the reason I'm giving it four stars instead of five. The screws that are used to attach this hair dryer to the plate that goes on the wall have a Phillips head that does not match American Phillips screwdrivers. I was very lucky to have ONE special screwdriver that worked. Why I didn't remember this problem from the first Andis hair dryer I don't know. I think they should include American head Phillips screws when sending it to an address in the United States."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"Bought this hair dryer a year ago and we need a new one now.

It is out of the way and no cords on the counter. The green night-light is bright, but the girls like it since it brightens the bathroom up at night! They can remove/replace the dryer by themselves (they are 5 and 10 years old). They don't have to squeeze anything to remove it. Just gently pull. It is quiet with high/low speeds. I did NOT use the anchors/screws that came with the kit. Since I had young girls who would be pulling the dryer off of the wall and may not be so gentle, I replaced those with drywall toggle bolts. It is nice that the GFI is built into the unit and not on the plug so that the plug does not block an outlet or have to plug into the bottom outlet only. I recommend this product. Only reason for 4 stars is because of the hardware they sent with it. There is no way I can see those screws and anchors staying in the wall with people pulling on the dryer to remove it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shuts off when it gets hot","review":"I have owned two of these units.

I figured, OK, they make commercial products so this should be decent.My first one began to make a noise like the fan was loose and got to the point where it was unusable. It was under warranty, so I sent it back. They replaced it no problem. Occasionally you get a lemon, that is why we have warranties.Well.. It has been less than a year and the replacement hairdryer is now making the same noise. It is going to die. I will try to send it back again, but it is hardly worth the effort. I promise there is nothing unusual going on here. Too bad it is not made better, we really liked it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad but not great.","review":"I bought this hair dryer close to a month ago. Overall I am satisfied with the dryer itself. The built-in nightlight I thought would help me save from taking up another outlet for a separate nightlight. However, the nightlight stopped working after only about 5 days. It still comes on occasionally (when it feels like it). When it is on, it is very bright. One other improvement I would like to see is where it plugs into the wall. I would like to see a 90 degree plug so that the cord does not stick out so far from the wall. For my particluar bathroom setup, the cord sticking out gets in my way. Not bad for the price though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Andis hang up dryer","review":"Excellent.

This is exactly what I was looking for in a dryer. It has high and low settings and it also has 1400 and 1600 adjustable settings. I chose to keep mine on 1400 and it dries my hair in minutes. It is also perfect for styling my hair as i do the final drying. I love the convenience of having it mounted on the wall out of the way.

The hook attachment to keep the cord off the counter is very handy. The only thing that is negative is the nightlight is very bright and Aqua colored so it really lights up the room.

While this new one is much quieter than the old one, it really isn't super-quiet. Still, I have no complaints on the noise, but the flimsy wall mounting hardware is another story. The threaded holes in the mounting plate are extremely fragile, so much so that they both were wrung out during the initial mounting of the dryer. It didn't help any that the mounting holes were extremely hard to locate once the plate was mounted - it's hard to see thru that white plastic shell. I ended up having to discard the original threaded screws and use two slightly larger metal tapping screws to mount the dryer to the bracket. This worked fine, but the original mounting hardware isn't very well designed in my opinion. Other than that the dryer seems to work very well, although I haven't had it long enough to know how well it will last. All in all, I'd give the dryer 4 stars out of 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy little dryer, big results","review":"Nice quiet hair dryer that attaches to wall. Green nightlight is a little alien-like but it gives off quite a bit of light. I don't need any other nightlight in my bathroom.

The wall plate goes on easy enough if you don't use the suppled plastic screw wall anchors, but use hardware store achors instead. The supplied screws are too short for easy installation and I had to find and substitute longer screws to attach the dryer to the wall plate. I hope I am not the only one who had this problem. The hairdryer works great, and if you want 1600 watts, best you have an allen wrench to switch it from the default 1200 watts. I have no problem with the bright night light, in fact I like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfied with this product","review":"I am very pleased with this product.

I bought this in black. It looked good but I couldn't believe how long it was taking to dry my hair. I finally gave up and got my old one out and finished drying my hair in less than 30 sec. I sent it back and bought another hangup dryer (1875W from Andis). The construction is not as nice but drying time is fast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great wall hairdryer","review":"This replaced my old wall hairdryer.

This dryer appears to be well built and fits the space on my wall fine but has two major flaws that make me regret my decision to purchase:1. The night light is way too bright.2. More importantly, the air flow on the high setting is woefully inadequate for me!!! Trying to dry my hair each morning during this hot summer has been no fun with this hair dryer barely pushing very hot air at me. It usually leaves me sweating with semi-dry hair.I hate to waste hard earned money, but I'm looking at trashing this unit and finding a replacement (I used to have a Sunbeam model that worked great).Good luck shopping!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Andis Wall Mount Hair Dryer","review":"I purchased this hairdryer & within a couple of months the low setting quit working.

The dryer itself is a bit bigger than the others, which I am hoping will help it not to overheat, which is what I believe shortened the life of the other hair dryers. The build quality of the unit itself seems pretty good. It's got some weight to it and it feels solidly built, not cheap at all.My only complaint with this unit is that the air doesn't come out very forcefully. The older, smaller dryers that I previously owned blew much harder than this one. My wife prefers the less forceful air, it kind of acts like a hair dryer with a diffuser on it.Overall, it seems like a decent unit, I hope it lasts longer than the others!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Hair Dryer","review":"I love the hair dryer, fits the wall perfectly, cord is long enough & hangs on hook when not in use.For the ones that do not like the night light on the base, you can push the test button which will turn the light off.

I could have done without the decapitations, spouting blood and gang rapes. It often seemed as if the author felt she invested too much time in researching the period to leave out historical information that was ultimately unnecessary and confusing. It was hard to believe in her characters -- the heroine falls in love with a bloody marauder who attacked her homeland. A bastard raised in poverty spouts poetry to this princess. Not very believable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well-written.","review":"The author did a fine job of balancing romance with period information.

But I decided to give the book the benefit of a doubt. I'm glad that I read it through because I really enjoyed it. Some parts are really informative, like how the vikings would put their dead men below the ship instead of casting them out to sea so they can bring the bodies back to their home for proper burial, and how the flies would swarm around and the stench was so bad. The author really made the character's experiences very real to me. I really enjoyed the ending!

My dogs (both terriers) absolutely loved them. And the toys for durable. My dogs were not real young, about 5 years old. I had forgotten about the toys and I now have two younger dogs who seem to like the noise that really loud squeaky toys make. But the squeaky toys play out quickly when your dogs run around the house constantly making them squeak. Once the toys won't squeak, the dogs don't want them. I have a toy that I can replace the squeaker. But my neice reminded me about the chimp we had for the prior dogs. So, I just ordered the chimp and I am also trying the rooster. I hope these are as loud as the originals and as durable. I've seen other manufacturer's versions, but you had to really push the \\"voice box\\" to get the sound. These were more sensitive. So, assuming they havn't changed, my young dogs are in for a real treat.

He'll random pounce and carry it around in his mouth, then curl up with it and take a nap. Our only complaint is the \\"monkey\\" sound -- it makes one long monkey howl. It starts low, then increases to a high pitched scream which can get annoying fast if your pet finds the sweet spot and likes to set it off repeatedly, just to prove they can. lol It's not extremely loud though so it's bearable.

No author crafts a better trip than Jane Graves, one of the genre's rising stars.WILD AT HEART opens with the best first chapter ever; no one who reads those early pages will be able to put down this novel. Graves is a master, with a such a command of language that she sculpts her sentences as much as she writes them.There is a lively and riveting plot. One of Jane Graves' greatest skills is that she takes a storyline that is implausible, but not impossible, and she makes it actually seem very likely. The scenes at the small town Texas fair and the game preserve as so visual that they beg for a movie, maybe with George Clooney and Julia Roberts in the leads.The earlier book featuring the de Marco brothers cried for a sequel; this sequel calls for a screenplay. And the notes at the back promise that a third novel in this series already is in the works. Terrific!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I like the writing style of this writer!","review":"I like the writing style of this writer.

Also, once the grill starts talking it doesn't stop and there is no way to stop it. You could simply walk by it and bump it with your toe and you end up listening to it talk for 5 minutes.

The moment we took it out of the box, the lid broke off. The sizzling noise the grill makes is so annoying it made the hair on the back of my neck stand up. It talks constantly, is loud and incredibly irritating. It is completely overstimulating and does not allow for much creative or imaginative play.

They thought he would love it since he always would play with it in the toy store. But he doesn't seem to like it as much at home.

Secondly, any movement or touch and the grill starts talking. My sister and I tried one of the suggestions of holding the button down for 3 seconds. He continued to talk. Lastly, the lid is constantly falling off. I would definately say this is an outside toy for the summer. I am a very open-minded parent but this toy is getting on everyone's nerves.

This toy kept his active mind busy for about half an hour and that's been it! My daughter likes to play with it every now and then (mostly as a step stool for climbing over the back of the couch though:0). The lid is forever falling off and the utensils end up being played with separately.The phrases the grill says are limited and the actions are limited - thus my kids aren't interested anymore - it's the same thing all the time. It needs to interact more - it's a cute idea but just doesn't do enough to keep them stimulated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps the kids busy","review":"I bought this for my 5yr. brother. He plays with it every chance he gets. I however find it annoying so I put it out in the playhouse. Other than it saying fire up the grill and other stuff over and over which bugs me it is a great little toy. I gave it 4stars because every once in a while if it gets dropped or he's carrying it by the lid it falls off and I have to put it back together. Never breaks to the point where I can't fix it but since it's for younger kids they should made it harder to get the lid off."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate this thing!","review":"My 4 year old daughter wanted this thing, neither my wife or I had a clue what she was talking about when she said she wanted a \\"talking Grill\\" we translated that into possibly a talking girl doll? Why would anyone make a talking grill? Someone set us straight, there was actually a talking grill. (shows me for having doubts in my child) We figured it was for Christmas so why not... I'll tell you why, after 10 minutes it is so annoying. My daughter lost interest and is quoted as saying \\"I hate this thing!\\" (Daddy does too honey, it is ok.) This toy can go off without warning at all hours of the day and NIGHT as if it is possesed. The grill now occupies a spot in the garage, a place it took residence days after its arrival. It is now nervously going off on its own awaiting a garage sale. Durable as a rhino, the batteries never wear out and it can be kicked and tossed down the stairs without injury. I would imagine that this toy is better suited for a male child. Good luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please read the manual","review":"Whoever wrote that it didnt have an on/off switch: there's a reason that a manual comes in just about anything you buy. this is an incredibly annoying toy that my 2 year old daughter lost interest in very quickly... and to turn it off you have to wait til he stops talking and hold the button for 3 seconds with the lid shut, and not touch another button. it doesnt do anything but sizzle and repeat the same phrases, and the foods couldnt be made any cheaply. i do not recommend this toy to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Sigh of Relief","review":"My 3 year old son received this toy for his birthday, 2 weeks ago. He loves it! I will admit that after reading some reviews that said the toy didn't shut off and the lid fell off, I was a little worried.

Wanted stumps info but there's not much there; boat ramps and marinas are in the wrong place; depth on north side of lake isn't there.One of the most irritating issues aside from incorrect lake info is they intentionally make the roads show up wrong. The road detail is actually pretty good, but the GPS does not put your location on the right road in this mapping software; called customer service and they said we'd have to buy their road maps for correct road information. Had no choice so we did and surprise, surprise, the road map software has no problem placing you in the correct spot.

It could best be summed up by my wife's reaction when I first played it for her. \\"This makes me feel like a real smartass!\\" This is hard, late-fifties, early sixties style instrumental rock. For drummers in particular, it's an object lesson in how to swing a backbeat. It's not just the frequent drum soloing (which has a primitive, atavistic quality) but the way Nelson backs other instrumentalists, driving them, and challenging the listener to keep from tapping his feet in time. This stuff really grips you, and the synchopations make a lot of modern \\"rock\\" drummers sound like thumping metronomes.Most of these pieces aren't included in the \\"greatest hits\\" compilations.

Gives complete information on situations that were not taught or encountered in training. Such as a detailed when and why section of patient assessment and a trade drug chart and how it will affect patient cooperation. It also tells you of which type of accident will produce which kind of injury and gives case studies, self-assessment test and answers. The book also covers technical considerations, conversion charts and has positioning and pathology diagrams. But the kicker is it gives you basic patient commands in 5 different languages!! There is much more included that I've probably left out.

In other words, nobody who's actually read the book has reviewed it yet, so the unusually high rating is fictitious.Perhaps the one negative review was too harsh and written by someone who doesn't like the author. But the 10 glowing reviews are not to be believed either; they were all apparently written by the author or his friends.Based on the author's stuffing of the ballot box, I'm rating this book with 1 star to try and balance the scales somewhat.

Unfortunately, nothing could be farther from the truth. The only positive thing about this book is the entertaining Simpons quotes, which the author uses generously. But besides that, noboby gets more clever by reading it. Not even Homer, Ralph Wiggum or Lenny.Let me give you an example on the \\"academic\\" analysis: In one episode Homer drinks Duff Beer every time he sees a Duff ad. Likes Pavlov's dogs, the ads make Homer feel thirsty. The scene is not just funny. According to the author it contains profound wisdom, that speaks directly to the american audience.\\"I personally will stop and think for a moment the next time I see an ad for Coca Cola - those sly advertisers might be able to \\"get\\" Homer Simpson, but they're not going to get me.

The analysis is amateurish at best; they are the sort of conclusions you could draw instantly by just watching the show, yet the author has decided to make a buck writing them down. One chapter is, in reality, no more than a listing of all the characters the author could remember. Sadly, this may be the most informative chapter. It is poorly written, both gramatically and stylistically, and even as a collection of quotes it fails miserably (some are just plain wrong). Perhaps most disturbing is the positive critical review at the top of this page from the Excelsior--his college newspaper. To wonder whether the author himself wrote that review does not require a far stretch of the imagination. This is a disgusting display of greed."},{"rating":"1","title":"so bad.","review":"it is a complete waste of a time to read this book, and I agree, I have no idea how this was published.

How does something like this get published? I am an avid fan of The Simpsons and was thrilled when I came across this book. I hoped it would have some interesting insight into the show. It has barely any insight, beyond stating the obvious, and does not come close to achieving the goal stated in the title. The writing is atrocious. It is written like a paper a freshman would come up with at 5 AM the night before class. The quotes are wrong and stretched to fit the authors \\"points.\\" Everything is explained too much, only further emphasizing that the author couldn't make any of his points and citations stand on their own. Thank God it was so short.Also, is \\"aforementioned\\" the only word in his vocabulary? It must be used over 70 times and its a short book!

As a college student, I envy those students who are enrolled in Tufts and other universities that feature Simpsons courses in their cirriculum. That said, this book, along with \\"The Gospel According to The Simpsons\\", and the Simpsons guide books (3), satiate my desire for Simpsons knowledge. It's nice to read about specific episodes, then watch the DVDs and examine the satirical humor that is inherent to the series. I also enjoyed the Postman essays (2). My favorite part was the quotes. Any book with Homer quotes makes me laugh. The book is a credit to the longest running animated series of all time. It is great that the series has begun to merit serious attention from fans and scholars alike. (As a college student, I suppose I'm somewhere in between a fan and a scholar :) As I get older though, The Simpsons do not.

He presented some concepts, didn't go too much indepth, put some jokes/quotes in. Keslowitz said at the start he did not plan for the book to be a serious reading - but some still took it that way.

I read about this Simpsons book in a local paper, and had to give it a shot. (Glad that I read the paper everyday!) (smiling)If you're a Simpsons fan, acquaint yourself with this book and \\"The Simpsons and Philosophy\\". Both are very interesting reads: The philosophy book discusses the ways in which Homer represents Aristotlean characteristics, while The Simpsons and Society discusses whether or not Homer is a good father by invoking philosopher Immanuel Kant. It's amazing that books such as these are written so clearly that they are accessible to the general fan, but also useful in an academic atmosphere (e.g., college courses). One cannot deny the impact of The Simpsons nor deny the culture that has now become synonymous with America. The Simpsons and Society demonstrates why this isn't a bad thing. In fact, we're all a little more like Homer, Bart, Marge, Lisa, or Maggie than we'd like to believe!"},{"rating":"1","title":"bad","review":"dont waste your money, i wouldnt use this as fire wood. terrible. no one i know liked it, bad reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"COMIC BOOK GUY SAYS...","review":"\\"The Wurst Simpsen's Book Eeverr!\\"This is a SELF-PUBLISHED BOOK.

With incorrect plot and quote references aplenty, the book quickly disintegrates into a hodge podge of poorly written chapters that wouldn't have made the grade in a freshman high school english class. Farther into the book the author loses sight of what the book is supposed to be about and switches to explaining other authors views of American politics, work attitudes and home life with miserably thin attempts to relate the views to the Simpsons. With minimal time the mistakes were easily researchable and correctable. I don't think much could have been done with the writing style. I had a very hard time stomaching and finishing this book.

The font is enormous in size yet the author only manages 140 pages and two pages of non-specific bibliography and absolutely no notes. There is an enormous amount of 'filler' content, such as various list and quotes that are irrelevant to the argument. Speaking of the argument, the book has no clear thesis or coherent organization and is, therefore, completely useless in an academic setting. This is a 'must skip' book.

I had been contacted via email, as I am an astrophysics PhD candidate, by the author to look at it. I do not frequently discount a book by its cover. But, for this, I will make an exception. The book is discounting a theory (a set of facts, propositions, or principles analyzed in their relation to one another and used, especially in science, to explain phenomena) that has had supporting observations since the mid-1950's. (example WMAP) Do not give this author a bigger head by buying his non-credible book. A 450 page credible book to dismantle a long standing theory would have lots more than 5 technical illustrations.

Overall, I have been very happy with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I really love this product and use it on a regular basis. I cook meats, veggies, and fruits on it.

Well, I was very disappointed when I used it the first time and \\"tried\\" to grill pork chops. It took forever (much longer than the manual stated) and I had the temp setting at the highest. They finally did get done but were not very tasty and dried out because I had to cook them so long. My opinion is that because the grill is open on the bottom to the drip pan and the eating element is underneath....much of the heat goes down and not up to the food on top.It was, however, easy to clean which was good because I packed it up and shipped it back the next day.Sorry Delonghi, back to the drawing board."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"Purchased this a few months ago, and have had a chance to grill steak, chicken, fish and vegetables on it now. Works very, very well. A bit slower than the Foreman grills, but not enough to matter in terms of time. I think it cooks better than the Foreman(s) (I've had a few) and is a much better quality (the Foreman's fall apart easily) - and much easier to clean. I read some of the other complaints before I tried it: if you pre-heat per the instructions on the highest setting, and then adjust the temperature as needed, the meat browns very well. If you put a little water in the bottom each time, there is no smoking issue at all. Very good grill, very good price."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOES NOT HEAT UP","review":"I gave it two stars for its big grilling space, but if a grill doesn't serve its purpose, it is no good. I waited 10-15 minutes for the light to go out before I started cooking. I wanted to grill shrimps and hoped that it would take only few minutes for me get the dinner ready. The grill didn't heat up enough for the shrimp to cook. Instead, they became chewy because they were cooked on slow heat (5 max heat on the grill). I was extremely frustrated with the results. I read a lot of reviews before making this purchase. Many customers mentioned that this grill doesn't heat up and suggested that they must have gotten a defective piece. I don't think that many people received defective product. This grill just doesn't heat up. My husband said there is no need for the lid because grill doesn't heat up enough for anything to splatter. If anyone honestly knows a better product for indoor grilling, please recommend it to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just love it!","review":"We received our grill a few days ago and like it even more than we thought we would! It's a nice size, holds a good amount of food, and the drip pan sits at the bottom of the grill so there is no spilling at all. The grill itself has a lip on it to hold guard against food slipping off or grease splash or drip. The grill disassembles for very easy cleaning. I have used it every day since it's arrival. I'm going to recommend this to family and friends!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST THING I PURCHASED","review":"We bought this grill approx 4 years ago. The only thing that we ran into with the OLD MODELl is that the drop downs pan non-stick completely chipped off. The non-stick surface just started to come off, although it still heated up just like it was originally purchased and worked great.This model I just got is still the same original design which is great! Living in a place where we can't have propane or charcoal this is the best alternative. It is better than most electric grills that we have tried, even the high name brands that most people would think of first.this model is really the same, although a new thing they did was remove the non-stick surface on the drop down and make it completely stainless steel. Which means an easy clean! I do find that this item is REALLY easy to clean with some hot water in the sink and some soap with a bristle brush."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delonghi Perfecto Indoor Grill","review":"Really pleasant experience.

After preheating the suggested length of time, a 3/4\\" Delmonico steak took 10 minutes per side to cook to a medium rare stage, leaving only faint grill marks. Hamburgers turned out the same. I called Delonghi customer service and they were not at all helpful. I will not use it again to cook beef. Maybe chicken would fare better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delonghi BG24 Perfecto Indoor Grill","review":"Product works good. Some people say that it dose not get hot enough, others say that they don't pre-heat it enough. I agree that is not hot enough to grill a big steak.This grill is intended for chicken breast, fish, vegetables. It can't replace a gas grill, but it dose what is advertised for. I'll give it 4* because i'm happy with how it works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Grill","review":"Pros: The grill is much better than one of those grills that you close the lid on and squeezes the juices out. The grill is ideal for cooking boneless cuts of meats, sausages, and fish fillets. Grilling lines are easily achieved during searing. Results are the same as cooking on an outdoor gas grill.Clean up is relatively easy. Putting tin foil is better than adding water to the drip pan; it's harder to clean up/dispose of the water mess. You must have a good non- scratching brush for cleaning the grill surface.Cons: Only 1500 watts. Meats with bones do not cook evenly.Bottom line: Great indoor grill for certain types of meat, poultry, and fish/seafood (shrimp). Would recommend purchasing."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect grilling","review":"Delonghi BG24 Perfecto Indoor GrillI love this grill! A must have for all year around grilling.

Miles"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this iron!","review":"I read all the reviews - pros and cons - and was a little hesitant to order this but am so glad I did! I'm a quilter and this iron sits just to the right of my sewing machine and I press as I go. Someone said it doesn't get super hot - true - I never used to use steam and now I do - but I can forgive a lot not to have to deal with a cord. It is just very convenient and I like the auto shut-off for those absent minded moments. If I have any criticism, it is the base tends to 'shuffle' with repeated lifting and resetting of the iron so I have to adjust the position fairly often during a quilting session. But like I said, I can forgive a lot not to have to deal with a cord!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother with this product unless you have all day to iron","review":"I first tried this iron on a silk blouse at the low setting. The iron did not hold its heat long enough to to iron more than one side of the collar. It also was not hot enough to get out the wrinkles, even with steam. The steam does not work well at this setting. After 10 minutes, I was still not done with the blouse.I then tried the medium setting on a polyester blouse. The iron was marginally better and I got both sides of the collar done before returning the iron to the heating element. It required me to use added spraying to get the wrinkles out and the blouse was not that wrinkled.The high setting was a little better than the medium setting. I still needed extra spraying to get out the wrinkles and the results were no where near the quality of my old steam iron. If you do not need what you are ironing to look crisp and well-ironed, this product might work for you, but I would not bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the Oreck cordless","review":"I have had this iron for a month and so far, so good. I had the Oreck cordless and the major difference right off the bat is the weight of the Panasonic...much, much lighter than the (really) heavy Oreck. Time will tell if the Panasonic holds up to the demand I put on it. I am a machine quilter and the iron is used a lot! Owned the Oreck for about 5 years -- it \\"sprung a leak\\" and would throw hot water all over my work, the floor, the ironing board...what a hassle. Oreck will NOT repair their irons. Had the choice to either replace with another Oreck or try Panasonic (had better consumer reviews which helped me make this decision)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cordless","review":"Cordless.. that is what I like about it.One should know1. It needs to be replaced in to its base \\"very\\" frequently for constant heat. It loses heat qucikly once you start pressing.2. very convenient, this being cordless.3. Heat settings are low, med, high.. no intermediate settings. It bothers be sometimes, but I rarely press on anything but highThat's about it ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice design, but cools off way too fast","review":"This is my second cordless iron after my Maytag died suddenly few weeks back (lasted ~ 4 yrs). I chose this model given its higher wattage expecting faster heat. It may do so, but it cools off too fast and once off the cradle the light goes off and there is no indication if the iron is within the temperature range for the material.I'd go back to the Maytag for now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works very well and cord free is nice","review":"I replaced an old Panasonic corded iron, low end model. This works better meaning it heats faster and has a more aggressive steaming which are important to making it work fast and well. It is not the best iron I have used but it is works much better than the department store (Target, Walmart) kind of basic irons. A big step up and having no cord is certainly less annoying. Considering I'm usually ironing in a rush, less annoying is good. I'm satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Iron","review":"Readed reviews and love it. One thing cord could retract a little better. So easy to work with and irons smoothly ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Promising for not great","review":"I was very hopeful this would be a good purchase. It is definitely convenient being cordless but it just doesn't get hot enough. To get maximum heat, you just have to put it back on it's base and wait. Maybe I rearrange the garment too fast in between, maybe it just takes too long to get hot enough, maybe it just doesn't get hot enough, ever.Still keeping it. Returning and paying shipping just doesn't seem practical at this price range."},{"rating":"2","title":"Panasonic Iron","review":"My old Panasonic cordless iron finally wore out and since I liked it so well, bought another one. It's a great iron."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst iron I've ever used.","review":"I ordered the Panasonic cordless iron 2 months ago based largely on the good reviews here and I couldn't be more disappointed with my purchase. I'm baffled by the good reviews. How could anyone be happy with the performance of this iron? It works like the old fashioned black irons that people heated on wood stoves hundreds of years ago. Except this one doesn't hold heat like the ancient irons. Temperature control is non-existent and a ridiculous amount of time is wasted constantly reheating the iron. It seriously needs to reheat every few seconds, and even then it doesn't maintain a consistent temperature. I've already retired this 2 month old iron and purchased a new iron that is actually usable."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE it!!","review":"I love my cordless iron!!! No more fumbling with the cord in the way. Also, I love that the heat settings are controlled by the push of a button, instead of having to spin a wheel to get to the proper heat setting. This may seem trivial, but I do alot of piecing of fabrics for quilts, and so I am turning my iron on and off alot in between functions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Iron .. but","review":"I really wanted to love this iron. I do love it being cordless, it makes it very easy to use.. but since I am a quilter I need an Iron that is going to get hot enough to take the wrinkles and creases out of 100 % cotton, and this Iron just can not do that. That being said, while it is not the best iron for ironing yardage of cotton, it IS a fantastic option for keeping handy to press seams while piecing !"},{"rating":"1","title":"I sent it back!!!","review":"We needed a new iron and given the good reviews decided to buy this model.The charge doesn't last long enough to complete a short ironing session.Steam is very weak like if it wasn't there at all.I hate to return products, but my wife refused to use it after trying it a couple of times.Bottom line: if you want good results with your ironing I'd stay away from this model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Steam Iron doesnt work","review":"I realized a bit late that the steam iron didnt work.

Stays hot while ironing and reheats quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"This iron is fabulous!","review":"I an a quilter and collector of antique linens and fabrics. This iron, being cordless, permits easy ironing of all types of fabric. It holds it's heat very well, you only have to learn to place it back in the charger as you iron. The temperature and the steam dispersal are both excellent. I have had very expensive irons in the past, and they have leaked. This one does not, and the reservoir is easy to fill and holds a decent amount of water. The price is very reasonable for the value and quality of the iron.If you need a good iron, this is the one."},{"rating":"2","title":"great cordless","review":"I don't iron anything, but when I had my mother move in with me 3 months ago, she has been on my tail wanting me to wear things wrinkle free. and she requested a cordless iron. having lived in Japan for so many years, she only used cordless irons only last 10 years or so.I could not find any cordless in local stores, and reluctantly I got on from Amazon. but with name like Panasonic I don't think was going wrong.operation is simple, switches are logically organized (she does not read english, but with my instruction one time, she figured all out).it gives a good amount of steam (advise to any of you wanting to use the steam function, do use distilled water. this will keep you from having to clean out the iron, and also the iron will last for long time).my only slighly negative on the iron is the capacity of the water tank. As if with most of the irons, the water tank is tiny and you have to refill quite often which i find it annoying.other than that, this is a must-have. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"cordless convenient, functional not","review":"The vertical steam is useless, the cordless functions is convenient, however the ironing potential is very short it will iron an area no longer that the size of a sheet of paper before it cools again needing to be place back in the charging base. Therefore ironing with this iron takes longer, the great feature is that it goes off by itself when idol, making it great for seniors like myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Water Tank Leaks!!!","review":"This iron gets used on a daily basis. The iron itself works great and the cordless feature is really neat - and I would buy another cordless iron again - JUST NOT THIS ONE!The problem is, this is the second iron we have gone through because after a year of use the adhesive used for the water tank has failed (micro-cracks in the adhesive develop - leaking water like a sieve). This also occurred on our previous iron as well. I originally thought the leak was a fluke, so I replaced with the same NI-L70SR. Sure enough after 14 months of use, this tank has started to leak (right after the one year warranty - figures).Because it is past the one year warranty - Panasonic Customer Service said there was nothing they could do. There is also no option to purchase a replacement tank so you must replace the entire iron.Spending $60 - $75 on this iron, I would expect it to last longer than one year - so consider this when shopping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice for what it is","review":"This is a very convenient iron because it's cordless, obviously, so there's no cord impeding your chore. This makes ironing faster by allowing you to rotate the iron whichever way you want. Also, it makes packing up a breeze - just ditch the water and place the cover back on and you're done. The iron also feels smooth to move around your clothes which I like.Several things I didn't like so much is that it doesn't have as much heat as a corded iron. This means you'll have to iron many clothes right after you dry them and go over a crease more times. The second thing is that the capacity of the tank is pretty low. I find myself refilling the tank more often than other irons I've used.For a cordless iron, it's great. It gets the job done and I'm satisfied. It doesn't beat a corded iron though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Product","review":"The removable water carriage is a superior idea. Heats fast. And, of course, it is cordless.

Only a few of the stories can claim to involve elements of speculative fiction in any significant way, many of them are so similar in theme and structure it is hard to believe an editor had any input into selection, and much of the language ranges from baroque to fustian. While I read a lot of work by British authors, I can't recall ever being quite so lost in place-specific allusions. Harrison's references to the Midlands and northern England might as well be neighborhoods on Mars, although then I probably would not have felt like I was losing so much of the context.

I will survive is a sort of country version of destiny's child's song. Not the same lyrics or beat, but the same message.My favorite? \\"Don't give up\\"So why 4 stars. A couple of the songs have really annoying effects and \\"Honey\\" is the same four lines over and over and over again.

Especially \\"Prayer\\" and \\"Liberate\\". Those are two awesome songs. Here are my suitability ratings:The Explicit Version: Ages 15+ There are explicit lyrics in Liberate, so this is more for mature teens.The Clean (Edited) version: Ages 11+ The clean version instead of having a moment of silence, edits the CD by putting \\"MotherMother\\" instead which I think is cool.Parents get the clean version for your younger children if you don't like them listening to explicit lyrics.

First off, the sound is a lot more refined. They've also cut back on the electronics and they in general have more complicated guitar lines than in \\"the sickness.\\" It does a great job of getting in your face with tracks like prayer, liberate, intoxication, and rise.

Dr. Wider may think she is utilizing a chatty style that would make her book accessible to college women, but she comes across as condescending. Like a lot of health books on the market lately, her tone is alarmist: every bump is an STI, and every little thing just HAS to be checked out by a doctor. She doesn't show a lot of respect for women or their bodies. Nothing is ever normal. She keeps telling you all these things you \\"have\\" to do, rather than giving options or explaining why they might be beneficial. Every woman MUST get this shot. Every woman MUST have this test. I think it's really egotistical for a doctor to suggest that having a gynecological exam \\"makes you a woman.\\" Yes she really does say this!

Banjo is used to nice effect in some of the songs and the lyrics are as always well written. Honestly this does not hold up to the standards of the classic Strawbs songs to this 70's Strawbs fan.

It is philosophical, engaging, stimulating, and practical at the same time. Jim Percoco has been generous in sharing his insights, strategies, curriculum ideas and specific lesson plans. He also shares his enthusiasm for teaching history, which is highly motivating in itself. If you are interested in stimulating ideas for an interactive teaching style, this is the very best source to check. Give yourself some time to read and work with this material - you will be inspired and guided - and so will your students! I can't rate this source more highly. Anyone teaching American History today will want to be familiar with Percoco's ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"As a future teacher...","review":"All I can really say about this book is that it is so impractical. Percoco outlines many techniques that have worked in his classroom; the techniques range from giving students clay and allowing them to make whatever they like, without giving any historical context, to writing about their emotions associated with traveling over bridges, to discussing 90210 during a unit on World War II. I'm sure the book is great if you live in a district that allows teachers to set kids loose on field trips and arranges internships for each of them. I'm sure it's great if, like Percoco, you can hand-pick students for your class. Some ideas are usable,but for the most part, neither I nor anyone else in my class found it to be of much help."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Inspiration for a student teacher","review":"As someone about to enter her own history classroom for the first time, I found Mr. Percoco's book inspirational, encouraging, and NECESSARY!

If you like to keep those spare sticks low on the hi-hat stand at a steep angle for quick retrieval, this will likely bother you just a little bit; if you use this holder in a more vertical orientation you'll never notice it.

Although they state clearly that UML is purely notational and does not imply/condone any particular methodology, they proceed to introduce a \\"generic\\" methodology of their own, and spend most of the book explaining it and using it to develop a simple \\"application\\".Without doubt the most dissappointing thing about this book (to me) is the joke of an application developed by the authors. For a book subtitled \\"The Developer's Guide, with a Web-based application in Java\\", I actually laughed out loud a few times at example source code.Sorry, guys, this book could've and should've been much, much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best to start with UML and Java.","review":"This book makes UML simple and easy to use.

For instance, McKinney, an apparent fan of the big-budget turbo Porsches, asserts that the McLaren team was lucky to win the 1971 series. This is obviously a second-hand impression that contradicts well-known racing facts as presented, for instance, in Pete Lyons' excellent Can-Am books. The turbo Porsches were fascinating but actually inefficient and heavy pieces of machinery.This book is written from a biased viewpoint since the McLaren team won 8 of 10 events in 1971 and Revson beat Stewart, who at the time was at the top of his form. Also, the book's organization and layout are unbalanced as the size of the photos and text placement vary in an erratic fashion, giving a less than professional appearance.

I use it in all my international news classes at Scripps School of Journalism. Rosenblum extracts from his lifetime of journalism a clear, logical and comprehensive explanation of how the story you read got there, and what influences affected its selection and presentation at every stage of the process. It's also a fascinating and exciting read, by one of the world's most prolific and professional journalists. He introduces you to individual correspondents, both as individuals and as types. He explains how geography, economics and sheer prejudice can determine what you learn about the world. He tells great bar stories -- the kind of thing journalists tell each other over a beer. And he does it all with skill and style. Worth reading by anyone -- a must for anyone interested in news."},{"rating":"2","title":"OEM Serpentine Belt replacement for 2007 Pontiac Vibe","review":"I purchased this serpentine belt for my wife's 2007 Pontiac Vibe.

It is also a rather engaging, quick read and contains many interesting kernels of information. This combination makes it the most un-intimidating introduction to bird watching I have read. Wildlife watching is often frustrating, but searching for these birds is rewarding whether one lives in the country or the city. This is not one of those books that overwhelm readers with lists and pictures of species beginners will probably not see. Simonds' love of birds is apparent, even though he digresses a bit too much.Although the book does contain an index, information would be easier to find if the chapters were subdivided.

Basically, it's a great sweatband.NEGATIVE: It's few inches too long if you tie it with a square knot, as it will leave two \\"tails\\" of about eight inches hanging like a ponytail. The length is about right if you tie a bow in back, which seems a little...I dunno...flouncy, I guess.NOTE: If you purchase this product through Amazon, make sure the seller doesn't charge you a fortune in shipping costs.

However, more solutions are required to make it of any real value. Sallas, Hille, and Etgen's Calculus of one and several variables, is one such title that works in the students favour. In the solution manual, every odd numbered question is solved. Furthermore, the ones that are not solved are some form of that ones that are. This makes it a great companion for a student. With vector calculus, however, there seems to be no emphasis on helping the student. Usually, the easy questions are solved and sometimes they are done in obscure ways. If one is absolutely lost, this book may be useful. Otherwise a good study group could probably come up with better solutions.One last point; the study hints are somewhat condescending. There seems to be the assumption that the student has no intelligence.

I am mostly into somewhat heavier stuff (Staind, Mudvayne, Chevelle, Disturbed, etc.), but something about the cd just hit me.Anyways, this cd (which is actually they're fourth, they had two independant releases before \\"Where You Are\\") continues on that great sound. Neil Alday is one the most talented men in the music industry today.I've been listening to Touch the Sky for awhile, as it has been up on myspace for awhile. The song is very upbeat, lyrically sound, and probably my favorite on the album. While all songs on the cd are very good, I would also recommend checking out Love Hate, Leaving Song, Cold Night, and the newest version of I'm Happy (previously released on \\"Where You Are,\\" and the independant release \\"What A Beautiful Waste.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep your an eye on these guys!","review":"This album is the kind you pop in while driving to rock out to! I became a loyal fan when I heard SocialBurn back in 2003 when they dropped, \\"Where you are\\". This newest cd, \\"The Beauty of Letting Go\\" impressed me even more. I love the way Nail Alday's (lead singer) voice has improved on this album. I love the deepness he has in his voice and lyrics. The track \\"Get Out Alive\\" is a song I listen to when I want to escape and indulge in music! I love this band! SocialBurn should be respected by all because of this latest album.

I have a bike mount for my eTrex that is a clam shell set up with a set screw and I much prefer that because you can move it around all you want just by loosening the screw.I got 2 of these so I could have one on both bikes. I have read reviews of 305's flying off of these mounts on rough roads and I even talked to a guy who said that it happened to him.

The songs themselves are not necessarily bad, but they are saddled with a produciton that includes nearly every cheesy disco cliche in the book. I suppose it worked at the time, but now it sounds horribly dated and makes for a painful listening experience. If you are new to Solomon Burke, this album will leave you with the wrong impression.

If you break through the dreadful disco sounds, you will find Solomon's versatile and flexible voice, and you will also find his most soulful performances among his works in the 70s. And Jerry Williams Jr. aka Swamp Dogg (except tracks 3-5) generally did earthier and tougher treatment even in the uniformed disco era.

This book is brilliant. It is more than just an overview of full contact defense for women and children, it's a manual for changing lives. Can you imagine what it might be like for a woman not to be afraid to walk down the street for the first time in her life? Snortland's mix of hard facts, biting humor and keen passion make this concise book a joy to read. When she's not shocking you out of your stupor, she's knocking you off your seat and making you roll on the floor doubled up with laughter. It should be on the mandatory list for every college freshman. Female and male. For women, it's a transformational door to the possibility of being safely dangerous. For men, it's notice that there are now consequences for violence towards women.

Another book which exemplifies that feeling is the \\"End of Affluence\\". Some of the credit for our IMPROVEMENT over the predicted results belong to the President (Clinton) and the Congress (both parties). One significant MILESTONE was that the home ownership rate reached record levels (especially amongst minorities)in the 90's.The author Katherine Newman did a great job at telling person stories of baby boomers and their children and their predicted plight.

If you really want something Herrmann-esk from Silvestri then What Lies Beneath is more like what you are looking for.Sorry but I listened to this score once and never listened to it again. He experimented much like James Horner did on The Forgotten and it come's out sounding too odd. It just doesn't quite work. Both these scores have something in common; they will bore you to death, very mediocre scores.

It has a pleasant challenge to it, it took me quite some time to finish, but I enjoyed every minute of it. The picture on the box is detailed enough to help one find a needed area but not detailed enough to give anything away. That the pieces are oddly-shaped really adds to the fun and intrigue of it all. I always looked forward to working on it, even if I only got a few pieces to fit, every one felt like a victory.I find working with ordinary puzzle-piece-puzzles not as much fun as this. I've put together 2 Springbok puzzles so far & getting ready for #3. I'm sticking with Springbok. The pieces hold together firmly, there is no mistaking what fits where and if I cluster a few, I can move them easily to where they belong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatly organized and an easy learn","review":"If you have spare time, this language is unique and interesting, and full of culture.

I purchased this course in hopes of learning Catalan while driving. It is not intended for this application, and it doesn't work while driving. Without the book, it's a long slew of Catalan, no English, and no repetition. By contrast the Pimsleur system (they don't have a Catalan course that I could find) builds language skills slowly, repeating all words in English, then the other language.In some sense, this is an unfair review.

He added as little of his own ideas as possible, even if his reticence sometimes left very bare orchestral bones in terms of harmony and secondary lines. As for those who followed, Wheeler, Carpenter, and Mazzetti to varying degrees stepped over the line, trying to pose as Mahler impersonators with unacceptable intrusions of their own.The worst is surely Carpenter, which makes this CD a dismal experience--the man has no idea, apparently, how sub-Mahlerian his retouchings actually are. The clogging of counterpoint and filling out of orchestration are cumbersome. This performance is quite forgettable and regrettable, but so are all the sets I've heard that present any other Mahler Tenth except for the Cooke."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"I found this book at a used bookstore around 20 yrs ago. Didnt know it was from Dayton, Ohio area til the store owner told me. Ive read it at least 3 times. Its a great book. Always interesting to read about something that happened in your hometown.

If you run your dryer full speed hot (like I do) to dry your hair you MUST blow it out at the lowest heat setting for at least 30 seconds.

They have returned to their Italian roots but they've maintained English songs for the sake of us English-speaking people, and what a masterpiece this album is. Every song is beautiful. There's not a dull song on the whole album. Even the remixes are incredible, proving how talented these men are. \\"Living in My City\\" is an extremely deep and wonderful song written by Maurizio Lobina and it blends guitar sounds with the dance style Eiffel 65 is so famous for. The song \\"The World Inside My Bedroom\\" is probably my favorite on both discs, and at one point this song moved me to tears. No lie. Jeffrey's voice is flawless, and when he is given the chance to sing so passionately in this song, it touches my heart so deeply.

It is a showcase of the band's breadth, which runs from traditional American (\\"Cotton-Eyed Joe\\"), to traditional Scottish (\\"Queen of Skye\\"), to original ballad (the heartbreaking \\"Black Smoke Train\\"), to brilliant string-band instrumentalism (\\"Ryan's/Jordan's Reel\\") to the stone zany (\\"Hiawatha's Lullaby\\").The Ramblers don't tour much anymore (except in theatrical productions that they write), which is a shame. If you go back and listen to some of their vinyl albums, you will hear a similar unwillingness to be type-cast as one sort of band or another.

The authors cover exhaustively the field of wireless LANs. Whatever your interest within this communications space, you should be able to find a detailed explanation of it here. Typically along with a good set of citations of research papers and texts.The various standards are explained in a manner that should be more comprehensible than the official standards documents, which are usually bureaucratically opaque.The coverage of security of the network is carefully done. Compared to wired nets, a wireless net is often far more vulnerable to undesired probing and usage. Hence the protracted discussion of how to bolt things down.The book is well suited for engineers and researchers wishing to implement a LAN or for those investigating new types of wireless nets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Think twice - do your homework first","review":"I recently purchased the Andis Deluxe Pet Clippers and they are not very good.

This is a very nice CD which I thoroughly enjoyed. I really heard of De-PHazz from different compilations, from Brazilectro volume 1 that kicked off with a nice remix of The Mambo Craze to Hotel Costes. After those two, I figured I'd take a stab at getting this album and I wasn't disappointed.The album sort of goes on, melodically, and has some very interesting musical arrangements and samples. The style is hard to express, but I'd label it more along the lines of Cafe/Lounge. Imagine going to a nice bar, having a chat with someone and this would be playign in the background really. It's upbeat and sweet - some horns, smooth vocals, strings and percussion. Good music!So I'd recommend it. If you like the Hotel Costes scene (Estage 3 especially), you'll enjoy this one... or if you like the Boss-A-Troniq Vol II, you'll probably like this too.

I don't think it is out of print, as I bought my copy at a music store less than a year ago.The transcriptions contain a good representation of the Harlem Stride style of the 20's and 30's, and they are exact transcriptions of the original recordings.Also included is a brief overview of the history of Stride piano and biographies of most of the important figures in the genre. A short introduction precedes each of the solos in the collection. A discography and bibliography will direct the reader to further resources."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good ol' American food...","review":"Having lived in California for most of my life, I am quite used to the trendy, healthy cuisines with costly ingredients you've never heard of. This book was a nice change. The idea is that all of the recipes have ingredients you could even purchase in a local grocery store in Oklahoma - where the author originates. I bought this book on a whim because it was in the clearance section of my local book store. I paid full price for the Italian version because the original was so great.Rohde has given helpful tips in the front of the books for cutting fat out of recipes. Each recipe has the fat content and preparation time. The one thing that could use some improvement is cutting the use of refined sugar in the dessert section. Also, since Rohde is from the south I am guessing I won't see a vegetarian version anytime soon - too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"A useless book if you don't live in the United States","review":"I am an American living abroad and found this book near impossible to use because of the ingredients called for...fat-free cheese, fat-free salad dressing, Butter Buds, Lite Cool Whip??? I have therefore NEVER used this book. And I don't see what is so impressing anyway. If I really wanted to, I could take my Joy of Cooking and replace all the fatty ingredients to \\"fat-free\\" and use more spices instead of butter for flavor. Maybe this is a good book for those who are totally clueless about cooking and health, but other than that I wouldn't recommend it. It has been sitting on my shelf for 3 years, collecting dust. I think it's finally time I threw it out and made space for a better cookbook."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you are crazy about planes,it's for you.","review":"It came in long box-envelope but and it was damaged a little bit,I don't know when it happened.I bought it for my friend who is a pilot,he liked it very much!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Channoine - Worth the Hype?","review":"This new product line just popped up on ShopNBC and Amazon. They played up their cult following in Europe on ShopNBC (complete with rep with accent) but I have not been able to find 1 review on the web for this product. Given the pricing, I would not buy until someone, somewhere can tell me whether it is worth it. Their own site sounds more like an AVON pitch (be your own boss, blah, blah, blah) so that makes me leery of the truthfullness of their \\"luxury\\" tag line (with apologies to AVON but they know their market and don't price out of it).

The characters are cool, and the locations are neat. For example, the character's names (such as Treestump, Skywise, Cutter, Rayek, and Winowill) are interesting. The artwork is great because of the shading and the dimensional work. When warriers are fighting and strange things are happening the characters say things like \\"I'LL CUT OUT YOUR GUTS AND ROAST 'EM IN THE FIRE PIT!\\" and the trolls say \\"BY GRAYMUG'S BLACKENED BONES!\\" and the humans say \\"YOU'RE BOUND FOR NOWHERE BUT THE DOOM PIT!\\".

This single recently reached #1 on the US dance charts and it is well deserved. It's catchy beat, the bittersweet lyrics, and an excellent set of remixes make it one of the Spring-Summer dance anthems without a doubt. It is great to see Tina Arena having another hit in the US, given that she has a lot of talent that has been (unfortunately) ignored due to poor promotion on the part of her label (with their misguided attempts to turn her into the \\"next Celine Dion,\\" instead of taking advantage of her charm and vocal power).The best mix is definitely DJ Tiesto's. This is one CD single that is worth buying as it will remain a house classic for years to come. I only hope that Tina gets a new US deal after the success that this track has enjoyed."},{"rating":"2","title":"SUPREME DANCE TRACK","review":"This is one of the best dance track ever release in the past few years, wow Tina Arena injects such melancolic vibration and her voice it's unmistakeable SUPREME, the lyrics are other great + for this winning track, the remixes are well done.

For instance it tells you how installing programs works, which is surprisingly very different from Windows, and it gives you step by step instructions on doing basic things like that.Although this book is good at showing you how to do things you once did in other operating systems - which may be good enough at first - I felt undereducated. It didn't really tell you how the core of Linux works.

They are pretty thick too. I like the way they feel. They are great to use for burp clothes and I would buy more. My only concern is that after I washed them for the 1st time they shrunk considerably from the size they were out of the package. The size after washing is still great for use a burp cloth, but, I would think that they may be too small for use as an actual cloth diaper, esp as the baby gets a little bigger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Disappointment","review":"I put these on our baby registry, but didn't bother to read any reviews on them.

I would NEVER knowingly buy anything made in PAKISTAN and I would NEVER use anything like that especially for my baby. I try to buy things only made in USA, but do make exceptions for things made in Canada, Europe, and a couple other places that are trustworthy. Needless to say, these diapers are being returned. I'm not upset with Amazon, they are handling the return very well, but I do think that Amazon should require the disclosure of product origin within the product description!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not great for diapering","review":"While these may make good burp cloths as others have commented, they are not the best for diapering. They are basically flannel diapers and after just a few washes they have already begun to \\"pill\\". They also aren't the ideal size as they are very long and need to be folded in the back as compared to other diapers. They are also very thin (but dense). If you're looking for cloth diapers, a better choice would be the traditional Chinese prefolds.

There are a lot of 6-10 mile hikes with elevation gain, which is exactly what I'm looking for. The directions are always great and the trail descriptions are always right on. The only thing that I don't really like about this book is the extensive description of trees and plants for every hike - more than half the description focuses on the plant life that you will see during the hike. I love hiking with my botanist friends because they can point out interesting plants and trees to me while we are hiking. But without pictures of all of these interesting things, I'm not going to try to identify them on my own and so I just skip all of this in the text. But that's really a minor quibble.

I got it of a friend, so I had to learn all of the controls without an instruction book. Now THAT is challenging. When I learned to play, however, I realised that this game could not have been made less complex than it is without slicing away some important pieces of the gameplay. The complexity is fascinating in itself, and the fact that the game is turn-based provides a relaxed feeling which is well needed in the current computer game climate. Alpha Centauri is an amazingly good game, on the border to perfection. It's time consuming, no doubt, but anyone with a bit of patience has countless hours of interesting gaming ahead of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hope you have lotsa time on your hands.","review":"This game has a super thick book full of instuctions and with everything there is to control, build, and change, this game can be overwhelming. It takes forever to learn what each function is and to read the instruction book. This game is a case of a little too much. A friend I work with had played Civilization 2 which is another Sid Meier game that did exceptionaly well, but after he played this game for 2 weeks, he gave up. there was just too much stuff to learn and what certain things did was not clearly described which left alot of guessing. What he and I did learn while playing the game was that the story was good, the graphics are good, and the game was well thought out. But the overwhelming things you had to learn just took it's toll which probably explains the lackluster sales of this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd give it negative stars if I could.","review":"I've played every game by Sid Myers and I've loved them all. I've spent years of my life playing Civilization and its sequals, so I was very excited when SMAC was announced and I promptly bought it.This game - despite all hype to the contrary - is one of the worst ever made. Technically, the diplomacy model is as bad a anything in Civ, the graphics are extremely poor, and the planet will rise up against you no matter how green and harmonious your faction is. The plot is something right out of a hippie's drug-enduced dreams of eutopia and does its best to be a far-left political statement no matter how you try to play it, even to the point of hamstringing factions that don't agree with extremeist athiest and environmental views.I gave it a fair shake regardless, and beat it with most factions, but the plot structures that it forces on you limit replayability and the game is just an eyesore. Skip the game and hope that Civ 3 won't follow the same disastrous path."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its ok","review":"This game is complex its not even fun to find out all the options. What is anoying is that when u in middle of the game u have so many units and u have to give a command to every single one of them, yes u can automize them but that will do no good to ur military units. Some times if ur lucky the gamefun will be 3 stars but most of the levels i played turnd out to be boring either i lost fast or it was 2 easy. Also sometimes when the game is over anyways and one of the leaders has clearly won, the game still goes on for an hour. Dont forget the game is more then 3 years old get something better for ur money for example:\\"Warlords Battlecry\\" or \\"Cossaks European Wars\\". I dont recommend this game though its not catastrophic either!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Bad!","review":"This game looked really good for the price, but IT DIDNT WORK! I changed my PC but still having problems with TERRAN or whatever that is. Maybe I'll try it again"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst games yet!","review":"I wish there was a -1 to rate it. This game is the worst game I have ever played in my life! You may think it's not all that bad, but once you actually get into this game, and have lots of units to control, it becomes very boring, and time consuming. You have to watch Every Single unit on the entire screen move its little squares. I have got to give them credit for making the game, but they needed to spend just a little more time on it! To tell you the truth, I wouldn't have even wanted this game if I got it for free based on my experiance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Okay Game","review":"I got this game in the December of 2000. I think it's okay. One of the things i like are the communications. You can talk to other faction leaders on the phone and you choose waht you want to say. One more thing. If you get bored playing after a while you play it later and you like it. I think you should get this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oops!","review":"Suckered by the glowing reviews already on file, I bought this book, but was immediately alarmed to note numerous typos and weird grammatical errors.

It is not an Ipod but for around $70 it's a great deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it!","review":"I received this player for free from Dell when I ordered a laptop. When I finally used it, the battery life was really short, the screen is too small & difficult to read, and menu navagation is a pain in the butt. I also had to 'reset' the device often. This player lasted less than three months before it died. I'm glad I didn't fork out any money for it, otherwise I would really be upset. I would never buy this product or recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply Made Piece of Crap","review":"My reason for buying this was because my mom had accidentally put my old DJ ditty through the washing machine, a week later, i got my brand new one, it was a complete piece of crap! when I turned it on and put my headphones in, 85% of the screen would go to black & the sound only came out in 1 ear bud, finally after a week, I went to Fred Meyer and bought a Phillips Go Gear RaGa, they are much better than the ditty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless piece of junk!","review":"Shortly after I purchased it from Dell it began having communication problems with my computer. Sometimes it did not recognize the unit, sometimes you could not load music on to it. Now, it is completly non fuctioning. I tried to load the latest firmware from Dell, but the installer could not find the unit, even when the computer saw it. But regardless of the status, it would not sync with Media Player. I have reset it many times without results. Most recently, it will not shut off. It just shows a diagram of a computer with arrows going tho a musical note. I keep thinking that I will figure out what the problem is, but for now, it just sits in my file cabinet gathering dust. I have a very old Memorex MMP3642 that still works fine. I just upgraded it with 2 Gigs of memory and it fuctions better than the Ditty ever did. This must be the reason Dell got out of the MP3 player business."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works great--until it dies","review":"Prospective purchasers should take the following points into account1) DELL expects the battery to last from 1 to 3 years, and2) there is no way to replace the battery.I thought this was a great little product until one day, about six months after the warranty expired, it just died.I would not buy another one and I would not recommend anyone else doing so unless you're prepared to buy another in 18 months to 2 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNK !!","review":"If I could give this thing 0 stars I would !! It is a total piece of \\"Ca ca.\\" Bought it brand new on eBay. The F.M radio worked fine - but when I tried to play music files there was NO SOUND. I updated the firmware for it - still no sound. STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE !! As I type this I am listening to music on a Creative Zen Stone 1 MB player, which I highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusted","review":"I like others received the DJ Ditty free with a Dell computer I purchased this year. What my 1 star will represent is the fact that it came 'free' with the purchase. I thought it was me trying to figure out how this thing should work, but it was not. I was able to load some music, however like another reviewer a month or so later, it stated that the license had expired. I then decided to sit down with this thing and figure it all out, nothing worked, FM Radio, Time and Day etc. I've never seen anything like this, it's a piece of junk. I tossed it and purchased an Apple Ipod."},{"rating":"1","title":"Screen Broke twice","review":"I have had a difficult time getting various computers to recognize it in the USB. Then the screen went out and so they sent me another one. The display stopped working on that one to but by then it had been 90 days so no returns."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective Product","review":"My girlfriend got this free with her computer. She loved it when it was working because she only used it for radio, but when I used it for mp3's the interface was pretty annoying. Last week the battery started expanding and the back popped open. The battery no longer holds a charge. Called Dell and they said the warranty was up, sorry. I noticed another reviewer had the same problem, so unless you have a burning desire to get a $20 refund when someone finally brings a class action suit for selling a defective product, don't buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"I second all the reviews that say not to waste your time. I have had nothing but problems with this and I have had two different units. Even when it was working, which was rare, it was difficult to use. The navigation buttons are next to impossible to use - and I have small fingers - and the power button got stuck all the time. I too experienced monumental problems getting support and got the run around when I wanted to return it. I returned the original only to find it did not work any better and to be informed that the replacement was out of warranty, even though I specifically asked when the replacement was shipped if the warranty period would start over. This got one star only because zero isn't an option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good until warranty expired...","review":"I bought the Ditty because it is small and light and I was tired of running with my big Dell Jukebox. It really is a great mp3 player except that it stopped working about a month after the warranty expired. I wouldn't recommend anyone buying it. I never even dropped the thing, and it now fast-forwards the whole time it's on. It doesn't even have the option to fast-forward, so I don't really understand what happened. For $100 I'm pretty mad. Of course, since it broke I've gone back to using my Dell Jukebox (which I've had for about 3 years) and it has broken too. I'm switching to Apple!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ditty Mp3","review":"Dear All,I have still not received my Mp3 Ditty. Where is it?

True, Rob Laufer and company do a great Within You Without You. And you do need different singers while going from She's Leaving Home(a fantastic performance by Zander) to Mr. Kite. But while Zander is in McCartney's league as a vocalist, Ian Ball leaves a lot to be desired. Lovely Rita and When I'm 64 would have come off a lot better if sung by Zander as well. Still this is an excellent addition to any Beatles collection and I can only hope that Cheap Trick can someday soon do the same for Abbey Road (with some added tracks from Let It Be)and Magical Mystery Tour (with added tracks from Yellow Submarine and the White Album)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have for all Cheap Trick Fans","review":"All Cheap Trick fans will want to add this CD/DVD to their collection.

In this case I am referring to Cheap Trick. The Beatles certainly received and are still receiving the acclaim they deserve, & Cheap Trick had a few periods where they were recognized for their talents, however it is sad how they are immensely overlooked most of the time. Simply put for this album, no one can do the Beatles better than Cheap Trick. Please note Cheap Trick's other 2009 new album released only a couple months prior, \\"The Latest\\" is also a fabulous album filled with exceptional original material.

A mathematician I am not. So, the food didn't fit, but I liked the container so much I wasn't about to send it back. It is now my new, and best, kitchen trash container. The seal is so strong, I can't smell a thing. Trash bags fit nicely and the container fits perfectly under the counter. If I had more room in my kitchen, I'd leave it out because it's cute and sleek. As for my dog's food, I bought the 30-33 quart IRIS (see review)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compact - but truly airtight?","review":"This product is a great size for storing the food for a small dog who does not go thru food very fast. I can't really tell if it is airtight because it seems our dog loses interest in the food over time. He is much more interested in eating it when the bag is first opened.

I bought one of these to store it in. The design is all wrong for cats because they jump up on it and it tips over very easily. After the first accident I took the wheels off. After the second accident I realized that because the bottom was narrower than the top it was prone to tipping if it wasn't full.

I go through dog food like it's nobody's business so I like to buy two large bags of dog food at a time (lasts me about three weeks). With the rate of consumption, freshness is not really a problem (at least, I don't think it is). I've had these rolling foodbins for ages, but Wal Mart doesn't stock them anymore so I went to amazon and got these air tight ones. The bins a little on the short side (my old one was waist high, this one's thigh high) but it holds the food easily, keeps the bugs out and rolls smoothly. All of my old food bins (different brands) have gone out the window because the wheels break off- that's to be expected, but they typically last between 2 to 3 years with moderate use.The Iris container is made very well and I love the latching lid part of it.

Mind you that I didn't roll the container around or put too much weight in the container. The container was stationary except once in a week when I moved it around to mop the area.

I will bet in a few months that the unit breaks after pushing and pulling since the plastic is sort of brittle.

The container is easy to roll around and holds a 40lb bag of dog food with room to spare. The reason one star was taken away is the seal is shipped locked in the lid. What this means is the seal is crimped between the lid and the container, deforming it. The purchaser is required to install the seal themselves.

I was a bit worried when I read that the wheels can break off, but I have had no such problem and feel that it was due to user error. Slide the bags of food into the containers, don't dump them in. But if you don't need to move it, don't put on the wheels! They are great! They hold a whole bag and are easy to roll! The food stored in the garage no longer gets chewed by mice or attracts roaches!

Seem to be very sturdy and I like the lockable lid with the hinge. Was not expecting that. Just hope the hinge holds up. As for the wheels, a little disapointed in them. There were no instructions with it when it came so I can only assume holes need to be drilled into the bottom of the unit to fit the wheels as there was no other hardware or obvious indication of how to attach the wheels.

They seem quite airtight, though when we get down to the last couple of inches of food our cats still get kind of finicky about eating, so I think the food is getting a little stale.

Equally important is the author's personal story, intertwined with Pirip Kuru's, which reveals not only the deepening of McCollum's understanding of Pirip's life and circumstances, but of her own life as well.

(Other reviewers have done a great job of the storyline, so I'll pretty much skip over that....)Anyhow, I found myself practically holding my breath the last 10 pages, when Caro finally decides to burn the place down. I found myself saying \\"you go, girl!\\". And her last conversation with Richard was riveting. I have chills just thinking about it. For a short book, it was incredibly intense, building up from practically Caro's first week there, to the end......

Spencer is left in a rest home by her brother and callous sister in law. She commits to writing her cruel experiences in a journal. She reflects of how she lived her life and contemplates on the harsh and humiliating treatment that the nursing staff give the elderly in the home. She displays rightous indignation at the neglect and callous treatment on the elderly by the nursing staff and by society at large. This novel makes the reader realize how much society has neglected our elderly and basically abandoned our elderly love ones. Sarton writes with great skill.

It is not for the student who really takes it serousily to learn Indonesian in to the deep.

Because they use phrases to every word you learn and the words keep repeating over time, you can memorize such words quite easily.I would advise to have a native speaker to help you though. My girlfriend is Indonesian, so I sometimes try to speak in Indonesian with her what I've read and just combined to what I wanted to say.

In the dictionary, in the appendix, it lists words such as 'intent','sponge' and 'alliegance', but not 'stop', 'bathroom tissue' or 'hungry'.

Another good aspect Lebron Brothers bring to the table is their colorful as well as conscientious lyrics that you can either relate to or make you reflect on the world and how people act. I have listened to 10 of 29 L.B. albums and this one is easily the best one. The only slight slip up is \\"Anda en el Aire\\" a less than spectacular bolero, but the rest of the tracks more than make up for it. This is definitely a MUST for any Lebron Brothers fan.

Meanwhile his father is dealt obstacle after obstacle and never once lets anything slow him down. I think all of us can relate to being in the place where Steven gets stuck and it is rare for that place to be described so truthfully. I liked that in the end Steven does get out, but there's no big loud finale with him finally taking a chance and making it on Broadway-- he just pulls himself up by the bootstraps and finds new ways to love his life wherever it takes him. Like father like son."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorrentino serves up a moving memoir with Luncheonette.","review":"Sorrentino's first book is a funny and moving account of one man's journey through life's unexpected detours. The Luncheonette in question is filled with a memorable and hysterical cast of characters. But even more memorable is Sorrentino's journey from chorus boy to caretaker after his father suffers from a catostrophic illness.With echos of Sedaris and Burroughs,but with a voice all its own, Luncheonette is proof that truth is often stranger (and funnier ) than fiction. It's a great remedy for the winter blahs."},{"rating":"1","title":"A personal memoir, though cliche and boring","review":"While Steven Sorrentino writes a personal memoir of the relationship between his luncheonette and his father (the metaphor repeatedly slaps the reader in the face), the reader is busy waiting for something to \\"happen.\\" The Sorrentino memoir seems more of a posthumous personal documentation of a father-son relationship than a novel for the mass market. Nothing truly happens, and the cliche and stereotypical characters become tedious to read. Can we watch the Soprano's for this form of regionalism? Would have been more effective if the author was not trying to expand the metaphor of the luncheonette to mirror the relationship between father and son. It seems a tiresome stretch; nevertheless, if Sorrentino feels compelled and pleased with a journal-like memory of his father, good for him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice easel","review":"Nice wood, nice smell, not to big but perfect for a smaller studio.

The self-closing action is a bit loud, but you know it is closed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gate","review":"This is a great gate. I needed a pressure fit gate, but wanted a walk-through. Looking at the reviews, I settled on this one. I'm very happy with it. It set up pretty quickly, and only worked when set up correctly (a plus). Easily opens with one hand, and I also like that it shuts itself -- once you walk through, you can let go and it swings until it catches -- great when you have a wiggly baby in your arms! Good for top of stairs or any doorway. I would definitely recommend this gate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Latch is Cheap","review":"Overall I like this gate, it looks nice and works pretty well, but the latch is made out of pretty cheap plastic.

I was planning on using it on the door opening to my child's nursery as she is crawling a lot now and I want to keep her in her room to play most of the time. I guess my doorway opening are not perfectly aligned or my floors are crooked but I could never get this gate to close.

We didn't get a chance to try this gate becuase the box arrived without the upper locking set, rendering it useless. Most likely it had been returned by another customer who didn't care, as long as they received their refund. I will now only purchase toys, etc. online because I can't stand having to return things! For baby gates and similar items, we will go to a store and visually inspect before purchasing, rather than rely on other parties to ensure all pieces are included."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really easy to install, works great","review":"Very happy with this product. The black version is as stylish as a great big metal gate in your doorway can get, is very easy to open one handed, and the swing-shut mechanism works every time. Installation is a breeze with the double-sided tape, and the overall effect is sturdy. One criticism is that the warning labels on the floor bar are an eyesore, are stuck on with superglue and will not peel off. We need to get some goo-be-gone, which is an annoyance and the only reason this didn't get 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"looks nice but not durable","review":"I have four children, one of which the gate is for. My 8 and 6 yr olds have no problem with using the gate and my 3 and 16 m old can not. I installed it correctly and easily. It looks great. At first I loved it, especially the one hand swing close mechanism. The first week my 3 yr old got a finger pinched trying to figure out the top latch. We moved past that, since I tightened it a bit more. All was well until recently. It swings close on one side but not the other as other reviews mentioned. The problem lies within the bottom latch. We have only had this gate 3 MONTHS!! This is unsafe in my opinion. My 16M has made it to the stairs a few times and to the top of the stairs before we have gotten to her. Not good since she thinks she can stand and walk up the last step. Because I homeschool, this gate gets a lot of use and just isn't doing what it is suppose to. Now I will have to replace it. I would not recommend for high traffic area and for saftey issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"closes but doesnt lock, not good for pets","review":"i bought this item (i actually purchased two) because i needed to keep some dogs from going into a specific room. while the dogs are respectful of the gate, which is indeed sturdy, i am very concerned. the latching mechanism is rather lacking in design. a tiny piece of plastic locks the gate closed. and YES, i installed the gate properly. the margin between locked and unlocked is not well defined, and i have found that when the gate swings closed it does not lock many times. perhaps i misread the selling points. it says that the gate closes. and indeed it does. but it does NOT say that it locks when it closes which pretty much defeats the purpose of the gate swinging closed by itself. i cannot trust this gate and will be forced to purchase a different one from a different manufacturer. Lesson learned...$110 dollar mistake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gate","review":"The gate work perfect, I couldn't use it at the top of my stairs but in the hallway before you get to the stair is just as good, this way it will stop my granddaughter before they get to the stairs...

After I installed the first one, it was super easy to put the other ones in. Also, I like that it automatically came with gate extenders and wall protection covers. I opted to use the double-sided sticky rings rather than the screws and they are very secure. Not only do they work well with the baby but they also work well with our dog."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Gate","review":"Love this gate. Only problem is putting it in a walkway that is 55\\" wide...the description claims that it can cover up to 60 something inches.

Worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good item","review":"This is the second dreambaby gate that I bought for my one year old. The first one was the tall gate for the top of the stairs and this is a regular one for the bottom of the stairs. It is very easy to assemble and it fits well in standard size hallways/doorways.The only thing is that I like the tall one much better, even though it seems like the shorter one would be more comfortable... its the exact opposite, you dont have to bend down to open it with the baby in your arms unlike with the short one. This product is great, but I would recommend the tall gate over the short one."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE!","review":"We've had this gate through two houses and two babies and it's so great. We had it in a hallway in a previous house and it was great for keeping both our dogs and kids from going where we didn't want them. We have 4 cats too and they are all able to jump right over this. Now, with a 7 month old and a 2 1/2 year old I can't sing the praises enough. It's at the top of the stairs going into a recessed family room and it's so easy. I can open with my foot and push open with my knee while holding my baby and a bottle/toy/etc. And it's VERY strong when installed correctly. While we dissuade our daughter from hanging on it (she 2 1/2) she inevitably does on occasion and it's never fallen or come off the wall on her. Great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lightweight","review":"This gate does what its intended to do, but I would not buy it again.

It is very easy to put together and the auto close is effective and much needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Purchase","review":"I love that this gate opens either way, my only complaint is that it sticks a little going one way. I like that it swings shut behind me, that way I don't have to worry about forgetting. We fashioned a little velcro strip to hold it open when we want it to say open. It was super easy to install and we got a great price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome gate, the best gate ever!","review":"I purchased this gate after trying 6 others and had to return for one reason or another, but not this one. This gate is impressive right out of the box, very easy to install - I didn't have to refer to manual as I watched amazon video once and that was enough(thanks to amazon); this gate is built strong, operation is very smooth and easy - we love it, especially the auto close feature. Can't think of any negatives - a novice person like myself was able to install this gate in less than 10 mins. This is the best gate - I would highly recommend. I have a need for 2 more gates and I am going to place my order from Amazon.com shortly."},{"rating":"1","title":"False advertising!!! Please be warned!!","review":"This product is advertised as coming with two extensions to accommodate a max width of 39 inches, however it does not come with the extensions. The gate alone only accommodates openings from 28-32 inches, I never would have selected it if it didn't come with the extensions. Neither Think Fast Toys nor Amazon were able to send me a set of extensions to resolve the issue, so I had no other option but to return the gate. Very inconvenient!! Fix the item description, or send the correct item!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Latch did not hook- probably defective","review":"On the gate I got the gate was farther apart from where it should hook in to. I should have probably sent it back but I needed it quickly. I would advise any one else purchasing this gate to make sure it latches not only at the bottom but at the top as well. Easy to use!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Hassle!","review":"I purchased two of these gates. First one I installed properly, but when I went to open the gate, it fell off completely, denting my wood floors. I quickly noticed that the bolt that is supposed to hold the gate in place was missing the nut to hold it in place. Opened the second gate which had a secure bolt and installed it the same as the first. It must have been bent out of shape because only the bottom locking mechanism would line up properly. In order for the top to secure I had to force it shut, which takes the \\"one-hand\\" feature out of play. Also, the paint on the top of the gate was not complete, so it looked as if there was a giant scratch along the edge of the frame, even though it clearly was not scratched. If the products weren't defective, I think it would be a great gate. But after having TWO out of two gates defective, I'm done with Dream-Baby products."},{"rating":"2","title":"The garden effect","review":"This gate is so easy to install my husband could do it . But he didn't. It looks really nice too like a garden gate. You will love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Not Work For Large Dogs","review":"This gate has a poor design that makes it impossible to function while tightly installed in a doorway to keep medium to large dogs out of a room. In order to function, the gate must be tightly installed so that the weight of the dog will not push the gate down; however, when the gate is installed this tightly using the included fasteners, the \\"swing-door\\" in the center of the gate will not function because the tightness of the installation locks it in place. If you are just using this gate to maintain a small infant, it might work... anything larger and it is a failure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Secure, easy set up","review":"I was a little concerned after reading some of the reviews, but the gate was easy to set up. As one reviewer said, even a 1/2 turn makes a difference when getting the latch and the gate to match up. It look about 15 minutes of tinkering around but we got it to the point where it locks when it swings closed AND our 4 year old can open (the gate is for the benefit of the 1 year old). It's only been a few days, but I really like it. And bonus that there are no holes in the walls."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome, but know that it auto closes...","review":"this gate is awesome. looks nice. its metal so not only is it sturdy, but it doesn't look cheap like the plastic ones on the market... however, the gate auto-closes. its spring/gravity closed. great if thats what you are looking for, but as a part time divider, you are going to have to rig some sort of bungee or rope to hold it open if you need it to stay open."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing parts","review":"I did not get the screws to fix the door, I just have the three pieces of bars composed of the door and two small side bars.

Single mission option allows you to do flight training, i.e., landing, takeoff and navigation. In addition you can fly training missions in strafing, bombing and firing rockets at targets with on-screen instructions. When you get comfortable with these missions (if you're a new-comer) you can progress to actual missions on specific campaigns or build your own personal missions, if you like. I've tried MS Combat Flight Sim, Figher Aces and a couple of others. I've yet to see a WWII Fighter game that tops this one! You can't go wrong with it, especially at this price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of The Best Simulators I've Played!","review":"Easy to learn to fly & very stable in the air. The graphics & sound are very good, even better than most $30 games!There is a unique tracking toggle that displays a small picture of the object you are tracking in realtime, plane, vehicle or structure, which is really great to see your attack's aftermath. It also has \\"non-drone\\" mobile ground targets, even soldiers in motion. the graphics & sound effects from dropping a bomb are great!The only draw back (hence the lack of the fifth star) is the short list of Axis fighters to fly but atleast they chose among the best ones to fly.For the price I paid (half what most sim's go for) I was expecting down scale & got a shock when I saw just how good it was! I'm hope there is a sequel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another movie looking at Hollywood.","review":"\\"Hollywood Confidential\\" is a TV movie and it certainly looks like it. It actually resembles a version of \\"VIP\\" with some men working alongside the women. The only difference is that the main purpose of the agency in the film is to spy on people (although they also provide protection when the situation calls for it). The actors are never really given any chance to express emotion. They are all just there for the purpose of speaking lines to present the extremely dull plot. The plot mostly centers around a big time Hollywood director who is trying to cut off his relationship with a teenage girl. The usual plot developments occur and nothing truly interesting ever really happens. Charlize Theron and Amanda Pays (who is criminally underused here) try to provide some spark but it is hopeless in this case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great film!!!","review":"First of all Hollywood Confidential is NOT a tv movie. It is a great action filled suspense drama. Check this one out!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking something overall, not as good as the Sookie books","review":"I read this after loving all of the Sookie Stackhouse books and hating the Harper (Grave Sight et al) character and books. I was hoping to find a middle ground here that would have some of the same humor and finesse of Sookie's stories without the melodrama and creepy relationships of the Harper stories. Sadly, this book and Aurora left me cold. Real Murders felt like a book for teens. Aurora is lacking confidence, she has no panache and none of the real world intelligence that makes Sookie so real and a character you actually want to know more about."},{"rating":"1","title":"All 6 published Teagarden books","review":"I have to say that after reading all 8 Sookie Stackhouse books and Lily Bard, Shakespeare's series, I am very disappointed in this series. I made myself finish them just because I just knew they'd kick in at some point and meet my expectations. It never happened. I judge a book by my wanting to re-read the books over and over. I can't say this about this series. I went out on Harris' web sight and was disappointed to hear that she would not be writing any more Shakespeare mysteries. That's ok because the series ended very well. I was disapponted when she said never say never about another Teagarden possibility. Please save your precious time writing Stackhouse books and end the Teagarden!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Having read many of Charlaine Harris novels this one was disappointing.

I was happy to find a new author that I really liked and then discover that there were 7 more books in the series! Ms. Harris really packs a full story in a small book. You definitely want to read these in order. I found a few at the library and ordered a few others that I couldn't find. The Julius House is the best one so far, so I expect Ms. Harris just keeps getting better and better!! I don't think I would be interested in her vampire series: It doesn't sound like my thing, but I may give the first one a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good introduction to the series","review":"This book introduces us to Aurora Teagarden, an amusing, intrepid and self-deprecating almost-30 librarian. She shares her interest in historic murders with a group of crime buffs who have formed a group called Real Murders. They meet once a month to discuss murders and murderers of the past. Strangely enough, murders begin to occur which mirror these past murders and which include members of the group. Aurora teams up with the Arthur, a local policeman and member of Real Murders, and Robin Crusoe, a mystery writer, to solve the murder cases. No one is above suspicion, but the solution is a surprise. This is fun, light reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I can't wait to read more in this series. I kept laughing and could not put the book down. Charlaine Harris is the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good mystery","review":"This story was completely different from the Sookie Stackhouse novels. The romance was down played and the mystery took center stage. I can't wait to read the rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Does Not Say It All","review":"I thought the book was contrived. It did not have the same charm or flow as the Sookie Stackhouse books. And there is nothing endearing about Aurora. I was pretty bored by page 22. So, I went to the end of the book to see how it ended. After reading the ending, I decided not to read anymore of the Aurora Teagarden books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bloody Vanilla---","review":"A bad mixture: bland story with an even blander ending, flat characters--especially the heroine, and several bloody murders. Couldn't believe this came from Charlaine Harris."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mystery Club","review":"This was a good mystery! New series for this author and I think it will improve as characters are developed. The star, Roe, was well suited for the story.

I do recommend this book for mystery fans...I liked it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I loved the Sookie Stackhouse series so I thought I would check out more of Charlaine Harris' books. I was very disappointed by this book. I had a hard time getting into it and felt that there were too many characters to keep track of.

I really wanted to enjoy it, but just couldn't get there..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, fast read","review":"If you're looking for a cozy mystery, Aurora Teagarden will hit the spot.

I love her Sookie series, I love her Harper and Tolliver books, I love her Lily Bard series.I do not love Aurora. Usually with Charlaine's work I am immediately drawn the the story and characters but this didn't happen with this book. But, I wanted to love this, but by chapter 3, I kept noticing I would just end up reading the same paragraphs over and over not paying attention to the words at all my mind somewhere else, because this book was just a drab.

It was too \\"cozy\\" for me, I suppose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as it could be","review":"I love Sookie Stackhouse and Harper Connolly so I really wanted to like Aurora Teagarden.

I think Charlaine can do much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"rereadable","review":"Real Murders is the first in the Aurora Teagarden series.

Get over it!","review":"As I stated in my last review of Sweet Valley University, I am starting to get tired of the series. This book seemed to have clinched it. Must we rehash Elizabeth and Todd again? I don't think so. Next thing you know, she will decide she likes Tom again! I am getting so, so tired of Elizabeth's confusion about her virginity. It seems that the university series is focusing only on her obsession with this. One second, she says she will give it up, the next, it's \\"not the right time\\". All you SVU readers understand what I am talking about. Can she please just get it over with so we don't have to get so bored with this topic, or stay a virgin, and not talk about it constantly? I have to ask, do these university students actually go to class and worry about important things besides relationships? I'm giving this book two stars, only because the wedding theme was enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elizabeth and Todd","review":"Look, I love Liz, but the thing is I've never been a Todd fan. When I recently read the 3rd University book (bought it in the library), I stopped hating Tom so much, but the thing is, I love SAM and wanted Liz to end up with SAM. God, why didn't they end up? Max was okay, but he wasn't SAM. I know Sam's what most girls consider a \\"slob\\", but that's what I loved about him. That backwards cap and Playstation...he is awesome. Todd is a major jerk. \\"Ooh, you don't want to lose your virginity to me, so let me do the immature thing and break up with you!\\" Plus I hate jocks. Well, not really HATE them, but they aren't hot to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"IM CONFUSED!!!","review":"Ok... i didnt get this book. It totally changed the history. It said that after Liz and Todd broke up at the begininng of their college years (because she didnt want to lose her virginity), they stopped talking. HUH? Whatever happened to them going out again when Gin Yung was in London? I believe thats talking. They were friends after they broke up that time too. And whatever happened to Sam, Elizabeth, and Jessica? They're \\"incident.\\" It didnt explain anything. Personally.. i thought this book was really dumb and confusing. And not to mention that i always thought Elizabeth and Tom should be together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toddand Liz-Ugh!","review":"I didn't read the whole book but if Todd and Liz end up together again I am going to scream. It's getting old if she just keeps running back to Todd. She needs someone the totally opposite of her.there should be one stable one in a realtionship and one non-stable one. I hope Jessica's diary is better than this one is so far. Jessica's diary should be interesting because they bring Devon Whitelaw back in the scenario."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been better . . .","review":"This book wasn't as good as I thought it would be. I'm tired of the Elizabeth and Todd and Todd and Elizabeth saga. It's too much. I'd rather see Elizabeth go back to Tom or Sam, anyone except Todd. The book was also confusing. You couldn't tell if it was before or after Elizabeth went out with Sam. I also think that the author is focusing too much on Elizabeth losing her virginity. First she thinks Sam is the one (in Face It) now she thinks it's definitely Todd. She doesn't know what she wants. One minute she wants to lose it to Todd the next she doesn't. All I can say is I hope the next book is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tiger Woods who?","review":"I could not have been more disappointed with this game.

I mean how practical is \\"Wild Rice-Sausage Chowder and Fresh Tomato Slices\\"? There are 16 ingredients listed! Someone who can whip up a 16 ingredient dish doesn't need help putting together a 1,200 calorie day. Here is one that looks inviting...\\"Individual fruit platters with hot popovers\\" Oh wait, I don't want to whip up popovers! I wanted something to help me get OUT of the kitchen and grocery store.

It really makes a lot of sense. The guy thinks it's okay if he strays outside of his marriage, yet thinks it's wrong if his wife does it even though he does. This movie is pretty funny and the dialogue between the husband and the man he's temporarily rooming with (the guy his wife's having an affair with) is great. Great movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Men\\" was very enjoyable","review":"I caught this movie on the Independent Film channel and was thoroughly delighted. With the disclaimer that I am not terribly experienced with foreign films, I loved the feel of the movie: it was clearly not from Hollywood! The movie has some serious themes but the many laughs bring it to a level that has a wide appeal. I would definitely recommend \\"Men\\" to anyone who is wanting to experience something outside of typical Hollywood fare; this movie will satisfy that craving without going over your head."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing quality--like amateur copy of VHS tape","review":"From one of the customer reviews (and the lack of product info), I had anticipated this to be the older German DVD with English subtitles. It turns out to be a badly dubbed English version, where the video quality is equally bad. It seems like an unauthorized copy of the VHS version of the film. Disappointing! I do hope that the DVD (German/English subtitles) will be re-released soon. It just came out again in German (and German and French) on the Continent, so perhaps the U.S. will follow suit soon.

Sadly, it is not was horrible movie was an annoying main character, Oskar, a spoiled brat who I in no way cared about or could relate with.The movie is long, boring and drags out with no redeeming moral at the end, which I was hoping for and pretty much the only reason I finished watching.

And just think, here they are, together in the same movie...sort of.The story, about a child who's convinced his father (who dies in the Twin Towers) left him coded messages, didn't work. To me, the kid seemed like a self-absorbed brat. I just couldn't generate much sympathy for a character who seems to think that the whole 9/11 attacks took place just to disrupt his world.More screen time for Sandra Bullock might have helped. I couldn't help but feel for her character, a woman who loses her husband to terrorists and her kid to an obsession.Tom Hanks is good (as always; I even liked him in Larry Crowne), in a role that we mostly see or hear through recordings.I think there's a place for a story about the effects of 9/11 on children, but this movie isn't it, at least not for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a good movie","review":"my goodness!

The young actor, Thomas Horn is excruciatingly terrible, yes I understand what he was attempting to capture, but it failed miserably and just destroyed any credibility of realism I have in this character. Sorry Thomas, and I think you know this already by the lack of work you had since 2010, acting is not your strong suit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close","review":"Interesting movie. Was told ahead of time it disturbed some viewers due to 9/11 incident. I can understand that asthe image of a man falling from the window played several times during the movie started to be bothersome forme so I can imagine how someone who lost someone at 9/11 would feel seeing that over and over. I think SandraBullock was excellent in the movie. Some parts were a little difficult to follow but the acting by all wasextremely good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging and clever","review":"We all know the story of 9/11 but not like this. A child's view of loss, of not quite fitting in a world of normality facing a hard reality. The story reveals human nature in many formats and the pain and joy of family. It all comes together through the search for answers which many of us spend our entire lives looking for, but this small boy systematically calls upon humankind to bring him to a conclusion where he learns to live for what he now has and accepts the shadow of what once was.

I think your missing the point. This is one boy's journey to make his dad proud who sadly was taken away by the tragic events of 9/11. Not only is he on this journey but it shows other people's lives and how theirs are intertwined with his just like our own lives with each other. It reflects how a community can overcome tragic events and never give up hope in the face of death. We all have separate lives but human culture is about helping one another if we are to survive. I blame not only terrorism but our own Government for what happened that tragic day. Too many lives lost for a war started by profit, greed, anger, hate and creed. Never forget those victims on 9/11. A moving picture that deserved Oscar attention for its message and its outstanding performances. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly powerful!","review":"This movie portrays profound love in so many different ways...love among family members, love of, and by neighbors and strangers, love for an amazing city, lost love, and found love, and misunderstood love and the never ending love of a son for his father!This is an incredibly powerful movie!

It's the film that proves that if you add Tom Hanks and Sandra Bullock to anything, you will get an Oscar nomination. I expect next year there will be a two-hour movie where Meryl Streep simply reads from the phone book with a foreign accent and the Academy will honor that too. It's utterly disgusting, but reinforces the old saying \\"it's not about what you know, but who you know.\\"Telling a story of a child on an unrealistic journey through the streets of NYC, bad parenting is really the only impression I was left with during this overlong exercise in patience. Using 9/11 is disgusting, and was used as a way to sell tickets. Maybe the book is better, I didn't read it - and now I have no plan to.

Who knows how he was found to play this part, but I doubt they could have found a better actor for the movie.I would write more, but I do not want to chance spoiling this movie/book for anyone.

Supporting his performance is a stellar cast including Tom Hanks, as Thomas Schell, Oskar's father and Sandra Bullock as Linda Schell, Oskar's mother.This movie is heavy, emotional, and filled with angst; young Oskar is very intelligent and driven to resolve the challenge he believes has been left for him by the death of his dad on 9/11.The movie is rated PG-13 but I would suggest its heavy drama will require a very mature 13 year old.

They should not be seen as mini-adults, or as proto-adults. As a social group, they have specific relationships with other social groups, particularly with parents and teachers. She shows that children are agents, partners in constructing the social world that we all share. They are not just passive consumers of scarce social resources.In fact though, they do receive inadequate support for their development. Resources for children&#65533;s health are poor, and so are the resources for children&#65533;s education. For instance, 94% of primary schools have no gym, 92% have no swimming pool, and 97% have no tennis courts. One in five children are brought up in families who live in poverty, and economic and social inequality blight the lives of all too many children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome recipes!","review":"I love this book.

If you did your work right, they will die in the process and you will get their treasures.Dungeon Master 2 implements better graphics from it's prequel.

Those poo's are so runny & hard to contain. Once your baby's older, it will be easier to keep everything in. Even in disposables - that stuff can get up their backs, etc!

I use cloth diapers, liners and covers that will wash and dry separately. It's just as easy to use as these, and they dry much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Leaky","review":"We got these at a recommendation from a couple in our birthing class. We only bought one pack. For the price, we wanted to see if we liked them before making a large investment. Our son was premature, so our newborn Kushies were too large for him until he reached about 6 and 1/2 pounds, despite the fact that they were sized 4 to 10 pounds. I found that though well made and wash friendly, they are very leaky. I much prefer the used velcro wraps and cloth diapers we got from a friend. They NEVER leak. At night, because we don't change our son as frequently, to keep away diaper rash we use disposables, which are also leaky. The covers we got from a friend, can be used around the disposables, which keeps our son's clothing and sheets dry all night. I have since found another cloth diapering system that is virtually leak proof. I recommend buying several types before investing heavily into one CD system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bulky","review":"EVen though the feedbacks said they were bulky, I bought it. and they were right!

My goal was to start making him aware of being dirty and wet and hopefully boost his interest to potty train. Well still not interested, but these diapers certainly have made things a bit easier and definitely less expensive in the long run even if we end up going to 3.They are very well made and stand up to repeated washing and drying, my son says they are soft so no problem there. I would say the only thing I would change is to put a softer material around the edges of the leg openings, because when it is on the plastic out layer does scratch his legs some, but not badly and he doesn't even seem to notice. I just notice the red marks when changing.I liked the first pack so much that I did go ahead and order a second package."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than disposables!","review":"I switched to cloth for environmental reasons and for the safety of my baby, so she wouldn't have all those questionable chemicals next to her delicate skin that you find in disposables.

Look into Fuzzi Bunz or Wonderoo's you'll be much happier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inexpensive, easy, and LEAKY","review":"We bought some of these in the newborn and infant sizes before our first daughter was born. We quickly found that the newborn ones are useless, as no matter what combination of liner and diaper you use, the poop will get out of the diaper. Later, the infant ones became part of our cloth diaper rotation only as back-ups and only for use at home. The reason is that the legs lack proper gussets, so urine leeches directly from the lining of the diaper onto whatever clothing the little one is wearing. If your baby is still in the liquid poop stage, the legs completely fail to keep it in. The most absorbent, leak-proof, inexpensive, and eco-friendly option we've found is a combination of bamboo terry squares (fastened with Snappies), Kushies cotton liners, and Little Beetle one-size wool covers. If you want an all-in-one that won't turn you off cloth diapers forever, spend more money to get something good.

I was not pleased at first with how tight I had to make it on my daughter just to make it snug around her leg, we often have leaks in that area. After she grew a little more they became better. After only having and using them for four months they are begining to have holes in them near the legs and waist. the velcro is curling and I must change her with in 3 hours other wise her clothes get wet at the waist. I have taken care of them as the maker suggests. I find it upsetting and disappointing that choosing to make a change from disposable to cloth for many reasons including cost and this is not a cost effective diaper, I don't see it lasting one child or even many more months. I am just very unhappy with this purchase. I only use them at home so if I need I have whatever I need here at my finger tips, extra clothes, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks, stiff, and not absorband","review":"Not a very good cloth diaper. The inserts are very inefficient in pulling moisture away from the baby's bottom. This can result in diaper rashes. You might as well use prefolds and use a cover and save LOTS of money rather than use these diapers.Besides all the leaks with this diaper, they are really stiff. I wanted to like this diaper, but am very disappointed.

Unfortunately they leak like crazy, little bits seeped out on a lot of my daughter's jammies right off the bat and major leaks as soon as she started having good size bm's, within two weeks or so it was really bad.So I decided to just use an additional cover and they are HUGE on a little newborn body, and my baby is not that small. I did try the technique that one reviewer specified on how to fit the diaper, which helped but did not stop the leaks. I had an 8 1/2 pound baby and with this diaper and the cover she actually won't fit in most newborn size pajamas!

I never use them when I am out and about or know that he will be somewhere where people might want to hold him. The last thing people want is to have a pee stain on their clothes after holding a baby. I feel that the pee soaks through so fast because the cotton inside layer sticks out the sides around his legs.

We haven't had any leaks, even overnight, they are very soft, and they dry in a reasonable amount of time. They are also really cute, and very reasonably priced.

First of all they are extremely bulky which isn't very conducive to a baby learning to crawl and develop their muscles well because it forces their legs so far apart.My baby pees a lot and I just don't see it worth putting these great big things into the wash after she just peed. I go through 17 diapers a day (because I change her immediately). At this price this is WAY too expensive. I've found using liners and just five covers works great for me. And seventeen of these wouldn't even fit in my washer every day.If your baby is a frequent pee-er you might want to consider using something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the Bum Genius 4.0 instead...","review":"Read the reviews and thought this would be a good value since the Bum Genius 4.0 2pack is 35.99 for 2. For that, it deserves 2 stars. However, in this case, we got what we paid for. The velcro straps are too firm and scratchy, and rides up on the baby if she's sitting up straight. The diaper is also very clunky, even for a re-usable. The outside material feels like a cheap swim suit and is not as soft as it should be for a baby's skin. The insert also leaked on the first use. I have had 2 pairs of the bum genius diapers and they have not leaked since our baby was a newborn, and still do not leak to this day. The inserts are much more absorbent and the material overall is much softer. The packaging says it's for 10-25lbs but I honestly don't think this product would be appropriate for any baby under 15 lbs. It's bigger, yet less absorbent than the Bum Genius.

I purchased Bumkins all-in-ones at another online store, and have been thoroughly satisfied with them.

Graphic full color photographs that read like crime scene photographs or stills from a horror movie.There's the sexy display between two praying mantis before the male becomes a post-coitus snack. Another praying mantis dances merrily on the head of a fat shiny toad before meeting its inevitable end. Caterpillars greedily gorge themselves on tomatoes only to be sucked dry by more ever present praying mantis.The most graphic scenes though are the ones with the pinkies. Pinkies being born amongst a white blood smeared backdrop only to be gobbled up by another fat toad.It's sick to look at and even a bit morbid at times, but it's Mother Nature and a testament to the circle of life and the survival of the fittest."},{"rating":"2","title":"A superbly written military novel","review":"When Pearl Harbor was bombed in a sneak attack by the Japanese, George Lewis got angry.

For (reflective) radar, it will only detect the cop behind you if and only if the cop's radar signal is reflected from some large object in front of you, e.g. a wall or a building or a large truck. I have been in situation where I saw a cop car go past me (coming from behind) and then the unit started beeping.

So far the unit works great. Minimal false alarms. It's obvious that in the city there are many X band stimuli, you just have to keep the unit on \\"Autoscan\\" mode which will greatly reduce the low intensity X band alarms. There is a silence button that I find useful. The alarm intensity level is a good indication of police presence. This thing definitely detects radar very well. Of course there is no fullproof detector, so don't get too cocky. Only one real complaint: The windshield mount is very noisy. I ended up mounting on the dash with a wedge and some velcro.

I actually almost burned the book, but am against book burning. I was much more relaxed when I realized that books can never tell you how to work with a child. You must use parental instinct.

Ignored by the author is the question of your child's psyche that will be damaged because he feels rejected by the people he is genetically programmed to trust.

Sadly, to prep the ever-adorable Sophie Marceau for her part as a cello virtuoso, the director seems to have had her coached in bowing and fingering for about five minutes. ... Of course, we usually don't go to comedies or heroic adventure films for the realistic musicianship of the actors--but the sloppiness of this element in THIS film is just one more insult to the audience.

The reason being is because you have to go very slow while clipping in order for them to work. My cat lost patients with me and I did the clippers. Continuous cleaning while usuing them (which is to be expected) but they got real hot in the process, so had to shut them off and on during the grooming. Needless to say I sent them back.

There are very few denials of love between the two and they both, from the beginning, know they want ot live together. This is refreshing change from novels where both characters are at each other throats from the beginning to almost the end. But Ms. Camp does not bring them together too soon, if she does that the book would be over. Storm has to deal with the prejudices of the white's and he feels that he is a curse to his people. He fears what would happen if he brought Tess into his tribe. Tess, from almost the very start, wants to live with the Blackfeet. There she would be treated with respect as the Medicine Woman she is and not as a second class citizan. I hope you read this book.

Maybe you did a little more research, which at the time was a bit harder to do, and found that Stephenson had written under another name - \\"Stephen Bury\\" - and tried to find those books too. But that was before eBay and Amazon, so they were difficult to find. Maybe you had a friend with them, or they were in the library, and you read borrowed copies.Interfaceis one of those. When I got an Amazon mail about a couple of \\"new\\" Neal Stephenson books, I ordered them.

It certainly has the Warner Brothers' touch. Errol Flynn is his usual dashing, dauntless self, perfectly at home with a sword in hand. Claude Rain again is the cunning, cultured villain, and Alan Hale is a welcome face, although this time he is Flynn's foe instead of friend. As Prince Edward and his look alike beggar friend, the Mauch twins are occasionally annoying, but for the most part quite effective as the victims of a switch that learn to appreciate the other side of life. The story is fun and played with a lot of energy and humour. Don't assume that this is an Errol Flynn video, because he really isn't the star - the twins are the stars. However, there is enough of Flynn to keep his fans happy, and a good enough story and movie to keep everyone happy (including children)."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time","review":"It's plot has almost nothing in common with Twain's masterpiece, which could be made into brilliant film without any alternations.I wonder if people who wrote those positive reviews ever read the book.

It's language is rich and convincing.This movie looks like adaptation of another book with the same title and written by some 3-rd rate author.

I highly recommend this collection and hope you will be as enriched with it as my family is. Merry Christmas!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Needs more songs","review":"I think that this is a great collection of songs, but I believe that they should keep adding CDs to the collection; they skipped over lots of other good songs, like Gene Autry's version of \\"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.\\" Definitely a triple!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't recognize some of the songs.","review":"While much of the music on this double disc offering are fine, there were a few I don't think I had ever heard before.

However, to be honest, I was way disappointed. Most of the songs are not well known and most are mediocre, but the worst things is that both CDs are each only thirty minutes in duration, so why bother splitting the collection into two CDs? Perhaps so that one will think that there's a lot more than in reality. Can't recommend this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas Music CD","review":"If you're looking for some traditional Christmas music, then I think you'll find this to be a pretty good fit.

The cover was the same, but that is where it ends.For example, I had believed I had on my CD a song by Charles Brown, \\"Please Be Home For Christmas\\", but instead, was replaced by Charles Brown, \\"Merry Christmas, Baby\\". I thought at first, I had lost my mind, until I checked the listed songs on my CD's against the ones listed here.Besides, many of the songs are listed in a different order! Confusing, heck yeah!!!I would have returned it if had discovered this error before playing it! Oh, well, bought a different CD in order to get that song, even though it is sung by Jon Bon Jovi!

Now the fan will not oscillated after 2 days of partial use.Also the adjustable height rod is jammed . So now I have this giant fan 4 feet off the ground blows everything off the tables.

The fan was very unbalanced at first. I replaced the square head set screw that holds the blade to the motor with a recessed socket head screw that sat flush with the hub. I then had to bend the blades a little bit to get them all to ride in the same plane. The guard on the outside was very dificult to install until I clocked it so that the radial bars were in between the ones on the back guard. After that the fan cage had plenty of flex to allow the front cover to go on. Other than those problems it's a good fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"This brings back great memories!","review":"After many years of hearing the trash that country music is producing now days, it was truly refreshing to sit back and listen to Ed Bruce again.

Even slides I purchased at the Musée d'Orsay miss the mark.Not so with Welsh's work!

I own a number of others but this nice big page book has lots of paintings in it I had not seen before in other printed sources or museums. Most important, the colors and printing are excellent, much better than my other Van Gogh books. I always wonder how some well known companies have the gall or ignorance to print and sell art books with bad reproduction. This book is a joy to peruse and Amazon brought it to me at about half the price I almost paid at our local book store. The text was compiled by experts and in a very interesting manner.

This dvd includes extra content of the textless main theme song and it has trailers which are very intresting.

I think the clapper is too heavy for the wind catcher, so it can't work up enough momentum to swing it enough to hit the bell. I moved them around to try to find a windier spot, but even in 30mph gusts it didn't ring at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"The chimes do not function even with strong wind.","review":"This item is terribly designed. The bells in the middle are fully separate from the dragonflies so that they will never collide (unless you're in heavy gale force winds, but hey, if you're trying to listen to soothing chimes in the middle of a hurricane, you have some other issues).Furthermore, the bell at the bottom is very heavy, and the wind catcher below it (which is supposed to catch the wind and make the bell chime) is extremely light and made of plastic. The heavy bell reduces the momentum of the string, which makes it impossible for the collision to occur, so the chime will never happen (unless, again, you're in hurricane-force wind scenario).It's a beautiful look, but it just doesn't do what it was intended to do. This bell will never chime."},{"rating":"1","title":"not much to it...too lightweiight and cheaply made to make much noise","review":"This windchime is really not much to look at...and especially nothing to 'listen' to.

Brand new, plastic wrapped cases; no damage. The discs played without a hitch or a skip.And did I mention that it's 70 freaking episodes and two movies?

The chorus is layered with melodic multi-part harmonies. \\"I'm a Sucker for a Girl in Uniform\\" pays homage to the girls in blue and the ones in camouflage. No joking here, these guys are dead serious. Watery guitar tones and soft vocals portray the emotional pain of \\"Do You Want Me to Go Away.\\" Broken promises and heartbreak seem to be a recurring theme for The Churchills' music, and \\"It Only Hurts When I Breathe\\" is no different. The chorus hook is sure to elicit plenty of powerful feelings. \\"There Never Going to Find Me\\" is where the group really rocks out by kicking up the tempo and guitar fuzz.The BadThese songs are great for poignant dramatic scenes on television, but when they're run back to back, they get a little repetitive.The VerdictTwelve mellow, melodic, and emotional \`date' songs wrapped up into convenient three-minute packages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sloppy writing and too much repetition","review":"If you are used to read more technical and professional books, this book will be a disappointment. The writting style is too sloppy. The author has an annoying habit of citing so-on-so said this and that - it's not the standard way of making references in a typical academic manner. There is also too much repetition. The author basically says that whenever an economic indicator suggests a stronger economy, it'd be negative for the bond market and positive for the equity market, which is fine, but she keeps repeating the same thing over and over again. There isn't much insight in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An unexpected pleasure","review":"I bought this disc after hearing a download of the song \\"Summertime Thing\\". The song clicked with me, and I figured I'd give Chuck a chance. 9 times out of 10 I end up giving the disc one listen, and then it's long forgotten. Well, \\"No Other Love\\" beat the odds. I can't say enough about this album. At times Chuck's vocals sound a lot like an old favorite of mine, Jerry Jeff Walker. The production on some songs (CP produced this himself) reminds me of Gus Dudgeon's production on some of Elton John's earlier albums. There's even hints of Mark Knopfler in here. That said though, Chuck Prophet is truly an original talent. He puts his all into every song, from writing, singing, guitar playing, and producing. And the variety of songs just keep me wanting to hear the album again and again.There is humor, joy and a definite honesty in this album that is sorely missing in today's arena of popular music.

Sex is used throughout as a means of oppression and a form of torture in scenes that are described at length with sick complacency.

Really, the only thing I don't like about it is the size. It is rather large. Also I preferred the LCD didplay of my old detector to the LED display of this one. The LCD is more readable in most light situations than the LED, which has to constantly be adjusted. Besides that, I like everything about it. Easy menu, logical buttons for brightness, sensitivity and volume. Compared to my old detector, it hardly has any false alarms, and the range of detection of an actual signal is much further, sometimes to the point that I get an alarm and dismiss it because I think it's false, and then I pass the cop.

My 1991 uniden was smaller. The overall quality of this detector is poor. During a hot summer, the unit actually separated at the seam and warped, which made it impossible to turn on or off without significant effort. To turn it on/off I actually had to smack it against my leg so the warped button could contact the leads. On top of that, the fine piece of engineering that is supposed to keep it on the windshield doesn't work. Since it warped in the sun, every time I turned or hit a bump, the unit would fall of the mount and come flying at me or my passenger.Performance wise, it worked marginal. I received many false readings. The compass is a nice feature. Again, the unit is huge and the display screen is quite small and difficult to read. The dot matrix red is very 80s.Avoid.

Since my dogs had already clipped short for the summer, the Andis clipper worked great. It's quiet and cut through their coats like butter. I did'nt have any problem with overheating. I don't know how well it would work if they had'nt already been clipped considering the thick undercaot of Aussies. I intend to keep them short all year round here in Texas since they are inside dogs and love being cool. A once monthly clipping is perfect and the Andis does what I want. I would buy it again.

After 6 months I noticed a marked decrease in performance, and just after a year the motor wouldn't turn on anymore. I replaced it with the Oster Golden A5 single-speed clippers and immediately noticed a huge difference.

One is a ragdoll and the other is a snowshoe, either way they got a lot of fur. I was using the furminator and was getting tons and tons of fur, yet every weekend I still have to vaccum my carpet to get rid of cat fur. Plus I live in Los Angeles and it's like 100 degrees right now so I thought giving my cats a trim might help them. The #1 trimmer guide is what I use because with the #2 I can't get enough fur and it ends up with an uneven cut. The clipper is amazing and I finished shaving 1 cat in 40mins and I trimmed other cat in about an hour. Easy to use and easy to clean. Be very careful using the clipper without the guides because you may end up cutting your cat's skin.

I had no problem with the attachments staying on and the clippers are quiet so the noise didn't bother him one bit (but he does likes the hair dryer). You just need to work slowly with the clippers.So far I've used the clippers twice and I love it. It's well worth the price!

The Andis is quieter, possibly because the rpm's are slower, and it's lighter, but it also doesn't cut very well. I shouldn't need to make several swipes over my miniature poodles' faces in order to get a nice smooth look, but it takes 4 to 7 swipes before I can move on to the next line.A phone call to the company met with a rather unsympathetic and indifferent customer service rep.

Her facial expressions don't work for this type of dance though. I have watched a lot of Indian dancing and she just doesn't have it yet.

The memory card on my laptop makes use of RAM for its video work. When I put in the PNY memory (the package says its 30% faster), my video rating jumped from 2.7 to 3 due to the faster RAM memory. . . a nice side benefit.Finally, I bought this while PNY was running a $15 rebate.

However, it quickly became evident that the author had been sent through the Mayo physical in search of a magazine article that never took shape. Thus, it became an even weaker storyline for a book then made up of the author's assorted rants to fill the final 2/3 of the book. Interestingly, the author seems to have little respect for the Mayo physical in light of the cost but cost then goes unmentioned when one of his children needs treatment for a serious injury."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obnoxious, Pretentious, & Rambling","review":"Avoid this author's political soapboxing, circular logic, pop-culture references, and redundant rants.

It catalogs the author's complete physical at the Mayo Center. Sad, funny, ironic, you'll both wish for a visit and be glad you never have to submit to the \\"Executive Physical\\".Later in the book, the author discusses stem cell research and singles out the South Korean research. Apparently though, this book went to press prior to the revelation that that research was not properly done and thus doesn't offer any hope for disease cure and prevention.

That is to say that one year later, a few of the books I've bought remain useful but most of them don't.How Linux Works went to the bottom of the pile very quickly after I bought it and has remained there pretty much continuously since then. In fact, I only recently pulled it out of the stack to see if, now that I know a bit more about Linux, there might be anything interesting or useful to me.

The Bentley Manual is fine for most of its photos (however, some pics are not accurate) and the instruction is OK if the reader has experience working on cars. I was able to do more work on my car by just observing the placement of part or system and by referring to several BMW forums which, in my opinion, are far and above this simple manual. It can come in handy as a quick reference but does not serve as an end all shop manual."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ultimate Service Manual","review":"Bentley manuals are the best, the level of detail and information is unmatched anywhere but for BMW's own workshop manual. These books arent small, roughly the size of two UK telephone directories and unfortunatly for me don't cover the 525TDS engine. That said there is enough information contained within to enable the DIY mechanic to tackle just about any job. The section containing error codes is useful if you have an error code reader and the index is clear and easily understood.

And I gave rave reviews for another Canadian TV cop show I recently bought called \\"The Border\\". But I didn't like this show much at all. The pacing was slow, the acting no better than a weak cop show you'd see late at night on cable, and the characters and cases just had no 'sizzle' in my view. The premise of this show is identical to the series that ran for 8 years on CBS, also called \\"Cold Case\\", starring Kethryn Morris. That is a great show but unfortunately not available on DVD and probably never will be. So I would not recommend this show to anyone who loves cop shows. Its not 'terrible', its just that their are SO many good cop series out there (The Wire, The Shield, Law & Order, to name a few)that I wouldn't waste my time watching it.

While it can offer some useful information to those who do not have knowledge about their MS at this point, the rest, with comments added in by mothers, was just scary and depressing. One women even comments that if she had known how bad she was going to feel she would never have gotten pregnant! This is NOT a book for someone who is happy about their pregnancy and unwilling to let MS rule their lives. Women would be better off reading one of the other books on MS combined with a good pregnancy book. This book also chooses to follow alternative medicine, which can be disappointing for those of us looking for traditional medical advice. I would suggest pregnant women with MS find a good website for women with multiple sclerosis. There a person can get advice from the message boards and chats, places where people not only share information, but a general concern for ones feelings."},{"rating":"1","title":"scared me to death!!","review":"This book has opinions of women who have ms and have had babies and some are very frightening.

Luckily I have the original remote, otherwise there doesn't seem to be a way to switch it off the twinview without it.Sony's implementation is terrible. They could have made a twinview on/off toggle button rather than having a dedicated off button on the original remote. This would have save them the cost of needing a dedicated \\"off\\" button---Actually, it might be a \\"regular view\\" button---well, they did save the cost of not having it on this remote and screwing those of us that need this button.So,my best option is to get a remote that has a learning/programable feature so that I can waste a button to make a dedicated button to button off the twinview button."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of crap","review":"A piece of crap.

There was a button, called \\"Picture Mode\\" that allowed me to change the picture from Vivid, Standard, Movie, and Pro, very quickly. That is missing from this remote. Not sure why because this button seems common place to most OEM Sony Remotes.
