Then explain this....","review":"First the good: great sound, great selection of songs. Good picture, although the brick wall of the Bitter End takes away from the visual appreciation of the band.Now the bad: check out the song \\"Mirage\\", Tommy's voice continues holding the note even when he is away from the mic, and I mean a long time. This pops up a number of places in the song which means that maybe the concert wasn't lip-synched, but in the final edit overdubs where probably made. This is especially apparent with the annoying crowd noises of people cheering throughout the DVD yet there are no corresponding visual images (the same problem as with the Spirit live DVD, although not as bad here).I rented this and plan to buy it, despite the sloppy and numerous overdubs. It's an exciting show and very well-played, well, maybe too well, but that's a quibble only costing one star. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Legends Trilogy","review":"The previous reviewer has this box set mixed up with another book. This box set contains 3 Dragonlance books from the legends Trilogy, which takes place after the Dragonlance Chronicles. Its the second trilogy in the Dragonlance series of books. It contains the books: Time of the Twins, War of the Twins, and Test of the Twins. These were excellent books but i recommend you read the Dragonlance Chronicles before you read these as they will give you a better understanding of the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best trilogy in fantasy-won't disappoint.","review":"If the prologue won't hook you in, I don't know what will. (You SHOULD read the \\"Chronicles\\" trilogy first to know what's going on.) The best fantasy trilogy with memorable characters who you will come to know well. In all our imaginations, however, Raistlin is a character to be loved, hated, and/or both. In my mind, \\"Raist\\" will always be the \\"master of past and present.\\"After \\"Legends,\\" Weis/Hickman continue the story, and so should you if you love \\"Legends.\\" If you REALLY enjoyed the trilogy box set, the \\"Annotated Legends\\" is a must-buy as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Brilliant","review":"I am a 14 year old student. This Dragonlace series is probably my favorite of all other ones I have read. The characters are well developed. I have heard some people say they think Dragonlance characters are rather flat but i disagree. Raistlin is the best character. I feel he is a trajic character as he meets an ill-fated end and endures much suffering. I hesitate to call him a villian but he is definantly not the protagonost. The plot is all three books is very interesting and I do not believe it had any boring parts at all. I liked how they threw in the whole time traveling to the future thing with Tas and Caramon. So in conclusion, this book is great. If you like Fantasy or are simply looking for a good book to read, buy it. You will not regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"i enjoy these books","review":"Gave these as a gift to Grand daughter - she loves them, as do i.

Its about twins brothers Caramon and Raistlin Majare and their half sister Kitiara. It is full of supence, action and emotions that will promise to blow you away!

A halfway decent editor could have fixed so much in these books; clearly the authors expected to be paid by the quantity and not the quality of the words.I was continually disgusted and appalled from the first chapter. Intelligent readers will be insulted by the writing style. My only solace is that I bought these from a secondhand bookstore for a total cost of $6. Still, I would much rather have the $6 than the worthless literary trash it purchased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I expected","review":"This opener has received good reviews by others, however I cannot do the same.

One jar was even easily open by hand without the gripper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works well, but broke in half after about 1 1/2 years","review":"I'm reviewing this product because I've had my eye on it to re-purchase since my first one broke in half at the pivot/rotation point at the top - and I just noticed they've raised the price from $8.99 to $11.39. So, at that price, no, I (probably) won't buy it again. It had worked very well on opening jars - if I remember correctly, it has a bit of rubber around the area that grabs the jar lid, so it hold on well and I could always open any jar (large and small). Crate and Barrel had these for $8.99 a few days ago. Not sure if I should give 2 or 3 stars. I'm giving 2. Message to manufacturers: Make quality products. When did everything have to be replaced every few years??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Plastic Handles!","review":"The tool generally opens most jars.

About the only thing you can use this is for a bottle opener and a tab opener. Even with the tab opener it is only good just to lift the tab high enough to help you grip it. The handle is wide to help my dad grip the opener.

Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Handy","review":"I purchased this from a different site but this opener has come to the rescue on many occasions to pop the cap off of a bottle and especially to open those really tight jars. Its been the muscle in my kitchen for over a year now. Gave it 4 stars because it does show wear and tear over time. I don't know if it's all the jars I've been opening but the top edge looks as if its cracking. Well, I did get a lot of usage out of it...and when it goes, I'll be back for another!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke within 4 weeks","review":"This thing works great but its easy to break it at the top pivot point and there is no repair possible because it needs to pivot at that point. Glueing is out of the question.

I am so disappointed. I only keep it because my son can use it, but I don't have enough strength in my hands. I am so sorry that I didn't pay attention to the negative reviews. I had the One Touch Jar opener which was great, but it broke and I can't find another in the stores. From the reviews, the One Touch has a tendency to break after repeated use, so I won't waste money buying another if I have to keep replacing it. But America's Test Kitchen recommended the Swing Away Comfort Grip Jar Opener and I am going to try that. I looked at the reviews for that item and there are very few 1 star reviews. Keeping my fingers crossed that it lasts 20 to 30 years like other customers have said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantastic until it BROKE!","review":"I've really liked this jar opener. It's versatile enough to open many sizes of jars. However, the other day the rubber outside layer just snapped in two on one side.

Bummer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design","review":"When I first saw this, I thought it was a pretty good design.When I actually went to use it on a 3.5\\" jar cap, it broke.

The fact that it glows in the dark is convenient. However, when taken out in the rain, or becoming wet in any way, the design on the top begins to peel off, which is rather upsetting. Eventually I just peeled the whole thing off and began playing with a blank frisbee. It's still kinda cool but, overall, I'd say not worth the money when you can buy legitimate UPA frisbee for under $10."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Toy!","review":"My son loves this toy he got for his first birthday.

This one has only four: star, block, round & triangle.While I think the noises it makes are overkill, the real fun and learning value is in having the child place the shapes in the holes and then reaching in to get them again. Once my son learned how, and that each time he did it earned him a \\"yaaahhh\\" and a big hug, he'll actually stop walking with his walker to sit down and play with this for a while.Overall, a good toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Best Shape Sorter","review":"Because this has a completely open top, my daughter only wants to put the shapes in there instead of the right holes. I also don't like that there are only 4 shapes when you can get sorters with a lot more. The ones with more shapes are obviously more educational. I won't deny that this toy is cute, but it plays unnecessary music. I would honestly just buy a different sorter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hello...big open top!","review":"Like other reviewers, my child won't try to put the blocks in the right shaped holes because it's so easy just to put them in the wide open top. I'm really baffled at this design. Also, why must EVERY toy nowadays make sounds? Can't the child just be happy with herself for getting the block in the hole with no funny entertaining noises coming back at her? Oh wait,no they can't because they just put the blocks in the wide open top of the toy. Thankfully there's an off switch which I use all the time. This was a gift; I'd be mad if I spent $33 on this....I am wishing we had the $7 one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Educational & Fun!","review":"Length:: 0:52 MinsMy 13 month old son loves this toy and it's surely his favorite! I like how you can see the shapes through the clear box, the box sings short tunes, and the shapes have little toy displays inside them - which make nice rattle toys for younger babies. I've had no problems with pinching with the handle. I would recommend this toy as a must have. I uploaded a video so you can see the toy in action."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy!","review":"My six month old loves this toy! He likes to bat them around and study what is inside of each block. They are all different. Some blocks make noise while others may have different textures and other blocks have themes like cars, food or animals. I think that these blocks are brilliant. I also want to check out the Roll Arounds. They kind of have the same idea. This is great toy and I think any young child will like it as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"My almost 2 year old still plays with this toy","review":"We got this toy when my son was about 18 months old, just because mommy liked it. My fiance thought that maybe he was too old for it but he actually still plays with it on a regular basis. He usually puts the appropirate blocks into there shaped holes but then when he gets bored with that, he puts his match box cars in there and totes it around like a little carrier. He absolutely loves this toy. The toy lights up when you put the blocks into their appropriate holes and makes music when something hits the bottom of the carrier. It also has a handy little handle to carry the toy and the blocks around. This is a great toy for traveling as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"Bad not in a good way.

I can't understand why great vocalists, like Kevin Dubrow, Kelly Hanson and Joe Leste would give their approval for such a cheap, sampled, mixed and remixed piece of electro crap. It's almost like the artist sang to the original GNR tracks, and then the mixers layered their vocals on top of their noise track without the artists even knowing.

It put a modern spin on a classic album. Maybe this is what the album would've had to sound like today for it to sell. Is it any different from the bands like Kid Rock, Orgy, and Powerman 5000.

I believe Mr Rose's raw musical talent has been overlooked because of shallow people's petty interest in his personal life and his troubled ways. Slash is simply the most soulful musician I have ever heard with maybe the exception of Ludwig Van Beethoven. I have studied and am trained in classical music and have studied the great composers in music history(Beethoven,Mozart,Chopin,etc..) therefore I can appreciate the exceptional musical talent and deep emotion these two individuals put into their music, especially Mr. Rose.

Somehow I managed to order this album by mistake when I ordered the dresden dolls, but just to be sure I listened to it once through. Now, I am a pretty avid music lover, and most things I like - or at least I don't REALLY dislike. But as soon as I heard this, I knew I never wanted to hear it again. A lot of peole seem to like her, and she gets some great reviews, but maybe those people are just tired of the same recycled pop and confusing this nonsense with \\"originality\\". Its original all right. Originally bad. I guess its just not my sort of thing. The music is gloomy - creepy even. Her voice is erie in a way that grates on your nerves. It seems exactly like the sort of music the characters of \\"Crash\\" would listen to before they cracked up their cars and had sex in the wreckage.

I only wish she would make a follow-up -- I want more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"sensationally sultry","review":"I can't stop listening to this CD. Jill's voice is so sensual, rich, and mesmerizing, and the mixture of piano, violin, and occasional drumbeat is just so perfect for creating a darkly delightful mood. The lyrics are Edward Gorey meets Dark Cabaret--elegant and witty, not overdone, with a dash of irony and whimsy. Favorites are: \\"Evil Night Together\\", \\"Fine Art of Poisoning\\", \\"The Proof\\" and the others are getting stuck in my head as well...in a deliciously dark way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perplexingly tedious","review":"I like the sound, I like the mood, and I like the look. Jill Tracy has a nice style and the accompanying orchestra seems quite competent. Yet somehow this music, for me, is blander than silence. The lyrics, though superficially colorful, seem mostly aimless, and worse, the dynamics are utterly limp. These musicians are clearly skilled, but if they've put any passion onto this disc, then I must not know where to look for it. With one or two exceptions, every song has the same plodding tempo and modest intensity, straight through. I know these songs are about death, but that doesn't mean they have to be dreary. Case in point: the self-titled album by the Dresden Dolls, upon purchase of which Amazon prompted me to buy Diabolical Streak. That album has all the cleverness, sorrow, and life that this one lacks, and then some."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pulling Your Eardrums Out","review":"My initial impression of this album is that it sounds campy as hell. Though the background music is actually pretty enjoyable, thus the 2 stars, but once Jill's voice saunters in, the blood-goth words that grate against the instrumentals come off as very cheesy and unconvincing. Actually, you could almost say that the vocals sound like a bad impression of Marylin Monroe. Almost.And though Jill and the Dresden Dolls are not exactly comparable, I currently have Dresden Dolls in my stereo, and given the choice, I would take the Dresden Dolls over Diabolical Streak every time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond a Prison Movie","review":"This is a prison movie that transcends being a prison movie. Its true subject is the mystery of human beings relationship to the power of authority which is the consummate mystery of the 20th century that has leeched into the 21st. Sean Connery is marvelous as expected, but if you have never seen Harry Andrews get his teeth into a role, you will be astounded. The mystery is illuminated but remains intact."},{"rating":"2","title":"A hot climb to the top of drama","review":"Saw this film the first time round on PBS as a kid. Was mostly wrapped up in the British dialogue on first viewing. Caught it again years later on TCM and as an adult, and was then able to understand the true drama of this gripping film set in a WW2 era British miliary prison in the searing North African desert. Became hooked from that point on. One of director Lumet's best, and in my opinion not given it's full due. Finally lucky to have found it on DVD through Amazon. As fellow inmates, the young Sean Connery is brilliant as Sgt. Roberts as is the equally youthful Ozzie Davis as Pvt. Jacko King. My recommendation is to come for the British-ness and dark humor, and stay for the drama and tense ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated WWII Drama","review":"The Hill, undeservingly, has been a much underrated Sean Connery movie. It was filmed in 1965, in black and white, and without any of the typical Hollywood special effects. It relied solely on the intense acting and brutal plot. British actor Harry Andrews, as Regimental Sgt. Maj. Bert Wilson was especially memorable. Non Brits may have a hard time understanding the heavy accent if they do not turn on the subtitles which were not available in the VHS version.

Moreover, I encountered errors in the manuscript due to little or no professional editing. More importantly, and in light of historical research, there is the lack of a table of contents.

A lot of people enjoy reading true history and that is what this book represents. I think it is great that he has shared these men's story with us. We should be greatful to all the men and women who fought and died in WWII. We should, also, charish every moment with veterans that we have because we are losing history everyday.

Why must she insist on growling her way through her songs just to sound bluesy? This results in a contorted exxpression on her face all the time. By the time this concert was staged, she has lost some of her vocal range. To compensate, she has resorted to weird phrasing in all the songs. Her hits are here but unrecognisable in the mess.

I walked the course again but carried the unit in my hand so I could feel the pendulum clicking; when it stuck (every few hundred feet), I had to shake it - sometimes quite hard - to start it working again. That time, it showed I had walked about 2.5 miles. Since I had to concentrate on the unit rather than my walking, I shelved it. I'm very disappointed with this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"AND WHEN SHE WAS BAD.....","review":"....she was excellent. The legendary Bette Davis stars as a wealthy woman who uses her tongue as a machete to slice & dice her three grown sons and their significant others. She will stop at nothing, including blackmail and quite possibly even murder, to retain her control over them and their lives. Based on the stage play, this ultra-black British comedy/drama takes place during one evening as Mrs.Taggert (Davis) has her annual wedding anniversary celebration (Mr.Taggert is deceased) with her family paying her the usual (and reticent) homage. When the youngest son's new girlfriend tries to exert her influence, things begin to go awry. Anchor Bay has offered a fine print that's worth owning. The film shows it's stage origins a bit but the British cast is great and Davis is magnificent in a very, very wicked role. You may want to see it again just to catch some of her lines as the script is pungent and full of verbal slap-downs. Enjoy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"I remember Mommie","review":"Bette Davis inhabits cruel matriarch Mrs. Taggart, a lady so mean she doesn't have a first name. She gathers her children (whom she refers to as her chicks) once a year to celebrate her Anniversary, whether of her marriage or widowhood is left to the imagination. Bette wiggles her way through this one, spewing honeyed venom at the cast and changing her eyepatch to suit her outfits. She also makes up for the lack of one eye by allowing the other one to upstage the rest of her- it widens in such mascara-laden shock so often one is afraid it will pop out and shoot across the room. All of this is played in lurid, living color, the better to appreciate Miss Davis' bright blue eye and slightly yellowed teeth: teeth she gleefully cuts on the rest of the cast.

If you are doing occasional pumping this product will probably accomodate you. However if you plan to return to work full or part time after your maternity leave it up and want to pump to supply your baby with breast milk while you are away from him/her or need to build your milk suppy I recommend a quality electric double pump.I am a first time mom and had no idea what I was getting into with nursing and had I known, I would have skipped this kit and gone straight to the electric pump.

I even saw one mentioning that she had to switch to a different brand because of reflux.The bottom line is... They are convenient for breast feeding and interchanging, but they cause an extreme amount of gas when feeding, due to the awkward nipples that are provided. The bulbous base of the nipple, causes their lips to suck in air around the sides. The entire time they feed, you can actually hear tons of air flowing into their stomach. 5 stars for a product that \\"I just bought today\\" doesn't mean anything if you can only use it 1 day, because your child is screaming from colic due to the aweful engineering.I'd like to see more return reviews from people that used these more than a week."},{"rating":"1","title":"H.O.R.R.I.B.L.E","review":"We've got Valerie who lacks spines and is very uninteresting, drab. Then we've got Gabriel here, king of the snakes and brujo, who is an oversexed macho seducer. Valerie generally seems to look down on all the inhabitants of New Mexico, very WASP. The one exception is Gabriel, whom she lusts for. Not very original. The whole story is a dragged out love affair between them. It tries to have a plot but doesn't. It keeps on going on about the wonderful sex they're having, and how much they lust for each other, but it doesn't contain much else. There's no point in reading this. Plot? None. Characters? Not realistic, nor interesting. If you like books of this ilk, fantasy-romance, I'd advise you to instead go for Laurence Hamilton's Anita Blake series.

Everything is covered in a single source- hull, chassis, powerplant, suspension, turret, armament, armor, equipment- it's all there.Two minor irritants, first is that many of the line drawings have not been translated from the German orginal.

A variety of artist's journal pages are displayed and the narratives describe the process and the message the artist is trying to convey. The book describes techniques that anyone can use and suggests supplies and techniques to get you started. It is not a step-by-step how-to book, but I've gotten so many ideas from it.

Unfortunately, the reality is that the game client is big, slow, buggy, unstable, and the graphics are poor. I could live with the poor graphics, in fact I was expecting them, but the playability just isn't there. It takes forever to load, uses ridiculous amounts of RAM, and once you get in the game it's hard to tell friend from foe.Also I wonder if anyone beta tested this game. It seems like there are some pretty basic bugs that could have been fixed prior to release. For instance, if the install path for the game has a space in the name (like Program Files) you can only play offline. The fix is to uninstall and reinstall to a different path. Also the game hangs on launching under Windows 2000 unless you rename a particular folder so that it doesn't try to play the intro movie.After 6 more months of patches this game might be worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Please","review":"This game had promise but now due to certain changes, it is no longer something for the casual gamer to enjoy.

The only way to get any action is to play as a rifleman which basically means you're nothing but cannon fodder for any tank you might encounter.

Plus, the game itself has graphics of a snes game and consist of nothing but tank battles. It takes about ten minutes for the game to load and sometimes it takes thirty minutes to find where people are actually fighting.

It's easily the best idea I've seen in the last decade. Imagine a game that simulates the entire scope of the Second World War - ground, sea, and air. Very cool.Sadly, the game itself doesn't measure up to the idea. First, there are staggering hardware requirements that still don't provide smooth enough framerates for air-to-air combat at all times, numerous problems with the network and servers, and a log-in mechanism that requires your browser (eating up even more resources). But worse than all those are the damaged physics models (the tanks feel like they are made of styrofoam) and the fact that real-life tactics don't work while gamey tactics do work.Having said all that, this game still has promise.

My set up met the recommended specification and my PC just can't handle it.

While some players will no doubt be able to find sufficient motivation to overlook or ignore them, most will not. Hopefully future games will make the persistent battlefield concept work and learn from the mistakes of WWII Online.

The concept of this was so impressive that it alone earns bonus points.But, sadly, that massive concept was also the downfall of it.

Ultima Online and EverQuest had lots of lagging issues, but at least *the game* still worked. Apparently, StrategyFirst didn't consider this when they released WWII Online.I have a PIII 450 with 128 megs of RAM. It just barely exceeds the minimum requirements, but, according to StrategyFirst, the game *should* work. Unfortunately, it doesn't. When I'm not being booted out to the Windows desktop, I'm trying to figure out how to get the game to load. It doesn't look like this is restricted to low-end computers, either. I've seen a PIII 700mhz computer with 386 megs of RAM do the exact same thing.WWII Online COULD have been one of the best massively multiplayer online games released in years. In my opinion, it turned out to be the worst. I give the developers 1 star for effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY YET","review":"This game has great potential, but has enormous problems:The 'minimum requirements' for use are frankly wrong - you will not be able to play this game without AT LEAST the recommended 'specs'. There are frequent crashes for a lot of users, even with high-end hardware. Most features mentioned in advertising and even on the game box itself are missing. The game is basically unfinished. Patches have been promised by the developers to add SOME of the features like rank (and the weapons listed in the manual), but they are slow to materialize.This game will be good if it survives 6 months, but don't buy it yet unless you really understand what you'll be in for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just gets better & better","review":"Yes this game stunk when it first was released.However, with version 1.6 almost ready fro release, this game is 1000 times better than it's original release. The game play is awesome, the scope and depth of the battle field is incredible and the community is very helpful and welcoming.It DOES require a lot of horsepower from your pc. The guy who left the review regarding framerate issues, just needs more ram. I have 384 ram on a P3 933 on a standard DSL connection and I experience very little lag. Version 1.6 is currently being tested for release and the memory improvements that they have made make it so that you'll be fine on 256 ram."},{"rating":"2","title":"World War 2 Buff? This is a Time Machine..","review":"The game did have a bad launch, but it is updated often, and the last patch is UNREAL. Imagine if you will. You spawn as infantry and hop aboard an Opel. The truck is full and other Opels are loading up. There are Halftracks pulling 88's and Paks you're in a real convoy. As you near the battle there are tanks flanking the enemy city on multiple sides. There are Stuka's bombing the enemy from the sky. The air is controlled by your 109's. In the river your boats are moving in with troops. All this and every one of them is controled by another person. You can drive a tank and your friend can operate the main gun. You fly the plane and your buddy's the tail gunner, or how about the Bombadeer? Visit the game's web page and look at some of the screen shots and videos. This game ROCKS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Beta Test","review":"I bought this game a week after it was released and have been playing it ever since. I love it, and yet I can't recommend it! Very few of the \\"real War\\" features have been implimented so far. Crashes abound, and the game is basically in a beta test mode.Still... If you're into the subject and like team oriented action, there's a lot of GREAT FUN here! When it's working, the action is gritty and intense. Just bring a halftrack full of patience!Bottom line: This WILL be a GREAT GAME. Someday.System Notes: Myself and many others play on 56k dial-up. A good connection is important (I like at least 49k), but RAM is the key to FPS in this game.

The characters and their situations felt real. I don't want to give parts of this movie away, but there are a few interactions with the guys that I found hilarious.I wish the DVD had more features--actually, any features.

I honestly tried to watch this movie, but I had to fast forward through most of it because of the insipid dialogue and trite premise.

It also fit my father, who is 6'6 and a very big man, we just had to not buckle the waist band.The only downside is that now Grifin is holding his head up, he wants more of a view of the world, but when I put him acing out, he was very very un happy.

If the carrier positions the infant upright with legs hanging down and support at the base of the child's spine, it puts undue stress on the spine causing a condition called spondylolisthesis, and compromises developing curves in the spine.When a baby wants to be more upright to see the world around him (around 4-5 months of age), the carrier should allow him to sit cross-legged, so his weight is dissipated through his legs and hips as opposed to the style of carrier that has the baby's legs hanging down, where again the young spine has to bear the entire weight of the child, and can cut into the baby's circulation by holding the legs apart in a bowlegged manner during the important early months when the pelvis is soft and forming.http://www.earthbaby.com/babywearingindex.html"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fictional biography of a decadent aristocrat","review":"This is a fictional account of the life of a real person, the decadent pederast Count Fersen, who lived on Capri because even the French would not tolerate him.

They go from where you have to turn the speakers alll the way up, to where you just about blow them out. The only part on the record i love is the final \\"Pesante\\" track which just sounds amazing. But the rest of it is just... too digital-sounding for me. I prefer an organic, live-sounding recording that is not altered (except the usual mics which are used live anyway).

Great price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Prisoners of the Mountains","review":"I thought this movie was decent but nothing spectacular. It kept me awake but just on the verge. The few comical scenes helped to keep me interested as did the totally unexpected ending which was probably the best part of the entire movie. I thought the acting in this movie was just mediocre at best. Overall I was not impressed with the movie but the few good scenes earned it two stars over just the lonely one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where was the War?","review":"This is a film about two soldiers captured during the Chechen war. Normally the Chechen rebels don't take prisoners but one of the men is hoping to trade the soldiers for his son who is being held by the Russians. As time passes the younger of the two soldiers, Ivan, begins to feel for the rebels and to wish he could live among them. The soldiers are told to write to their families and have them ask the commander to trade them for the rebel's son. Ivan's mother tries but ultimately fails in her attempt. Eventually the rebels get tired to waiting and kill the older soldier. Ivan gets free and runs for the hills ending the movie with his escape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hey look! A war movie I like!","review":"Like many of the other reviewers, I went into the movie thinking it would be about the horrors of war. But it was much more than that. It was a story about prejudices and how they can exacerbate already terrible situations. It was remarkable to see the interactions between the Chechens and their Russian prisoner. On a human level, they were so similar. In another life, they could have been friends. But in that moment, they were enemies, and no matter how comfortable each were acting, you could tell they never forgot that.The movie started out very slow, but toward the middle it started to pick up. There were some very funny moments. I'm not sure they were supposed to be funny, but I had a good laugh. Overall, not a bad movie, but not for everybody."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully Russian!","review":"I saw this film last spring when I was living in Amsterdam. It was so beautiful that I had to see it again. Even though the film was in Russian with subtitles in Dutch (it's not a film with a lot of dialogue), I understood the plot quite well. I found it to be sweet, heart-breaking, endearing and funny. It's too bad that they haven't released it in American format yet. The soundtrack is also quite nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"stopped working after 2 months","review":"This was my second Nike watch.

I would try to press the buttons for timechange and backlighting, but nothing would happen. After \\"troubleshooting\\" this with Nike support, they said it was covered under warranty and I could have it fixed for $8.95 + my shipping costs! Also I was disappointed that when I described the problem, they seemed to know about it from previous versions of the watch.

They seem to be struggling through the lines, because that's what the script said, not because they feel anything, and so the emotion just isn't there. The worst was Ethan Hawke-he was more like an impassionate, objective narrator of a PBS history special than a tortured Hamlet (and Hamlet's problem is that he feels so much and has too much emotion to know how to deal with it). Steven Seagal could have delivered more emotion for crying out loud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oddly detached","review":"I found this movie oddly distant and detached. The actors are for the most part good and I was surprised how much I liked Ethan Hawke. But for some reason, the film never engaged me. I always felt \\"outside\\" the action. Strangely enough, the Kenneth Branagh version, even though it is twice as long, seemed shorter because it involved me.The only exceptions were the scenes involving Sam Shepard as Hamlet's father's ghost. Contrary to some portrayals, you can palpably feel his rage at his brother's betrayal. I wish the entire movie had been as good as his scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"What were they thinking?","review":"I am so tired of \\"Rock and Roll Shakespeare.\\" I am all for modern interpretations of Shakespeare - I've even done a couple - but these actors, particularly Bill Murray, could not have seemed less interested in the material. \\"Concept Shakespeare\\" never works because you have to fit the play into the concept, and not the other way around. Ethan Hawke is a good actor, but woefully miscast in this. Also, setting up Denmark as a corporation as opposed to a country sets the stakes very low, and makes us not care what happens after a while. In this version, Hamlet should have just called the police when he had the evidence and then gone out for a martini."},{"rating":"1","title":"Modernization creats confusion","review":"Although I have throughlly enjoyed other more traditional adaptations of Hamlet, I was lost by the over modernization. When placed in the steril, artsy setting the charictors seem to be over dramatising trite inconviences or playing a continous joke bon those gulliable enough to believe them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Got to join the dissenting party","review":"Obviously this film has a legion of detractors ...-- I count myself among their ranks. Just one more criticism I haven't seen anyone else mention -- Ethan says \\"to whose bourne no traveler ever returns,\\" instead of \\"from whose...\\" To me this single example sums up how sorry this rendition of Hamlet is. The leading actor, the director, and everyone else associated with the making of this awful movie failed to correct Hamlet's misplacement of a preposition that dramatically changes the meaning of what is probably the most famous group of lines in all of English literature. In my humble opinion, sloppy work like this destroys the whole point of producing a play like Hamlet. If they're not trying to reach an audience who knows the work and cares about it, then who are they trying to reach? This film has no substance. It's a bunch of posers trying to pretend that they're making something new and unique while really they look silly."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Adaptation","review":"There are just some actors who just shouldn't potray the lead role in one of the world's best loved plays. Ethan Hawke is one of them. I've been exhaustively studying the play Hamlet for years and never have I come across an adaptation so poorly done. The movie lacked in emotion and sincerity...it sounded more like some bland read-through of a scipt during rehearsal time. Perhaps the best portrayal done was by Julia Stiles in the role of Ophelia, but even that was not at it's best. This is a movie that would make true Hamlet fans cringe."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderfully inventive and accessible \\"Hamlet\\"","review":"A terrific updating, using Shakespeare's language, but set in moderncorporate New York City. Beautifully shot, on a shockingly low budgetfor it's look, with amazing use of New York locations.Hawke is very good, and most of the rest of the cast, including Bill Murray (to mysurprise, doing Shakespeare), Kyle MacLachlan, and Diane Venora are first rate.More important this is a re-telling that really uses the film medium,and makes us re-think a classic in a new way, while being terrificallyentertaining along the way. It makes the simple humanity and complexideas under the Shakespearian poetry as clear as any production I'veever seen, on stage or film.Obviously controversial, and not for purists, but well worth seeing todecide for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really wanted to like it","review":"Really I did. The setting intrigued me, and I wanted to think that Hamlet could be done in a contemporary corporate setting. Perhaps it can, but, until I saw this, I had no idea that Shakespeare could suck so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"To avoid, unless on medication","review":"I loved every Ethan Hawke's movies until now. This is a very outplaced Hamlet, very poor acting or actor-direction....I mean.. throwing out the lines without any feeling on it.. just like reading a postcard somewhere??? ...Now.. whos to blame? The actors are good and many here... so what's wrong?I think the director or the one that made the script is to blame here.... or.... maybe even the actors... ...Hamlet's father appears in a cigar machine? Come on!!! And look... just look at the air of surprise of Hamlet when he sees the ghost for the first time.Was Ethan on medication? In fact... were everyone here on medication? ...Plain ridiculous and quite entertaining to watch such a movie with such an amount of lack of feeling and expression."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid and interesting","review":"Each detail is worked in to the modern setting brilliantly. The camera work is excellent. The actors perform well and deliver the classic dialogue in a genuine manner. Top to bottom this is a solid film, an interesting adaptation, and is probably as entertaining and thought provoking as the material was intended to be by its sublime author in 1601."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG Disappointment","review":"Terrible! The sound quality is so bad that I found myself turning the volume up repeatedly just to understand the words. Background noise is too loud. The movie is visually interesting, but if you can't hear and understand the language, what's the point of Shakespeare? I was really looking forward to seeing a truly modern interpretation of Hamlet, but I couldn't even watch this the whole way through."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was aweful.","review":"The movie was stomache-turning. Hamlet is a wonderful play, but the movie [stunk]. Setting it in the year 2000 was one of the most idiotic things I've ever seen. Anyone who enjoyed it has serious problems, and cannot really understand the play."},{"rating":"2","title":"best new drama","review":"Very good film to put in context of world and U.S. events of September and October 2001. Ethan Hawke is great - as is everyone else in the film. To understand - or not to understand may be the question. The young star certainly takes us beyond the cliches of what we sometimes hear on t.v. or from leaders. He is a moral force of a younger generation who definitely makes changes not just by alliances and scheme (as new game shows make us believe) but by dispair, love, and truth. It seems that \\"they know not what they can do.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A Hamlet for My Generation","review":"Ok. I admit it. I was a virgin. I was in Blockbuster and having never read or seen Hamlet I decided to be literary. And I was completely blown away!! It was one of the most enjoyable movie watching experiences of recent memory. I identified completely with Ethan Hawke as Hamlet, and the whole cast (except for Bill Murray).This version of Hamlet is perfect for anyone who has been a college slacker since the 70's and has felt the psychological and philosophical dilemma's that that place in our society engenders. The twin joys of this version are 1) the transcendent beauty of Shakespeare's language; and 2) the univerisality of Hamlet's struggles, which transcends the generations. It may not be for Hamlet scholars, but this one was done for us, and if your one of us, you will enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Film Class","review":"I had the option to view this for a paper in my film class. Interesting take on old school Hamlet. I enjoyed it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please read the play before acting the part","review":"Eathan Hawke manages to turn some of the most beautiful poetry written in English into the most deadpan and apathetic drivel I have ever heard. Perhaps he was sleeping (or the director was). I've seen a version of _Hamlet_ mocked by the characters of Mystery Science Theater 3000 that puts this version to shame. Save your time and money. You'll do better reading the Cliff's Notes or watching _Strange Brew_."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you don't like it the first time, watch it again.","review":"The best Hamlet ever. Mel Gibson's Hamlet seemed to breath new life into a tired vehicle, but Ethan Hawke's version not only enlivens, but also makes it believable. It is the only version where the audience really doubts Hamlet's sanity, and Hawke pulls it off magnificently. There is a wonderful mental ambiguity that emerges from this adaptation. Usually Hamlet gets mad, in this one Hamlet goes mad, and we follow. Very believable.This Hamlet is like fine wine, it gets better each time you watch it. The first time you see it, the layers of novelty and creative innovation are so thick, it is almost intimidating or overwhelming. You can be absorbed by the costuming and sets and miss the plot. Try it again. It gets better everytime.The acting is superb throughout."},{"rating":"1","title":"TO BAD I COULDN'T SEE THIS...","review":"Well, first of all, I rented it on Amazon Instant Video and it kept freezing up on me. When it finally stopped freezing, I watched it a bit and couldn't stomach it anymore. It's always good for people to take creative liberties. However this didn't work for me. I just didn't think the dialogue worked with the scenery. I felt that the actors were having trouble making it real and believing it for themselves. Perhaps someone else will like it though."},{"rating":"1","title":"And it had so much potential...","review":"Contrary to the Amazon review, this rendition of Hamlet was quite disappointing. Hats off to Ethan Hawke for great acting. My compliments end there. Bill Murray was awkward. Someone just needed to steal that hat Ethan Hawke wouldn't take off. Apparently the makers of this movie were overbudget...this assumption stemming from the blantant advertizing throughout. Does every video in a blockbuster store have to have the logo on it? Do we have to have the pop machine as the focal point instead of the actors? Subliminal messages seem far less obtrusive."},{"rating":"1","title":"For the love of god, please don't waste your time or money.","review":"This version of Hamlet is horrid. Everyone involved should quit the movie business and go apply at Taco Bell. It has less to do with Shakespeare's play of the same name then Strange Brew! Instead of watching this warped, massacred, and boring rendition of Hamlet you should just take off your shoe, kick a wall as hard as you can and start reciting all of the lines from the play that you can remember. You'll certainly get more lines than the actors did."},{"rating":"1","title":"An abomination","review":"Run, do not walk, from this unwatchable version of Hamlet. Set in modern-day New York City, but retaining all of the play's references to lords and castles, this film is the most ridiculous and contrived adaptation of Shakepeare I have ever suffered through. Hawke plays Hamlet as a pouty gen-Xer, whose soliloquys are played back on a hand-held recorder. Must been easier to hide the cue cards that way. When Hamlet and Laertes pull out fencing swords on a New York rooftop, it's true eye-rolling time...although not as horrid as when Bill Murray, playing Polonius, hams his way through \\"to thine own self be true.\\" An awful, awful movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"short, sweet, and to the point.","review":"Horrible... HORRIBLE movie. If they were going to modernize the story, they could have modernized everything. The fact that they were still speaking old English was stupid! It just didn't work. And, good god, the whole \\"GET THEE TO A NUNNERY!\\" scene was atrocious. Finish the fight over an answering machine? Blasphemy. HORRIBLE horrible horrible movie. I would give it zero stars if that was an option."},{"rating":"2","title":"What the heck just hit me?","review":"When I first began watching this movie it was a let down, I had been expecting so much more. I almost shut it off but my husband convinced me to keep watching and....I LOVED IT.I am not much of a Julia Stiles fan but when she is lamenting over her father's death and casting polorids of flowers to the ground, I amost cried with her. Her performance there is worth owning the movie in my opinion. I recommend you get through the somewhat dull beginnig and see the masterpiece of the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"LET ME NOT THINK ON IT !!!!","review":"In the immortal words of Kurtz from \\"Apocalypse Now\\" ---\\"The horror! The horror!\\" This has got to be the worst Hamlet ever. I suppose it's worth seeing for that reason alone. I mean, who wants to listen to a voice-over of \\"To be or not to be\\" while a kid wanders through a video store? I can see kids wandering blank-eyed through the video store at my local [Video Store]. I will say, however, that Bill Murray was an amazing Polonius and the Mousetrap sequence was very inventive. But after that's all over you still have to endure the rest - absolutely AWFUL! Back to Murray - you'd think that Bill Murray as Polonius would be a super-buffoon, but he actually came off like a really nice, concerned Dad-type. I actually felt bad when Polonius got killed, for the first time ever. If you're serious about your Shakespeare, do not expose yourself to this one. You will writhe in anguish."},{"rating":"1","title":"How do you ruin a classic?...Watch this and see.","review":"By far the worst interpretation of Hamlet I've ever seen, and a terrible film in its own right. You can be as open-minded as you want about re-interpretations of Shakespeare, but this film was more than ludicrously produced: they actually had the cajones to put BILL MURRAY in the role of Polonius, and strangely enough I think he was channeling his character from \\"Caddyshack,\\" the way he mumbled through his lines. Ethan Hawke delivers his usually half-hearted, bored-with-his-job, GenXer performance. I had high hopes for this film, but it was so over-the-top maudlin that I almost couldn't bear it. There's a difference between exhibiting your interpretation of a classic drama and simply making a film just to see it done--this version of Hamlet is sadly the latter."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst version of Hamlet yet.","review":"I've seen at least 4 different productions of Hamlet and this is definitely the worst. The artistic choices aren't bad, but the actors in this version have no idea how to read Shakespeare. The dialogue sounds stilted and gets in the way of everything this production is trying to accomplish. Since it's all of the actors, I have to put most of the blame on the director. As both an actor and a student who's spent 2 years studying Shakespeare generally and Hamlet in particular, I can assure you that this version isn't worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's pretty much a mess","review":"The movie is only worth watching for Maclachlan's performance. He is fantastic in it and he oozes charisma. I can't stand Hawke's scenes because he sounds like reading off a laundry list and he does not look the part. The actors for Gertrude and Laertes are not bad. Murray and Stiles are aweful. The direction is terrible, we are constantly seeing people's back side when they are talking, and there's no special effect for the ghost and the actor who played the ghost did not sound ghostly. It's like they are not even trying. Yeesh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Modern day Hamlet","review":"This modern day version of Hamlet is quite interesting in its own way. I had watched this movie with the expectation of modern language, and so was pleasantly suprised to find that Shakespeare's language had been (more or less) preserved.I think that if the language had been modernized that this adapatation could have been a little more acceptable. But the younger actors, including Ethan Hawke and Julia Stiles, just couldn't seem to handle Shakespeare's lines properly. Many of their lines were rendered rather woodenly.Had the producers chosen better seasoned Shakespearian actors this movie would have had some real potential. It's a shame that star-power could so blight a promising film."},{"rating":"1","title":"A movie that never should have been made","review":"I don't know what these people were thinking, but this movie is about as much like Shakespeare's Hamlet as an Elephant is like a chimpanzee. Hamlet's to be or not to be speech in a blockbuster, not even close. This movie uses all the tricks and gadgets from the twentieth century to completely dilute or better yet pollute the orginal play. The acting was lackluster, no emotion whatsoever. The screenplay should was lacking in all areas. Try Branagh's version of Hamlet for what a modern movie about Hamlet should be. This movie was a waste of everyone's time from the start to the end. The only good thing that can come out of this is that a few actors can now add a Shakespearean role to their resumes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful- with one priceless moment","review":"My only real comment on this horrific version of Hamlet is the what this production does to Hamlet's soliliquy.One of the most celebrated scenes in the world's cultural history takes place- in a 7-11/Gas-N-Sip with Ethan Hawke wearing one of those grunge rock Peruvian wool caps with earflaps and tiedowns walking through aisles of fruitloops, Slim-Jims and cokes! A priceless moment of unintended comedy.Horrible rendition of Hamlet though."},{"rating":"1","title":"To Yawn or Not to Yawn, That is the Question.","review":"This is the absolute worst Shakespeare adaptation I have ever viewed; it was so horrid, I could only watch 45 minutes of it before I took it back to BlockBuster.The acting (?) was pitiful; Ethan Hawke meandered about the screen in what looked like a pointless daze. Claire Daines spent 90% of her camera time in an open-mouthed, slackjawed stupor, apparently attempting to garner an Oscar for Best Fly-Catching Performance. Bill Murray acted like he was still singing in a lounge on Saturday Night Live.If you can even get past the acting (?), there's the problem of the story - as in - where did it go? Quite a bit of the original storyline seems to be missing, making the title of \\"Hamlet\\" to be one of major deceit.Save your $3.50 and rent the Mel Gibson or Kenneth Branaugh version and let this one collect dust mites on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"what is with you people?","review":"I don't understand why this movie got so many good reviews.I guess i must presume that most of you people have never read the play or even studied it. you see hamlet is a serious character a deep thinker. i loved 10 things about you and the new romeo & juliet but this movie is absolute garbage i'm sure will shakespeare is rolling in his grave because, to be or not to be is a very famous quote and for ethan hawke to mutter it in a blockbuster video store looking like a zombie makes the statement completly worthless. if you love the play you'd have to be brain dead to enjoy this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid.","review":"I think that many of the other reviewers have hit the nail on the head. So I won't bore you with the small points.

As I read it, I realized that we all make quick and often inaccurate assumptions about one another, even when from the same culture. This book forces us to look at all of the ways in which we can oversimplify the behaviors or appearances of others and often jump to false and dangerous conclusions. It is certainly a book that anyone working with people from cultures other than their own (that means most of us)should read. it speaks both to the complexity and importance of the work and challenges us to look more carefully at what we do."},{"rating":"2","title":"A quiet, simple story of love","review":"This is a sweet story about a big topic: interracial romance and marriage.

Part A is that at the time this film was made anyone who made any kind of an objective and reasonably thorough investigation would have known that the world was in factswimming in oil. Part B is that since the film was made it is no longer required that one make any investigation. The news of the vastamount of oil all over the place, particularly here in North America, is shouted at us from every media outlet. Kindergartners are nowprobably quite aware of the Black Gold boom in North Dakota. None of this should hurt the film though, despite the fact that the wholething is not merely predicated on the fantasy that there is a looming oil shortage, but about that shortage.

In any event, Ruppert has some thoughts worthy of consideration intermingled within a lot of unsubstantiated conjecture presented as fact. As a sidebar and given Ruppert's self-proclaimed credentials, his often use of vulgarities during the interview is a decided put-off; a truly educated man does not need to resort to gutter language to express his emotions on an issue -- in fact, the emotion displayed (including the tearful breakdown) causes the viewer to question Ruppert's stability and therefore his grasp of the issue, his research, his conclusions, and, finally, his credibility."},{"rating":"1","title":"...and TIME!","review":"Their ONE source gives his own credentials, for god's sake!I expected SO much more from this documentarian.

China will sit still for that I am sure. Anyway you will be saddened after watching this. Why? We have been lied to for many years. Everyone knows that.

That was about $28,000 too much in my opinion. I'm sorry that those people got ripped off. I'm not sure what Michael Ruppert's agenda is, but the majority of his opinions appear to have been pulled from thin air. It really pained me to have to give this film even 1 star - the minimum allowed.

The first thing he needs to do is offer some proof for his outlandish claims. He doesn't even really offer a motive for the government's actions.

He hits on points that effect our society as a whole. We have been consuming to the point of sucking the planet dry of all of it's natural resources and have lost touch with the Earth and it's other inhabitants. I actually cringed on a couple of parts of this documentary because it is apparent that the world is actually already reacting to the fact that pretty soon we would have consumed all of the oil on the planet, and when that happens God help us all.

The majority of the shots were various angles on Michael sitting on a single chair in the middle of an otherwise empty warehouse. The viewer has to endure his continual preoccupation with cigarettes. Michael's only message was that the entire system is going to break because the world is going to run out of oil. This will be followed by mass chaos and mass starvation, war, and disruption of all the social aspects of life. He seems to fix most of his blame on George Bush. Michael's brand of alarmism is disingenuous, in that he has essentially given up on the system. The final views are him in his home that he is about to loose because of past due taxes and bills that he cannot pay. Poor Michael! While there is truth in his thesis of the purported coming system collapse, he lacks not only credibility, but also the ability to develop his claims in a convincing fashion.

Bush. Cheney. CIA. Big oil. Oooooh.FYI, we went to Iraq not for Oil and NOT because we alleged they had anything to do with 9/11. We went because we all, left and right, USA and Europe believed Iraq had WMDs and if they did, that could make 9/11 look pale in comparison.

For instance did you know that, after the game in Fenway Park some of the away teams go into the Green Monster scoreboard, and sign there names.

It attempts to find casual mechanisms resulting in unhappiness, but fails to adequately untangle the many sources of unhappiness and several times places emphasis on clearly the wrong one. The book is also extremely redundant, and could have been condensed to half its size. Lastly, many of the studies cited needed more justification and explanation.

This video has lots of moves and is well put together, but it's tough to just follow in a \\"do this first, do this second\\" mode. Also, while the instructor shows everything just fine, it might have been helpful to have other participants at a different angle doing the moves at the same time. For example, I have some yoga disks that have the class facing you and the teacher facing sideways and I realize how helpful that is having seen a disk with just one instructor. Overall, I was able to use the DVD to get into a routine (I hope I am doing everything right; it seemed much easier with a younger body, that's for sure), but getting going was a bigger commitment than I thought it would be."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice","review":"since walking is a problem I went to this.It really helps and I enjoy it a lot get upfeeling good and the warm up is wonderfuleven if I don't get a chance to do the forms"},{"rating":"2","title":"good instructions for a beginner","review":"Having not taken a tai chi class before, I found this video to be a good introduction.

Scott Cole explains all the excerises slowly and very well. Because I am beginner to Tai Chi, I am a bit slow in preforming the movements. I have noticed more flexibility, but I caution people to stop when it begins to hurt. The swinging movement of the arms caused my neck area to hurt, probably due to stress I was undergoing and just trying to keep up. I loved this and will continue to follow Tai Chi."},{"rating":"2","title":"Owned one for years now buying another.","review":"This is a great tool for those who carry one all the time. It is small enough to fit in my jeans pocket, yet big enough to actually get something done. The pliers and scissors combo is handy and all the screwdriver tips work well. The blade isn't bad and holds a edge ok (what can you expect from a knife in this price range). One side of the tool is thicker than the other so at first you might thing it is broken. This is normal and doesn't affect any functions (and saves a little weight)."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for us lightweights","review":"I don't need a tool that can do everything except have it's own battery pack...I just need something that will help me tighten screws on instruments and tighten a loose nut occasionally.

Now I've bought 3 of them. Of the 3, I like the Juice S2 best, but I'm probably going to give it to my brother for 3 reasons: 1) It's a really nice gift - and I think he'll love it. 2) I can get by well enough with the Squirt S4, and 3) The one thing that I do most frequently with pliers, I cannot do with the Juice's pliers because the jaws don't close flush with each other along their entire length. The jaws of the pliers close tight at the tip only. If you need to straighten thin items - such as a row of pins on an electronic DIP chip, the Juice is not ideal. Aside from that (which few people need to do), it's wonderful. I especially like the way the two sides can be unfolded into a line with the screwdriver blades extended from either end. That gives you a screwdriver almost the same length as a normal screwdriver, that feels like a screwdriver in the hand, and is slim enough to get into most spaces."},{"rating":"2","title":"A touching tale about the need to be loved & friendship.","review":"I found this in the discard pile at my local library, and 'adopted' it.

It will likely not go down as one of the classics of the 20th Century, but it sure was entertaining and a happy way to spend an evening.

BUT I can only get 5 muffin wells sprayed before it's 15 pumps. So for 12 muffins that's 45 pumps. And the spray IS uneven--it doesn't coat well at all.

However, after using just a few times, I never get a mist. Just a lame squirt of oil, regardless of how much or how little I pump the cannister. What a waste of money! What a waste of time!

Some reviewers warned that the nozzle would clog up, but we thought if we carefully followed the directions and warnings given by other reviewers we could avoid this fate.No luck. After only one use, the nozzle clogged up. It now just spews out globs of oil and we don't use it at all.

End of story."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT kitchen device","review":"I absolutely love this device. You just fill it up with your oil of preference (I use extra virgin oliveoil) and use it instead of no-stick spray, or to cover homemade fries, evenly spray a salad etc. None of those additives you get from the store bought cans and you also save the environment since you can simply refill it when it runs out.The can's pressure is created by pumping the lid up and down a few times (which i did not figure out immidiately) and then it is good to go.HIGHLY recommend this! You use less oil (=healthier and better for the purse) + you skip out on all the chemical stuff that are added to no-stick sprays."},{"rating":"2","title":"gift","review":"I gave this item as a gift and the giftee LOVES it, I already own one and am not as crazy about it mainly cause of clogging problems, but I've had mine a really long time so maybe they have solved this problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looove it!","review":"I love the idea of using a high quality oil in a reusable spritzer, The only thing I can find \\"wrong\\" with it is that occasionally the nozzle seems to clog up a bit and the spritz turns into a stream."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it a lot!","review":"I really like the Misto!

When I make waffles or use other non stick surface, I spray it with canola oil. On the waffle irons, and other non stick machines like making sandwhiches, etc., the clean up is easy. You don't get that nasty brown and black stuff left over from the heat that you get with Pam. Clean up is so simple because the heating surfaces actually stays clean.

I read all directions and followed them to the letter, to no avail. The white plastic top broke on two of them. All three stopped spraying, first coming out in a stream or dribble, then not even that. I thought they were getting plugged with some unseen particles, so I tried straining the oil and cleaning the unit, which was a difficult messy job with no better results. And I, also, noticed that the oil tended to become rancid in very short order, probably due to the fact that you are pressurizing (forcing) air into the oil. In addition, the squared off edges on the top hurt your hand when you have to pump the unit. Now, I'm back to generic \\"Pam\\" or using a dribble of oil and a silicone basting brush. Don't waste your money like I did..."},{"rating":"1","title":"pure junk","review":"I cannot figure out for the life of my how others have gotten this thing to work.

It's not as bad as I first thought. Other brand misters I had I was able to fill with oil whereas this unit really can't cope with any more than half full (I am sure other people put that info in their reviews as well).

If it is used daily, it can work fine, but if it is not used for even a week, I have found that the spray simply doesn't work. When I first used the Olive Oil Sprayer and it stopped working, I called the company and received instructions to get it pumping. Unfortunately, I found that the time it takes to clean out the system and get it operational is better spent doing other things, so I simply use an alternative to spraying the oil. I really wanted to use this can all the time, but it became a nuisance. I do have a little sprayer which does work great and was sold in a martini set.

Well you get the picture.However, I was doomed to disappointment. I filled it the first time with best-quality olive oil. The first spray worked just fine. And the second. But come to use it the third time and the plastic \\"guts\\" were broken -- irretrievably. A costly kitchen gizmo obliterated by a 5-cent part.I'd love to see this product relaunched with interior workings to match its exterior. Until then, guess I'll just have to keep using Pam and dreaming of something better.Sigh..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap plastic on pump breaks easily","review":"We loved this product... until it broke that is (and after only 3 months of occasional use).

I don't know that a new one would look this bad after we would have had it for a year.

Looks like we'll be shopping locally."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good environmentally friendly product","review":"I've been doing what others suggest and releasing the pressure after each use, and it's been working great for months. On the very minor downside, it takes a little while to get used to the exact amount to pump it--after a few times you'll kind of get a feel for how much resistance is ideal. And it's not as even a spray as Pam or stuff like that, it's more a spattering of droplets than an even misting, but it serves the same purpose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work very well, then it broke","review":"I was excited to use this product instead of having to buy non-stick aerosol sprays, but when I used it, the spray was very blotchy, not uniform, and kind of weak.

The worst part is my roommate grabbed it the bottom half dropped off and spilled oil all over the hardwood floor and carpet!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Guess I needed to learn the Tricks","review":"I really wanted to like this product. I bought it thinking I was going to love it. And I did, for a while.My problem is that you can only fill it half full of oil so it felt like I was constantly filling it with oil after very little use. In addition to that after you spray oil on your pan for a short amount of time, you have to stop and repump it to that it will continue to spray a fine mist. Also it quickly got clogged and as one reviewer has stated, once it is clogged; it's goodbye Misto. I used mine probably less than a year before we finally went back to buying already canned spray oils.I guess I should have read the reviews because it sounds like if you know the tricks and take the time to do the work such as loosening the top, you will be able to use this item for a long time.good luck to other purchasers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I am very disappointed in the performance of the Misto Sprayer. I like just a light mist of oil on veggies or for baking. This sprayer needs constant pumping and delivers dribbles of oil. It's a real chore to get it to work properly and not worth the time, effort and mess it makes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice inexpensive alternative","review":"So it costs about $5 for a aerosol can at many stores. For me these last about 3-4 months. Not sure how long this guy last quite yet. But i know it's not the same. I obviously dont get 1oz of oil in a aerosol can.It does however need to be pumped often. Which is easy and does not require you to open up the bottle or anything. Very simple. I use less oil then if I were to just pour a little in the pan. I like the item. I bought one for myself and one for my best friend. I paid $9.50 on Sept 12, 2012"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Concept... but mine doesn't work","review":"I received this right on time but was disappointed after the first day. It's far less substantial than the description made it out to be. The pressure works great - for about two seconds. In order to spray a pan of garlic bread, I have to stop after each piece and pump the canister back up. It doesn't spray very well, but it spits gobs of oil quite nicely. I filled it to the halfway point - and no more - and pumped as instructed.I'll experiment with it later to see if I can get it to work properly. Meanwhile, I can't claim to be a happy user."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea that doesn't work","review":"I've had several oil sprayers, the first of which was a Misto. I still think it's a wonderful idea. The problem is that any oil is so thick it doesn't readily \\"spray\\", even the light types. Instead, it comes out in an anemic stream. I did manage to get one working by cleaning it thoroughly and then mixing up a 1:1 mixture of oil to vinegar. That sprays beautifully, so a light salad dressing is definitely possible. Using this method, you could probably mix oil and enough water to be able to shake it and spray, knowing that it's not pure oil but still getting enough oil to do the job. An earlier review mentioned using a silicone brush, which for me is a better solution to minimal oil--one tool for multiple uses that cleans and stores easily. I won't be buying another oil sprayer, that's for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Misty might be a better product name","review":"The Misto really does spray olive oil out pretty evenly, but it doesn't come out like a typical spray bottle does. It's very misty, even more so than a cologne or perfume bottle. That's not necessarily a bad thing, it's just not what I expected.For me, it only means I have to spray a little bit longer. Aside from that, the Misto is very cool and a lot better than sloshing your bottle all over the pan."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this damn thing!","review":"I waited a few months to do my review, making sure I had quite a bit of use. So far so good though. I use this every time I'm in the kitchen, and have even used it on wood furniture. I personally use olive oil, but it seems like you can put any oil in there, which if used with canola, would be a cheap replacement for expensive non-stick cooking spray. Great product, definitely worth the buy. I give it 4 stars instead of 5 (since I doubt they make these in America)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be called \\"sputtero\\"","review":"Maybe I was overly optimistic, but I kind of expected a product named Misto to produce something resembling a mist. Once in a while it does produce a mist, but not very often. Most of the time it puts out a sputtery spray of large droplets. Filled it only halfway, pumped it up good, it just doesn't work well.On the other hand, a Sputtero is still a somewhat useful device. It's a little easier to oil up foods for the grill with a Sputtero than with a paper towel or (ick) rubbing it on with your hands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works just fine","review":"Okay, you get a little arm workout when pumping this thing, but once the resistance is there, it sprays oil out like a charm. It really does the job when you need a light mist of olive oil on vegetables, or need to spray coat a pan for baking. Now I feel like there is just enough oil there, instead of my old method of using too much by putting things in a plastic bag w/oil & shaking it around, or dipping a paper towel in oil and smearing it over a pan to coat (kind of a waste). This item is pretty economical for what it does, it's attractive, and it works. If you do need to do multiple sprays the pumped air can run out pretty quickly, but that's a small thing. 4 stars for the little sprayer (5, minus 1 for the workout)."},{"rating":"2","title":"works as advertised","review":"Just got Misto and the thing actually works. It's very straightforward to use. The spray isn't as fine as with a can of Pam but I feel better not polluting the Earth with dozens of empty steel cans. The spray is good for everyday purposes. It's well made and even looks elegant with the stainless steel appearance so I can leave it on my countertop with my spices. It does take a little bit of work to pump air into the canister to get the pressure but it's small price to pay for a reusable canister. I put regular vegetable oil in it and used it for frying eggs. I plan to use it for a non-fried baked chicken recipe. Normally I drizzle oil on breaded chicken and bake it. I expect it will be better with Misto because I won't have to use as much oil. Great product. Wish I had discovered this years ago. Arrived in perfect condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price!","review":"I looked at a lot of reviews and decided to try this. I bought it at a local store for $9.99 but still the same model. I do like it. It keeps my husband from \\"dumping\\" oil in the pan for cooking. It doesn't seem to have the nice fine mist that Pam does, but it does a fairly good job for $10. And I like the non-aerosol taste! You do need to release the pressure before putting away. 10 pumps isn't usually enough as the directions tell you. But 15 is plenty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoots a fine stream","review":"We followed the instructions, filled it to half, and pumped it up well. Sometimes it gives a feeble spray, but mostly it's an erratic stream or drip that makes a mess on its intended target or on the counter top. I think it's a waste of money and over hyped."},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have known better","review":"Ordered this several years ago and it stopped working a few months after I bought it. Saw it recently on a cooking program and thought \\"Well, maybe they've fixed what was wrong it.\\" Ordered it again and scrupulously cleaned it at the recommended 6 week interval. After cleaning and refill it sprayed very weakly. Now a couple of weeks lately it's not spraying at all and there's no movement in the sprayer. I wasted my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vegetable Oil Sprayer","review":"I was disappointed in the sprayer. It does not easily cover the small pan I use without consistent pushing. It could be my fault since I washed it before using it and the sprayer might have had some water in it. It is attractive. The service was very good. The mailing was very fast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works great at first... BUT","review":"I've gone through 2 of these now. I decided to try a second one after reading reviews from people providing a couple of tips, including releasing the pressure after every use. Nothing helps. It works amazing at first, but over time (just after a month in both of my experiences) other problems begin, including clogging or the seal not being able to hold pressure anymore. Pieces of junk. It's too bad, I wanted to believe! I can't find any information on getting in touch with the company either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Misto Oil Sprayer","review":"It took me a while to find an oil sprayer that got decent reviews and would work with most cooking oils and this one seemed to be the one. So far, I have only used it for olive oil and it works as described. Compared to an aerosol store-bought product it does not produce as fine or even a mist but considering I have full control of the oils I want to use that have not other additives I am quite satisfied so far. Had been using commercial brands of canola oil but I wanted to get away from them since canola is a GMO crop and the fact that they always seemed to contain lecithin. Lecithin is fine except for the fact that it can tend to build up or \\"shellac\\" some of my non-stick skillets over a period of time. Pure oil is just better overall and I know the quality of the oil used."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't overfill!","review":"I'm just now buying a replacement for my first Misto after about 12 years of reliable use.My best advice to new users is to only fill about 1/4 full at the most."},{"rating":"2","title":"need help with my misto","review":"I love it when its working.

For one the limited time of the spray before it starts sputtering and then dribbling. Not so sure the spray coverage is even comparitive to aerosol.It is good looking for the sterile-look that I like.Overall not a particularly good or bad buy for the money I paid and I look more to the ecological and economical savings as the plusses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Misto","review":"It works great! .. as advertised.Saves oil and uses so much less to get the same job done = healthier!PLUS .. so many more uses that you wouldn't have normally done with pouring oil out of the bottle.I highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the same","review":"Purchased a Misto before and liked it so much I wanted to get anotherbut this is not the same.

The one I kept for myself does not work at all. I read several reviews and was looking forward to a good product. It does not build up pressure when pumped. I have soaked in warm soapy water and reassembled it multiple times hoping to get it to spray. It is half full of olive oil, I have pumped it many times without ever feeling it was building pressure.

Must be a better one somewhere","review":"I thought this a wonderful idea after ruining several pans using the aerosol sprays that leave a sticky residue. I bought two - one for olive oil, another for vegetable oil for coating bake pans. After about a month the veggie oil began squirting rather than spraying. No matter how hard I pumped, could not make it spray. Emptied it, thoroughly cleaned in hot soapy water. Then it worked...for about a day. Back to squirting.The one with the olive oil still sprays but unevenly and creates a mist in the air like air freshener. Maybe that's why they call it \\"Misto\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this horrible chemical smell inside?!","review":"The plastic insulation inside has a terrible vapor. Fatty foods are especially more likely to absorb chemicals from plastics. I wish the manufacturer used a better quality food-grade materials. Actually I found the oil sprayer made of glass. Hooray! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked well until it lasted (not for long)","review":"Though it looks complicated, it is pretty simple to operate. As long as you pump the cap properly, it sprays a fine jet of oil. If you don't pump the cap, it leaks from the sides. It worked well for me until the internal plastic tube cracked within a month of purchase. After that I cannot pump the cap and this has become totally useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Mess","review":"I rarely use my Misto because it doesn't work.I've pumped it till there was enough pressure and it just shoots out short squirts instead of a steady spray. My friend's Misto works better but is very messy, expect to get oil all over your hands. The bottom line is that even if you get one that works, it's a mediocre product."},{"rating":"2","title":"not bad","review":"Saw this used on a Sunday roast in \`My Big Fat Diet Show' and decided to purchase one myself as I am prone to drowning my meats in oil when I cook, which really ads inches to my waist line. It is good but you have to be very strict on how much to fill and how much to pump. The cleaning is difficult because of the whole oil clashing with water but just use lots of soap and you will be fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inexpensive and Simple to use","review":"This product is simplicity itself. Pour in olive oil, close it, prime it and spray. To get spray one must keep priming as the spray becomes a stream within seconds, no big deal but distribution of oil is more concentrated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great with olive oil","review":"Any oil that needs refrigeration isn't going to work with this. I say that because some organic oils (not olive oil) do require refrigeration. But I've been using this for years and it's worked perfectly. The only thing to remember is to keep it pumped up and not fill it over halfway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eventually, the spray nozzle dies","review":"It's a great idea for a product. We put olive oil in ours and used it to coat pans before cooking, or glaze fish and poultry. However, the the spray nozzle failed after about a year of light use - now a weak spray comes out in a single stream.I have tried finding a website or some way to return it for replacement, but there doesn't appear to be a way to do this (please comment if you know)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great idea, well execucted!","review":"This thing rocks!

I am a major review reader, so it was easy for me to purchase this. So far, and I've used it for several weeks now, I have no complaints! You just fill halfway with whatever oil you prefer, and then pump a few times, and spray! It's that easy! Now I feel comfortable actually spraying directly on foods to get a better browning (i.e. veggies in the oven). I also did a little research, and found out that a typical short spray produces about 10 calories worth of oil; for those interested in that sort of thing (like me!).

I know that you are not supposed to use aerosols like PAM on non-stick pans, however, after many uses you do need a little oil for certain things like eggs or they will stick.

Frustrating and disappointing.When you look over all the reviews on this item it's evident that a substantial number of these units have quality problems of one kind or another. Even a considerable number of the positive reviews mention having to jump through hoops to get the thing to work correctly.Which is a pity, because the product is a great idea, just executed poorly and cheaply. I would gladly pay more for a quality oil mister that simply and reliably does what it is supposed to do.

The Misto Olive Oil Sprayer has not disappointed me. The spray that it generates is comparable to that of an aerosol can. Great for using on salads and to replace those cans of cooking spray that we seem to go through weekly. I highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE","review":"I was definitely a little doubtful, but I thought it was worth trying for the price. I hate buying the aerosol sprays, so I rarely use them. Pouring oil often gets me way more than I need. I have used this for about a month now, and I am so happy with how well it works. The amount of time it says to expect a spray to last is definitely downplaying how long it really will last, depending on how much you pump it up. Cleaning it the first time, I did the recommended 15 pumps, and it sprayed for a LONG time! Last night I sprayed a whole 13x9 baking dish, and then sprayed a second layer, and it still could have kept going. If you only need a little, a couple pumps will do fine.When I come up with a regular use for flavored olive oil, I will probably buy another one of these. I love the idea of putting seasonings in the olive oil and always having it ready to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like this sprayer!","review":"I checked the reviews before I purchased the Misto. I got it in the mail today and gave it a test run. First hand wash all of the pieces, let air dry. Then fill 1/3 or 1/2 way with your favorite oil. Pump the cap 10 times or more till you feel pressure build up. Then spray. I used it in my salad and it was delicious. It gave enough taste without it being too oily.The best advice from a previous review said to untwist the cap after every use to release pressure and prevent clogging. It's only day one but it seems to work.Thank you Amazon for a great price and for resending out another product when my original order went missing. Great customer service!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My wife loves this sprayer!","review":"We got this as my wife had heard about it and just had to have one. She thinks it is one of the best kitchen aids she has. You fill this with a light olive oil and pump it up to spray a fine mist of olive oil onto your food before cooking or eating.We use it before grilling, baking, broiling and even frying. It makes food taste better and it is healthier as you minimize your olive oil use and reduce calories. It helps make foods bake crisper and taste so much better and it doesn't use a propellant to spray the oil.We use it on:* Chicken* Baked French fries* Baked red potatoes* Grilled vegetables* We spray the top and bottom of pizza crusts or pot pies* Fry eggs* Spray salads to flavor and reduce calories* The uses are endlessIt reduces your cost by not requiring you to buy spray on oils that cost more and it doesn't release chemicals into the air while you use it because you pump up the pressure that creates the spray.You need at least one of these in your kitchen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"None of the problems other's had","review":"I love my Misto. I followed the directions and only fill it half-way, pump it well and often, and I get a nice fine mist. I always remember to release the pressure when I am finished using it.

Plus it looks nice enough to leave out on the counter."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great idea","review":"I hate using those cooking spray cans, and when I use olive oil to grease a pan, I always have too much grease.

It needs higher pressure to atomize the oil to really do the job.I am using an airbrush with a small compressor set to 50 psi. works great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea but doesn't work","review":"I wanted so badly for this product to work. I've always hated the idea of using the canned pan sprays, but I also didn't like dropping in big dollops of oil then tipping the pan back and forth to coat a pan. After a couple of months, this just stopped spraying and started dribbling instead. I did find a solution: I'm now using a silicon brush to lightly coat a pan with a much smaller dollop of oil than is needed to coat the pan by tipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Major Flaw","review":"The Misto Sprayer takes about 15 or so pumps to expel oil in a fine mist. Unfortunately, the manufacturer chose to make the screw-on sprayer cap out of cheap plastic (the body and cap are aluminum). The plastic cap cracked after a few uses and now when the sprayer is pumped pressurized air simply leaks out of the crack and the oil dribbles from the sprayer. A major design flaw seriously limits the life of this sprayer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reviewer comments very helpful","review":"I can understand why some reviewers found problems with this item - if I may sum up some of the helpful hints:- Hold the pan vertically, so you can hold the sprayer in an upright position- Release any built-up pressure by loosening the cap when you're done using it- Don't overfillWith these tips, I feel this product performs as it's intended, and delivers a great value in being able to use pure oils instead of artificial products. Every healthy kitchen should have one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Piece Of Junk","review":"I'm sorry I didn't read any reviews of the Misto Sprayer before I bought one for myself. Even though I followed the directions closely, it never sprayed a mist of oil. The oil came out in little squirts and the oil leaked out of the sprayer making it messy to use. Even if it had worked like it's advertised to work, I probably wouldn't recommend it because the constant pumping you have to do is very frustrating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works well--if willing to maintain","review":"I have two Mistos (both gifts). When I am willing to work at keeping them cleaned, then they do work. Thankfully, I've escaped the broken collar problem that so many reviewers complain about.The troubleshooting section of the Misto website...gives instructions about how to get the unit unclogged when it starts sputtering. Takes some time, but soaking in hot water and spraying hot soapy water through the unit does the trick for me. Also read on a web bulletin board that keeping it upright, not tilted, when spraying keeps it from clogging as quickly. But the manufacturer says that it will need to be cleaned and unclogged every 6-8 weeks. So this is a high maintenance item.But when it works, it is a great tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gimicky useless kitchen gadget","review":"The product review makes this sound like a neat kitchen accessory. Like some of the other reviewers, I too found that the spraying action was not as advertised. It tends to gum up VERY easily, and requires MANY repeat pumps during use. Mine also began to leak at the seam of the base after about 6 months. (The inside is plastic). Also found the base was not flat when I first purchased this, and I had to use sandpaper to flaten out a crown so it would stand upright. Save your money, and get a nice oil can instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as it looks","review":"Mine worked fine for a few weeks. Then started squirting and leaking. Even soapy water cleaning seems temporary. I use it for vegetable oil though. I could live with this but scary is that the oil turns rancid fast. This is due to exposure to air during pumping. Cans use propellants and these vapors are lighter than air. Plus they're almost intert. So they work. Solution: Smell the oil in Misto every couple of weeks. You don't want to feed rancid stuff to your families."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another purchase for the wife","review":"She wanted a mister so i got this one based on reviews. It appears to work fine. you have to pump more often then I would like but hey, it is not a 2gal bug sprayer after all ... it is a little oil mister fr inside the kitchen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saving money and fat grams!","review":"I bought the Misto because I keep hearing that the propellants in products like Pam are harmful to non-stick cookware. Also, I like to watch my family's calorie intake and budget and this seems like it will allow me to use less olive oil when cooking.So far all of these things are true and I'm glad that I bought the Misto. However, the spray is not uniform like I would expect. It already seems to sputter out a bit, almost as if it is clogged. Overall I am pleased with the product, but I am surprised at how the oil comes out."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money on this one","review":"This has got to be one of the worst purchases I ever made.

The oil only comes out in a stream now. I've tried cleaning it many times and it doesn't improve the flow. And then recently it started leaking air pressure. I can pump it a lot or a little and it doesn't matter. As soon as I take the cap off, the air starts leaking out from the seal. At the same time I bought mine, I also purchased one for my parents. The Misto doesn't mist either. I wish I could get a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk -- great, until (both) broke","review":"This was great until, after 2 months of daily use, the plastic pump broke and it would not fill with air. Same thing happened with the second one I bought. I emailed the company to inquire about replacement parts -- never got a response. Like reviews said, it produced a fine mist. But it's just not meant for regular use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works With Vinegar","review":"I owned one of these years ago and used it for spraying olive oil but I had nothing but trouble. I even called the manufacturer and they told me to wash everything in warm soapy water, pumping and then spraying the soapy water to flush out the innards, which I did but it still didn't work right. Since then I've bought an oil sprayer on Ebay, it has no name brand on it but the seller said it was the same as was sold by Pampered Chef. It does look just like the Pampered Chef spritzer except mine has no design printed on it. But I must say it has worked perfectly for at least three years now. So I wanted another sprayer strictly for balsamic vinegar and went with this Misto because Amazon sells it. It's working fine with the vinegar so I'm happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's too much of a pain to use","review":"When I first purchased a Misto sprayer, it was around $25.00 but even at less than half the price, I still wouldn't buy it again. I absolutely loved it at first but way too much effort in trying to figure out how to keep this thing working! Also, when I hadn't used it in over a month, some sort of mold was growing on the plastic tubing inside, yuck. The mold turned me off for life so now I buy a similiar product in a see through sprayer WITH the olive oil included at Marshalls, TJ Maxx or Home Goods for $4.99."},{"rating":"1","title":"From Instant Joy ... To reality and Disapointment","review":"I really thought I would love this. I was paying an outrageous amount to buy olive oil in spray can's from the store and thought this would be a really great way to apply only a limited amount, but not pay the cost (per oz) that comes with the spray can.Unfortunately, it doesn't spray well. At first there is too much pressure and it's just a stream, then it becomes a mist like spray (what I wanted) but it only last a second before it becomes too low a pressure and it starts a very jerky uneven spray.After only a short period of use, I suddenly realized I had used almost a whole bottle of olive oil already. I was paying less than the spray can, but I was consuming more than 10 times the amount of oil I thought I was using. Needless to say, I have the added weight gain to show for it.Also, with normal regular use, there ends up being oil all over the canister, the table, and a lot of other surfaces around the general spray area of my food prep area."},{"rating":"1","title":"total piece of crap","review":"i thought this product would be a winner -- and it was -- until i tried to clean it (carefully and according to the manufacturer's instructions). the plastic pump split around the bottom and now the pump doesn't work at all. Since the Amazon return policy on it expired a month ago, I would have to pay to ship it back AND I would only receive a partial refund. Ten dollars down the drain since I can't seem to find any information about who manufactures the product to deal with them directly.In total, this pump lasted 2 months. Totally unacceptable. I'm off to Crate & Barrel to pay more for one that works and will be returnable if it breaks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exploding Misto","review":"Has anyone ever had a Misto explode? After two years of very occasional use due to the fact it mainly gave out a stream rather than a mist, I attempted to fill it for the third time. As soon as I started to unscrew the collar it exploded. Olive oil misted the counter, floor, walls and me, but very little in the pan I wished to coat. The Misto ended in three parts plus the lid, the can being partially crushed. It was a shock but no lasting harm done, and the pain quickly receeded. I somehow doubt we'll buy another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works for 1 month only!! Waste of $$","review":"Works great at first and then totally stops misting.

There have to be better ones out there, this one is a WASTE OF MONEY!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great alternative to aerosol cooking sprays!","review":"This is our second Misto olive oil sprayer.

Simple to fill & use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Healthy and easy to use","review":"My sister had given me one of these many years ago. I finally wore it out a couple of months ago.

I knew about releasing the pressure when not in use, etc. My PC one lasted a long time but wasn't great at spraying. I got the Misto and it worked great, for 3 months, and then the plastic ring that creates the suction for pumping up the pressure cracked and split. No pressure, no oil spray. So much for that $10."},{"rating":"2","title":"Problem free so far. Good mist with canola oil","review":"I have not tried this with olive oil, but with canola oil it gives a good mist and doesn't take much pumping. So far after about a month it still works fine. There is a tiny bit of a stream in the center of the spray, but it is overall a really good mist and spreads evenly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry...but this thing is worthless","review":"I followed all the instructions for how to get this to work properly and still find it to be worthless.

What initially was a fairly nice spray of olive oil (still dribbled a bit, but generally OK) has morphed into a steady stream of drippy, runny oil.In addition, this thing smells terrible! I guess that may be my fault, but I was unaware that olive oil would turn rancid after a little while. Call me a dumb guy, but who knew?In the final analysis, this was one of my worst Amazon purchases. Good thing it was less than ten bucks!I strongly recommend AGAINST buying this turkey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kitchen Essential","review":"This thing is amazing. For anyone who uses olive oil on a regular basis this is a must have. It is such an ingenious idea and so well executed. It works exactly as advertised it really makes olive oil last much longer and makes it so versatile. Normally i wouldn't use olive oil for things like making eggs because it is more expensive I would use a little butter or vegetable oil but with the misto a few pumps and a spray is all you need!If you spend time in the kitchen and you like olive oil...stop reading and just buy one. It's only 8 bucks!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gift","review":"Bought this for my dad for christmas after watching the video, think he will like it he's an old(er) hippie and into the environment, looks nice, not as fancy as it appears to be in pic but nice, I got the cheaper one just to give it a try, think this makes a great christmas gift hope it works out for him and will update once he tells me how it works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a sprayer I can fill","review":"I like this product, but it sometimes leaks.

Who wouldn't want to use their favorite oils in controlled amounts? I purchased this sprayer with great anticipation, and expecting performance. What a disappointment it turned out to be. The sprayer is a dribbler. I initially thought it was just a defective unit, and returned to Amazon, receiving the replacement in only a few days. The replacement worked for the first day, and on the second day it failed. If the manufacturer can fix the issue, I will definitely try again. Amazon informed me that if they make the item available again it will be because the issue has been fixed. I will keep an eye on the site, just in case.

It was not worth the mone; it does not work! Not sure how to return something that has been used."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Alternative to Aerosol Sprays","review":"I like my Misto very much and cook with it frequently. From spraying the bottom of a pan for stir-fry or misting a salad, it works perfectly everytime.Make sure you read the directions, though. I didn't and filled mine to the top and found that it would spray for two or three seconds and then squirt in a stream. The box said it should mist for 15 seconds, so I went back to the directions to see what I'd done wrong and sure enough, you're only supposed to fill it halfway so that there's enough room for pressure to build.If you cook with oil frequently and want a healthy alternative to those off-the-shelf cooking sprays, this is the way to go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really works","review":"Product works fine if you only fill it 1/4 to 1/3 full of oil and release the pressure after each pump up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest kitchen tool !","review":"I can't tell you enough how much I love this sprayer! I was wasting alot of olive oil just trying to coat my chicken and other poultry and misc cooked items. All I really needed was to spray a light mist on the poultry. I also use this now to spray the bottom of my pans, and I save a lot of olive oil by using this mister.This is the greatest invention! I love it! I use Olive Oil for everything now, no more butter and I'm sure as time goes on, I will use this mister for everything!Nancy"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shop around for another brand","review":"We have had two of these already and both eventually failed.

How else can you get unusual oils or your oil flavored oil in a spray can? Just pour oil (don't fill it all the way to the top), use the lid to pump pressure into the can, then spray! To release pressure and prevent clogs, simply twist the nozzle until the pressure is released. If you leave it pressurized, the lid may not sit flush on the container. Not a big deal. I've used it for 10 weeks without a problem and have saved a lot of oil and disposable cans. It's cheaper at T.J. Maxx, but free shipping at Amazon saves a drive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misto","review":"I just didn't care for this product.

This is my 2nd Misto, the first one has ended up being used as a mister for water, both for plants and especially mushroom cultivation. The droplets from the atomized mist are so fine that it is *perfect* for small scale use with growing things but can be used in arts & crafts applications as well.. I would imagine that there are many things than can be sprayed with this product that is between water and a heavier oil.

It would be more enjoyable if you read the book, preferably in Spanish in its original form."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dona Barbara","review":"I really enjoyed watching this, the storyline moved so quickly I was thinking it could have been a telenovela. I think there are 4 versions of this made. Produced in 1943 and 1998 as movies and the telenovelas were 1964 and 1975. I've only watched this one (1998), a bit to young to have watched the 1964 or 1975 telenovelas--anybody watch these?Then, I noticed they are airing this as a telenovela starting next week in my area---can't wait!!! It will be interesting to see the 2008 production on TV. Edith Gonzalez (who I think is amazing!) is playing Dona Barbara and they filmed it in Colombia so I know it's going have amazing scences.I really like the campo-type movies/telenovelas--horses, wilderness, scenary, and of cousre latin cowboys:o) And if you do too, you will enjoy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"DO?A","review":"PLEASE,WY I CANNOT SEE THE MOVIE IN MY SONY DVD PLAYER/VIDEO- CASSETE MODEL# SLV-D550P?I ALSO ASK MY NEIGBOR TO PLAY THE MOVIE IN TO HIS DVD PLAYER AND IT WORKS OK.BUT I PLAYED OTHER MOVIES IN MY DVD AND ALL WORKS OK.AS YOU CAN SEE THERE IS NO PROBLEM WITH MY DVD PLAYER.PLEASE CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT WILL BETHE PROBLEM?"},{"rating":"2","title":"You Have to Know What You're Getting Into","review":"I've read reviews in here of people complaining that the graphic novel isn't representative of the movie. Of course not! The graphic novel came first! Anyone intersted in Frank Miller artwork would love adding this to their collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great concept on a legendary battle","review":"What can I say, it's Frank Miller's epic opus. I believe every other review has covered the nuances of this graphic novel. I actually read it late in the game, having vaguely heard of it before but not actually laying hands on the book until after the movie came out. Both the movie and the book prompted me to revisit the historical accounts of the Spartans' valiant struggle against overwhelming odds. For some reason, Thermopylae reminds me of JFK - I believe he quoted the famous epitaph in one of his speeches. If 300 inspires young and old to read up on history because of the valor of its protagonists, it will have served its purpose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional art and story telling","review":"Although I had seen the recent film adaption of this graphic novel the novel is in itself far better in its simplicity. With one or two words, you understand the harsh life of the Spartans and the task at hand in this story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very much like the movie","review":"I got this book and intended to read it before i saw the movie... i ended up seeing the movie first with my girlfriend (she cried at the end... so i guess it WAS a good date movie. i dunno) ... anyways... the movie was awesome... and the book was VERY close to the movie... but of course they added stuff to the movie to make it longer... otherwise the phrases and everything were exact. i loved the book... but loved the movie even more. Frank Miller is a genius. I hope you find this lil review helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Herodotus meets Sin City and gets whacked.","review":"I was hoping that Miller would turn his talents from the dark side and we would see how well he could reproduce a Classical Epic. What we get is a blood splattered \\"300 Lacedaimons in the Hood\\". The Spartans are presented to be a buch of Homo erotic Rastafarians. The Persians rather than the Noble Middle Eastern Autocrats presented in their Art are drawn by Miller to resemble African American Gangstas with piercings and Skin art everywhere. I was looking for Xerxes to have a grill and whitewalls on his chariot.If you were into \\"Sin City\\", you will love this mishmashed version of the Classical Tale of bravery and sacrifice in the face of overwhelming odds."},{"rating":"1","title":"300 Review","review":"Expected the book to be more interesting. The narrative part is very poor, the drawings have also let me down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short and Sweet","review":"Sure, if you're familiar with history you know how it's going to end before you even open it, but Miller's writing and incredible art are well worth it.

I had a horrible misunderstanding as to what I was buying. I thought it was going to be a novel, but instead it was a Comic book. I quickly returned it without reading it. If you are into comics perhaps it is for you, as for me I prefer novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have a brain? Stay away from this mindless garbage.","review":"To say that one \\"reads\\" anything by Frank Miller is quite a stretch. The amount of meaningful dialogue from this book in particular would fit on the back of a match book cover. And to suggest that this book has anything to do with the actual historical event is even more of a stretch. Miller appears to have done no more than 300 seconds of research about the actual battle before turning it into a \\"Lord of the Rings\\" ripoff here.Frank Miller is about graphic violcne, most of it mindless at best. He appeals to young boys under 12 who are still wowed by mindless images of blood and gore. He also appeals to those with IQ's under 70.If you are looking for reading material with any kind of substance trust me, you won't find it in \\"300\\". Save your money and spare your brain cells. They are far too valuable to waste on this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"reality","review":"The film is fake and not based on the real history. it is just propaganda to make more money.

However, the book remains a bit short, each day (which there are seven)are no more than ten pages at max. I love long Frank Miller novels, and even though this isn't one of them, it's still a great read for any fan of history, war, or Frank Miller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"The art work and imagery is amazing as is to be expected from Frank Miller, and the story is awe-inspiring.

The actual story is great (I also recommend \\"Gates of Fire\\") But also, how Miller delivers it is amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy It","review":"If you are a comic book fan and enjoy Frank Miller's work, you will want to pick this book up. The art is very good and the story does not even begin to get boring. After you are done reading the book you will want to go back and read it again and again. It is a wonderful story of bravado, belief, and self sacrifice. It is a great piece of work to add to your comic/graphic novel collection. Shell out the $ and get yourself a copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun","review":"Fun book to own, a comic book with a hard cover really, drawings in the comic are great, especially nice if you are a fan of the movie 300 which was based on this graphic novel"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Christmas Hit","review":"I gave this to my brother for Christmas. We are both 40-something artists and history lovers. When he opened it he was thrilled like a little boy with a new toy. He called twice after the holidays, once to rave about the artwork, and again to say that of all the gifts he had recieved this book was, above all, his favorite.The artwork is just as compeling as the story.

If you are going to write HISTORICAL fiction, history actually IS the point. Instead of writing 300 and basing it--as loosely as possible--on the Spartans and their battle at the gates of Thermopylae, it would have been better had Miller called them \\"Spartatians\\" from the planet \\"Spartatia\\" and, in his narrative, sent 299 (or 301) to battle the (seemingly) evil homosexual piercing addicts of another culture.Rather than beat this dead historical accuracy/inaccuracy horse AGAIN, though, I strongly suggest that everyone read David Brin's dissection of Miller's 300 at [...]. Then maybe try reading some Aeschylus. Y'know, for yucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Typical F. Miller","review":"If you like Miller, you will like this. It was shorter than I thought it would be, but it delivered in true Miller fashion. If you are looking for a historical accont of the battle, move along, this is a big fish account of the legend with enough fact sprinkled into it to stay true to the myth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the movie!","review":"I'm being a fan from Frank Miller since his books of Batman. When I find out that the 300 book is gonna be in a movie i just can't believe. I think it was dificult to capture the images from the book to put into the big screen. The drawings of 300 are unique and is a piece worth collectible!Luis"},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor substitute","review":"While beautifully drawn and arguably one of Miller's best works, this book is a prime example of surface over substance. The retellling here of the battle of Thermopylae simply does not do justice to one of history's greatest stories. If you really want to know these warriors--their loves, their fears, their training; if you really want to experience the battle so clearly that dust mixed with day old blood chokes your nostrils; if you want to understand the camraderie and leadership that puts the life of the man who's protected by your shield above your own, read the definitive work on the subject: GATES OF FIRE by Steven Pressfield."},{"rating":"2","title":"a masterful and entertaining piece of fine art","review":"I love Frank Miller. He is by far the best writer working in comics in the past 20 years. Personally I feel his art is very under rated and under appreciated in the art community as a whole. With that being said the real unsung hero of this book is Lynn Varley. Her colors really make this book what it is. Without the vibrant colors this book would have been passed over by many people. Frank's work is exquisite and brutally beautiful as only Frank Miller can do, his story telling and style really shines in this book but the POP comes from Varley's vibrant pallet that makes the work jump from mer comic art to the surreal and fantastic. I'm a huge fan of this collaboration and feel this one hit's the mark and is a near flawless comic as well as a true work of art. Everyone, comic fan or not should pick up this book for the superior writing storytelling and true visionary art of Miller and Varley."},{"rating":"2","title":"Miller Time","review":"Frank Miller never fails to disappoint. This telling of the grand Battle of Thermopalae (I know I mispelled that) is filled with everything that makes his work so great. 300 Spartans against insurmountable odds yet manage to find a victory that resonates throughout all time. Is it silly and over the top? Yes. Is it politically charged and biasd? Yes. Is it equally appicable to current events? Yes. Does it still manage to resonate themes that all humanity should appreciate and embrace? Yes. Is it a form of literature? Hell yes. Miller demonstrates exactly how words and pictures in unison can tell a tale worthy of any homeric epic. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Frank Miller Masterpiece now the Motion Picture","review":"From comic book legend & creator of \\"Sin City\\" comes this spectacular tale of glory, of the battle of Thermopylae in 480 B.C. as King Leonidas, bold ruler of Sparta, leads an army of 300 warriors against the Persian army of of King Xerxes.

This 13 year old loved the book when we gave it to him and we hope he will have a fantastic time reading it at pleasure back home in Florida.The book is gorgeous and done with great taste; a beautiful gift indeed if someone wants to have a token for a person, young or old, male or female, interested in History and famous battles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific effort by Miller and Varley, as usual.","review":"It's a graphic novel, folks, so if you aren't willing tosuspend disbelief long enough to enjoy a first-ratere-telling of a legend, then by all means use your moneyto buy a historical survey of the same material. FrankMiller delivers good stories. Leave history to the Schlesingers.Let's say you're willing to take a shot on this book,though. You're in for a treat: Miller's artwork has neverbeen more expressive, and Lynn Varley hasn't lost a shadeof intensity or a single gradation in her palette. Andone thing I tell anyone about a Miller project: you will besurprised at how well Miller can write, considering how wellhe illustrates. It's a truly rare combination of talents,and I've never been dissatisfied with his work.Should you own this? I'd say so. And if you get anycriticism for owning a historically inaccurate account,show them the bibliography at the back and let them seethat it was a conscious decision to tell a good story first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but curt like Spartans were supposed to be","review":"This comic book is a replay of an ancient war in Greece.

But this story is just ludicrous - it stacks all the goodness in the world on one side, and then invites us to cheer for the Spartans who represent all the forces of light. The Spartans are manly and defenders of freedom. The Persians are barbarians, easily crushed in battle, and quite inexplicably, Xerxes seems rather, well... I don't even want to start on that.I don't know how a society that survived on the labor of helots can repeatedly be proclaimed to be the champions of freedom they are made out to be, or what good so much freedom is, if the society has to kill all these children just because they are not good soldier-material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smashed Corners","review":"When I received my Hardcover 300 graphic novel the top righthand corner, as well as, the bottom righthand corner of the book where smashed.

The author also provides occasional information about L2 interference broken down by various language backgrounds. There is also a section at the end of each chapter suggesting ways to teach the particular grammar structure. I wish this section was more developed.

Before that, it worked great in snow. A couple months later, I realized I needed to change the battery in the remote. Speaking of batteries, it doesn't include the recharger. It usually takes about 4 to 5 hours to totally recharge and works about 20 to 30 minutes. Just today, I put it in the lake in our backyard. I noticed that one side was more above the water than the other side. When I was done, I took it and cleaned it because we have mulch right by our lake. When I took the battery pack out I noticed that it was wet. I let it dry for a few minutes and put it back in the recharger. It recharged and it worked.

That would mean that at least 10 HP is required. 1 HP = 750 Watts. 10 HP = 7500 WattsP = E x I or Power = Voltage times CurrentThis unit's required 2.2Amps times 12 volts = 26.4 wattsThis unit falls short by 7473.6 Watts (7500 - 26.4)It's actually robbing power (the air restriction of the blower blades and the friction of the bearings) from the engine as the blower \\"free wheels\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"ARE YOU CRAZY!!??","review":"Anyone who buys this should have their head examined.

I found \\"A Royal Duty\\" to be a testament to Princess Diana's generous, loving, and kind nature. I found the section regarding her brother, the Earl of Spencer to be very informative. It certainly filled in the missing gaps pertaining to his rather odd behavioir at her funeral and buriel. Not to mention the \\"museum\\" of his late sister he created at Althorp. The book did tend to be a little dry at times, and I was occasionally frustrated by the author hinting of secrets, but choosing not to reveal any of them to us. I gave the book 4 stars, rather than five. For all of his fascinating detail, it could have been written with a little more spark.

I have read just about all the other books written about her, and they beat this one by far. The first 100 pages are about Paul B.'s life, and his service to the Queen. We find out all the small details of the Queen's day, and if you are interested in what she has for breakfast, this is your book. It is almost 100 pages before we get to the Diana part, and frankly I don't know why so much was made of this book. He was (is) so blinded by her that he is pathetic. A waste of time. Basically it is very repetitious, - he tells about fixing her breakfast, lunch, her dinner, blah, blah. He tells what she wore. He was THERE for her !! Frankly, after all I had read about this book I was expecting some new gossip, but there is not even any old gossip. Just too many mundane details about his service, which frankly, made for boring reading. And, he did the unforgivable. He made her boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Definitive History ON Diana","review":"So many stories have been written, and will be.

Not much is revealed in these pages that isn't already known. This book is a love letter from Mr. Burrell to the late Diana, Princess of Wales. There is an implication throughout that he knows more than he tells here, but, he doesn't give many clues about what else he knows. A few details are given about life at Highgrove and Kensington Palace and it makes for a light and not unpleasant read. Just don't expect any great revelations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad!","review":"I found this book interesting to begin with, Burrellreally harping on his \\"special\\" relationship with the Princess.Toward the end of the book I was questioning his motives forwriting the book in the light of criminal allegations in whichhe was involved.

Not what I expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"good read for royal watchers","review":"paul burrell's book provides a glimpse of Princess Diana that well captures the ups and downs of her personality. Most intriguing, perhaps, is the picture of life of Buckingham and Kensington Palaces from a butler's viewpoint. The author was consumed by his devotion to the Princess, and that devotion was so extreme that his entire life was effected during his tenure with Princess Diana and since then. That his wife and family stood by him while he was in her employ is remarkable, but his relationship with his wife during that time is not entirely clear. While Burrell has much insight into his extraordinary fascination and devotion, his present state of mind and ambition are not fully put forth. This book is not a salacious tell all, but a vivid portrait of an unusual relationship and his descriptions both of the royals and of the palace life are compelling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scary! Both of them!","review":"I read Sally Bedell Smith's bio of Diana and thought that Smith went overboard with her insistence that Diana was mentally ill. That is, until I read Paul Burrell's book! She was impulsive, immature, jealous, vindictive, and full of self-pity. Burrell's story of Diana's attack on Tiggy was a jaw-dropper. How could you idolize anyone who acted like that? This book made me feel sorry for Charles--and I never thought I would. No wonder he turned to Camilla for some intelligent conversation.The sad thing is, this terribly deflating portrait of Diana was written by a man who adored her and thinks we will, too, after reading this book.

There are many Dian books out there, so it is hard to choose one. But this one just seems better than the rest.

Instead, it illustrates what a complete nut her butler was!

What a disappointment. I could barely finish the book and now can't wait to get rid of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I had eagerly anticipated the release of this book and mustadmit that after reading it I was very disappointed. Basedon several pre-publication interviews that I had seen PaulBurrell give, I was expecting the content to reveal new andcontroversial information regarding Diana and the Windsors.This proved not to be the case. Burrell simply took previously known and published information and retold such. His complete devotion to her is obvious but this proves to be a detriment to the reader since his objectivity is impaired. I wanted to geta clearer picture of the real Diana but this wasn't the case.Her unquestionable love for her children and wonderful charity work was written about extensively but her flaws and life difficulties were minimized. I was hoping that a close insiderlike Burrell would have been able to provide the definitive andbalanced portrait we have yet to have on this complex woman buthe didn't quite achieve that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insider Information","review":"I have read virtually every Diana book there is, and I really enjoyed this one. The book did, in fact, provide new information and painted a more human picture of the princess. Burrell's wife, Maria, certainly has a reasonable complaint when she speaks of her husband's obsession with Diana (spending the night in her wardrobe?), but the result of that obsession is a great read. Burrell also confirms what I long suspected, that the Spencers certainly have no right to take the high road with regard to their own treatment of Diana, particularly the hypocritical Charles Spencer. The book also clears up nefarious rumors about the Queen and Prince Phillip's treatment of Diana--seems they aren't the villains they've seemed to be.

There is more description about the table settings, tea cups, uniform decorations and silverware that I had to force myself to read, UNTIL I read an insult about Diana, and I then promptly closed the book. Paul Burrell may have been enamored with Diana, but he certainly did her no favor by writing this boring book, and I highly doubt he would have written this book while she was still alive.For someone that was trusted as a dear friend, in this book, Diana's private confidences were severely betrayed. To me, the book lacks integrity, trust, and is quite distasteful. It was simply not necessary. It seemed throughout the book that Paul was quite taken by Diana, and the text shifts from severe infatuation to betrayal. I gave the book one star because it has a few nice photos, other than that, the text is beyond boring and quite the betrayal of a trusted \\"friend.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Fantasy","review":"Poor Paul Burrell. He didnt get a call from the royal family so he wrote a book -- his admission not mine. Then he says the book is not meant to hurt anyone. Regardless of his protests, this book IS a betrayal of Diana's trust. Has anyone heard the interview where he acknowledges that he doesnt HAVE any of these LETTERS? They are all just \\"memories\\".

I think that due to his name being dragged into the mud by the Spenser's, he had no other choice but to write a book to clear his name and get the record straight. People can be so greedy and cold hearted. Lies and deceitfulness make a person so monstrous. The book describes so many things you've ever wondered about the Palace and more. It was amazing. Congratualtions to Paul & Maria on a victorious trial and to the Queen for her efforts in helping Mr. Burrell. Long Live the Queen. And the mistresses of the Prince of Wales.

Perhaps tastes have deteriorated so much that the delicate, the lovely, the merely marvelous are no longer fashionable. Perhaps Eleanor Farjeon's sensibility, nurtured in the late Victorian period, and flowering in the 1920's and 1930's, is simply not able to connect with modern readers. But I don't believe it.

If you try to have them tilted inwards to glide and keep the kyak in place, they will not stay the same way as you glide because one will tilt more than the other causing the kyak to drop one side on the cross bar.

While at camp, they decided they would stay at their old Japanese Church along with other displaced families until they could find work and a place of their own.This book was good, I guess.

This book provided us with the perfect framework from which to start our team. We've developed several major projects using the principles in this book and have experienced a great deal of success.One warning, the book gets a bit tedious after the first half.

Probably that's why I love this book so much I've pretty much it makes me realize my mistakes, and teaches me how to do it correctly, right now I'm doing a personal project in which I'm also applying what I'm reading, so this book has become pretty handy.

If you are looking for some light hearted physics fun, this is a great quick read. The footnotes part of the kindle edition needs some work, but this book is not alone in that regard. I purchased a physical copy for my brother who is a comic book buff, so he could learn something. He enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Read","review":"I took some Physics classes in college, and was able to grasp most of the ideas in the first reading. I had to reread some of the concepts a second time to understand them. This book is recommended for those who at least have basic knowledge of Physics, or you will be struggling. One of my favourite chapters would be the one on Spiderman! I also learnt about the background of lesser known Superheroes. For the price of a bargain book, definitely a good buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A trip back in time","review":"This book was a trip back in time, a time of segregation and life in a small town full of \\" good ole boys\\".

All us Meekerites love you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Execellent Book","review":"(... Ms. Les Becquets') writing style is wonderful. She describes the scences so you can paint the picture in your own imagination, instead of telling you what you are seeing. Diane writes so that your attention is captured from the very first page of the story. The Stones of Mourning Creek is a book that you will never want to put down, and you will want to read it again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful!","review":"This book was beautiful. The heroine Catherine was sweet, lovely, alittle opionated but overall a worthy heroine. But the hero Andrew I just don't know where to begin - he's just wonderfull. His character came to life for me in this book making what would have been a good book, great. The love I felt he had for Catherine was so beautiful. He was sensitive, sweet and above all had such a intense love for Catherine it just flowed off the pages. And his interaction with the son Spencer showed just another wonderful side. The ending where he says my heart, my soul are yours. Tell me what you want to do with them. Oh my God it does not get any better than a hero like that. Well Done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Enjoyable","review":"I really liked this book. Not only did I enjoy Lady Catherine and Andrew as main characters, but I loved the interaction between Catherine's son and Andrew. You do become frustrated at one point like most novels tend to do, but the ending will definitely leave you feeling complete."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, dull, a chore to read","review":"Nothing interesting in this book, well written but dull, a chore to read, characters dull and the heroine extremely stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"First, she's not an heiress . . .","review":"Second, she shouldn't be called \\"Lady Catherine,\\" which implies she's an unmarried woman (the heroine is a widow). Third, the son's club foot would not have been that big a deal at the time (Lord Byron--yes, the one dubbed \\"Mad, bad, and dangerous to know\\"--had a club foot, and it didn't hold him back socially). And there's simply no reason a club foot would prevent someone from learning to ride, let along drive. This book just felt utterly contrived."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deserves Zero Stars","review":"This book is FLAT, BORING, and an UTTER WASTE OF TIME. I can't believe some people gave it four and five stars. There is simply NO chemistry between the hero and heroine. Halfway through I gave up caring about them, and simply skimmed till the chore of reading it was over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bubbling with wit","review":"I've seen a number of romances capitalise on plots where the heroine is involved in a publication, so while the plot was predictable, D'Alessandro's writing was not - it was witty and I enjoyed every bit of conversation between Catherine and Andrew. A plot where both protagonists have been married before and one has a child with a club foot does make for quite a lot of emotional baggage, so I found this book richly satisfying.I'm reminded of Amanda Quick's earlier books, where the conversation is almost farcical and there's a bit of mystery mixed in. If you like Quick you'll probably like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"mouse eyes,","review":"well it's pretty simple. You plug it in and it shows whether the trap has something in it or not.It works and is pretty great not having to physically look at the trap directly everyday.My only negitive comment is there is no way to replace the batteries.

I even waited until I caught a rodent in my zapper to see if the indicator lights would light up... no such luck. At least my zapper ultra works. Unfortunately, my husband threw out the packaging as soon as the zapper tale arrived; therefore, I probably cannot return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great addition to the Rat Zapper","review":"The Rat Tale is designed to be used with the Rat Zapper Ultra. It plugs into the top of the unit, and flashes whenever the trap has been activated. Since I had my Rat Zapper in the back of the attic, it was a big pain to go up into the attic every night to check the trap. Checking the trap a lot also discourages rats from entering it if it is constantly moved. The Rat tale has about a 12 foot long cord, and I was able to let it hang down from my attic (see picture). I kept looking up at it every time I came home, which I later found out was unnecessary since this thing flashes like crazy when it goes off. The LEDs are very bright so, there is little chance you will not notice is. I recommend it for anyone who plans to put the Rat Zapper in an inconvenient location."},{"rating":"2","title":"Correction to B. Walker's post","review":"There is an error with B. Walker's post.

That thing works 100% of time as long as the batteries are good ;-) But I had it above the garage and had to keep going up to check it out. So I put the Rat Tale on and now I can see if Fievel has met his maker readily and easily.

Problem is is that when the saliva goes into the holes where the music comes out from, it warps the music.

I can get it off easily, and take him out to put him in his crib. My son weighs 14lbs and the carrier dosent cause that much stress on my back or shoulders. This carrier is the best.

It is such a struggle to get him in and out, the leg openings are too tight, and when I tried to adjust it to use facing out, the support was still in his face.

I had gotten one for my first son (5 years old now) & couldn't find it to try with my newborn. I wasn't all that thrilled with the prospect of reusing my old one since it wasn't all that comfortable anyway (major back strain after using it too long). Snugli has REALLY done well with this one! The top back strap combined with the wide waistband make this a real backsaver. Please don't buy one of these without a waist-strap/back-strap combination! You'll so regret it! The zippered vent for baby's head makes it so much better ventilated than older versions. The removable wallet is useful to hold pacifier or small necesities (keys, for example).

(she is almost 5 months and is 16 pounds now) She just does not fit in it very well. It seems that her thighs are too big for the leg holes and getting her in and out of it is a pain. When she is facing forward, the front of the carrier rubs on her face. So we have to fold the front over and so that she can see. In regards to comfort, it was fine for me. On the other hand, my husband can't stand it. I guess for $30, if you are going to use it on a daily basis for the first couple of months of your baby's life, then it's worth it. But right now for us, it's worthless so it's going to Goodwill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product","review":"This was a good product especially for the cost, but my daughter rather been held then the carrier.

I was constantly checking to make sure he could breathe.Third, when he was 2 1/2 months old his legs were being squeezed so tight in the leg opening that his feet looked like they were turning color and he's not a huge baby. He was 12 lbs when I stopped using this product.When he was 3 Months old I got the Hip Hammock by Playtex...Much better product.

Once I adjusted the straps to fit me, I never had to touch them again!! I never had any problems with them loosening. And yes, there seems to be a lot of straps, but once you get used to putting it on, it's no problem at all. I always left one of the side clips attached to make it easier to put my son into the carrier. This was a lifesaver for foodshopping!! The only reason I've stopped using it is because my son outgrew it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to get baby in and out","review":"I would recommend spending the extra money on a Baby Bjorn if you're going to be using this often. The Snugli is difficult to get the baby in and out of, and there are too many straps. Plus, you have to have someone help you buckle and tighten the straps because they're in the back. The straps also don't stay tight, and loosen as you walk around."},{"rating":"1","title":"This carrier was not for us","review":"We received this carrier as a gift, so we didn't have much input on the selection. We liked the idea of it being a front or back carrier, however it just doesn't seem to work with our bodies. Our daughter seemed to be carried with her head by my ear when I tried it as a front pack. The plastic side buckles to hold the child in place were not that secure, so when we used it we still held her for fear of them opening up - defeats the purpose of having your hands free!

I felt like the baby was totally in front of my face... literally, I couldn't see around her and it was not comfortable for either of us. My husband tried it, and he hated it even more than I did. Not well designed... our baby hated it and it just seemed impossible for one person to put it on without assistance. We are taking it back to exchange it and pay the extra money for a baby bjorn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated this with my newborn.","review":"This was not usable at all for me with my newborn. It is complicated to put on and adjust, and my tiny baby was completely enveloped by it, and I did not feel she was very secure in it.

Now with our second baby, I went out and purchased the Bjorn and it is far superior. The snuggli is cheaper but you get what you pay for. It offers little back support and numberous snaps and buckles that are a pain when handling an infant. The Bjorn is far superior- fabric is great and it is much easier to snap AND it offers excellent back support. I am usually a cheap skate but this is money well spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for dad to use","review":"This carrier has been in use in our household daily for 8 weeks. We've been carrying our son in it since he was about a week old and he is so content in it. It never fails to calm him down when he's fussy and he really enjoys being so close to his daddy. I am unable to use very often it because I'm nursing and when my son gets that close to my chest it fustrates him because he wants to nurse.My husband says that he finds it very comfortable, we take a 2 mile walk daily and he's never sore or uncomfortable. It did take several tries to be confident putting the baby in and out, but now he's a pro! We were wondering why on earth you'd need the pocket on the front, but it's great for an emergency binky."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT, COMFORTABLE CARRIER","review":"I reviewed all the carriers before I registered for the Snugli. I was hesitant because some people said it hurt their back, while others said it was great. I think that it is wonderful and probably one of the most useful things I received. I am 5'6 and I wear my 2 month old son in this carrier for hours. I can get my whole house clean on those particulary fussy days when he just wants to be close. He sacks right out. My husband, who is 5'10, wears it when we go out for walks and loves being close to our son. It is very easy to adjust and is a quality carrier. I wouldn't spend the money on the more expensive carrier."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great product, but a bit tough to get on and off","review":"I bought two infant carriers when my daughter was born, a Baby Bjorn and a Snugli. The Baby Bjorn is easier to use by far, but it's also slightly less comfortable for a really long haul because the padding on the straps isn't quite as good as the Snugli's. As far as price goes, the Snugli is by far the more reasonable purchase. I felt the Baby Bjorn was the best when my daughter was small and that I preferred the Snugli as she got older, faced forward and weighed more. You will definitely want to own at least one of these carriers. They're lifesavers when the baby is really small and will only sleep while being held. Later on, they're fun for walks and for bonding."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE THIS!!!","review":"This carrier is SO convenient for doing things around the house...or when you just need to run in somewhere (store or whatever) and need your hands to be free! My baby--now 4.5 months--is very comfortable in this. It allows me to clean, cook, or do whatever I need to do when he wants to be held and I am unable to just sit and hold him! He was colicky at first and this was a godsend! He was tummy to tummy with me and felt comfortable with the movement...and I could still get things done, and move around without having to exhaust my arms! Seriously don't waste your money on an expensive carrier b/c this one is just great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good carrier at all!","review":"This product is terrible. I tried it on once. My baby slid to the bottom and her face was completely covered. There are too many snaps and buckles. I got a sling from Hotslings instead. It works great and is MUCH LESS COMPLICATED.

The way you need to maneuver yourself and your baby to use this thing is ridiculous. Also, the material is not soft and seems like it would scratch babies' soft face skin. I would never buy another and return any I got as a gift immediately. Try it before you hbuy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for us","review":"This carrier was not for us. It was awkward and difficult to use. My son was not comfortable in the carrier either. I exchanged it for the model below and love it! It's super easy to use and my son loves it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoulder Strap Problem","review":"This carrier has been nice to use when I walk my dog or go shopping instead of bringing a stroller. The shoulder padding tends to slide around since they are not attached to the straps. When this does happen, the straps dig into my shoulder. Also, it took quite some time before my son was able to face forward. He could hold his head well enough long before he was tall enough to face forward, but my baby didn't mind facing me. Some similar carriers fold down by the babies face so they can face forward easier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Speaking specifically about the front-facing position (that is, a small infant facing inward), I really hate this product. It is complicated to learn how to use, and very awkward to put on without someone's assistance-- useless to me, since I need a carrier when I am home alone doing chores. It has very awkward side clips that are hard to fasten when the baby is loaded, resulting in an angry baby and an irritated parent. The strap that goes across the back is difficult to reach without help. Once the baby is loaded, her head bangs against your chest when you walk around. Every time I have tried to use it, I just get mad. Why on earth would someone design such an annoying and complicated product for use with an infant?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bulky","review":"This carrier is way too bulky and a complete pain to put on. I registered for it after reading some favorable reviews but wish I didn't. I am going to try another brand. If your baby is small you have to pull all the straps so much that you have tons of things dangling all over the place. It is hard to get her in and out of it without major disruption to her, and no matter how I adjust it the left shoulder continually slips for me. It is also too small in the waist adjustment for my husband who is a pretty big guy. I thought the Bjorn carriers were overpriced but I am going to try another brand. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not fond of this one","review":"I am disappointed with this product. It is difficult to get baby in and out. While she seems ok when facing in, when we put her facing out it cut into her little chubby thighs at only 4 mos. old and cut off her circulation. Haven't tried any of the other carriers, but I prefer a sling to this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont waste your money","review":"This carrier was such a pain! It has so many straps and adjustments that it was a project that required the help of my husband to put on and take off. Our son just looked uncomfortable in it and I was also uncomfortable with the skinny little shoulder straps. We attempted to use it a handful of times and each time gave up because it was uncomfortable.I tried some of the other brands that were more expensive but they were so much more comfortable they would have been well worth the extra money. In the end I did not purchase another carrier, but I would recomment either spending a little more on a higher quality carrier or not buying one at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to use!","review":"The neck support for the newborn position didn't like to stay put and my poor baby's neck flopped around. Now that he is a little older and faces out, the neck support is support flap is supposed to tuck under, but it keeps getting in the way. Alex just chews on it when it doesn't shimmy up over his eyes. I haven't tried it on my back yet. The whole system is a bit uncomfortable for me, but better than some I've tried. If you lean forward just a little, the baby flops away from you, though. I must admit, I don't know what I'd do without it while watching both my baby and my sister's 11-month old, though!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good-until you use the front carrier","review":"I LOVED this until my daughter could face outwards. I know it says that the part that once supported the baby's head goes down, but it doesn't. I could not get the upper part out of her face when she was facing out. I had to fold it under the straps. Anyway, I returned it and got the other one by Snugli. I think it's called the Comfort Vent. Much easier to figure out. Just my $.02."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Uncomfortable","review":"This carrier was so uncomfortable that our daughter cried when we put her in it. there is a stiff piece of fabric that the baby's head rests on, while they face you, and it always left a big red line under he chin. it was very combersom to put on.spend the extra $$ and get a baby bejorn. they too are tricky to put on, but so much more comfy for you and baby!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great buy!!","review":"My daughter would jump into this carrier if she could. She loves being in it. She falls sleep everytime she gets in there.The only thing I dont like too much is that the straps are so long. They have about an extra foot on each strap. And there are afew of them. I had trouble adjusting them all the first time I used it.Putting it on is a little arkward too unless your able to reach between your shoulder blades.This carrier also allows your baby to face outwards to see what you see. Im sure my daughter will love this too seeing that she is already a nosey parker.Great buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ive read it twice","review":"Of the countless books I've read in my 26 years, this one will remain in my top ten for one reason: I hadnt even gotten through the first ten pages before I realized that I have the same condition as the main character. His Tourette's affects him in horrible ways, while mine has rarely been more than a slight nuisance (and sometimes a good conversation piece), but the similarities were too great to ignore. For that reason alone I'll be greatful to Daniel Hecht for writing this book. BUT...without the revelation that I have the same condition as the protagonist, this would still be a memorable book, full of suspence and downright creepy scenes. When an author makes you do research, seeing if what happened in the book actually exists (I'm not speaking of Tourette's, but of another subject which I can't reveal) then you know he's done a good job. This is a wild book, from beginning to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Struggling Under the Burden of Advance Praise","review":"To read through the accolades on the dust jacket, I expected miracles, or at least fireworks. The book was entertaining and a worthy first effort, but not exactly the \\"most psychologically sophisticated thriller\\" this reviewer has ever read. The many interesting subplots kept me up late into the night. Unfortunately, even the author had trouble keeping track; one or two story lines got lost. In the end, I found the race to the final conflict more exciting than the ultimate outcome. Still, it was well worth the three dollars and the trip to the bargin bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"interesting enough, but dragged on","review":"Just finished Skull Session last night and was very disappointed in the ending, well, actually the entire story. The information on the mental disorders was informative, but the story lacked good characterization and dialog. The dialog was stiff and too formal - who speaks like they are constantly referencing a thesaurus and psychological texts? Seems way too forced. I just couldn't get into the disappearances and murders, or Paul's relations with his family. I was thoroughly disappointed and found myself just trying to get through it just to get through it."},{"rating":"2","title":"AT LAST !!!","review":"At last Daniel Hecht's Skull Session is out in paperback, making it even more accessible as it rises in national bestselling ratings. If you want a REAL thrill, READ THIS BOOK !......Meanwhile, the natives are restless as we wait impatiently for Hecht's second novel, The Babel Effect, to come out in the near future. READ SKULL SESSION AND CHALLENGE YOUR MIND AS WELL AS YOUR COURAGE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary,intelligent stuff","review":"Looking forward to reading whatever this guy writes next. This book was so exciting, always smart and thoughtful, never dull. Whenever I hear a ratcheting sound I'm going to run for cover. There aren't many thrillers that manage to be scary, nuanced and perceptive all at once. I see why they called it a neurological thriller. This one really was about how the brain works. And it doesn't always work in nice ways."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engrossing... kept me up at night.","review":"I bought the book on a whim, not really knowing anything beyond the \\"psychoneurological thriller\\" epithet. From the first page, I had a hard time putting it down. The texture of the book is so dense and layered -- like the debris in the Lodge -- that I found it irresistable. I've never been able to resist the ruined and the smashed; nor can I turn away from the true mysteries: Are we really \\"meat machines\\"? hidden beings within beings? bundles of nerves and chemical reactions?Tho I wish the ending hadn't reminded me quite so much of a \\"clash of the Titans\\" or Godzilla meets whoever, I can't really imagine another way for it to have ended. That in itself is praise enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irritating and Slightly Ridiculous","review":"I don't demand Shakespeare when I read suspense thrillers, but this book really bothered me. Two things, in particular, need to be said. First, for the plot to work the protagonist has to be the biggest, most irritating wimp on the planet. I realize the man has Tourette's, and I realize that would affect his interactions with his loved ones, but if once, just once, he pushed a little harder with some of his questions the mystery would be quickly dispelled. Hecht seems to realize this and tries to figure out ways around it, but I don't think he ever really solved the problem. Second, the ultimate answer to the mystery is incredibly silly. It may be plausible, but the reality of the climax is laugh-inducing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tourette Syndrome is not a side-show disorder!","review":"As a college graduate,I can appreciate a budding author wanting to make a buck and attract readers with a character who faces unusual and challenging circumstances, but Tourette Syndrome is not a side show disorder!! Less then 10% of folks like myself who have Tourette Syndrome DO NOT experiance outbursts of uncontrollable obsenities, violent tics, or job unemployment. Depicting 38 year old Paul as some sort of wild, neurological \\"anomaly\\" incapable of getting his disorder and his personal life under control is not only inaccurate and deeply offensive, but takes away from an otherwise intriging tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"SLEEP SESSION","review":"Read this torpidly-paced ridiculous \\"thriller\\" at your own risk.

With this one, it is very hard to control and the range is so short, that if you were to try to drive it into a small pond, you will have to swim out to retreive it!Also, the kids just seem to lose interest in the rc, I thought this one would be different, but my 8 yo, and 5 yo, stopped playing with it on the first day and it just collects dust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Pricey!","review":"I was seriously thinking of buying this toy for my grandson. But after reading the reviews and finding out that a $30 battery pack has to be bought seperately for it has definately changed my mind in buying it. What were they thinking!!!! I don't care if it can go over ice snow mud and grass. It's too pricey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fraud is fun, but batteries aren't included","review":"I think the biggest problem I've seen is turning a $70 toy into a $100 toy with the words \\"batteries not included\\". My issue isn't that there are no batteries (I learned with Tyco last Christmas to check the box) my problem is that the ToysRUs Website on Amazon.com states that this product requires 1-9 volt battery when it actually requires 1-9 volt plus a $30.00 add-on."},{"rating":"1","title":"WALT","review":"I never tried the snow or the water, but on grass and asphalt, this thing will barely move. It will only travel out of control on pavement in a sideways fashion. It will not go forward as the rotors won't grip. Hardly moves at all in even short grass. Regardless of the battery cost, do not buy this. You will be disappointed. I just ordered Tyco Vertigo & another Stunt car from Amozon.com that use the TMH battery. (...) Good Luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Toy!","review":"I bought this toy at Target, but they don't have a review section so I'm here. I think it's a great toy!

I say: \\"BUY IT OR ELSE!\\" Oh, and you might want to buy the TMH FLEXPAK, too. It can't run without! (Note: Battery takes four hours to charge, five and a half hours the first two times!

What a let down!!! The toy definitely was not what it was shown to be on TV. While this is no big surprise, I at least thought that it would do some exciting things. It would barely move on the grass. We tried it on dirt, sand, and driveway. It never really performed very well. I really don't mean to sound negative, but I am really being honest. For the price, I really thought it would be a better toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"BATTERY DOESNT LAST","review":"Well my son got the terrain twister this year (FINALLY) for xmas, last year it was sold out and unavailable. He has spent more time charging the battery then he has used it. The battery seems to take forever to charge only to get a few minutes use of it. He is not impressed and I am dissapointed with it also. It was not worth the 80 plus 30 for battery pack I paid."},{"rating":"1","title":"total fraud","review":"Tyco should be ashamed of itself. They mislead parents into thinking the battery is included only to later surprise parents with the price of $35 for a battery that is not included on a $60 gift.The worst part is that we brought the gift to switzerland from florida. When our son went to use it we realized it didn't have a battery and there was no where within 3 hours that had it.

I did notice that they have corrected it on here, but too late for me and I now have to return the one that was suggested and sent to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst RC toy ever","review":"I couldn't agree more with the bad reviews of this toy. I bought 2 of these for my two boys, and they both hated them. It won't go in a straight line, as someone else pointed out, it only goes relatively fast sideways, and can't hardly go at all in grass or dirt. There is almost no control of these things.

My son played with it once...then said he'd rather color. I've never seen him pass up an R/C toy for coloring!!!!I was so angry that I called Tyco directly. There's a number on the box! Luckily, they provided me with good customer service by allowing me to send them the stupid thing back. They promise to send me a voucher to purchase another Tyco vehicle that works better.

Tyco needs to make it way more clear that this is the case. Parents are way too busy to have to search & search for this information. I checked the Toys-R-Us info when ordering & it says only that it requires 1 9-volt battery - nothing about the special - $30 extra rechargable battery pack. [...] It just needs to be much clearer or to be most helpful - included in the toy, sure it would be more expensive, but at least it would be there.

So Even though we took the time to ensure all the batteries listed were bought, the boys could only look at these toys, what fun!!! Not only can you not buy these on Christmas day because all stores are closed. You can't just run out and buy these batteries, you have to order them.

Some of the simplest turns are hard to make with this system. The controller is very cheaply made. The control buttons are not durable. My unit stopped working 3 minutes after being on water. It never came back to life. It does not live up to the hype. What does? The manufacturers should not be allowed to make the claims they have regarding the toy.

However, if I were living in Thailand, this book would be helpful. Even though I live in southern California where there are plenty of asian supermarkets with fresh fruits and vegetables, the ingredients asked in this book are impossible to find. For example, some recipes ask for mangosteens and other tropical fruits, where to find? I think that the author strikes for absolute authenticity, but as we know, every cook improvises given the available ingredients. The author does not bother to tell us how to substitute any hard-to-find ingredients.

I have taken private cooking lessons with chefs in Thailand and I am addicted to both the culture and food of this beautiful country.When I got David Thomson's book for my birthday, I was both very happy and very sad. Happy, because I had finally found the ultimate Thai cookbook. A book that reads like a blend between a dictionary, history book and fantastic cook book. Sad, because at the moment I opened the first page I knew that my dream of writing a Thai cookbook had come to an end. There is nothing more to be said or written. David Thomson has done it. I recommend this book to all people serious about Thai cooking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only for hardcore Beatles fans","review":"I absolutely loved this DVD. I was a little skeptical at first because it was so cheap, but it was such a bargain. I wouldn't recommend this DVD to the casual Beatles fan, however. It is filled with rare interviews with the boys, from various cities on various tours. There's no music in it, just an hour of talking, but it is well worth it. The interviews are treaures, to see the interaction between the four members. They were very close and it shows. The Pyramus and Thisbe skit is so hilarious, I would have bought it just for that one scene. There are many numerous hilarious moments withing this DVD. Like John saying that The Beatles is just a name \\"you know, like shoe. We could have been called the Shoes for all you know.\\" Things like that.

I have the 45 piece set of antique white dishes, and liked it so much that I ordered the cereal bowls to go with the set. All of the dishes are very high quality.

They are much more elegant than the Correlle. The price couldn't be beat, as I purchased them from Amazon's 4 for 3 promotion. Because of this promotion, I was able to purchase the whole set.

The bowls that come with the Countryside set are shallow and great for soup/stew or small portions but with 3 children, I needed deep bowls for cereal and ice cream! These work great!

After purchasing a stoneware set from Pfaltzgraff and watching it get completely scratched up after 1 week's use, I returned it all. A bridal consultant at Macy's suggested china instead of stoneware for durability reasons (including the four children who load and unload our dishwasher). We were intrigued with Mikasa's Antique White pattern but thought that it was out of our price range until we discovered it at Amazon. We <love> our new plates and bowls and have begun collecting other serving pieces. It's lighter than stoneware, and makes even tacos seem more elegant. The pieces have already been clanked together soundly without a crack, scratch, or chip.

On first viewing I had trouble distinguishing some of the male characters. Maybe if I watch it again, the difference will become clear.Some reviewers feel that this 1934 version is better than the one from 1956. From my experience, it is the other way around. Two stars for 1934 and four or five stars for 1956. I really felt the suspension and tension in that one. If I saw a better reproduction of 1934, would I change my mind?

Very bad paraphrasing of almost every sentence uttered.As far as the actors go, not very good. The guys are young and attractive since they float around in a world of modeling, stripping, and porn. They might be pretty, but they're not very good actors. The nudity is minimal. I didn't buy any of the father-son scenes at all. It seemed to me that some scenes must have been cut. A whole subplot about the visiting cousin needed to be fleshed out.This is not gay enough to be gay. And it's not straight enough to be straight. And it's certainly not good enough to be good. It's just dull and pointless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"I thought this movie was very disjointed. It didn't do a very good job of connecting the scenes. The cinematography was excellent. But that couldn't save this movie from been very uninteresting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic CD","review":"Although not as great as their groundbreaking releases \\"Forever Young\\" and \\"Prostitute,\\" \\"Salvation,\\" like all other Alphaville albums, only improves with age. A great, harder-edged sound is presented by Alphaville with this album, a little more techno than usual. Overall, this is a must have for any Alphaville, Pet Shop Boys, or Erasure fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Synthpop is alive and kicking","review":"It's good to see the Metropolis label branching out and embracing other genres of music besides darkwave and EBM. It was surprising when I found out that Alphaville would be releasing Salvation stateside through the industrial superlabel. Upon the first listen, I knew that Salvation was going to be a good album. The songs that struck me the most was \\"Monkey In The Moon\\", \\"Guarding Angel\\" and \\"Soul Messiah.\\" For those of you who lived and loved the 80's, this album is definately for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alphaville makes a foray into techno-blandness","review":"Sorry I have to disagree with the other reviewers. I was a big fan of Alphaville in the 80's, but this one is full of empty euro-dance fluff that may get your feet moving but the melodies and chord progressions are absolutely commonplace. A guardian angel theme runs the course of this album, making it a concept album I suppose, and even this becomes tiresome. Also gone are the cryptic lyrics full of wild imagery that made Alphaville so unusual (though I suspect a lot of it was nonsense stemming from an awkward grasp of the English language at the time). I have yet to buy Prostitute, but my hopes are up on that one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alphaville in the future...","review":"Probably one of the best CD's by alphaville to date. Their new upbeat techno style music makes this different from anything you've heard from them before. Unlike other bands though, the meaning in the music is not compromised by the new style that they display on this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Alphaville's best","review":"... Alphaville is still playing the sort of electronically-oriented pop/dance music that made me so fond of them in 80s, although they do seem to have mellowed (and darkened just a tiny bit) with age. I recommend this CD to anyone who has fond memories of Alphaville's music.On the plus-side, stand-out tracks include \\"Guardian Angel,\\" \\"Wishful Thinking, \\"Dangerous Pieces,\\" \\"Pandora's Lullaby,\\" and \\"Wishful Thinking Physical.\\"On the minus-side there are some tracks that go on just a bit too long to support the flimsiness of the song in question (\\"Flame\\" and \\"Point of Know Return,\\" and \\"Soul Messiah\\" are the greatest sinners as far as this goes).The good, however, far outweighs the bad on this CD, so in the end it stands as one of the best Alphaville albums I've heard."},{"rating":"2","title":"They're still alive and kicking...","review":"Just when you think that they've hung up their instruments for good, since it's been years since the last release of an Alphaville 'album', another one appears (I only found out by checking for their CD's here on Amazon), and presents their unique musical talents in a different and refreshing way. For me, using their CD to test my new surround sound stereo system, the opening track, \\"Inside Out\\" astonished me, and let me know that once again, they've produced an incredible volume of music. I think that they're one of the most 'underrated' or 'under-realized' groups that ever was (they've been producing music now for around 20 years but no one I know has heard of them...). I hope they keep going... (I'll be waiting for the next release)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Album Since Forever Young","review":"If you're old enough to remember those great dance tunes from the 1980's, you'll remember Alphaville: Forever Young, Big in Japan, Summer in Berlin, Red Rose, Universal Daddy...Well, \\"Salvation\\" proves that this German band can create dance music for any decade! If you like to move, you should get this CD. Don't let the sticker price put you off. It's well worth it!This one NEVER leaves my CD player!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive","review":"I found this series surprisingly good.

Added to it, you get a preview by Tony Curtis - Mr. Cheese himself. This not one of Cary Grant's better movies to say the least.However, His Girl Friday is an excellent movie.

From the perspective of a witness/participant in the pre-Stonewall era of gay life in NYC, Nestle recreates the courage and the struggles of lesbians to find each other and create community in the '50s and '60s. Nestle's writing is beautiful and moving; this book is unique.I highly recommend this book for everyone who wants an understanding of lesbian life and culture during these particular years; I especially recommend this book for younger lesbians and gay men who are interested in understanding the lives and sacrifices of the generation previous, who helped create what we know and enjoy as contemporary lesbian and gay culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"A renewed appreciation of what it means to be lesbian","review":"A Restricted Country is the personal and candid testimony of lesbian activist, speaker, and working class woman Joan Nestle.

I was able to pick the person out within the first 10 minutes of the picture. That's really neither here nor there, but if you are looking for a shocking surprise, you won't get it from this movie.To be fair, however, this is a better than average crime flick with good acting all around and the comedic moments are less dated that most from similar films of the era.There is a lot of good tension in the middle of the film and the revelation of who did it works well."},{"rating":"1","title":"why was it wet with pages torn out?","review":"well the title says it all. it was soaked when it came in the mail and a few pages were ripped out. it was not tampered with post shipping. thats just how it came in the box, on a sunny day."},{"rating":"2","title":"an essential field guide","review":"This is a must have book for anglers or anyone with a passion for Atlantic saltwater fish.

It lives in an area between genres, hovering next to punk, goth, and industrial, but mostly punk. The vocals are so deep that they don't sound human; imagine Barry White's evil twin with a cold. (That's actually a good thing) The tracks vary nicely, so it doesn't fall into the one-note, three chord trap.Points of note? The cover of This Land is Your Land is brilliant, and the chorus of Barf Baby kept me singing along all night.Short and sweet: You want this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving and beautifully realized","review":"A heartwarming and well crafted film. The Lucas character is the most endearing of them all specially because he must endure much from the obsessive Martin. But once the love bug hits, all bets are off. The main character is not so lovable but the movie is and it will leave you yearning for more way after you have seen it. Well recommended for purchase and for keeps sake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"After declaring his love for the straight Lucas, Martin not only gains his love, he breaks up the heterosexual relationship Lucas was in at the time. (Oops!) Martin then proceeds to spend the duration of the film driving Lucas away. Since he's dying of AIDS, Martin is far too busy playing the martyr to acknowledge the pain his lover and mother are going through. He shows a completely selfish and callous disregard for anyone's feelings but his own. Martin is an insensitive, self-righteous jerk who deserves to die alone. Good riddance!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Awful","review":"The box cover and desription of this make this flick seem sexy and edgy. It is actually boring, depressing, and almost completely reprehensible. The moral of the story is that straight men can be persuaded to pity gay men enough to sleep with them (but only if they have AIDS and are dying). I was insulted by this film. Save yourself time and agravation--skip this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A stunning success","review":"I've passed this movie up continously in the video store. The synposis on the back of the movie cover simply does not give it justice! Finally, I broke down and rented it and I'm so glad I did! It's beautifully acted, scripted and it totally moved me. Of all the gay movies I've seen, this is without a doubt, one of my favorites. Yes one of the characters has AIDS, but that is so not like the typical American gay flick, where one of the guys has HIV. This film is done so majestically, I guess, like only the french can do. Definitely worth seeing, this it truely a great movie about two men who fall in love with each other."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another AIDS gay flick","review":"If you've never seen a story about a gay man stricken with AIDS and a loyal lover in a tear jearker, then you may be able to tolerate this movie. Otherwise, if you're looking for a film with real sex, believable characters and plot, don't waste your time. The only redeeming feature of this film is the French sea town setting. The motivation for the straight diver's change of preference is totally absent. The presentation of the main character as more than a kooky, pushy companion is not convincing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too idealistic, Too Simple","review":"I found this movie to be incredibly simplistic in its ultimate message and its failure to fully develop the characters leave the viewer feeling unfulfilled, and in my case, extremely confused. The Man I Love immediately introduces that the main character has feelings for Lucas, the straight guy (I'm talking like in the first 5 minutes he is like I love you). Because of this hurried approach to ignite the love between the two characters, the powerful message in the end becomes undersupported. For Christ's sake the main guy has AIDS and chases after Lucas, who is struggling with his own sexuality. So, there are two conflicts occurring simultaneously. The amount of internal conflict paired with lack of character development (like the viewer doesn't get to know the characters at all, period, the end) causes the movie to ultimately fail in its purpose. Don't rent this movie, 'cause youll get a huge disappointment. Rent Burnt Money. It's awesome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BRAVO! Gay cinema at its best","review":"The depiction on the cover of this dvd/video is somewhat misleading as it tends to lead one to believe that this a superficial \\"softporn and eye candy\\" type movie. The very opposite is true. While the actors in this film are definitely easy on the eyes they have have a depth of character and emotion that few american gay film characters achieve. I found myself feeling sorrow, attraction, and admiration, all at the same time for the lead character of Martin throughout the movie. The plot is sad and beautiful at the same time with just the right amount of emotion and not too much preachiness given the fact that it is about AIDS and the impending death of one of the characters.This is a must see if you get the chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"a heart-warming love story","review":"This is a pretty decent heart-warming romance between an out-and-proud guy who has the ba**s to tell a straight guy he works with he's interested in him. What happens after is what this movie is about. How many guys dream they could do that? Well, in this movie you can see what could happen if you did... The French are quite good in producing artsy romance/comedy/dramas with a touch of je-ne-sais-quis that make them so unique. Definitely worth having in your DVD collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"The 39 Steps","review":"This take of the original novel is fairly decent, however there is much better version available. In 1979 a Brittish film company produced a color version of the original story, which I think is outstanding. Though extremely hard to find, spend the extra time to locate the '79 Brittish version of the 39 Steps. It is much more accurate and suspenseful, compared to the Hitchcock versions. Quite frankly, don't waste your time watching Hitchcock's movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful budget interface!","review":"I couldn't disagree more with the other reviewer. Using my alesis io2 with my macbook couldn't be any easier. Garageband sees the interface immediately and asks if you'd like to change to that device....then you just add a track, plug in your instrument and hit record. The fact that the alesis is USB powered makes it more attractive because it allows you to record anywhere! This is a solidly constructed device, sturdy and very sleek. I HIGHLY recommend it...it did even work on MY old windows machine before I got my macbook....if the Alesis doesn't work for you, then you're doing something wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely useless","review":"I bought this unit over the cheaper io|2 express because it looked better quality in the pictures, and had better reviews.

Subsequently bought the io2 express and have had no problems with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thumbs down","review":"The Alesis io|2 failed to work properly under Windows XP w/ Cakewalk Home Studio 6. The result was two-fold:1: playback was an octave higher than recording -- which can be fixed if you remember to (manually) set the sample rates accordingly. This problem occurred in Sonar Home Studio 6, Cubase LE 1, and Window's \\"sound recorder\\" app.2: in Cakewalk, regardless of varied ASIO buffer settings, recording was garbled and filled with static.I was able to duplicate the problem in two different XP environments: one under an HP dv8000 with Media Center Home Edition, and another with IBM thinkpad t60p w/ XP professional (both with ample RAM and CPU).After 6 months of troubleshooting and support calls to Cakewalk and Alesis, I bought the Edirol UA-25EX audio interface, and it worked perfectly upon the first attempt.

This is a story about a young man who goes to Vietnam to fight. This young man represents Myers, and is used to show his experiences and thoughts about the war. Myers goes into great detail with his experiences and feelings of the war. He shows his confusion and disagreement with the United States involvement in the fighting. He also brings in his anti-racist points of view as well. There are a few battle scenes that catch your attention, and are very descriptive. Although this book is an interesting account of Myers experiences and opinions of the war it struggles to show the reality of the war. He puts aside the real reasons for the war, (the attempt to stop communism) to show the gruesome manslaughter and the worthless sacrifice of young men. The book is overly descriptive making it long and a drag to read. There is not enough battle scenes to interest battle enthusiasts either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible book","review":"This is a terrible book.

One always reads of war novels in romantisized fashion or a militaristic viewpoint, except here. This portrayal focuses on the emotional impact the realities of war hold for soldiers. It is plain to see why present Vietnam veterans are so hesitant to speak of their experiences in war. From reading this book one will assume they experienced the worst. Fallen Angels is a war story from a non-traditional depition that is truely inspiring."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best","review":"I did like the novel, but it was not something I would usually read. My father was a Vietnam Veteran so that kept me interested in the novel. I could almost see what was going on during the war by reading the book. Images would pop up in my head as I read the high and low points of the novel. This novel made me think about what my father had to go through during the war.The novel started off slow, but it spead up after a while. There were five soldiers assigned to the same squad. They did not like their squad leader. They wahted to band together to get rid of him. They were trying to work together and stay alive while doing there their job in Vietnam. Death came on both sides of the battle field.I would recommend this novel to any one who wants to vision what American soldiers went through in the Vietnam War.

Perhaps one of the best, easy-to-read, down-to-earth books written about war, it portrays not only the young men and women of the war, but also puts a face and soul to every character. From the main character's pining and missing home to the bond developed between fellow soldiers, Walter Dean Myers accurately portrays what it is like for soldiers on a deployment.For those comtemplating whether or not our current war on Iraq is justified, this book won't help with deciding that. What it does help decide, however, is that soldiers have families too. They also have feelings, emotions and most certainly, can be deep, as shown in the conversations throughout the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fallen Angels","review":"Eighteen year old Richie Perry has enlisted in the Army during Vietnam in order to be able to send money home to his mother and brother. He has a medical excuse which prevents from being in active combat. Unfortunately, his medical file does not follow him to Vietnam. Perry is placed in a squadron with soldiers not much older than he, and together they must face life, death, killing and destruction, all while trying to stay alive amidst grenades, active mines and the Vietcong. This book is a powerful look at the fear which encompassed the soldiers during this terrible war. You will cry with Richie as he sees fellow soldiers killed senselessly and you will be scared with him as he waits, quietly for Vietcong soldiers to pass by without seeing him. Walter Dean Myers brings the young fighting men to life in this inspiring novel of courage and honor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fallen Angels can't sink much lower","review":"I can't for the life of me understand all these reviews--5 stars indeed! Even the reviews on the cover make this out to be a magnificent book. What rubbish! I find it pretty disgusting when an author makes glaring technical mistakes--its a distraction and only goes to remind one that Walter Dean Myers sits at his desk pretty well, but didn't even have the professionalism to check out simple and important details before writing. Makes the whole thing out for what it is--contrived blather not worth the $7. Don't be fooled by this rip off--if you can overlook American soldiers caarrying \\".60 caliber\\" machine guns and .50 caliber machine guns door mounted on Hueys, then by all means go ahead. Otherwise, save you money, or you can fish my copy out of the trash!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Account of the Vietnam War","review":"This book was a great recollection of the times in the Vietnam War, but also was a great lesson of how not to write a book.

Some times i found myself just reading because it was required, but i did get into the books sometimes. I think that fallen angels is the type of a book that should be made into a movie. Walter Dean Myers did an exellant job describing everything and put a pictue into my head on what Perry was going through. I would give this book 5 stars if you are a guy, and 4 if you are a girl. I think that the fighting part will be more exiting for guys to read. Some of the stories about the war the author described were not too factual,but over all, i would read the book.

And Perry illustrating what it's like to live army life in vietnam Anybody that likes a good action book Fallen Angels should be on their list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fallen Angels","review":"Fallen Angels is the best book I've ever read and by far my favorite. This book can make you laugh one minute then give u that frightened feeling in the pit of your stomach the next. The story takes place during the VIetnam war. The main characters are named Perry and Peewee. AT the time they thought going to war would be a good idea at the time. They were in for it because war was not as thoughtlessly fun and interesting as it seemed. I loved this book. There was so much suspense and action you just couldn't put the book down. The way the men bonded was a beautiful contribution to this book. You just feel like your in the book. This was definitly the best book I've ever read and, dispite some language, i strongly recommend this book to all ages that have any taste for a good book, because this is nothing less than a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"outstanding book","review":"I am only a twelve years and I have read this book.It is an incredible war story that tells about the real life of an american who fought in the vietnam war. I would definately reccomend this book to any young adult to adult. Whether you are 12 or 99 you will enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving piece of Literature for adolescents.","review":"Having read this book as a 26 year old college student, I found that it is one of the few war novels that does not attempt to paint the protagonist as some larger than life war hero. Here, we see a young man who only wants to survive the war and discover why it is that when others die, he feels sadness and a feeling of relief that it was not him. I believe that every young adult needs to read this novel and see for themself that conflicting feelings are not foreign. They are a natural part of life and Myers allows us to see them in a very powerful way."},{"rating":"2","title":"FALLEN ANGELS","review":"Fallen Angels was the best book I ever read. If you like suspenseful books i would read this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthy of your time","review":"Fallen Angels by Walter Dean Myers is an adventure story about 5 US soldiers serving in Vietnam. Although not a true story, it is based on real life and the horrors of war. The group of friends attempt to survive Vietnam through a close comraderie. Myers' writing brings the war to life as we experience the battles, injuries, drinking and day to day routines of our soldiers. So much of our society is currently enmeshed in the Middle East, this book is a great reminder of the sacrifices made by our soldiers."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is is a great book, and YOU should read it!!!","review":"This was a great book because it had war things in it and thats the kind of thing that I like. This guy went to Vietnam and it tells his story about what it was like and how the soldiers went on patrol. It had the kind of details that I like. It also gave me an idea of how it was in Vietnam. The thing that I liked the most was that it made me feel like I was there watching them. I was able to envision it in my mind because of the author's descriptions of the action. Any guy would like this book if they are interested in learning about war."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite books!!","review":"This book was sad, and trilling at the same time. I couldn't put it down. In one day i had read 131 pages. It makes you think twice about the war and the situation we are in right now, and what we are doing. This book is a classic, and I recomend it to everyone. Read this book and I garentee you will love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book","review":"This book is probably the easiest read you'll ever have in your life. The story is excellent, and you really feel for Richie Perry, the protagonist. He goes through a lot and Fallen Angels is incredibly realistic. This is one of the best war books out there, and it is one of the best books I've ever read.Also, the author's brother died in veitnam, so you know that this is all from the heart, and Walter Dean Myers displays his affection in the book openly and it makes the book even better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fallen Angels Hits the Ground Hard!","review":"This novel was hypnotizing, it drew our attention into the book and brought our imagination into the deep jungels of Vietnam. One of Walter Dean Myers best works. The launguage of the book was realistic and simple to read. The experencies of Perry really made us think of how hard and devestating war can be!"},{"rating":"2","title":"FALLEN ANGELS IS DA BOMB!!!","review":"THIS BOOK WAS SO GOOD IT WAS A GOOD DESCRIPTION OF VIETNAM! EVERYONE SHOULD READ THIS BOOK! NOW!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book for a first hand look at vietnam.","review":"Fallen Angels is the story of a teenager from Harlem, named Richie Perry, who joins the Army and gets sent to Vietnam. Perry and his squad have many encounters with the Vietcong and face many life or death situations. This book is well written and the situations make you feel a wide range of emotions. It's mostly action, with a bit of love and sadness. There is a pro war and anti war position in this book. During the course of the book, you wonder why these men were put in such dangerous and deadly missions. It helps many Americans see a view of Vietnam through the soldier's eyes. Walter Dean Meyers had a lot of input from people who experienced Nam first hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Respect","review":"This book gave me new respect for all fo the men who fought in Americas wars. I think that anyone of any age should read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"this book is worth the time and effort","review":"I read this book a few years ago and was quite amazed and moved by it. It is so hard to get an accurate portaryal of the evenst surrounding the vietnam war. As a teenager who is interested in this time period (the music, culture, politics) i was so happy to read this book. The book is so telling about all human nature that i think everyone should read this book, its that beneficial. So, please read this book so we can avoid this in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books ever!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"What can I say. Fallen Angels is a teriffic book. Being a teenager I really felt close to the characters in this book. The characterization in this book is teriffic. It's more indirect than direct because it does tell what each character is like but you still feel like these people have secrets that are better not told. Also I could really relate to the movie freak Lobel being a movie freak myself which made this book all the more better."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent, a book you can really understand","review":"this book is fantastic. The reader is able to really get the plot and what is happening b/c it doesn't contain heavy symbolism or hidden meanings that might distract the reader. When you read it the story line is what you get, not a bunch high society engilsh nonsence that has nothing to do with the story line. On top of that the story itself is absolutly fantastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing, it makes you really think","review":"This is an amazing novel, being a girl I took it really to heart.

Walter Dean Myers did an amazing job and deserves alot of credit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing good to say . . .","review":"Bad story, bad script, bad dialog and bad acting.

But reading THIS book made me sick to my stomach. The idea of using genetic engineering to turn future humans into animalistic creatures was literally an insult to my intelligence, and some of the creatures that are said to have evolved later were simply unscientific and implausible, such as the water seeker and the \\"memory people\\". Then aliens descended from humans that have escaped to another part of the galaxy return to Earth after 5 million years and wipe out nearly all creatures on Earth! After a few weeks, I literally threw this book away and my opinion of Mr. Dixon was lowered permenantly. Quite simply, he should never have written this nonsense!

Although it may be the most brilliant Blu Ray you'll see this side of Avatar, aside from the stunning picture quality there's not much to recommend. When the villain of the film actually laughs an evil \\"muuuwahahhahha\\" laugh...then and there I knew we were in dire, dire trouble. Between the absolutely ridiculous Susan Sarandon character ( who seems to have escaped from a Lifetime TV movie), the bizarre tra-la-la afterlife scenes which are overly precious, and plain bad story telling ( plodding, awkward structure and no real emotional linchpins) it is easy to see how the movie was a box office disappointment.The Blu Ray presentation itself is stunningly gorgeous, however it isn't supported by any kind of quality storytelling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely Bones will have you thinking twice before passing a corn field","review":"The first time I watch it I couldn't take my eyes away from the television screen had no idea what was going to happen next.The second time I watched it with my young children because I want them to become more aware of strangers and what does happen besides the fact we live next to corn fields..LOL"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where doth the fantasy lie?","review":"Cookie cutter flat stereotypes of a middle class family; the always lurking sex predator killer next door and of course what happens after we die (aka heaven). It was such a plastic artificial world that it failed to convince me of anything other than - aren't computer graphics wonderful and let's pray (pun) on some of our unrealistic fears.Negatives: The editing was self indulgent and led to a cutesy confusing storyline.Positives: The acting was appropriate to the flatness of the story - a task difficult to achieve."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tries to be 'What Dreams My Come' but fails","review":"I noticed some people compare this film to What Dreams May Come.The magic about What Dreams My Come comes from the fact that we don't know what is happening to the main character. He doesn't even know he is dead. We learn as he does as he goes along his 'death' journey. Heaven can be an awesome place and we get to experience some of that through him.With the Lovely Bones we know everything already. The main character is going to die, we know if from the beginning and so does she. We are then stuck in a limbo (which she knows about) with her as she tries to come to terms with her death. The limbo that the main characters wife in What Dreams May Come undergoes is a much more convincing depiction.Yes The Lovely Bones has some updated effects compared to What Dreams My Come has but the 'journey' is just not there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do yourself a favor: Just read the book. The movie does not do it justice...","review":"There is no way to translate the morbid beauty and innocence of this wonderful book onto the big screen.

There is no comparison, and the movie should've not been attempted."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so hot","review":"Well, I hope the book is better than the movie, because I found it not so hot. Actually, even silly. The drunk grandmother? All of a sudden a very serious thing becomes comical when she appears.

I gave it 2 stars, just for their effort. blah!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just get the book ...","review":"I really wanted to like this movie as a shared experience with my S.O., but except for Stanley Tucci's outstanding performance, this piece is an unmitigated mess. The writing is long-winded, meandering, and requires a complete suspension of disbelief. Pass on this one, any other use of your two hours would be an improvement."},{"rating":"1","title":"UNLOVELY","review":"This movie was a piece of sappy garbage. The nauteously overdone CGI heaven sequences bring the movie to a halt every time we are there. Jackson destroyed the few characters (and actors performances for that matter) who had potential to be interesting: Susan Sarandon, Mark Wahlberg, Rachel Weiz. The movie is a cut and paste job of the book that tries to do too much with too many characters. Jackson switches point of view just enough to never allow us to connect to anyone in the film.Peter, please go back to action movies. It is the only place where this much CGI can makeup for bad storytelling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like \\"what dreams may come\\" but worse...","review":"Pick a direction and stick with it - this movie tries to do it all. This movie is about the afterlife and crossing over, and is drenched in sentiment and symbolisms. This was like a standard child abduction drama, but it had the horrendous likes of \\"the cell\\" and \\"what dreams may come\\" added to it. I just couldn't bring myself to watch the whole thing, and watched it at 2x speed most of the way.This is definitely an artsy movie, probably meant for people that like emotional tear jerkers and pretty scenes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"After watching the movies that everybody raved about (up in the air and the blindside) and being underwhelmed.

It was well worth the wait. The acting is believable and offers first rate performances. If the film fails to move one then one must be completely devoid of emotion. Truly a heart wrenching tale.

Maybe it was because I was expecting so little, I came away from my first viewing pleasantly surprised and moved by the beauty of this film. I love Peter Jackson's work. Heavenly Creatures is one of my favorite movies of all time, and I think this film surpasses that one in visual beauty. While this movie is not a literal adaptation of Sebold's The Lovely Bones, it remains faithful to the spirit of the novel and to its most important plot elements. The movie does a wonderful job in exploring the evolution of the victim's character, after her death. My only quibble with the film is that I wish that it had spent a little more time in developing how her family gradually became reconciled to her passing. But no matter, this is still a beautiful movie that handles a most brutal crime in an unflinching, yet transcendant manner."},{"rating":"2","title":"LORD OF THE BONES","review":"Oscar winning director Peter Jackson shifts gears with this haunting translation of Alice Sebold's bestseller. The movie is beautifully filmed with gorgeous fantasy other worlds matched with stunning vistas of the real world. While Mark Wahlberg, Rachel Weisz and Susan Sarandon are fine in their roles, the movie belongs to Saorise Ronan and Stanley Tucci. Ronan is stunning as the murdered girl caught in a purgatory torn between her lust for revenge and a need to provide solace to her grieving family. Tucci's quietly malevolent killer is chilling. I would have preferred a more appropriate finish to his character, his ironic death is disturbingly satisfying. Not the classic it should have been, THE LOVELY BONES is nonetheless quality film-making."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This movie was beautiful the artwork the music everything about this movie is so touching.....i dont know how it compares to the book but alone it was Astonishing...A must see....

Well I only got half way through the movie but it was enough to get me to spend money to finish. The story line is wonderful and if you pay attention, you know everything that this movie is trying to tell you. It's a very heartwarming story, at the same time it's got tragedy and love. I love it and I would watch it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad!","review":"I have never read this book before, so I don't know any differences between it and the movie, but as far as movies go, this is a pretty good work.

If nothing else, this movie is definitely worth at least a watch. Check it out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"In Defense of the Positive Reviewers ...","review":"Their hearts are in the right place, and I understand why many people will like this film. But I think the majority of viewers will be very disappointed. This is not a good movie. As other reviewers have mentioned, it has no point, and is mostly a tedious trip to nowhere that really drags on at times. I love spirituality in films when it is presented in a moving and intelligent way. For that reason I really wanted to like this film. But there were so many twisted and silly elements (it presented heaven as like a sunny day in the midwest) that I fast-forwarded through most of the last act. The performances of the very talented cast are decent, but have no chance of making this film watchable. At times it's pretty to look at, and it does have some nice music -- so for that it deserves 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excrutiatingly painful","review":"The movie is boring, condescending, drawn out, choppy, and painful to watch.

I could have skipped this film and just turned on the news!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Afterlife","review":"Peter Jackson should know better. When you die, that is it. No CGI heaven or in-between, nothing. So please everybody, stop making movies about this subject, unless they are comedies and they sport Warren Beatty, are directed by Albert Brooks, or have the Archers seal on them. This tale is not suspenseful, nor rewarding. We are not children living in the 13th Century, so I don't understand the necessity of a graphical representation of a supposed afterlife of sorts. Sheesh. Two points for inspired visuals and the first 20 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully Boring Plot Lacking Purposeless film","review":"Need I say more. This film was a complete snooze and left me wondering throughout...where is this going? The storyline was so drawn out, all over the place and the movie was way too long. Nothing made sense nor did the disjointed pieces of the film tie themselves together in a comprehensible manner at the end!!The lead dead girl's body is never discovered and her murderer is not apprehended but randomly dies at the end in a \\"Final Destination\\" type of way?! The main clue that ties the murderer to the murder is handed off to a drunk and never spoken about or shown to the dead girl's parents who have grieved her death for months. I wasted my $1 on this film at the Red Box and want a refund!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My movie","review":"The movie plays like it is new. The quality is great and the price is right. I love the movie and am glad that I got it at such a great deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Do Justice to the Book","review":"This movie doesn't come close to doing justice to Alice Sebold's extraordinary book. While it has a lot of lovely special effects, the gist of the story falls flat; the excitement is gone.The story is about a young girl who is murdered by a serial killer. Her family is torn apart by the ordeal and each of them, in their own way, can't get over the murder. The murdered girl watches over her family from a semi-heaven as she, too, can't fully let go of her life. The actors in the movie (Mike Wahlberg, Susan Sarandon, Rachel Weisz, Stanley Tucci) are usually top-notch. However, in this film, their performances are rote. The only performance that stands out is Stanley Tucci's as the creepy murderer.I recommend you see this on DVD or skip it altogether. Do yourself a favor and read the book. It's astonishingly beautiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plot holes galore!! New Age junk....","review":"Ugh!! I hated this movie...good thing it was only a rental. I thought the depictions of heaven were ridiculous and certainly reminded me of the Robin Williams flick \\"What Dreams May become\\". Think massive bouncing beach balls and you get the picture. The \\"New Age\\" imagery was nauseating.The pedophile in the movie was the dumbest I have ever seen who turns out was the luckiest. Who builds a secret underground sex den in the middle of a field surrounded by houses?? What did he do with all the dirt?? LOL..nobody notices this?? He approaches his victim in broad daylight in middle of said field..nobody notices?? How did he destroy his den?? He kept a ton of keepsakes in it..the police couldn't get one clue out of it?? How did get that 500 pound safe up from his basement to his car by himself?? Why did he park so far from the dumping pit instead of pulling closer?? LOL..I could go on...but I already wasted enough time with this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everybody Needs To See This Film","review":"This is a polarizing film and I find that your enjoyment of the Lovely Bones will be based almost entirely on whether or not you connect in a deep way with Susie Salmon (played in a beautiful and soulful performance by the ridiculously talented Saoirse Ronan).I had that connection with her character and as a result The Lovely Bones was a powerful, heartbreaking and ultimately uplifting experience for me.It is a movie that stayed in my head long after I was done watching it although there are plenty of people who didn't like the film there are an equal amount of people for whom this film will be viewed as a classic in years moving forward."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sloppy work","review":"While I was as eager as anyone else to enjoy the unusual premise of the movie and hope for retribution for the killer, there were two glaring flaws that turned me off. Didn't the police take fingerprints in the hidey hole? There were certainly enough objects the killer handled there. The other was the heavy safe that took two men to roll ponderously over the ground to the dump. How did the killer get it up (or down for that matter into the underground hole) from the hole, onto his truck in the first place? Where were the brains behind these scenes which were so obviously illogical? Other than those serious glitches, I applaud Stanley Tucci for his performance. Tucci has played disparate roles in the past as Julia Childs' fond husband, the wardrobe master for Meryl Streep, and was superb in each. Did anyone else notice these two points I set out?"},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie","review":"this was one of my favorite movies of the year. it was very suspenseful, sad, and overall a very good movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Odd......","review":"I only knew a little about the premise of this movie. The movie started out ok, then became some sort of acid trip fantasy land that just didn't work with the supposed plot. The story bounces along to so many things that either don't make sense, have no bearing on the movie or are just plain odd. I think this would have been a better story if it had just focused on the family dealing with the death of a child ,sans the big color trip.. The villian was very unbelievable. The ending was a big let down. Susan Sarandon's role was weird. Not really sure why her character was involved.Overall this movie is weird. I didn't care for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only a second star for Peter Jackson","review":"Although picking such a crap book to do a movie of was pretty stupid on his part. The book was awful so he had nothing to work with. I hated the book so of course I hated the movie. I had hopes that Peter Jackson could do something to make this stupid story worth watching, but he made the huge mistake of following the book. Of all times for a director to actually follow the book this was not one of them! Hideous book, hideous movie. Don't waste your time on either. When I bought the book I was hoping for something like \\"Stir Of Echos\\" and instead got something that smelled like bubble gum and was all tied up in pink bows. Yuk! Only 10 year old girls could tolerate this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly Awful","review":"Note to Hollywood:Just because you CAN do it with computer graphics, it doesn't mean you SHOULD.This movie was great right up to the point the narrator dies, and then it IMMEDIATELY devolved into complete unwatchable garbage -- and with some of the most inane visuals you've ever seen.I bet the author was crushed to see what they did with her book, and the young actress was fantastic, but that's not going to transfer to the phone ringing for more work after this bomb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavy on indoctrination, light on substance","review":"Seeming more like a replay of the old movie, \\"What Dreams May Come,\\" this movie seems more concerned with revealing a concept of an ethereal afterlife than it does providing entertainment with substance. There are short sequences of suspense but the remainder of the movie is split between the drama of the loss of a child and fantastical afterlife CGI. This is not a horror film, nor is it a mystery. It is a long, mystical ride that leaves you wondering what the point is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, pointless","review":"I kept waiting for some kind of \\"twist\\" that would make the story come together and be more than a series of dreadful events. Bad dialog, bad concept of how people might act in this situation. It's just an awful, awful movie about nothing more than killing, with a touch of what another reviewer called \\"New Age junk.\\" Hard to imagine anything worse. Mark Wahlberg should be more discriminating about the jobs he takes, he's better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lovely Bones dvd arrived used","review":"Though I enjoyed the movie thoroughly, it did not arrive as advertised. It had a \\"previously viewed\\" sticker on it, when I bought a new video. I did not return it, because as long as the quality of the video was acceptable, I did not feel like going through the drill and pain of the return process. This is the first time I've had these kinds of problems with Amazon, though I have had problems with Amazon's video vendors in the past. I will probably still order dvds from Amazon, though I will be much more discerning in the fine print, and will return anything not what it was advertised to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written screenplay equals bad film adaptation of a lovely book","review":"What a lousy adaptation by Peter Jackson of the Sebold novel. The story was fragmented and the characters were absoloutely shallow and cartoonish. Perhaps Jackson's embellishments were a futile attempt to make the film commercially viable - but, instead it fell flat. Even the weird serial killer/neighbor character played by Stanley Tucci could not salvage it. And, those dreamy sequences could have been clipped right from a television commercial - boring and without depth. Save your time and money and skip this bomb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boo, Peter Jackson, were you on acid when you directed this?","review":"I rented this from the \\"RedBox\\" today for $1.00. I'm grateful I didn't pay more to rent it because it sucked. OMG, I was ready to slit my wrist to have this dragged out, nutso movie end. #1 It's slow and boring as can be. #2 Peter Jackson & his wife Fran, were involved in its making, so I thought it would be a dynamite movie, but unfortunately, they were tripping on magic mushrooms or peyote buttons while directing this. I could tell you the whole story in a small paragraph because that's all there is to it, the rest is a crazy psychedelic trip. You'll need psychedelic stuff to enjoy this.That's my opinion and I'm sticking to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch if you want to be depressed.","review":"I am glad I didn't suffer through the book if it is as depressingas the movie. I wish I had been warned that this movie has noredeeming features and is as depressing as a movie could be made.I am only writing this review to make sure anyone consideringwatching this movie knows what is in store. A very, very depressingexperience with NOTHING at all in the movie tolerable.I only wonder why would anyone make or participate in the makingof this movie. I had a pretty good opinion of Peter Jackson before this movie. But, I can't understand why anyone would want tohave anything to do with this movie in any way.In case I haven't made myself clear: I hated it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disjointed mess","review":"Apparently this film's director wasn;t sure if he was making a drama, a suspense thriller, or a comedy. One moment you have a child killed by a pedophile, then we're stuck watching a ten minute song and dance routine by Susan Sarandon, who is so miscast in this movie it's painful. Wahlberg is terrible, and he never causes you to feel any pain for a father's loss. The dreamy effects of the dead girl's \\"limbo\\" are pathetic and straight out of a bad Disney movie. And how old was that guy in high school that she had a crush on, about 35? Give me break, I've heard the book was actually good. What a shame that Peter Jackson took a good script and destroyed it like an angry intern."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an interesting movie","review":"This was not a good movie. I eventually watched it all but it was rough. It just didn't make sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Boring","review":"I had just finished the book (which was extremely boring). Without spoiling either, the movie did a good job at making the \\"story\\" in the book slightly more interesting, but the overall lack of plot made this a fairly boring movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Unwatchable!","review":"I had high expectations awaiting the arrival of the DVD\\"The Lovely Bones\\", and all I can honestly say, it had to be the worst film I've seen in years. Flat, empty cardboard type characters, a meandering script that had so much fantasy you thought you were watching a bad cartoon, overdone and all over the place, I had no idea of what I was watching.Stanley Tucci was great though, and brought a real creepy presence which gave the film some grit which it very much needed."},{"rating":"1","title":"5 Stars for Present Day, 0 Stars for The Other Place,Minus One For The Rhoda Gets Zapped (Bad Seed) Ending = Two Stars","review":"Liked the present day part, well at least the acting, esp. at the beginning (even though Jackson lingers way too longingly over the teenaged boy's curls and eyes, pretty predictable)> Hated, really hated, the Other Place scenes (spoilers ahead -- like we didn't see where the plot was going with Susie's mentor, Holly.....please -- spelled out like a billboard from the start.....). But the Tucci cornfield scene makes the entire thing worth watching. I remember loving the book, but his is a very, very mixed bag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Book. Terrible Film.","review":"Where the book was mesmerizing and lyrical, the film just fell flat. I found it hard to believe that such a dud of a movie could come from Sebold's beautiful prose. I found myself getting impatient and irate, particularly in scenes where they tried to bring in the other world; they did not ring true. I was so disappointed that I vowed, for a time, to just skip film versions of much-loved books."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL.","review":"If you read the book and enjoyed it, do not watch this movie--it is soooo awful. The scenes where Susie is watching on are so cheesy--it's really painful to watch. EEK! The only reason I gave it 1 star is because I can't give it .5 or O."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just bad.","review":"The effects were bad, I mean she didn't even look like she was actually there in the \\"in between.\\" You could tell it was all fake. Her mom looked way too young, and it was a bad attempt at a sad movie. There was no twist or surprising event. Everything was shallow and stupid. And the ending was retarded and completely unrealistic. When she went back that one last time, I was in WTF mode. [Can't really say more than that without spoiling it]1 star for the main actress, as I thought she fitted well.1 star for the part in the trailer where she wooshes by that other girl."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"The Lovely Bones\\" is a great vehicle for Ronan but the rest feels like two different movies","review":"Length:: 6:19 MinsGina from Haunted Flower reviews the movie \\"The Lovely Bones\\" directed by Peter Jackson and starring Saoirse Ronan, Mark Wahlberg, Rachel Weisz, Rose McIlver, Susan Surandon, and Stanley Tucci.[...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"will not watch again","review":"after reading the book, i decided to watch the movie, but i was extremely disappointed. the book seem more real than the special effects in the movie. the dead scenes were not as i had imagined them (as it usually happens after one has developed their own images when reading the book)."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is..","review":"Really moving and reflective of what someone attacked might feel whether they live or not.Symbolic on so many levEls..You'd need the music of Blaine Cartwright and gang to escApe.Deeply and profoundly life changing and path directing.A movie you watch again and again.."},{"rating":"1","title":"DULLER THAN DULL","review":"Peter Jackson is anything but a good fit to direct this story, as his well-intentioned efforts at conveying transcendence sometimes look and feel phony.It's a great deal of effort by a lot of talented people that results in two-plus hours of tepid clockwork blandness. The cinematic equivalent of that big farm your childhood dog allegedly went to. \\"The Lovely Bones\\" is a skeleton of a movie, lacking any sense of life and vitality. When I read Peter Jackson was handling the story, I figured if anyone could do it, he could. I was wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made no sense","review":"I hated this movie, I rented it for my girl. Total chick flick. Guys please save your money and not not rent this horrible movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good adaptation of a very good movie","review":"I loved this book. I read it twice. For a rather gruesome subject, the movie was visually lovely to watch. The acting was very good. Susan Sarandon was the best. She brought humor into what could have been a very depressing movie. I applaud the movie for staying away from showing violence. It was hinted at and conveyed well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Thrash - and a great addition to my Les Claypool collection","review":"Before Les Claypool became famous with Primus, he was in this band - in fact this may have been where he and Larry LaLonde met (not sure of that).Mark Beiderman's Blind Illusion was one of my favorite thrash albums back in the day and I was very happy to finally find it on CD. I've also owned it on Vinyl and Cassette.I've heard rumors of a second album that was recorded by this same line up that has yet to be released. HEY MARK - RELEASE IT ALREADY!

Their amps had tie-dye grills. I thought they were excellent but they did not get a good response from the audience. I love this album and look for it all the time. I have it recorded from a cassette to a cassette. My original cassette got messed up. I consider this album a cross between Rush and Megedeth,In my opinion. I finally found this cd online but it is so expensive. If you have the money I beleive it is a needed item for anyone who experienced the thrash era. This album brings back memories of an excellent age for metal.\\"Politicians refuse to open their eyes,the world is blind and The Future Will Cry...!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I didn't spend the money for this one","review":"I hate to speak poorly of ANYTHING yoga, but this book was disappointing. Most of the vacations are expensive and are limited in number of times offered per year and length of instruction. I've seen most of these listed somewhere in a copy of Yoga Journal magazine. Flip thru one of those before buying this book. It may be better to talk to someone who's done the vacation package before spending the money. Namaste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Display quality","review":"Very nice game! This set will not live in the game closet. We do agree with other reviewers that the ceramic playing pieces would over time scratch the playing surface. Our solution was to apply self adhesive felt to the bottom of each piece. It improved the feel of the game. The only drawback is that now two of the pieces do not fit in the designated storage area. There is, however plenty of room for them in the drawer with the dice cups."},{"rating":"2","title":"A reasoned look at unreasonable policy","review":"This well-reasoned and level-headed collection of writings about America's conduct of the \\"War on Terror\\" is a chilling indictment of U.S. policy. That we are willing to cede our most basic national principles in service of our fear and historical ignorance, and in the name of this administration's failures and fixations, is at once terrifying and heartbreaking. This is a call to moral action, no matter which side of the politcal aisle you seat yourself. At the core of this book lies this question, asked and paraphrased through many ages: Must we destroy our country in order to save it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely left wing propaganda & garbage!","review":"I've read this book and I will state flat out it's not worth the paper it's printed on, too bad that trees were sacrificed to allow publication of this garbage. I do NOT recommend this book to anybody who's looking for an objective appraisal of the ongoing war in Iraq. I had a copy of it. I threw it out with the trash! For shame that any author would be able to write this garbage and actually get someone to publish it. Of course it takes all kinds I suppose! Don't waste your money or your time!

Un discazo, sin duda uno de los mejores."},{"rating":"1","title":"Basura !!!","review":"No se que estuvieron haciendo los integrantes de Los Fabulosos Cadillacs en este disco, pero este disco es basura, excepto una cancion que si puede ser un hit comercial.

If I could tell the world just one thing, it would be: Check out the Blondie album...it's much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good music, but...","review":"Jewel has to be the worst excuse for a singer/songwriter in the 1990's. Her first album was good, and I only stress GOOD, with some poor lyrics (\\"Pieces of You\\") and some really brilliant moments (\\"Amen\\"). However, on \\"Spirit\\", Jewel tries to \\"up\\" her dull and depressing lyrics with some faster songs. Musically Ms. Kilcher has it going. Lyrically, however, she needs help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good and too pop","review":"The only reason I gave Jewel two stars is because she looks cute and has a good voice at singing . But her songs are really too pop and makes you feel like shooting yourself . Her lyrics don't make much sense and real musicians who play guitar usually wear chains , play distorted rock and sings good with strong lyrics . Jewel's last album was also dissapointing as well . I think I'm attracted to her but her music is just flat"},{"rating":"1","title":"A sleeper","review":"Jewel has a great voice and a nice folky sound, but this CD is really for insomniacs. It should cure them! No wonder we don't hear many cuts off this album on the radio. It stinks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as personal as Peices, but a nice follow up","review":"I wish that jewel had returned to the same coffe shop she recorded \\"peices of you\\" in, and made her second album there. This album does not have the local-artist-just-having-fun-with-a-guitar-and-an-audience vibe that made her first album so wonderfully personal and friendly. I also noticed she does not have as many ballads as \\"peices\\" did, and at times she sounds almost jaded, but she is obviously a talented singer/songwriter that could become another joni mitchell/bob dylan if she returns to the intimacy of \\"peices\\". Some of the tracks on Spirit reflect the carefree local feeling of her debut album, such as \\"Do You\\" and \\"Innocence Maintained\\" but some of her songs, such as \\"Enter from the East\\" and \\"Hands\\" sound more like Ricki Lee Jones than Jewel. I defintly recomend buying peices of you first, because it is more personal than Spirit and it is more than just another live album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing, Spiritual, Inspirational and Creative.","review":"Jewels first album \\"Pieces of you\\" was a wonderful, and personal look at a 19 year old Jewel. And this album is just as good, if not better, for it has the one thing \\"Pieces of you\\" lacked.... a full band. Inspiring lyrics, beautiful music and a totally AMAZING voice make this album a masterpiece. All of the songs here fit into one or more of three basic themes which Jewel says is what \\"Spirit\\" is all about, love, inspiration, and spirituality. This album is Jewel at her best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!","review":"Same as \\"Pieces of You\\" except with even fewer hits. The lyrics are so maddenly simplistic, and sometimes silly, that it seems that Jewel is trapped in 10th grade poetry class (my aplogies to 10th graders everywhere). The songs are neither cleverly written nor cleverly arranged. What a waste of one of the most angelic voices on earth. Please, please, Jewel, make a cover album with other artists songs so I don't have to listen to the #@!^%# you compose!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much like \\"Pieces of You\\". RESIST !!!......","review":"Basically \\"Hands\\" is all this CD offers (and perhaps one other title). The rest is Jewel plunking her guitar while singing poetry which becomes tiresome. When you have a message and decide to deliver it, over and over, with only one voice and one instrument: YOU'LL BORE YOUR AUDIENCE NO MATTER HOW FAITHFUL THEY ARE. I AM a fan of Jewels: I very much enjoy her voice and her songs \\"Hands\\" and \\"Foolish Games\\". I am disappointed in this album and sense that she focuses on expressing her thoughts & beliefs and demonstrating her 'intellect' so much that she is oblivious to what good music is, what she is capable of doing musically, and what we want to hear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrogant, Insulting, stick wtih Pieces of You!!!","review":"After hearing Jewel's wonderful first album, I was excited out of my mind about Spirit. I REALLY wanted to like it. I was disappointed song after song by the excessive electronics (the very end of a \\"girl w/ a guitar\\"). However, not only are Jewel's vocal and guitarist talents hidden, but because of her sudden success, she has obviously gotten a big head. She believes herself to be far risen above the rest of her generation (which I, a 16 yr old guy take as an insult). because she is so famous now, she thinks, she can preach universal truths to us all. It's not lyrical simplicity that I have a problem with, it's simple arrogance. How about listening to older concert recordings that display her superior talents instead?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, but I miss the strength","review":"Nothing define better this CD than the word BEAUTIFUL. After a hard day at work, listening to it help focus the important things and throw the trash outside. But, lacks the strength of songs like \\"Foolish Games\\" and \\"Don\`t\\" of the CD \\"Pieces of You\\". Made a try with songs like \\"Absence of Fear\\" and \\"Fat Boy\\", but missed the mark. Jewel's voice is capable of move anybody, but the strength is missing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of Spirit!","review":"It seems that Jewel has sacrificed her talent to sound like all the other annoying faux-folk female singers you hear on the radio today.This album is a snore. Pieces of You touched me; Spirit is watered down and overproduced. There are one or two songs worth listening to, but thats about it. Hey amazon, can I get a refund please?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simplicity in a world of instant gratification","review":"My Fianc��e asked me what it was that I found so wonderful in her music, he said he found it simplistic and over-rated. Perhaps he is correct, but the directness of her lyrics, and her stating the obvious is the exact element that I take comfort in. In a world were instant gratification in almost every aspect of our lives is not only achievable, but is guaranteed in 30 minutes or less, I think we forget what Jewel sings in her music."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think Jewel is a really good artist-in all aspects.","review":"I listened to samples from Jewel's new CD and it gave me a feeling inside.

I absolutely loved her first CD from the first note. But there is NOT ONE good song on Spirit. Not one. She sounds like she's trying too hard to prove she's 'grown up', and she's so mature now, that she's not writing good hooks! What makes her first CD so good is that's it's not 'songwriting by numbers' like Spirit is. Please don't waste your money. You'll thank me for it later. And if you don't get a chance to, I'll say it now....\\"You're welcome!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"She has a little growing up to do","review":"Her attempt at poetry is weak and child-like. A person trying to sound deep comes across as empty when they really don't know how to express what they don't know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spirit? Where?","review":"Whereas Jewel's debut \\"Pieces Of You\\" was a classic piece of shimmering folk, this desultory follow-up is almost downright bad. Boring and listless, with some shockingly bad lyrics and laughable arrangements, \\"Spirit\\" has very, very little. Only 'Deep Water' and 'Absence Of Fear' are memorable, and even they aren't all that good. Once success had gone to Jewel's head, she began to spout pointless pontifications and this is the sad result of too much too soon. She's lost it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed in this second album","review":"After \\"Pieces of You\\"(which I really enjoyed), I was unimpressed by Jewel's second effort. I liked her first album because the lyrics seemed honest. \\"Spirit\\",on the other hand, seemed like a shallow attempt to appear deep. It seems that everyone has ascribed great spiritual enlightenment and depth to Jewel, looking for multiple meanings and hidden treasures in her songs, when very little exists. She tried too hard with this album, and she bought into her public image. Its a shame.There are a few good tracks on this album, but I cringed every time Jewel reused the metaphor \\"fragile flame\\"--perhaps a thesaurus would help. And was I the only one who was annoyed by her \\"Fat Boy\\" Song considering she uses the phrase \\"A fat man takes my money\\" in another song. That would be like putting a song \\"Coma Boy\\" right next to \\"Adrian\\" in her first album. I will buy her next album and hope for the best, but after \\"Spirit\\" I'm not waiting anxiously."},{"rating":"2","title":"good voice, good music, trite lyrics","review":"Jewel is a very pretty girl (I know I shouldn't mention this in a review of her music, but ... hey she's hot!) who has a very pretty voice. Her music is well played, arranged and produced. The problem is 90 percent of the time her lyrics are air-headed drivel. She must hire a bunch of little junior-high school girls to write her songs. C,mon she lived in a van for chrissakes! If I had lived in a van I'd be playin' the blues, I'd be Robert Johnson, no \\"we're all ok\\" or whatever for me, nope, it'd be \\"I'm livin' in a van, damn, ain't no life for this man\\" you get my drift. Anyway, my wife bought this cd and if I tune out the lyrics I really like it, so it will probly end up in my collection ha-ha."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jewel, Jewel, Jewel. . .","review":"Granted, it would be incredibly hard to follow up something like Pieces of You, but I was so terribly excited when I bought this album, and so terribly let down when I finally listened to it, that I just had to sit there.

I mean, Hands is cute, but who wants to hear Jewel, who thinks she is the greatest thing since sliced bread, going on about her stupid hands? Listen,I adore sentimental things (i loved City of Angels) but Jewel thinks she is so deep, and her poetry is so meaningful. And guess what? It's not. Ultimately, this CD is an insult to music"},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS SPIRIT NEVER SHOULD HAVE RESURRECTED","review":"This artist is definitely not a jewel of any sort. Her songs are peevish and annoying; they lack any sign of creativity or originality and are instead replete with her wallow in self-pity. \\"Jewel\\" has an overwhelmig querulous nature which is clearly evident in her songs. One star may even be too generous a rating for this album. After a while of listening to this CD, the songs become repetitive, irksome, and boring. This album is not recomended to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing-and I never bought the first one!","review":"I have never felt compelled to share my views on music before...but I bought this cd yesterday and can't stop listening to it.

This new cd is even better... Her #1 hit song \\"Hands\\" is included with twelve other great songs that you will enjoy with friends or just by yourself... Jewel helps to settle your soul down and put it to rest... Many other great songs are included in the cd plus an additional track... Jewel's cd is absolutely the best... Her devotion to music and others made her my favorite singer of all time... She is a kind role model for all of us and we should respect her... This CD will give you a break off of everything and calm your soul down... Her lyrics are also included in the cd cover with some great photos and quotes... You can't resist that!

Jewel has matured in more ways than one on this album; it's also a bit more upbeat than her previous work. I love to sing along to this CD in the car and I don't think I could narrow it down to a favorite track; it's one of those CD's I can listen to all the way through without skipping a song. I own 4 Jewel CD's and Spirit is definitely my favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"there is a new army coming/and we are armed with faith\\"","review":"finally - an artist is willing to be honest enough to take her career in such a positive direction. the libretto could qualify for oprah's book club. and there i'd be, talking about how much it touched me to hear an anthem for my dreams -- people who think of others, and want to better the world - rather than complaining about modern life and acheiving a mediocre lifestyle of empty relationships. jewel wears her soul on her sleeve and she doesn't care if anyone thinks she's too much of an optimist in our cynical world. she must know there are legions of people who understand the ups and downs of the world but refuse to surrender to it. this album is inspiring, it makes me feel hopeful about life. god bless jewel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sophmore Jinx","review":"I want to like this album. The reality is, it's bland, with bad lyrics. Pick up these bootlegs instead - \\"unplugged\\", \\"save the linoleum\\", and \\"ddelight\\". There are over 30 unreleased songs on those 3 CD's that just blow away the ones she chose to put on this album. I hope 3rd time is the charm {although the 1st time was the charm too]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jewel is a Great singer , with very cool lyrics!!!","review":"Jewel is a great singer, with great musical abilities and the ability to write songs, with her own touch.she's great!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"JEWEL IS THE BEST","review":"TO ALL OF THE PEOLPLE THAT HATE HER ITS BECAUSE YOU HAVE ISSUES WITHIN YOUR SELF THAT YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH YOU ONLY HATE HER BECAUSE SHE MAKES YOU FEEL YOUR INER MOST FEELINGS... This CD is great Jewel has done it again she makes you feel everything she sings about and she dose it so beutifuly i have to say both of her albums are great please buy them and give her a chance you will thank yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jewel- back and Shinier than ever","review":"I thought that Pieces of You was the most wonderful album I ever heard and I really got into Jewel when I got it. So the day her new album came out, I ran to the store and bought it. I'm telling you it was even better than her first one! When I thought that absolutely nothing could top Pieces of You, good old Jewel came back with Spirit, more wonderful and shinier than ever!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I thought it Would Be","review":"The reason I bought this C.D. was because I really liked Pieces Of You, and I thought Spirit would be mostly the same but even better than Pieces. I was so wrong! When you listen to this album it feels like you are listening to the same boring song over and over again. The first three songs are the best, but the rest of the album was lifeless and drab. It lacks the originality and heart that Pieces of You has. It is not an album I would recomend, unless you like monotonous, lifeless songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eeek...","review":"I listened to \\"Hands\\" on the radio, and while Jewel has grown musically, the lyrics seem to be lines that she pulled from her poems that sounded okay, but really have nothing to do with each other. And she's gained a little bit of an ego after all her success. She says \\"we're all okay,\\" when I know for a fact that some people are NOT okay. \\"My hands are small I know, but they're not yours they are my own,\\" I know what she's trying to say, but is it worth it to have huge internal meaning when on the outside it sounds so ridiculous?? \\"But they're not yours they are my own,\\" Then, to add insult to injury, she repeats it!! She seems to be deliberately simplistic in her lyrics, and her voice is way too nasal. And while some people like all the extra music, I miss the intimacy of her acoustic performances. Sigh..."},{"rating":"2","title":"spiritually and emotionally grounding","review":"As a therapist for adult women struggling with issues of childhood trauma, I am always looking for creative ways to help with the healing process. \\"Hands\\" had an incredible impact on several of my clients and created an actual turning point for one of them. I have not experienced anyone that is able to touch people at such a level the way her lyrics have consistently been able to do. Thank you Jewel."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS THE WORST ALBUM EVER CREATED!","review":"The first Jewel album was a classic.It combined musak of all difeerent types such as folk and some rock.This has no catchy songs and deserves 0 stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as her last album","review":"Jewel is fine but I don't like Spirit as much as Pieces of You . Too bad"},{"rating":"1","title":"YUCK!","review":"All I can say is, a lot of teenage girls must have bought the CD and gushed about it here, because the CD was infantile to say the least! ...unless all the other emotionally immature and simplistic people (in my opinion and I'm not pointing fingers)decided to buy this emotionally immature CD as well! This CD says nothing of where emotions come from. Deep meaning... hah!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Album Stinks More than Dirty Socks!","review":"I heard the album, and it's so sickenly sweet, I'm afraid it'll give me diabetes! It's not even a good sweet, like Sarah McLaughlin. It's the underhanded sick kind. Her lyrics are obviously one-dimensional and tells us things we already know! The music style has obviously been changed to fit mainstream. I've heard some of her older work, and I can objectively see the extent of how she's conformed her music to agree with the masses, strictly for monetary reasons. I don't need bad music telling me everything's ok. The world is NEVER ok. What we need is music that makes us stronger. Not melancholy, no matter how lively she TRIES to make her music sound. It's still melancholy. Trust me, if you want to hear GOOD music, pick another CD. A fan, I am definitely not!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Reflective","review":"I come to the conculsion that the reason that I do not like this album is because it is too perfect. Jewel strength is her live songs, wich some traks on POY were. She needs to put out a live album so that people can see her real talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Soundtrack For The Emotionally Infantile","review":"All I have to say is taht if this is what passes for genuinely honest music nowadays, we are all in trouble. Her lyrics (i'm sorry, poetry,) are such gooey, happy-feely Hallmark sentiments that I would not be surprised if she wasn't receiving payoffs from the aforementioned card company. The music is an absolute hush, which is good, because if it was louder we would realize it was basically the same piano parts played over and over. If you like music (or would like to retain the respects of colleagues) avoid Spirit at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"This is no were near as good as her first album. She has become materalistic and shallow. She has become what she hated on her first album."},{"rating":"1","title":"PITIFULLY UNIMAGINATIVE","review":"Who would have thought that the artist who made sucha fine piece of work as her debut could have gotten so stale so fast? Truly a one-hit wonder. She sinks into depressing lows and doesn't seem to care about the people listening....these are her whinings and the only reason she can get away with it is because she has a record contract to fulfill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jewel, your \\"Spirit\\" could use some Prozac.","review":"I thought that Jewel's first attempt was a success. \\"Spirit\\" is a totally different story. The constant whining on \\"Spirit\\" gets old after about 5 minutes of listening to lecture-like lyrics: \\"in the end, only kindness matters.\\" Blah, blah, blah. Oh yeah, that fat boy song was a real winner too. This album does make me want to cry, but probably not for the reasons that Jewel intended."},{"rating":"2","title":"J'adore","review":"Les deux premiers disques de jewel (pieces of you et Spirit) sont ses meilleurs. Les m��lodies sont douces. J'adore ce disque !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Welll, it has some soul...","review":"I'm convinced Jewel ran out of ideas after her debut album. While \\"Hands\\" is a fabulous song, \\"Kiss the Flame\\" is not. I love \\"Down So Long\\" and \\"Innocense Maintained\\" and think \\"Jupiter\\" is pleasant, but I would not call it a favorite. While I still highly recommend this, Jewel's debut album is far superior.Bottom line: Jewel is still the best folk singer and both albums are worth buying- to me, anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't need Jewel to save my soul","review":"I know that social and political issues are important and all, but when I listen to music I don't necessary want to be reminded about how evil the world is and how all we need is an \\"army of faith\\" or everything's \\"nothing without love.\\" There are some catchy tunes, but Jewel's social consciousness spoil this album for me on a whole. However, \\"Absence of Fear,\\" which has nothing to do with social or political issues, almost makes \\"Spirit\\" worth it for me - it is a beautiful song and I wish the rest of the album was more like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"If Only They Had a Zero Star Option","review":"Even by my accomodating standards, Jewel's music is nothing short of horrendous shmaltz.What amazes me are the breathless pleas by others on this board to \\"just listen to the music\\". Well, brothers and sisters, I have listened to it. And if bland, refried escapist fare...like...speaks to you, then point well taken. But for folks like me who have heard it done before and far better by artists who transcend hallmark card sloganeering, the plea falls on deaf ears.Meanwhile, the monumentally egomaniacal image-making that Jewel and her \\"people\\" have engineered is nothing short of offensive. Our little world-saver at the end of the rainbow. Whatta bunch of hooey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can we say COPIER?","review":"Her first album is definitely better, if that says anything. Jewel has conformed herself to the \\"popular\\" types of music and has even done such things as copy other artists (such as Tori Amos) in her music. Have you ever heard the song Jupiter by Jewel? Does this remind you anything of Hey Jupiter (written before Jewel's song) by Tori Amos? Do you notice any similarities? Many artists get INSPIRATION from other artists, which is perfectly okay and is what music is for. But when one artist downright copies another one, that is just wrong. And if that isn't enough for you to save your money, let me add that the lyrics and music to Jewel's songs on this CD are just plain stupid, not to mention annoying. I don't have anything against Jewel the person, and it's great that she got out of sleeping in her car or whatever, but Jewel the artist either needs to take a break or get her own style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible and soul-filled","review":"This CD is like a journey through the mind and soul of Jewel. She takes you through her thoughts on life, love, and everything else. Her incredible talent makes this one of the best albums anyone could ever own. Jewel's voice is so pure and untouchable compared to all of the other female artists in the recording industry. Jewel just makes every girl feel like her emotions are understood. So, this is definitely a must have cd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Poetic, operatic, and rich with insight and melody","review":"In this, another in her line of outstanding cds, Jewel alternates between the sensitivity and expansionism which has become her hallmark and which demonstrates quite clearly her operatic background. Songs like \\"What's Simple is True\\", \\"Kiss the Flame\\", \\"Barcelona\\", and the soaring \\"Jupiter\\" remind me far more of John Denver at his best than any performer since. And that's saying something, because Denver of course was as poetic and insightful as any so-called commercial songwriter since maybe Cole Porter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sophomore effort-lovely voice","review":"I've read all the customer reviews. I was not expecting the range of response. From \\"the best CD ever!\\" to \\"trash!\\". This leads me to believe that we have a true artist here. First, I love the guitar work on Deep Water, Jupiter, Down So Long, and Do You. Also the lyrics on these are great in my opinion. Her vocals are very touching. If you are a romantic type and not afraid of some mushyness than you will love most of the material. I am taken aback by the venom released by some people. geez lighten up! At least Jewel is up front. \\"no more pigtails and ponyrides\\" for you negative heads out there! Sometimes innocence is bliss! She knows how to write a song. She sings like you wish your lover did. Pay no mind Jewel-Sing on! Let all you naysayers write and sing just one tune."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent follow-up to Pieces of You","review":"A wonderful follow-up to her first CD, and worth the wait!! More ballads than her first CD. The song \\"Hands\\" is wonderful. There isn't a song that I didn't like on this CD. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"BRING OUT THE HOSE THIS GIRLS ON FIRE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"AMAZING, SPECTACULAR, BREATHTAKING, GORGIOUS, SOOTHING AND FUN!! This new album is absolutely one of her best. The new song featured on dawsons creek was called HANDS and it was all out beautiful and what a fitting word for the song and the artist who takes my breath away!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quiet music from the \\"Spirit\\" of Jewel","review":"\\"Spirit\\" is a soft,quiet album,with wonderfull poetry and vocals by Jewel.\\"Fat Boy\\" really hit home,because I was one.The line,\\"Wouldn't it be nice if I could melt myself like ice,\\" says it all.\\"Down so long,\\" the second single released,is the hardest rocking number on the collection,next to \\"Do You,\\" but I still enjoyed the entire CD.\\"Absence of fear\\" is my favorite cut.The great piano and Strings,and Jewels unigue vocals,is fantastic.If you liked the singles,\\"Hands\\" and \\"Down so long,\\"played on the radio,you will love this record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"I like this CD and most of the tracks but I couldn't give it 5 stars as most of the tracks are too similar, and the word flame is mentioned too many times. However I love the songs Hands and Down so long. I might actually give it 3 and a half stars more realisticaly."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Spitit\\" of a Dove","review":"Jewel's CD \\"Spirit\\" is so relaxing that I pop it in when I am having a frustrating day and just mellow out for a few hours..I could listen to it for the rest of my life!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The lyrics of this CD are great!!!","review":"I just bought this CD the other day and I haven't stopped listening to it yet. The lyrics are awesome. Jewel is so poetic and realistic, I love them. I especially like when her mom sings with her, the two harmonize so beautifully that's my favorite song. I can't wait for her next CD, I'm glad that it's country."},{"rating":"2","title":"Her best yet","review":"I am a huge fan of Jewel and I find it interesting that this album seems to hold dual personalities.\\"Hands\\" for example seems to be a song about two people convincing each other of the same thing and then coming together in the end. One voices what she wants and one does the action. \\"Spirit\\" is extremely well done and throughly thought through. It shows Jewel's wide range of vocal talent and also seems to show much more confidence than her last album.This album definitely stays in your CD player and never grows old. \\"Spirit\\" is a sucess and every word is full of meaning."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good,this album has feeling !","review":"the music on this album attracts my attention,she she has grown in her song writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"Although I enjoyed Jewel's first CD a lot, this one was twice as good, and one of the best I purchased this year. Even without decent music or writing, Jewel's voice alone makes for a worthwhile purchase, but on this album every single track has something to say or good music, a true 5-star complete album, and my favorite for this year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect music with a powerfull lyric","review":"just the summary says everything I m eagerly waiting for the next on"},{"rating":"2","title":"The most amaizing lyrics you could imagine","review":"In this C.D., Jewel absolutely shines! Her words do everything from make you blush, (Jupiter) To make you cry, (Fat Boy) I think she's absolutly wonderfull. I totally recamend this C.D. to anybody. PLus, the soft music is great to do homework to. Fave song: Down so long. So, I give it a BIG FAT THUMBS UP!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hype","review":"Alas, Jewel's greatest assets appear to be just below her neck, and little is made of them in the packaging of this otherwise boring \\"If I could tell the world just one thing\\" pretentiousness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Check it out from the library","review":"Maybe I haven't listened to the CD much--not the 1000's of times it would require to develop a taste for this album. At least the songs on Pieces of You were all a bit different. Spirit puts me to sleep because all the songs sound the same. But I give her an extra star for commanding her voice in a more mature way and for the professional-sounding recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"More of the same.","review":"I feel very much the same way about this album as I do about the previous installment. I dispute the common belief that the music and message are simplistic. In most instances, the simplicity of the message is, in itself, a philosophy. It is a feel good album and, in this, it is excellent. However, I do have reservations about the album. The main downside of it is that it seems very similar to 'Pieces of You'. While her music focuses on a more spiritual side than most others artists, I would personally like to see Jewel in other genres, as long as her message is not hidden by big beats or lead guitar solos. This album, despite this downside, is still very impressive. It has the ability to speak to the soul and express how people are feeling in many ways. How long until the next album?"},{"rating":"2","title":"I think that the CD is absolutely great.","review":"I love Jewel, I lover her style , her sound, her spirit and her way of singing songs that is more special than any other artist I know.

You have power!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing.... she lost her\\"spirit\\"","review":"I really loved her first album, and I expected her second LP to be so great, but I'm so disappointed... I think she lost her unique spirit. what's wrong? jewel?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Miss it, and miss out BIG time!!","review":"Jewel is most definitely one of the best singers in this planet. Her voice, the lyrics, the music, it truly is inspirational. This is the best album, and Hands is the best ingle I've heard so far. Jewel's \\"Pieces of You\\" was good, but \\"Spirit\\" is way better. Add it to your wanted CD's list ASAP!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocricity isn't a bad word","review":"Please, people.

The music is not all that bad but the lyrics are insipid to the point of naseau.

I cannot put my finger on it, but for some reason Jewel's honesty and fragility simply don't translate from Pieces to Spirit. Perhaps it is because she has taken the leap from sympathetic hippie girl to beleagured guru. The music simply doesn't come across as genuine on Spirit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jewel's voice is a too whiny!","review":"Jewel's CD is really a disappointment. I liked Hands when I heard it on the radio, but after listening to Spirit, it's clear that Jewel isn't a very good singer. Her voice is very weak; she can't carry notes well. The way Jewel is struggling to sing, it sounds like she's on the verge of passing out - just listening to her makes me squirm. Looks like I'll be passing this CD onto a friend. On the other hand, I absolutely love Natalie Merchant's Ophelia!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn fest","review":"I'm sorry, there is talent in there somewhere...and she has a wonderful sounding voice...but this album will appeal only if you want to listen to something that will put you to sleep. I absolutely loved the song \\"Who will save your soul\\" on \\"Pieces of You\\", but even the rest of that album is unremarkable. If you like this kind of slow, dull, unmemorable stuff, you still may like this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was dissapointed . . .","review":"I have heard many unplugged Jewel cds from the FRC company that were really really good, but this was just so s l o w.

I bought her a pair of headphones as an early Xmas present. I said, \\"If I have to listen to that moronic Jewel CD one more time, I'm gonna go postal!\\"Jewel has a niche, and it's with the type of faux-folk with a side of naivete that she supplies her fans with. I don't understand the appeal of her, except that chicks who voted for Clinton and defend him must dig it. They seem to be one in the same. Naive, naive, naive - with an unrealistic view of the world and relationships. Nice to dream and have that warble in your voice, Jewel, but it doesn't do it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"needs more","review":"I am a fan of all kinds of music and i find Jewel's lacking of the reality in life. Her one single \\"Hands\\" is a strong song. But i think that the rest of the tracks on this cd lack substance. I think she could learn from artists like Sarah McLachlan and Tori Amos who find meaning in their lyrics without being repetative. I think she could do a lot better with a voice like hers."},{"rating":"1","title":"only two good songs on the album !","review":"number 3 and number 5... amazingly disapointing.Is it still the same person composing ?"},{"rating":"1","title":"please, stop.","review":"This is inflated, simplistic, low IQ, aural wall-paper.

That's pretty good. Jewel's music is my favorite. I think she shares a good message in a way listeners can understand and relate to, plus it's easy to listen to. I especially like songs 1, 2, 7, and 10, and I recommend this CD to anyone and everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could tell Jewel 1 thing it would be that her albums OK","review":"I adored all of Pieces of You.

I think she needs an upbeat rock album next..."},{"rating":"2","title":"simply divine","review":"this album is far better than Pieces of you, although they are both simply the best albums I own. Jewel is not a comercial person. She wrote her albums from the heart, about life, love and the world today because she felt them, not because she wanted to become top of the charts, although her music is so brilliant she should. She's not afraid to voice her opinions. She doesn't write music to please the critics. Her songs make you think about your life, and when I listen to spirt I feel thankful for what I have. It makes you want to fulfil your ambitions. I listen to her albums before I go out clubbing because it makes me feel happy. what a wonderful voice she has, able to portray so many feelings in a few notes. She should entitle her next album 'Angel' because it is certainly what she is. Down so long and hands are wonderful pieces of music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Muzak Disappointment","review":"I had high expectations for this CD. I loved Jewel's first CD, having bought it when it was first released, almost 2 years before anyone had heard of her. Her performance at Woodstock showed that she earned her name, being the crowning jewel of the event.Unfortunately, this CD seems to be the sonic equivalent of lukewarm oatmeal. All of the songs sound the same, with little of musical interest. It appears as though Jewel was \\"trying\\" too hard to seem deep with her lyrics, giving only a passing consideration to the accompanying music.I hope Jewel's next CD can better capture the passion of her first CD and live performances."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spirit is the best Jewel album ever","review":"I wish Jewel would have kept on making this same kind of music. Although 'Pieces of you' was a terrific album, this follow up album 'Spirit' is just amazing. This is a cd that you can listen to the entire way through without skipping one song. It is beautiful poetry that is injected with an angelic voice. Jewel's songwriting shines through on every song on this album. Full of songs of a love she wishes to have, to keeping positive and keeping faith, to trying to be the best person you can be, this album will make you feel full of emotion. Her guitar playing is something else, I never knew a guitar could sound like she makes it sound. I was 16 when I had this album and it made me feel so positive, happy and full of love. I've recently purchased it again and I feel exactly the same way. Good for teenagers, good for adults, this has to be one of my favorite albums of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"Jewel's second is quite different compared to her first album. Her lyrics are simple and yet very hard hitting. This is a different and yet a good follow up to her first album,'Pieces of You.''Spirit' true to it's title is a very deep and spiritual album. However if you're looking for her raw, innocent style from her previous album, you won't find it here.Her song like\\"life Uncommon\\" is a fine example of her matureness towards the world and to her beliefs. This is not an everyday listening cd, but very soothing and thought provoking."},{"rating":"2","title":"spirit, artist:Jewel","review":"This CD is one of her greatest yet. She fulfills the inner soul with her exceptional voice that comes right from the heart. Her music is not for everyone, but for someone who is trying to feel something deeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely, talented Jewel puts on another splendid performance","review":"This cd is filled with Jewel's complete passion for life and what life gives to her.Every song is individual and touching in its own special way, and I never, EVER get tired of hearing it.I absolutely love the song THIS LITTLE BIRD.

It seems she's also fallen in love. The cd is great. One song I think is dislikeable is \\"Fatboy\\", it doesn't make sense, it throws the CD off. But \\"Jupiter\\", \\"In The Absence of Fear\\", and \\"Barcelona\\", are beautiful. Listen for Jewel and her mom after the last song ends, it's great.

Since i loved her cd so much, i decided to buy her next one with one of my favorite songs on it, Hands. But once i listened to the cd, believe it or not, i only liked 2 songs on the whole cd. (hands and enter from the east) All of her other songs were kind of boring. No beat, nothing but acoustic on most--which is my favorite instrument--but none of the songs touched me at all. I dont think I'll be buying any of her newer cds. Pieces of you was a beautiful cd. I dont know what really happened, but this cd isn't worth any of your money.

Great for insomniacs."},{"rating":"2","title":"She's Got Spirit","review":"Singer, songwriter, poet, and would be actor, Jewel, reaches out and touches someone with her latest.I liked this CD more than \\"Pieces of You\\". The melodies are stronger, and the hooks catchier this time around. From the stirring lyrics and mood of \\"Deep Water\\" to the undulating refrain of \\"Hands\\", Jewel confirms the talent and creativity hyped on her first album. A couple of tracks like \\"Fat Boy\\" seem a little too maudlin in comparison, but overall \\"Spirit\\" avoids the dreaded sophmore slump and should please all but the most jaded of fans. As a side note, the success of \\"Pieces\\" apparently financed better production values as Jewel's clear, beautifully feminine voice seems to resonate more powerfully with the new songs. Her folky vibrato, reminicent of peers Natalie Merchant and Tori Amos, may illicit skin tinglings and neckhair standing if played on a decent stereo."},{"rating":"1","title":"A CZ in the Rough?","review":"I wanted to like this CD, really. Admittedly, I shouldn't have been so shocked that I didn't, after all I hated the first one. I will say this, though, this album is far better, musically and lyrically, than \\"Pieces of You.\\" But, and this is a big but, she still hasn't outgrown her preachy tendancies. Shying away from all forms of humor and irony, Jewel once again proves that she is not in the forefront of America's premiere singer-songwriters. If you ever wondered what an episode of Oprah would sound like over an acoustic guitar, then this is the album for you. If, however, you're like me and find this idea slightly frightening, skip it and buy something by Elliott Smith instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just great!

Good job Jewel!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jewel keeps making beautiful music!","review":"I have been a big Jewel fan from day one, when \\"Who Will Save Your Souls?\\" first hit the airwaves from \\"Pieces of You\\". Now she's done it again with \\"Spirit\\". She has a lot of critics who will try to tell you that her lyrics are trite and unimaginative, but that couldn't be further from the truth. More than anything, I think Jewel expresses honesty and compassion in her songs. Her unique, sweet voice combines with her thoughtful lyrics to make her songs pure joy to listen to. The well-known \\"Hands\\" and \\"Down So Long\\" are two of my favorites on the album, but three other songs that shouldn't be missed are \\"Deep Water\\", \\"Jupiter\\", and (my very favorite), \\"Life Uncommon\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"'Spirit' touches your soul","review":"Jewel's music could melt a cold heart on a winter's night.

I definately recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Compulsively Disgusting","review":"I really like Jewel's music, the radio play versions.

Such an angelic voice. The perfect little poor girl selling love and harmony and hope to people who like watching the Jerry Lee Lewis telethon and hoping that a cure will be found. Telling people exactly what they want to hear in a world that seems anarchaic and spiralling out of control. Extremely manipulative and annoying. Exactly like Geraldo's reporting for CNBC. Especially during the \\"crisis\\" of Lilleton, Colorado. With Jewel playing the soft, cotton-candy background music. Hold onto her hand and walk through lollipop land. With her voice guiding you to let go, not worry and walk around saying what a swell day it is. Her voice is also telling you to let go of your money. I know better though, and so do other people."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD sucks really bad!!","review":"Spirit is the worst CD I have listened to all year. All of the songs make no sense, and the only one worth listening to is \\"Hands\\". This song is pretty weak though so that is not saying much for the CD.

I bought this book because it was a romance story and had horses. It had such a promising feel to it, but it fell short. The plot was a bit tired and predictable. The so-called conflicts were tied up a little too neatly. There was too much going back and forth between the two main characters. One paragraph or a few sentences from Betheny's point of view then a paragraph or some sentences from Connor/Brett's point of view. It got to be rather exasperating. And like another reviewer said, there was too much time spent talking about how much the characters wanted to have sex with each other and about how their personal traumas were keeping them apart. We were told about the characters, but not really what made them tick. And when Connor decided to give up one dream for another, there didn't seem to be any thinking or turmoil in the decision.

At only 40 minutes of music and with a severely truncated Koyunbaba, which indicates that Adams couldn't master the middle two sections, there is little to recommend here.

It is a remarkable, I would even say unique story. At that turbulent time, most people let themselves be pushed where the changing fates of war were throwing them. Not so the young Adam Broner. He repeatedly made his own decisions, sometimes risky but right and courageous. The most important of these was to desert the \\"working battalions\\" in Siberia, and to join the army fighting the Nazis. It may sound strange, but Adam Broner's story is also unique because it tells the plain truth. He has not adapted his narrative to the now prevalent ideas. Broner simply tells us how it was.

This approach also makes the book a lot more readable and enjoyable for those who do not like a dry history book with facts and dates and people names. In addition, I also enjoyed the details about how they built their houses and the lay-out of their houses.However, the author seems to fall short in the area of icelandic marraige and relationships between the men and women, other than in terms of feud or law. The book seems to focus a great deal on law and not so much on the personal family life of these individual icelanders.To make up for it, the book does site passages from the sagas about different people in a political context.But if you buy this book, you really don't have to bother buying medieval iceland. These two books pretty much cover the same ground."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely worth reading","review":"This book has a little bit of everything. Mr. Sawyer's imagination is excellent. The story-line is a little weak in a couple of areas (thus, no 10); however, overall, the writing, characters, and plot are far above average."},{"rating":"1","title":"His Worst Book","review":"I read this when I was reading all the Hugo nominees that year and this was the most disappointing. I felt that this did not belong on the same platform with the other nominees. This book appears to be an obvious attempt to \\"do Star Trek right\\" with a non-military starship, alien races who are truly alien, and real adult characters. Unfortunately, as previous reviewers have written, Sawyer does not pull this off and we have a novel about a university director contemplating an affair co-mingled with the worst of the Star Trek movies.The entire novel seems inconsistent from scene to scene and is sometimes amazingly illogical which carries through to the ending. I cannot write too much about it without giving away some of the book but someone makes an awe-inspiring, illogical, bad, mundane, much more than life-time committment.He can be a good writer and people should enjoy his other works more."},{"rating":"1","title":"fun action, boring main character","review":"This is a fun read for action and exploration as long as you don't think to deeply or have high expectations. The \\"lofty message\\" of the book is trite and the main character is caught up in the angst of his midlife crisis. While it might be interesting to some people to read about the inner turmoil of a middle-aged man in midlife crisis, I think it is boring. It is not really very interesting to read about some guy acting like a jerk to his wife and other people around him because he's caught up in himself and isn't sure he is going to achieve all his goals in life. A more appropriate format for all of the focus on this type of character might be self-help rather than science fiction. I read science fiction to relax and have fun. Real people in midlife crisis are boring and the main character in this book is boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Juvenile","review":"Given the Hugo nomination and others' reviews, I expected more from this book. Some time is spent developing the main character, but most of the other players are bland, colourless props. The science is interesting, but I frankly did not care what happened to anyone.

Sawyer won the 2003 Hugo Award for Best Novel of the Year for HOMINIDS. That win was well-deserved but I got to wondering how far back in his career he was writing award-caliber books before he snared the \\"Big One.\\" The answer is: at least THIS far back. STARPLEX was the only 1996 novel to be both a best-novel Hugo Award finalsit and best-novel Nebula Award finalist (and it won Canada's Aurora Award and the Compuserve HOmer Award). Sawyer's aliens are every bit as good as those of James White, Larry Niven, Hal Clement and Robert Forward, and his people are infinitely more complex and believable than any written by those writers. This book tackles just about every problem in astrophysics ... and solves them all. No wonder its on numerous university astronomy reading lists, and endorsed by the Astronomical Society of the Pacific. A terrific book well worth tracking down."},{"rating":"2","title":"This a very worthwhile read","review":"I have enjoyed a few of Sawyer's later works(Frameshift,Factoring Humanity)but this earlier work was far better. The characterizations are good which is the usual for Sawyer. But more than that, I enjoyed the background of the alien races and found the story intiguing. My only complaint was that I thought the end of the story was a little too much; Sawyer didn't need to make the events of the story to be THAT important. It was already a good enough book, it didn't need any more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creative realities","review":"Robert J. Sawyer's book \\"Starplex\\" was one of the most entertaining, thought-provoking, and mind-twisting books I've read in a long time.To begin, Sawyer is an excellent writer. Plotting, dialogue, and human drama aspects are all well-represented here. He also never loses sight of using humor, awe (in its truest sense), human limitations, and philosophical twists to create realities that are at once far, far away, yet understandable.I'm sure Robert J. Sawyer has his critics - every writer does. Bottom line here, though, is that Sawyer has created his own voice with which to tell great stories (science fiction and otherwise), and Starplex is one of his best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Killer!","review":"Just like the inventor of this guillotine, this album is a killer. With hard tracks like Night Light and Dirty Girl, you can't go wrong. The rest of the album is also great. This isn't your typical techno, it comes on hard and doesn't let go.

The batteries were rated at 2500 mAh so I purchased the package. The first time I used the charger it had fully charged the batteries in 15 miuntes and the charge lasted longer than the Monster batteries which took twice as long to charge. I'd recommend going elsewhere for higher rated batteries at a cheaper price and that has a charger that gets them up and going twice as fast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useful, but not the highest quality.","review":"My brother bought me this as a christmas gift, otherwise I probably would have stuck with my Swiss Army knife. While most of the tools are really useful, the metal that this thing is made of isn't very strong. My corkscrew bent screwing into its first bottle of wine (and it was a totally ordinary cork), and then when i tried to bend it back with a normal set of pliers it was very flexible and then snapped off at the base. Also, the tool feels flimsy when you use the pliers and really have to clamp down on something, and the handles also cut into my palm. All in all, it's useful enough to keep in the glovebox for an emergency, but I wouldn't use it when I had access to proper tools or even a real Swiss Army knife."},{"rating":"1","title":"CS4 tools needs improvement","review":"We bought two of this because it looks so great in the review and advertisement. After using it for a month, there are some flaws, which should be improved to make it a practical tool. Does anyone know what's the awl for? To us, it is too blunt to be useful. It should have sharper edge so we can actually open envelopes, remove staples, etc. The set of screw drives is comprehensive but take care not to exert too much force on them especially the small one, the tip WILL BEND. Anyway, it was be repaired with the other CS4 :-). If you are a Swiss knife user, you will find the Philips screw tip drive too big for common screws found in the office. Also, you should be real careful about the blade, cause it is really sharp... it hurts but we love it. If you are not too fussy about the strength of the tool, go get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"FRAGILE!","review":"I had one of the original Leatherman tools which served me well but was prone to rust at the joints. My son gave me the Juice and initially I liked its size and loved the pliers. However after a couple of years of light use the springs holding all the tools fractured making the tool useless. I never abused the tool and it was very lightly used. I sent it back to Leatherman finally after it laid around broken for a year or so. They sent me a brand new one in a couple of weeks.Guess what? on about the fourth use of the knife blade the spring broke. I don't get it. I am sending it back. I think I will give it away if they send me a new one. Give me a Victornix Exployer anytime over this. I will just throw a Vise grip mini needle nose clamp in my back pocket and with the two will face anything without fear of failure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Drop It!","review":"This leatherman multi-tool is by far better looking than other leatherman tools, but as we all know: function over form. I've had the tool for about three months now. The blades get sticky and need to be cleaned more often than I'd like to. The handle is comfortable and the cork screw works great...but don't drop it: the finish is very fragile, it will bend and the color will scrape off. If you work on cars like me, you need to be constantly picking up and putting down your tool. If it falls out of your hand it will bend and the color will chip off. Another bad point about this leatherman is that the blades bend easily, and they can rust. Of course leatherman says that they are made of \\"high quality stainless steel\\" but if you put it under water or in the snow and forget to dry it off, you'll soon see that it will rust.

What a rip-off. Many songs are straight off the \\"Feels Like Home\\" album. Most of the other material is flat and uninspired, with the production remarkably free of good grooves or strong rhythmic feel.

Parton/Harris/Ronstadts' vocale are angelical. The sound engineering on this CD is also very interesting as well as the editing. In the first CD my favorite tune was Telling Me Lies, followed by Rosewood Casket. In this one they are Feels Like Home and Do I Ever Cross Your Mind.

The music just wraps itself around you and carries you away. One of my absolute favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent follow up to Trio","review":"Sheer beauty is the only way to describe the gorgeous harmonies of these three talented ladies. And this follow up was well worth the wait. Rondstadt is powerful on High Sierra, Harris balladeers beautifully on You'll Never Be The Sun and Parton performs with heartbreaking power on He Rode All The Way To Texas as well as After The Goldrush. And when all the voices meet it is enough to give you goosebumps. Thank God this jewel of an album is finally seeing the light of day.

Her beautiful voice couldn't be missing from any song!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing follow-up","review":"Anyone who is a fan of TRIO, will be disappointed by this thing.

Unfortunately, TRIO 2 lacks everything that was in the first album. The voices and harmonies are still there briefly in some songs - but this is not sustained throughout all the songs. Hopefully, TRIO 3, if there will be one, would be a better product from these three talented artists."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete loss of respect","review":"I have no idea why the singers and the producer decided to change the words in After the Gold Rush. It greatly subtracted from my overall listening experience of the entire album to hear \\"felt like getting high\\" change to \\"felt like I could cry.\\" If the singers really thought that saying that phrase would condone drug use, then they're nave and they never should have chosen to cover that song. Who were they scared of offending? With that one change, the singers turned one of the great all-time songs into saccharin garbage and made me lose respect for them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A \\"Trio\\" not worth revisiting","review":"Amazon's review opens \\"This long-awaited, highly anticipated follow-up to 1987's much-loved initial Trio offering doesn't disappoint\\". It does, if you've heard the songs before. The album was supposedly recorded in 1994, and shelved because of it's lack of \\"marketability\\". However, Linda released most of these songs on her album \\"Feels Like Home\\" in 1995, with EmmyLou backing her on many of the same songs found here. It seems Dolly went into a studio, and dropped her tracks over the existing ones, and viola!, new album (to hear her solo rendition of Neil Young's \\"After the Goldrush\\", get a copy of 1996's \\"Treasures\\"). I'm enchanted each time I hear the girls together, and realize how hard it is to get together to record, but a better effort was due their fans who've waited this long."},{"rating":"2","title":"A simply beautiful record.","review":"Thank you Linda, Emmylou and Dolly.

I highly recommend everyone rush out and get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful voices","review":"This album might not have been as successful as the original TRIO album from 1987, but I think it's even better. The song selection is very strong, and the songs suit these ladies very well. The harmonies are beautiful. There's nothing more I could ask for from this album. It opens with the beautiful \\"Lovers Return\\", which is a Carter Family song. \\"High Sierra\\" is a beautiful song, Linda sounds wonderful on this song. Emmylou takes the helm in a cover of Dolly's \\"Do I Ever Cross Your Mind\\". They do a great version of Neil Young's \\"After The Goldrush\\" which is just stunning. Linda is lead on \\"The Blue Train\\", which is a very nice song. Other highlights include \\"When We're Gone, Long Gone\\", \\"Feels Like Home\\", \\"You'll Never Be The Sun\\" and \\"He Rode All The Way To Texas\\". This album was originally recorded in 1994 but there was problems with the release and other factors, so it wasn't released until early 1999. Definately a gem!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Three Veterans Giving it to us","review":"As a young listener at the time this CD was released, I liked the CD alot as I came to know every song by heart. This is a pleasing effort from the trio with each lending their own unique qualities and abilities to the group. Linda is the loud belter; Dolly handles the bird-like, songbird songs and Emmylou takes the traditional country songs that require an authentic country voice. The material here is varied ranging from pure country to Adult contemporary, more in Linda's league. HIGH SIERRA shows the AC as Celine could get away with singing this song. There are some very touching songs that mean alot to me and they are toward the end. It is great to see these veteran performers come out and perform great material as such."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Trio has returned!!!","review":"The first TRIO album was a winner, despite being released in the 1980's. The songs had a timeless appeal to them and Dolly, Emmylou and Linda obviously put their heart & souls into the singing. TRIO II is nearly as good.

In fact if you listen to the two, most of the cuts on \\"Feels\\" already have Harris on them. Makes me just wonder if Parton went into a studio by herself and just dubbed her voice in ? A couple of words for the \\"TRIO\\", you had a faithful following that waited and waited until \\"Trio II\\" came out, we expected something as GREAT as before, instead we recieved a recycled Ronstadt LP. I Love you three ladies dearly, but I doubt if I would plunk down money for a \\"Trio III\\", and now there is just an album with Harris and Ronstadt on it- will we hear Parton dubbed in later for a \\"Trio III\\" fiasco?

For all of the people who think this album is great and wonderful, there is no disagreement, except for the fact that half of the album was released 4 years ago on Linda Ronstadt's \\"Feels Like Home\\" (1995). And when I say that they are the same 5 songs, I mean just that. The identical music tracks were used on \\"Feels Like Home\\", and honestly, when listening to these same 5 songs on \\"Trio II\\", I cannot tell the difference between them--except for the fact that you can hear Dolly's faint voice filling in additional harmony. And, the song \\"Blue Train\\" is exactly the same song as on Feels Like Home. Listen carefully, and you will notice that there is no Dolly at all on the song. Anyway, for those of you who didn't buy Linda's album in 1995, I guess you will enjoy Trio II. For the rest of us, it's like hearing \\"Feels Like Home\\" the second time around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hillarious!","review":"Especially to the younger crowd, this is a game that will apeal to them. Why? Because the adult situations, extreme and rediculous violence, and suggestive themes (such as the terrorist ordeal and the un-patriotic American signs) will make children everywhere laugh histarically. I do happen to agree with most people here. This is a low-budget game but with some great graphics and very funny parts. The reason this gets a 4 stars instead of five is because the game is INDEED short. I finished the game within days. But the thing is that this game hasn't gotten BORING for me. Walking on the streets and lighting them on fire with a gas tank never really gets BORING. If you found games of Grand Theft Auto tedious, this may not be a game for you. But if you enjoy the free gameplay of this game, this could be a looker for ya! Maybe you should check out the demo, which is on Postal 2's main site."},{"rating":"2","title":"Postal 2, the best game from 2003 for sure.","review":"You have to love the Postal dude and his crazy antics. This game has everything from putting a cat on your shotgun to getting an STD, and everything else you could possibly think of. This game was made by only two-three people, and it shows, but it's a great story and game. One downside is load times, but considering it's an earlier games and the maps are EXTENSIVE, I am perfectly fine with this. I've spent a good amount of time into playing this game, and all I can say is wow. Love it.If you like GTA, but want more edgy comedy, pick this game up.

BUT VERY \\"BUGGY\\"--- BEWARE!!","review":"I'd love to love this game. I've been a computer nerd for nearly twenty-five years and \\"politically incorrect\\" pc games take the edge off the day when I get home from the nine-to-five. My present pc is no slouch vis. power/memory/graphics, but installing \\"Postal2\\" and keeping the game from crashing is a nightmare...I've followed the instructions on the official website, downloaded the patch, downloaded \\"DirectX 9\\", re-installed numerous times, ran the game in \\"safe mode\\", submitted bug reports...The result???A beautifully twisted vision of a potentially GREAT game which because of the \\"bugs\\" is ultimately aggravating and *NOT* worth the $$$.Unless you have tomorrow's top of the line gaming machine with *all* the bells and whistles, my advice is to wait until they can work the bugs out or it comes way down in price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice idea, if you're ready for prison.","review":"I thought it'd be fun to play an ultra-violent game for a change. It was fun, for the first 5 minutes. After that, the game gets a little old and makes you a little cranky. Especially when you sit and wait for the next scenario to load. I think the developers did that on purpose to tick-off the gamer even more, and make him even more violent.The graphics started out nice enough, but I guess the guy doing the building interiors had the week off when they put this game together.As far as a fulfilling experience, the only thing this game teaches is how to get mad. Most of us have figured that out, already.For all you Gary Coleman fans, this game is a must!!!For everyone else, you can find better use of your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Game Is Sick and Twisted","review":"This game is horrible.

If your an animal rights activist, or just a normal person, then this game is not for sane people! With it's \\"over-the-top violence\\" (which I quote from the box) and extremely twisted plot, this game is a sick, twisted, mental, animal killing bloodbath from the beginning to the end.

Some one said that the My Scene dolls clothes are to revealing. I will admitt SOME of the clothes need a little work, but that person also said that the bratz dolls are better and the Bratz clothes need a lot of work, they barley even fit the dolls.

I love being able to use the Nike+ with the shoes that work for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"sensor case","review":"I was diappointed with this item. It is so much easier to use a shoe that is compatible with the sensor instead of using this pouch. Once you calibrate the sensor to the Nike shoe, you have to calibrate it again if you are going to use the sensor case instead. It's a bother having to calibrate it every time you are going to change shoes. I would stick with a Nike shoe. The Air Pegasus is an excellent shoe for long distances."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WEATHERPROOF!","review":"Until this past week I would have given this pouch 5 stars.

Cleaned it up with a pocket knife, inserted the sensor & put th sole insert back in. Took less than five minutes & works great.I love the Nike Plus product, but prefer my new Balance running shoes.

It holds the sensor well, but frankly, the setup doesn't work. My Nano catches only about half of steps. In fact, when calibrating for walking, it only captures .13-.14 of a .25 mile walk. My Nano gave me a calibration error because it was so far off. When I calibrated the run, it got .3 off a .25 mile. When I took it for my test run this morning, it only got .49 mile for over a mile run."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less accurate than the competition","review":"Maybe I'm being too harsh, but I have not yet been able to consistently get decent accuracy readings using this pouch for the nike sensor.

I don't recommend this for the sensor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the extra cost","review":"I bought this for my wife based on other reviews. I was hesitant to spend the extra money, but it was worth it. High quality, the sensor doesn't move. Haven't used in rain yet, but it doesn't rain much in Central TX.

I like this enough I am looking to Marware to buy a new holder for my iPod."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is what it is","review":"Little expensive for such a little accessory (with shipping). Works just like it says it does. Fits nicely on your shoe. Only issue I had was that I couldn't tighten my laces as much as my other foot because it got in the way. It works fine to keep the sensor in place. My sensor wasn't working correctly after a week or so, but it's probably just the sensor itself and not this case.Only thing I might note is that you can get it at someplace like BestBuy without having to pay shipping. I just didn't realize until after I had already bought this. It works though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as designed","review":"My husband uses this for his morning runs.

I live in two different places and having one less item to bring going to and from was well worth the $9. After removing the sensor from the shoe to insert into the case, I noticed the sensor showing some wear and tear from being in the shoe. I think this case will actually protect the sensor better from the dirt and debris that tend to get into the shoes while running. The sensor case is well made (of leather or leather-like material) and not flimsy at all. It holds the sensor very snugly, stays on the shoe tightly but also slips on and off the shoe very easily when removing the case.

It doesn't register your steps like when the chip is in your shoe. If you want to track the distance of your run, DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT. Instead, bite the bullet and buy nike plus shoes. It truly is worth the extra money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I was told that the Nike sensor would only work in Nike sneakers but this holder works fine on my hiking boots.

Simple design and affordable price. Arrived quickly after ordering it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sleek and sexy, but my accuracy rate went down...","review":"This iPod sensor holder looks so much better on my shoes than the huge Shoe Wallet I was using before. The only problem is that when I used it, my accuracy rate fell into an unacceptable range. I did a three mile run and it only registered 1.5 miles. I tried recalibrating, but the iPod couldn't read the sensor enough to register that I had gone ANY distance, much less 400 meters.The second I put the sensor back into the Shoe Wallet, my accuracy rate was right back to normal. The Sport Sensor is gathering dust in a drawer now..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A useful product","review":"After reading the above reviews, I was careful and followed the instructions on placing the sensor in the pouch. I got the same reading as when the sensor was in my shoe. So, I for one, am happy with this product because I don't have to buy the 100 dollar Nike shoes to use it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheap, Easy, and Works Well","review":"This is the best device I have found to house my Nike Plus sensor. Never has fallen out. I bought this after I lost my sensor when it fell off my shoe because I had a more expensive case that I had bought in a running store. Only thing with this product you have to be careful with is making sure the sensor is facing the right direction."},{"rating":"2","title":"shoe sensor","review":"This Sport Sensor Nike iPod Sport Kit shoe device works really well.My husband and I and our friend all use them, and we are almost always within0.2 miles of each other when we run together.

Our friend uses theNike watch with her iPod, but we use the traditional sensor/iPod nano combo.These sensors make it really nice to switch the system between pairs of sneakers."},{"rating":"2","title":"works great","review":"inexpensive and gets the job done - also I don't have to buy Nike shoes to use their sensor"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Gadget","review":"Serves its purpose very well. Inexpensive, durable,...just great. This little gadget does everything it claims to do.Was using velcro, but now am able to move to other shoes easily and effortlessly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what it is supposed to","review":"I tried to just put the nike sensor in my laces but it kept falling out. I purchased this little attachment and now I dont loose it, so I guess that means it was perfect because my problem is completely solved. It fits nicely on the laces and can even be removed easily when you dont want it on there. i used to have problems with the same route coming up as different mileage, and now they are all the same. So i am not sure about the reviews that said it doesnt count the miles, that may be their sensor not this attachment.If you are having trouble keeping your sensor on your shoes, definitely get this attachment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read for Anyone Who Needs a Reminder","review":"Okay, so maybe you KNOW what you should be doing to repair or improve your finances. But then you think: it's too simple; how can putting aside money for myself first possibly get me on a better financial path?This book reminds you that sometimes a single, common-sense step is what it takes to help you continue (or start) your journey to financial security.That reminder alone is worth the price of admission for David Bach's latest book. Granted, there is NOT a lot new here. But the longest journey begins with a single step, and all that.So if you need a reminder about what you should be doing financially, you'll find it here.Reviewer: Linda Painchaud"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple and easy to understand","review":"I've read the Canadian edition of Automatic Millionaire and it is simple and easy to understand. Although English is not my first language and it's my first time to read a personal finance book, I finished reading it in two days. It provides me a very straight forward and working solution to save money every month. I would recommend this book to people who lack self-discipline to budge and want to have a comfortable life at retirement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book is a RIP-OFF","review":"One of the priciples the book teaches is to try and find the little expenses and cut them out to make big savings overtime.Here is your first one... Buy the original this book is a copy of, George Clason's 'Richest Man in Babylon'. It is only $6.00. Instantly Save Money!I have only started reading this book and saw some similarities right off... Then I saw this clown on Fox 25 in Boston being interviewed on the news, and he almost quoted word for word half of the principles Clason wrote back in 1926.This book is a cheap rip-off. Clason's book is a true classic and has helped millions either become wealthy, or become wealthier. The principles are time honored. The only way this guy is getting rich is by stealing and publishing a rip-off of the original text.Buy 'Richest Man in Babylon' by George Clason instead, save $6.00+ and be happy that you did not get ripped off. Why over pay for information that was published 80 years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!!!","review":"I love this Book...It really is helpful for beginner's out there...I would def recommend this Book to Beginner's and to any one who just want's to learn alot about improving there income and there Life!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT book for college graduates!","review":"This is an exceptional book that I've recommended to several friends. The advice is sound and relatively easy to implement. I've gone on to read and listen via audio books, to several of David's books and yes, I've taken David's advice and automated my investing. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good work","review":"Every thing has its order of operation and David helps with that. Thank you, for making things a little clearer for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!!","review":"Consider this book a Double Flat Latte!!!If you have already read Smart Couples or Women, this book will be a complete waste of your time and money. If you haven't read Smart Couples or Women, then I highly recommend you purchase one of those. The information in Automatic Millionaire presents the same information that was in those books.I like and have followed David's steps in his Smart Couples book and have been very successfull in achieving my goals.I think David should \\"write\\" a new book on the next steps of financial planning instead of \\"cut and pasting\\" an old book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Come on people, 5 stars?","review":"I can sum up this book for you: Do everything your mother told you was prudent. If she didn't tell you anything then do what you are constantly told in every financial guide - save money consistently and don't waste it on nonsense. If you bought this book you just broke rule #2.The second edition of the book will add this wealth-accumulation method: Compile a bunch of common-sense and readily available facts about any subject and create a book. Get a tempting cover and a slick marketing campaign to sell said book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty thin on content","review":"A couple good ideas but drawn out over a few hundread pages. I was able to skim through the whole book in a day. Pretty thin on content overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby book","review":"The Automatic Millionaire is great for inspiration only. If you need that little extra \\"rah rah\\" for saving then this book is great for reading on the toilet or while waiting for the dentist. Bach breaks it down and reminds us that while his concepts are simple and easy many people just don't follow them. I agree. He roots for us and urges not to be spendy which is great but I do have a problem with the book. It is over-simplified. If you want a REAL book on how to manage your money that is JUST as simple to read check out Mary Hunt's Debt-Proof-Living."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Total Bomb","review":"The book is filled with pages that reference certain mutual funds at a time when many fund companies are under fire. Rich people dont buy mutual funds and the buy and hold philosophy that is tauted in the book is really outdated. Many people who held funds for years wished they had sold long ago. The problem with the book is that it is really a sales pitch that one might here from a financial planner who was trying to sell mutual funds to get a big commission. David Bach used to be a financial planner and it shows in the book in the most negative ways. There are too many charts and boring graphs to make a book a pleasurable read and because of that and its sell them at any cost mindset I cant suggest this title."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hands on - Take Action Book","review":"This book provides step-by-step action items to automate your saving in various areas (retirement, home ownership, new purchases, etc.). David Bach gives very clear steps that are easy and don't take much time to set up. The best part is, once everything is set up, you just sit back and watch your money grow (no more action is needed on your part). The book contains specific web sites and specific companies that you can use to \\"take action\\" and get your life automated! The book is really easy to understand and WILL give results! I highly recommend this book to any new saver or someone wanting to evaluate their current savings process!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"A good basic tool for those planning to be automatic millionaires. It's very simple and real. Mainly for the American audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet another rah rah book","review":"Just another one of those books that lead (or mislead) you to think you can make it, only to find that it is harder, or impossible to get rich. Sure, follow the advice and you won't be bankrupt, but that kind of results we can get from listening to our folks in their eighties! Try simpler and down-to-earth books like The Art of Happiness at Work or Dot Zen."},{"rating":"1","title":"blah","review":"If your a young person starting out this might apply to you but if your 40+ forget it you already know the answer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Im getting RICHER EVERYDAY","review":"This book is PHENOMENAL! The fact that the author and his wife are middle class hard working citizens, makes the plan more realistic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty swell, but...","review":"Book was really well written. Lot of good ideas but I already knew most of them. I also just wish the author went more indept on investing... but hey the investing world changes so frequently that its understandable"},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me a break","review":"Oh please, give me a break. Anyone who gave Mr. Bach a 5 star rating must have been a friend of his. This book is so basic. You could find this advice on most financial websites for free.Invest your money instead into your savings account."},{"rating":"1","title":"opportunist","review":"I will never read anything by this author again, He should not be allowed to publish books. He was subsidized by Wells Fargo because his book pushed home ownership and second home ownership, without regard for being able to afford the home/homes. He is not the cause of the housing bubble but a flag bearer for it. And rather an opportunist and a profiteer."},{"rating":"1","title":"More proof that how to get rich is to write a book","review":"David Bach gets rich by telling the rest of us things we should already know: \\"PAY YOURSELF FIRST!\\" \\"Don't eat out so much/get rid of extras.\\" Does anybody out there really think this is new information??? He then goes on to give advice on how to manage retirement accounts, 401Ks, etc in order to maximize profit. Newflash, Mr. Bach: the people who really need help certainly don't afford to have IRAs and 401Ks, and if we do eat out, it's off the Value Menu at Wendy's....once a week if we're lucky. All this book does is prove that if you want to get rich in the 21st century, rephrase \\"Well-Duh\\" common sense so it sounds like something new, get it published, and talk other people into buying it. Sigh. Skip this one, folks. Your mamma can give you the same advice for free."},{"rating":"1","title":"For This He Had To Write A Book","review":"The author has managed to pack all the wisdom of a 6-inch newspaper column into this book. Payroll deduct your savings, avoid debt, pay down your mortgage quickly. That's about it. The rest is fluff. Save your money and your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Choose To Become Rich Automatically","review":"There are no new ideas in this book nor are there any secrets to becoming rich. Basically, the whole book discuss having part of paycheck, pre-tax if you can do it, deducted automatically and let compound interest and time work its magic to make someone rich. Needless to say, the younger you are when you start this, the better off you'll be. Most of the calculations in the book presume that the investor will be able to obtain 10% annual returns over the course of their lives, which is always hard to predict given our volatile future and the state of the markets. What this book does do well, however, is motivate the younger generation to start saving money for themselves and their future. We live in a culture defined by making more to spend more. This, we all recognize, is not wise, yet few people actually diligently follow the advice in the book. It's a short and quick read, but had it gone on too much longer it would have become too repetitive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really informative...ESPECIALLY IF YOU DO IT!!!","review":"I am an avid reader of financial and investing books and this book was very refreshing in that it gave a rather different take on saving and budgeting than any other books I have read. If you follow Mr. Bachs instructions you will not only be financially better off, but you will probably be better off in personal relationships as well. This book really shows you how to take the pressure and strain out of budgeting and saving. I would recomend this read to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Educate yourself here","review":"There is no such thing as an automatic millionaire but you can develop the mindset of a millionaire, take calculated risks, and reach your financial goals. This book offers information and strategies which you can evaluate and select which work best for you. I suggest you read it along with Optimal Thinking: How To Be Your Best Self which provides the thinking required to consistently be your best, make the most of every opportunity, and optimize your emotional and financial intelligence. Being a millionaire is more than a monetary experience!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An Absolute Joke","review":"I would personally like to thank the author for putting in this book endless references to web sites and assorted materials instead of his own thoughts. Hahahha. I mean really. What this book is, is simply a collection of charts and info on websites. The idea that making a million is automatic is just stupid, but a great way to market a book like this. Its message is if it's automatic then everyone can do it. Not true said the wise man. How sad to think what readers get today is simply a marketing venture for the author, instead of a well thought out book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Common Sense","review":"This book gives information that actually makes sense and is achievable. It was written to hold your attention and at times seems gimmicky because of this but the information is solid can do stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"a book for beginners","review":"The book offers some practical advice but nothing beyond what can be found on the internet, TV or a friend. While it was a good reminder to start saving for retirement, the book has some flaws such as stating that saving requires no budgeting or discipline. He calls putting away 20% of your income and giving up your daily dose of caffine a \\"no-budget, no-discipline\\" plan."},{"rating":"2","title":"This or 17 LIES","review":"You can follow the advice in this book, which is excellent but requires one to have some money, actual money, or leverage in that direction. For me, I had to start deeper in the process, the inner parts that were preventing me from making money, for which I recommend Steve Chandler's 17 LIES as the ultimate wake-up tool for success."},{"rating":"2","title":"HOW TO IMPROVE YOUR FINANCIAL WORTH","review":"For those who want to improve the financial aspect of their lives, author David Bach gives practical, easy \\"can-do\\" steps. Are you paying yourself first? Do you put aside just \\"one\\" hour of your day's pay in an IRA or your company's 401K plan? Author Bach believes that anyone can enhance their financial worth by following suggestions given in the book which also contains true stories from everyday people sharing exactly how they helped themselves. A clear, and informative roadmap to dropping some destructive spending habits and climbing the ladder of financial well-being and self-esteem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new or original in this book","review":"First, I'm shocked Mr. Bach could convince a publisher to take on what really should have been an article, not a full book. Secondly, Mr. Bach doesn't express a single new idea or concept. In fact, he actually steals ideas from other popular authors. Forget spending your money on this book. Just follow the money guidance contained in the books already on your bookshelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful and simple.","review":"David Bach did a great job of laying out exactly how to go about \\"automating\\" your finances so that when you retire you have plenty of money to retire on. I thought this book might be about more than just retirement but that seems to be his main focus. For those who have a good job and like it and just want to retire wealthy then this book is all practically all you'll need! For those who want to be a millionaire BEFORE traditional retirement age(like me) then the tips in this book plus a few more will do you good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better books even for beginners","review":"This book has almost no substance. Anybody can give an advice, start investing in 401K, IRA etc but what abt the real questions like what mutual funds, what cap, fees, tax are not addressed at all. I think Suze Orman's books are much better for beginners."},{"rating":"1","title":"Took No Expert To Write This","review":"I HAD to read this book. The hype was overwhelming. Best-seller lists, waiting lists at the library. Wow! I was so excited to find out how to be an Automatic Millionaire. Turns out, I already knew how and I was already doing enough to be on my way.Quick summary: open and contribite to an IRA, save money by not wasting it on unneccessary things, pay off your mortgage, repeat.I could have come up with that in about 15 minutes. There is new information in this book. The actual way to become an automatic millionaire should be as follows:Write a book that includes information that everyone already knows, put a nice cover on it, sell it for $20 each.I would pass on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Young and confused about money - read this book!","review":"Let me start by saying this book is a wonderfully practical and easy read beneficial to those of any age (I finished it in about an hour and a half), but if you are in your twenties and haven't begun to think seriously about your money or your future, this book is a must read! In that stage myself, I found David Bach's information extremely helpful and inspirational. We are not too young to start thinking about our retirement (especially if we want to retire early). But besides that, Bach offers information on setting up a personal emergency fund and on buying your first home. If you are like me and wish that you had a personal coach to guide through this part of your life, buy David Bach's book - it is your one on one coaching manual!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Where was this book 30 years ago?","review":"I've read David Bach's \\"Smart Women Finish Rich\\" book and really enjoyed it. Three of my friends and I met twice monthly to discuss and follow through on his recommendations. \\"Automatic Millionaire\\" is even better, in that it is more direct and easy to understand. I've procrastinated all my life about taking care of my money, and Bach has made sense out of what used to seem overwhelming and therefore easy to avoid dealing with. I have ordered this book for all of my nephews, my sister and recommended it to all of my friends. I truly wish I had read it 30 years ago. I would be retired by now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless unless you're clueless","review":"Wow! I was so enraged to see this book on the bestseller list that I had to jump on here. If you are the average lunkhead who has no clue what do with their money (which is obviously many of you), this book MAY be of some use. Even then, if you can't figure out that putting away 25-30% of your income into an IRA will result in a lot at retirement you should maybe start with some Dr. Seuss books. Anyone with sense will go away saying \\"Tell me something I don't know.\\" I couldn't even bring myself to sell this one at a yard sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This book provides nothing new. It is centered on the whole idea of setting up your retirement accounts so they automatically deduct from your paycheck. If you have 401k, duh, it does that automatically...anyway, boring. It also says to save money, don't use credit cards, pay yourself, blah, blah, blah. Oh yeh, if you save early you will be a millionaire in like forty years...zzzz. Ok, it did help me by reminding me about the interest rates in banks. One idea was to put the emergency funds in a money market account which offers a higher interest rate than a regular savings account. Upon reading this, I decided to do this and doing this made me realize the dismal .2% I've been earning on my saving account. And not realizing the latest craze started by ING, all the other banks offer an \\"online savings\\" account which offers 5% compare to the dismal .2%. I immediately switched! Other than this part of the book, it was boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"More peace and security","review":"I am very pleased with David's latest book. I also participated in two of his coaching programs. His book is easy and understandable to read. I am in the process of following his suggestions and I feel more peace and security about finances than I ever have. I really like the idea of automating finances as much as possible. He has numerous suggestions in his books that are helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"long winded, myopic and basic","review":"I am not in any way a financial expert, but I found that I could have written the same book myself with ad hoc advice I've picked up passively throughout the years. The most frustrating thing about spending the money on this is, I don't live in the USA and nearly all the advice is for Americans... executing what he advises is not possible where I live."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Rip-Off","review":"How on earth could I have been so foolish to fall for this title? Nothing in life is automatic, particuarly becoming wealthy. This book is FILLED with misrepresentation, misleading statements and down right hype. I guess the way to becoming an automatic millionaire is to find a slick way to ripoff people at the checkstand. Well phooey on you, Mr. Bach. My Barnes and Noble will let me return this book if I am not satisfied. And guess what? I'm not satisfied. This publisher should be sued for daring to publish such a dishonest tome."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Automatic Millionaire","review":"As a entrepreneur this book did not impress me in the least. If you are a person stuck in the industial age and want to stay there this book is for you. One of my bankers recomended that I read this book witch showed me the sad realities of people's industrial age mind set's that are still inbeded in to many of us in today's world of globalization and information. See no healthy reasoning in this book in relating to modern ecconomic realities. This type of thinking holds no real future for us.

Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buying this book only makes the author rich not you!!!","review":"If you are looking for investment tips, this is a WRONG book!!! It is a 'cheerleading' book which is suitable for NO-brain mid-afternoon coffee time. It is very easy to summarize this book - force saving, cut bad spending habit, buy a house instead of renting and pay mortgage ASAP, NO personal debt and invest in 401k and other accounts.Why bother to buy this book?! Sometimes I could not understand why people are wasting [$] to learn the basic responsibilities which they are supposed to know from day 1.Go to local Barnes and Noble and I bet you only need one hour to finish reading without paying a penny!!!Buying this book only makes the author rich not you!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Some of the things are a bit hard to believe...","review":"Okay, I LOVE financial books. Love them. I like David Bach, he's okay, but this book is kinda hard to believe.First, when he tells the \\"story\\" of the couple from when David Bach was back in his 20's, so that would be back in late 70's or early 80's(?) - he talks about how the people told him about his \\"coined phrase\\" the Latte Factor (insert trademark symbol here).Uh, was a Latte even a common phrase drink back them? Not that I recall, so that little \\"PR\\" move for his \\"catch phrase\\" AUTOMATICALLY put me on guard as to what was real vs. not real.His info is a bit far-fetched if you want to truly read into it, but on the whole the book gives great ideas on how to set aside money for your future. Without picking it apart, it's not bad advice.Easy to read, but the stories are totally unbelievable to me. I kept thinking that he totally made them up, or how embellished they were.Get it from your local library. Also recommend Jean Chatzky books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding book","review":"I really don't where to start with this great book by Dave Bach. There is so much information in here. Everything you need to become financially independent is in here.Not since Charles Givens groundbreaking book More Wealth Without Risk has someone packed so much useful information in one place. Information that works all the time and works for everybody.Forget those 1,000 page fluff infested books written by non fincnial people or even worse, self publishing geeks who claim to be businessmen/entrepneurs but in reality are only spammers with no real investment/business experience and write horribly bad books.Bach is a guy who has a system that works and is working for everybody. Ask Ophrah. Ask anybody who has tried it. Then go ask people who have bought those books written by people from newsweak, who are writers but not financial experts.Great book Mr. BACH. I am looking forward to your next foray.Newsweak writers and self publishers, better keep your day jobs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it's weight in Gold!","review":"This is without question the best book on personal finance thatis on the book stands right now. Such an easy read. Practical and powerful and Bach is so witty too. Awesome book. I can conservatively say that The Automatic Millionaire has already saved me over $75,000. Thank you Dave BACH!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Seems all to familiar......","review":"If you have read another book by David Bach, save your money. This book has no new ideas.I was very disappointed in the book. Mr Bach has repackaged material from previous books in a more simplified manner. I was hoping for more insight since I had read two of his earlier books, but found the material all to familiar. It seemed like a dumbed down version of smart women finish rich.I can sum up his message (and save you $13+) - save 10% in retirement, buy a house, don't use credit cards, and tithe and do all of these in the most simple way possible and then you will be a millionaire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Financial book available right now","review":"Without a doubt, The Automatic Millioniare is the single best personal finance out book in America. This book is so packed with information and an easy and fun read too.I bought mine earlier today at Costco and couldn't put it down! Bach is a great writer as well as a financial expert.If you are looking for just one book on how to revamp your personal finances and get out of debt, this should be the one.And I agree with the reviewer that said that ratings are low here at Amazon because people are buying this and other best sellers at other places (like Costco where I bought mine) Why pay more, plus shipping and have to wait?The Automatic Millioniare is a OUTSTANDING book. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very similar to authors other books","review":"I gave this book a low rating for one reason, the book is so similar to the authors other books that there really isn't a reason to buy it if you have read the other books. Many of the examples and stories in the book are taken from the authors earlier books. If you have read his other books, save your money and invest it.If you have not read any of the authors books then this is a pretty good book with practical advice on how to automatically save for your future. Many people talk about saving but never do until it is too late. I have used the same method of investing and it does work over a long period of time.So my adivce is to buy the book if you have never read any of his other books. If you have any of the other books I think you will be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"YOU can make David Bach a millionaire...","review":"Yes, buy this book and you can make David Bach rich!

It provided some good insight on money management however I could not get passed how sales-oriented this book was. I couldn't get through one chapter without him trying to sale me some additional project he has or lead me to his website. I found this distracting and it felt like he was trying to take advantage of readers by weaving this information throughout the book.

However, there are a of generalizations inside. You must own a house to be rich.....nope. Even if you own your house, what type of cash flow does it bring to you??? What does Net Worth really do for anyone unless it pays? A lot of my family members own their own house, but nobody pays them to live in it. They just pay the taxes and repairs. What if you move every three years for your job? It might not be the correct answer. Although, for some people it is the right answer. Rule #1 - Money doesn't flow towards generalizations. It flows towards respect.The tone of the book favors the 401K over the ROTH IRA. Read anything by Suze Orman.

And none of the usual Hollywood bravado. The crewman sweat bullets, as they are driven against their will by their own Captain Ahab to seek revenge, to go where orders forbid them, to take on a target that should not be taken on. That target can move as fast as their torpedoes can run and can be hit only by drawing it into a dicey, down the throat shot to the bow. A well crafted, well paced, and tense film with great performances by Gable, Lancaster, and lots of well known character actors. Based on a novel by someone who served."},{"rating":"2","title":"A really good sub movie","review":"I had seen just about all the sub movies before this one: Hunt for Red October, Das Boot, U-571, Crimson Tide, and even Down Periscope.

Lancaster and Gable both do a great job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Done Sub Movie","review":"This is a first-rate movie for anyone who likes WW 2 sub movies like Das Boot or U-571. Robert Wise keeps the tension going throughout the movie. Burt Lancaster (the sub's executive officer) and Clark Gable (the sub's skipper) go toe-to-toe constantly over how the sub is being run while on a dangerous wartime patrol mission. Great to see two Hollywood heavyweights slug it out scene after scene. Great stuff. I'd have given it 5 stars if the end hadn't been so sudden and a letdown.

What makes a man a good commanding officer - experience, training, apptitude or all three? Clark Gable gives a riveting performance of a man who is out for revenge, totally unaware of the effect his actions have on his suboridinates or what dangers to him and to his crew might transpire if he continues on his course. The special needs of the individuals chosen to man submarines is not a guarded secret; to work on a submarine requires a specific set of attributes. It's really exciting and nail biting."},{"rating":"2","title":"The mother of all submarine movies","review":"This one is a classic not only to the general public but among submarine sailors as well.

Directed by Robert Wise, this black and white war movie is quite engaging, with good action scenes and pretty good special effects for the time period. Clark Gable plays Rich Richardson, a submarine officer whose burning desire is to sink a Japanese destroyer that he believes was responsible for sinking his former vessel. Along the way, he is at odds with his crew and his first commanding officer, even disobeying orders when he sees an opportunity to sink the destroyer. This behavior puts his crew in danger, as he is unaware that an even greater enemy is nearby.This movie has its flaws, but overall it's an entertaining movie that I recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT MOVIE!!","review":"My family and i really enjoyed this movie.

Funny the first time, but not when you have to do it every second track. And it's not just annoying noises... this is super sonic pitchings that made my Pit Bull terrier try to eat the speakers!!!

The object of this type of video game or any other game is to be as entertaining as possible while presenting a stimulating challenge to the gamer.

Kudos to the graphics department, a big boo to the puzzle and story people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Honestly, as a GK fan I was expecting far more than this... THe first two games were great. Compared to the first two, GK III is slow and boring.

It's a great mystery marred by a lack of truly interesting characters (pretty much only Gabe, Grace, and Mose are interesting) and by a rotten pacing. The tension never really starts to build until it's almost too late, and even then it's not up to the kind of delicious tension and suspense the first two games displayed. Is it a good game? Oh yes. The gameplay is marvellous, it's so neat to explore a fully 3D world in an adventure game and to be able to view things from any given angle, but...it's not the equal of the first two in story, pacing, suspense, or character. The mystery is very well done, but the story around it could've been a lot better. STill worth playing if you're a fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GK3","review":"I thought the sotry of the game was very good. As with the other GK games, there's a lot of history to wade through, however I found it very fun. The only thing I didn't like was the graphics. I think they could have spent more time on that. The movies in between some of the chapters were the same polygonic 3D images from the game instead of realistic movies. There is also a lot of religion in the game (many different types), but it's not telling you what's right or wrong.It's worth the money, buy the 3D is sometimes annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the klutzy","review":"I gave up in chapter one. I was completely unable to do anything except eventually get Gabriel out of doors where I promply got turned around and lost. I never made it any further due to sheer frustration.I loved the first 2 games. The first was cartoony but really interesting and logical. The second had a really swoony Gabriel,a great plot, beautiful scenery and camera work. The only problem there was the werewolf scene near the end. The game froze up every time I used the talisman and I could not finish.Never the less, I looked forward to the 3rd part. I am not coordianated enough to be anything but dizzy in this format. However, I suspect that for those who can use the 3d format that they will love the game. Just not for us oldfashioned non-tech people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spit on the Sacred, Hail to the Damned.","review":"As a longtime fan of the Gabriel Knight series, I was so looking forward to playing this game. In spite of the troubles I'd heard plagued the new 3d world, I was rarin' to go on a new adventure with Gabe and Grace. Imagine my disappointment, then, when I found almost no storytelling at all. The puzzles were nothing to write home about, either. And Tim Curry was sadly miscast as Gabe. Still, I was gonna tough it out, just to see what happened. Was I in for a shock! I spend all this time wading through a sea of mediocrity, only to have this game tell me that my God is dead, and my faith is a lie! Not wanting to take the chance that some other poor fool might possibly play my copy after I threw it away, I actually broke the CDs first. This game was one of the greatest letdowns I've experienced in 10 years of PC gaming."},{"rating":"2","title":"On the whole, I enjoyed playing GK3","review":"I immediately purchased GK3 when it reached the stores since I had so much fun playing the first two games in the series. I thoroughly enjoyed this game with one notable exception, the character of Gabriel. His dialog was obnoxious and Tim Curry's voice acting was nothing short of terrible. But, as per usual with the GK series, the story was compelling, the characters were interesting, the game play time was long enough and the puzzles made sense. I liked the addition of the 3D engine and didn't mind them going back to animated characters. I sincerely hope there will be a GK4 as I would definitely buy it. My only wish is that they do NOT hire Tim Curry to play Gabriel again and might also consider toning down Gabriel's rude comments."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate to say it, but...","review":"I very much enjoyed GK2, so I was surprised at the letdown of GK3. I was looking forward to it so much that I bought it when it was released versus after the price goes down (I'm a poor grad student).The game was slow, there was little \\"adventure,\\" the characters movements were stiff (Gabriel walks like he has a pole up his butt), the puzzles were obscure, and the graphics weren't nearly as great as they were touted to be. But perhaps the most annoying thing about GK3 was Tim Curry's rendition of a Southern drawl. Besides the grating voice, many of the things he said were just stupidly insulting.If a GK4 comes out, I'll be waiting for it to be in the sale bin, if I buy it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"A different opinion","review":"I love adventure computer games, but I had a very different reaction to this one than the other reviewers. First of all, there wasn't much \\"adventure\\" to this adventure - I thought the story was pretty slow. But most importantly, this game had the most obscure (and in my opinion) ridiculous puzzles I have encountered in an adventure game.Also, I found the hero both annoying and unlikable. Among other things, he's supposed to be from New Orleans, and his accent is so bad that I found it distracting. In the game's initial movie, I could swear the character is British, but during the game sequences his accent is \\"Southern on steriods.\\"Suffice it to say this is the first adventure game I have ever purchased that I had no interest in finishing. Normally, I can't be dragged away from them.Go figure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low Tech - Bad Value","review":"I have always loved the Sierra Games, and have played most adventure games out there. Time has passed this game by. The interface is bad, parts of the character's bodies fade in and out as you move around. I have a very fast machine and the game sputters along at incredibly slow speeds. Compared to The Longest Journey and Syberia which both have fantastic graphics and very good interfaces (and even Grim Fandango - a great game with a very awkward interface), I would advise skipping GKIII. You will just be frustrated, I quit about 1/2 way through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"As much as I loved GK2, The Beast within, as disappointed am I with GK3, Blood of the Sacred. Why on earth did Sierra go from real actors back to drawings only? Endlessly boring, bad graphics, and a \\"Schattenjaeger\\" Gabriel Knight who is simply appalling and shows none of the charming characteristics his \\"real\\" persona had in GK2.

Will never buy a game again untill the price is reduced. WHAT Happened?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning","review":"I had seen this game sitting on the shelves of software stores for months. When the price finally lowered I decided to buy it. It was well worth my money. The game is absolutely stunning.The first thing to note is the graphics. The textures aren't really that detailed, but that doesn't stop them from preforming. The scenery is absolutely beautiful. Playing the game makes me want to visit Rennes le Chateau for real.The next good thing is the soundtrack. It is perfect. Every scene has a unique track. Sometimes I have the character just stand around doing nothing so I can enjoy the music.Lastly the story is fabulous. It has some great supernatural influence, as well as classic detective work.I take away one star because some of the puzzles can be ridiculously difficult expecially if you don't understand what you're supposed to be doing, but don't let that stop you. If you really need to you can always find a walkthru."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anticipation turns to disappointment...","review":"I couldn't wait for this game to come out. Then, as I began to play, I found myself really annoyed by the extreme slowness of the gameplay -- especially when Gabriel has to, for instance, walk back to his motorcycle -- and by the absolute poisonousness of his character as portrayed in this game.

My children (8th and 5th graders)and their Gifted and Talented Program teachers have been enthusiastic about using the book. I especially appreciate the author's humorous treatment of this compilation of words likely to be tested, and the fact that he has updated the book periodically to keep pace with changes in the SAT. I would recommend it for any student-in school or not- interested in expanding his or her vocabulary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for homeschoolers","review":"When my daughter was in the 10th. grade, she was homeschooled.We purchased a set of curriculum, which of course, includedEnglish. I wasn't satisfied with the vocabulary portion of it,so I used this book. I gave her 10 new words each week and weboth had so much fun learning them! The illustrations are greatand they really do help you to remember them. Every week whentested, my daughter always got 100% correct. A few years later,my son was homeschooled for the 7th. grade. Out came the bookagain! I also use it to look up words, before reaching for adictionary. Having a good vocabulary (and using the words youknow correctly) is very important and I would recommend thisbook for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could not ask for a better way to memorize vocab","review":"As a student who is preping for the SAT, I must say the author did a great understanding the minds of the students.

We recomend it,because its fantastic information about Mahe,Praslin and La Digue islands, their national parks (such as Sainte Anne or Vallee de Mai). Prices were as high as the author wrote! and all information about public buses, rent-a-car and restaurants was right. Just one thing, we couldn't find where La Gogue Reservoir was! If anybody can strength the lake exists, please let us know!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty thin gruel","review":"I had two problems with this book. First, a stylistic complaint - I found the writing to be much too self-consciously cute. If you're going to write about serious topics, then do so in a serious way. Second, the author's approach consists of constructing one straw man argument after another and then demolishing it. He did not seem to be addressing any serious theoretic perspectives on conscious will, rather he seemed more interested in proving that the idea of conscious will is simply silly on its face and proceeds from there.A good and extremely important topic, but flawed execution."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book worth reading for any introspective person","review":"As I have been introspective, educated and am a practicing physiologist, and meditative for long stretches of my life, much of what I read in this book was not a big surprise! But it was a great read and had numerous good reviews of the literarture to confirm my own self ovbservations.I am still up in the air about our whole crime and punishment mindset, and wish there had been some more on this issue and also the relationship to meditation as a self induced hypnotic state- whatever that might be.In closing, if you are interested in any way about who we perceive ourselves to be, in the context of reality, then take the time to read the book.

Empire Of The Stars: Obsession, Friendship, And Betrayal In The Quest For Black Holes charts this rivalry and its lasting impact, considering both the quest for black hole proof and the underlying reasons for the struggles.

It was exciting, and it contained characters that actually had real life problems that most people can relate to. It dealt with trials and tribulations of love, and it also dealt with geographical racism. It spoke about black life in the south, and indian life in the northwest. This book kept you on the edge of your seat because it was filled with unexpected twists and turns.

Perhaps I should have waited the 10 years Dorris took to write the sequel. CLOUD CHAMBER is formulaic and bland.

Many artists try to recapture that soulful sound and many fail. Raheem definitely succeeds. So far this year the best CDs I've listened to have been Shakira, Esthero, and Raheem.

Faith cannot be destroyed--it can only be redirected."},{"rating":"1","title":"How Sad!","review":"I am dismayed that this educated man cannot understand the bible in a more comprehensive way, or any comprehensive way. It is sad that this author can undermine a more intellectual, spiritual, and reasonable approach to the bible. To say that the bible is nonsense does not reflect well on this author's intelligence or reliability. Perhaps he has some other issures which are unspoken and result in such dogmatic statements. To say to those who have doubts that the bible is nonsense is irresponsible.I would most heartily recommend the books of Han Kung to those who would like to diminish and eliminate those doubts that arise from inconsistencies and hard to believe events in the bible. Kung's books, there are many of them, save those who have had trouble with aspects of the bible and redeems our reason and spirit."},{"rating":"1","title":"mediocre","review":"I haven't bought this book and I would not waste my time reading it in its entirety. From the preview it's clear that it's another of those type of books where the author has employed a lot of sophistry to say what could have been said in a few simple words.

His lack of understanding of justice due to sin and wrongdoing is clear. We'd all agree if someone murdered our child and the judge allowed the murderer to go free, that would be wrong. Because God is a holy God (set apart, without sin, pure) AND He is just there must be a consequence for sin. God is love but He is also just yet full of mercy. Justice and Mercy meet at the cross of Jesus when God became man took upon Himself our consequence for our sin. So justice was served, yet mercy was given -- He took His own wrath (justice) upon Himself (mercy). Only God can open the eyes of our hearts to see truth and not fester anger or bitterness, which blinds us to truth and God's love."},{"rating":"2","title":"CLEAR AND POWERFUL","review":"For a relatively new skeptic, this work is full of supportive material. More experienced skeptics won't find too much that's knew.

Agree with his beliefs or don't; but his premise is spot-on. My singular complaint is the layout of the book. It makes it a difficult read. There is no chapter breakdown. I read the first 20-pages thinking I was reading an introduction and hoping with each additional page that I'd soon come to a chapter one heading.It didn't happen. What's even worse is that there is virtually no white space.

The organization and formatting is downright irritating and his overly pompous language is very annoying. The book doesn't even have chapters(!) It is just a litany of facts, almost in random order, which are not tied together in any consistent theme, so one is forced to go to the Bible and read the referenced texts and deduce for himself some consistency of message. He makes his many points over, and over, and over. An especially annoying part was early in the book when he explained, for no apparent reason, the many types of argument (IN LATIN!). Why??? To impress the reader? It not only added nothing to the book, it was probably a reason for many readers to simply chuck the book. I almost did.I suggest the writer use this manuscript as notes for writing an actual book.BTW, I agree with a great deal of what I could make out of this set of notes."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book needed an editor.","review":"I could only get through the first twenty pages or so.

At that time, I was diligently studying the Scriptures and reading everything that I could on the topic of predestination. Sproul has a delightful writing style that should be enjoyable for practically everyone, even if you are not reformed in your soteriological views.This book touches on the theological and philosophical realm of Calvinism. If you are beginning your investigation of the topic, or in the middle of it, this book will be rewarding. It is not like reading Augustine or Calvin directly, but then again, that is not the intent of this book. Sprouls ministry fills in where Sunday school leaves off and seminary picks up.Sproul is a Calvinist, not a hyper-Calvinist, and can help guard you from drifting to far in your theology. This book has already become a classic in our day and will provide you with a solid introduction to the doctrine of predestination."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would be better titled \\"Calvinism Is Right Just Because\\"","review":"I am a big fan of R.C. Sproul, listen to his radio show every day, and have several of his books. When I turned to this offering from Bro. Sproul on the sticky problems of predestination and election, I was stunned - there's a lot of eloquent language here, but no explanations.If you're a Calvinist, this book just covers the basics of Calvinist doctrine and cites the verses to back it up. If you're not a Calvinist, there's nothing here for you. The verses which contradict Calvinism are not addressed and not mentioned. The book goes in circles for many pages and finally ends up not giving you any satisfactory answers on the subject. I know Bro. Sproul is capable of much deeper explanation than this, perhaps he just wanted to keep it simple, but in doing so, he failed to really address the question - are we chosen by God or do we choose God? Despite the title, the answer to that question isn't in Bro. Sproul's book."},{"rating":"1","title":"If This Is Simple, So Am I!","review":"I eagerly read this book as part of a study on predestination due to the promotion of it as a \\"simple, clear\\" exposition of a complex subject.

At least this guy has the guts to stick to his guns having embraced biblical inerrancy. It is also not surprizing that this idea would be glorified. If faith is embraced as a valid epistimological procedure- anything goes. Practically speaking, Sproul, and the NT bring to the world a message that is one level lower than nihilism. The amazing thing is that good men and women have bought into this idea, hook, line and sinker. I read this book because this is the kind of thing my neices are being taught. This breaks my heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written, good logic","review":"This was my first experience reading Sproul and I was very impressed my his style of writing.

Although I accepted Christ at a very young age, I was never sure whether I had done it correctly. This book shows that it is not how you do it, but that God does the saving without our help. He has chosen those who are to be His. He makes sure they \\"find\\" Him. It takes away the worry over the problem of doing it right.

I would prefer Scripture references and a focus on what the Bible says."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 2nd?

Sproul's teaching on Total Depravity truly opened my eyes. It firmed up for me my place in the universe, God's place, and the level of grace and mercy that I had received.That is not to say that I didn't throw the book across the room a couple of times during the process.My favorite parts of this book were Sproul's treatments on Romans 3 and Romans 9. It took about two years to come to terms with the shifts in my theological perspective. This book has helped me to understand God's sovereignty and to take comfort in the fact that all things are under His control. It's good to be liberated from the image of a God who's wringing His hands wondering if people will accept His gracious offer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Degrassi RULES - Release them all on DVD!","review":"This series is great, and it would be great that since the Junior High series was released on DVD, I hope that there are plans to release this series, as well as Kids of Degrassi Street on DVD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best \\"realism\\" TV show I have ever seen!","review":"I first saw the series on my local PBS station.

It deals with such real issues teens have to face, and there isn't always a happy ending. Degrassi High takes it to another level. From suicide to inter racial dating, to moving out on your own to violence in dating. This series has it all, with an added bonus of characters you know, and actually like. They could be someone you knew growing up. I am now in my mid 20's and still find it to be a fasinating show!

Though the quality isn't as high as in Pride or UFC DVDs, especially the production values, at this price this DVD is a great deal for Rampage fans.There aren't any extra features included; the DVD has a short introduction and conclusion by an announcer from KOTC and that's it. The time between rounds has even been cut.So in the end, although the excitement of these fights doesn't equal Rampage's match-ending slam on Ricardo Arona or his KO of Chuck Liddell, this DVD is still worth checking out with some solid bouts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not to be missed","review":"This is a fast-paced, exciting mystery that keeps you engaged.

As an actual working cowboy way out in eastern Washington state, Wylie clearly knows the north end from the south end of a horse, and so sings his songs about Western life with an unmatched authority.Wylie's up-tempo numbers are joyous and bouncy, and make you want to hit that Whoop-Up Trail alongside him: his voice is rich and clear, and his band is tight and swinging. Although the songs themselves are generally strong (Dylan\\"s \\"Girl From The North Country\\" is an unexpected treat), the inclusion of perhaps one too many lugubrious love ballads-- the bane of the genre-- brings the production down one star.Oh, and did I mention his yodeling? Talk about a rare talent: what would be terminally corny in the hands of a lesser-gifted artist instead raises goosebumps.

Warned against a Cajun werewolf, known as D'Loup Garou, Feliciana huddles under her covers after hearing something strange outside the house.But once Feliciana has convinced herself that the howling she heard was only her brother trying to get back at her, she fearlessly chases after whatever it is running through the swamp.D'Loup Garou springs out, ready for a nice meal, but Feliciana has more than a few things to say until this seemingly mismatched pair learn that they are more alike than either suspected.The illustrations are delightfully rendered, and the Cajun dialect is fun to tackle, even if you feel like your tongue has suddenly swollen as you try, perhaps in vain, to sound the part."},{"rating":"2","title":"A truely enjoyable reading experience for kids and parents.","review":"My kids (8, 5, and 3) were delighted to find another Feliciana Feydra Leroux story. Like the first Feliciana story, this story also features a great antagonist for Feliciana. This time Feliciana is up against a Cajun werewolf, and there are some terrific illustrations that really bring him to life. I like the fact that Feliciana is a little girl who takes charge during her adventures. My kids (1 boy and 2 girls) just like the adventures. We also like the relationship between Feliciana and her brother, which is certainly reminiscent of sibling relationships everywhere. This is a story that kids love and parents can really enjoy reading. The language is marvelous, the story is engrossing, and the surprise ending is bound to delight.

Someone remarked to Napoleon, \\"No man is a hero to his valet.\\" Napoleon replied, \\"That is not because the hero is no hero, but because the valet is only a valet.\\" Johnson cannot see any virtues, because he has none himself. He is of a piece with the other bullyboys of the right, Bill O'Reilly (the great defender of family values,now on sexual harassment charges), Rush Limbaugh, Kelvin McKenzie, Alistair Campbell, Bernard Ingham, Christopher Hitchens. All pose as iconoclastic, brave and outspoken; but all cravenly repeat the lies of power. All fawn on the rich swine who own the media pulpits from which they bully those who never have a chance to reply."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rogues and Charlatans","review":"Paul Johnson is one of the most acute observers of the 20th century, and Intellectuals examines some of the left's most idolized men by means of their personal lives and behavior. It appears,unsurprisingly, that some revolutionary artists and writers are selfish, egotistical monsters. This book is very witty, and Johnson has the brains to understand the work of these people quite well enough to subject them to this kind of scrutiny.

It is both more entertaining and more informative than the average Liberal tract, not that that is saying much.Try it. If nothing else, it will infuriate all the Liberals who see you reading it, which must be counted as a plus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paul Johnson exposes uncomfortable myths","review":"Mr. Johnson's book is an intelligible and entertaining read. His thesis is really to expose the hypocrisy of these major thinker's lives to much of their own ideas. Easy to love humanity, harder to love individual humans. Most failed miserably at the later. Much needed debunking for those enamored with the radicle left."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining, but poor science","review":"I enjoyed his history of 1815 - 1830 very much, so I bought this without much thought, assuming it would show the genesis of certain ideas.It contains highly critical biographies of some people - Tolstoy, Hemmingway, Sartre, Brecht, and others, and says little about their ideas.Assuming that they were such bums as described, what point is proven?Where is a solid definition of what is meant by 'intellectual'? Where is a long list of those who fit and those who don't and why?How is it shown that the samples chosen for detailed study are randomly selected?And even if all this be true, once the unproven is discarded, all it says is that some people with very stong convictions tend to let those convictions blind them to truth and to common humanity. Rather tautological.Entertaining, but poor science."},{"rating":"1","title":"repudiation of independent thought by a devout catholic","review":"Throughout all the reviews of this book,no one has mentioned the most salient motivating factor of Johnson;his devout catholic faith!He openly admits to finding the replacement of ecclesiastically dominated philosophies with 'rationalism' to be morally abhorrent.Thus we come to the nub of this and indeed all his works;man cannot replace god.That his attacks on bizarrely selected 'intellectuals' are vindictively selective ,unempirical,and ultimately ,of course the work of an intellectual(who himself has recently been shown to be an adulterer,despite fequently railing against infidelity)attempting to use rationalism, rather perversely both nullifies his work,and vindicates it.Thank god for the reformation of the church!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not his best book","review":"Paul Johnson is a writer who I have great respect for and have much enjoyed reading. This is the least successful of the four or five books of his I have read. His attack on the Western Intellectual tradition in the past two hundred years is in certain ways justified. But there are other great intellectual figures he might have taken whose contribution to our understanding of ourselves and the world is useful and great. If you want to write about Intellectuals in the past two hundred years you should write about Isaiah Berlin, Popper, Camus, Kierkegaard, Daniel Bell, Sidney Hook, Whitehead, and a host of other figures whose intellectual contributions were not necessarily diminished by their political positions."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Spanker\\" Johnson and the private lives of intellectuals...","review":"As a number of people have noted, a hatchet job on selected intellectuals of the Left. Christopher Hitchens called it \\"...a foul-minded assault on the Enlightenment...\\", and the description still stands.But have I missed it, or has no one noted Johnson's own prediliction for being spanked, as noted by his dominatrix Gloria Stewart, after she got fed up with listening to his Family Values tripe? I wonder if any second edition of _Intellectuals_ would have to be set up as an autobiography... ?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Haphazardly written, total disappointment","review":"I think that Mr. Johnson has put too much of his own spin on what those intellectuals were like. Any person who would read a serious well-researched biography (say of Sartre by Annie Cohen-Solal) would know that Mr. Johnson is perhaps kidding around.If you don't spend the effort required to really know these intellectuals, don't expect too much.

I also found his \\"A History of Christianity\\" both interesting and valuable. But this one really disappointed me. It came across as superficial, petty, and just plain \\"shoot from the hip\\". And I kept wondering how Johnson's own life as an ordinary human being, combining both brilliance and flaws in his makeup (as we all do), would read if it were written up in this same way. I also wondered how my own life would look in print, if Johnson were to report on it in as vicious and uncharitable a way as he has portrayed those of his victims in this book, and shuddered.Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biased and stupid","review":"Johnson has written a lengthy character assassination on a very select group of public figures -- people who are too secular, or too left-wing, for his taste. It's quite true that Johnson fashions a definition of 'intellectual' that excludes most conservatives and traditionalists (interesting tactic, that), but he also fails to acknowledge the very different aims and drives of, say, Hemingway and Ibsen on the one hand and Marx on the other. Basically, he took his salacious little gossip-pieces where he could get them.By his writings and his own definitions, Johnson can lay no claim to being an intellectual; that's quite true. But he lied and denied about his own dalliances as enthusiastically as did any of the subjects of his book. His hypocrisies are of a more traditional type, which I suppose is appropriate."},{"rating":"2","title":"One sided but true","review":"It is true that Johnson is quite selective and anecdotal in his description of the so-called Intellectuals, but it brings a previously ignored balance to these characters.

The only difference is that they claimed otherwise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing in its depth and relevance","review":"What Paul Johnson does, that many are afraid to do, is take a serious look at the lives of people who have shaped Western culture, and acknowledge their many short-comings.

In other words, when I chose to do just workout 1, it jumped right to workout 2 and the rest of the DVD. Plus, this DVD should be considered advanced since most of the poses are sort of confusing and difficult for someone like me who is not all that flexible at all. Other than that, I hope Mike McArdle will be out with more yoga DVDs in the near future. He was not bad at all as instructor. But Bethenny's chatter often interrupted with his teachings which caused some confusion as too what the moves I was supposed to be doing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caution! Too Much Bethenny Chatter=Waste of time and $","review":"Not even one star. I usually don't mind instructors talking during workout dvd's and videos, especially in yoga or yoga-type workouts, where their talking is so often necessary in preventing students' having to look up tv all the time as we learn. But there was just WAY too much idle chatter in this dvd. The majority of the yoga instructor's vocal and non-vocal instruction in this dvd is constantly interrupted by Bethenny. She even interferes with verbal instruction. This was so jarring and unhelpful I gave the dvd away after my first use--I just can't be craning my neck thru an entire workout dvd, especially a yoga one, in a vain effort to follow the instruction and the yoga flow. I have nothing against Bethenny, who seems like a nice person. But this dvd should not have been released as it is.

It was really too difficult for beginners, requiring aerobic and strength moves (push-ups and thrusters) and balance that is difficult if you're overweight or overage (older than 25, that is!). I'm 58 and about 30 lbs. over weight, if that helps you decide if this is for you.Plus, there is no instruction, just straight into the moves, which are difficult to see on the TV when you're bent into a pretzel, looking at your toes. I think I'd rather take a class to have a live instructor correct my moves.P.S. Oh, did I say that Bethenny makes quirky little comments throughout? That will also get annoying after the 3rd time of watching!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the newbie","review":"I REALLY wanted to like this. I love Bethany's style. She's laid back and has a great sense of humor. Unfortunately, for me, this DVD was too difficult. I've never done yoga before and this DVD professed to be for people of all levels. I found it difficult to do most of the positions properly because I had to keep looking at the tv so I knew what I was doing. Also, many of the moves were quite difficult for an inexperienced person. There wasn't enough explanation or time given to perform each new move before moving on to the next. Also, I can easily see how someone could seriously hurt themselves if the moves aren't done properly. It does give a fantastic stretch..but aren't you only suppose to stretch warm muscles?

While some of the cultural and technical elements require a little suspension of disbelief, the overall story is a fascinating follow up to a great book.Highly recommended if you enjoyed \\"Old Man's War\\". I am very much looking forward the next book, \\"The Last Colony\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding read again!","review":"I would really love to provide a great review of this book, but I feel like anything that I'd say would give away part of the plot and encourage you not to read it, and I certainly don't want that to happen at all.Let's just say that Scalzi does a tremendous job writing science fiction for people who people who do and don't like science fiction alike. He deftly weaves human nature, xenobiology, and metaphysical concepts into a tremendous narrative that's hard to put down. If you've read his first book in this universe (Old Man's War), then go read this one already.

Unlike the others, Jared was cloned from a living person, Charles Loubotin, who has defected to the enemy with secrets the Colonial Defense Force is desperate to keep. At first Jared seems like a failed experiment as he has none of Loubotin's memories, but slowly they start to filter into his brain, creating conflict between the viewpoint he inherited with his DNA, and the soldier he has to be.The feel is different enough from Old Man's War that some people were disappointed with this book. I think this was so much better, combining military SF with psychology, philosophy, and ethics. And I LOVE Old Man's War - high praise for both books. Ghost Brigades made me so sad I actually reread it hoping I'd missed something. I hadn't. I think it's safe to say this is the only SF I've read that made me sob like someone died."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun.

I don't mean it as an insult, at all. It follows on within the universe admirably, examining the Ghost Brigades in a bit more detail. But the original novel's protagonist (who I quite liked) is relegated to a footnote in a few chapters, and replaced by a character I found less compelling.Which is perhaps not odd, given that he's essentially an infant. :)That said, this is a good book, and I will definitely continue to read in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Read","review":"After Old Mans War this was a great story getting to learn more about the special forces.

Why quibble. This is a solid follow up to Old Mans War. Perhaps not the most ingenious story but I loved Old Mans War and this one provides a pretty well told tale of the Ghost Brigades. If this had been a stand alone book then I might have given it a 3, considering its a sequel and a middle book to at minimum a trilogy I give it extra points.I was not totally sold on Boutin's motives for betraying the human race. That for me was the weakest point in the story.

And very often dead.If you're a fan of military SciFi, you'll really enjoy this series. I'm a fan of Hammer's Slammers, the Lt. Leary series, Honor Harrington, and of course RAH. If that's your taste in SF, do yourself a favor - read this series!This is a sequel. Kind of. It stands alone just fine, and only a few lines of text allude to the previous book.

However, Scalzi's style and humor has won me over.Reading \\"Old Man's War\\" is not required, but will better prepare you for \\"The Ghost Brigades\\". I do recommend reading them in order.

The narrators are more matter-of-fact and gritty, and less enthralling.

The pacing drags.Here's an example: At one point he writes that the soldier's guns are linked to their specific brain implants. He then writes that that's so \\"their guns can't be used against them by anyone else\\". Really?!! Thanks for making that clear, because I wouldn't have picked up on it otherwise.

The characters apparently have no inner lives, and their thoughts are cliched and trite. The author does reference long-lost fathers in an attempt to provide some complexity to the characters, but unfortunately, this fails to give them true and honest depth--depth that would give the book's action much-needed resonance. The dense descriptions and long-winded prose dilutes the dramatic tension. Several minor characters could've been cut (especially since the author felt compelled to change pov for almost every scene) which would've enabled the author to create more fully realized major characters and ultimately provide a stronger foundation for the overly plotted action. I truly looked forward to reading this book, but came away disappointed. REAP is uneven and doesn't showcase the writer's talents. Although his descriptions are lovely at points, they don't make up for a severe lack of characterization."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good memory but not worth but one third of its price...!","review":"This like any other brands memory is functional, but for the price this is offered for, it isnt worth it one bit, so beware, there is just-as-good and cheaper out there...Viking is way too much money...!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a children's book.","review":"I bought this book based on the rave reviews it had received.

Also, contrary to what Samsung claims, there really is no appreciable upconverting the signal for VHS tapes that I could see, they actually looked worse!!. In short, DON\\"T BUY THIS UNIT, it has a widely experienced defect. Shame on Samsung for releasing a product with known defects in the HDMI audio without a recall or warning to consumers.

Next, DVDs would stop playing mid-movie - they would get stuck and we would have to forward several frames to be able to continue the movie. Now, it doesn't even recognize DVDs anymore.

After about 6 months of use the DVD recorder burns nothing but coasters. The is a very poor design. Samsung should be offerring free replacement/repair.

It records and plays BOTH DVDs and VHS tapes, and I've experienced exceptional picture and audio with both media on this unit. I converted a few tapes to DVD with that feature, which is quite handy. I did have the remote problem that others mention, but I drilled a small hole in the end of the remote to expose the IRLED and switched to Lithium batteries and no more problem. I only payed $200 for this brand new. I purchased this product when my old DVD player died, I wanted a 2-in-1 unit like this and wanted to record DVDs.

Gary takes you step by step--from reading an article in the newspaper and deciding you have a story worth writing to writing an agent winning book proposal. And... because of the nature of true crime, writing a book in this genre is like no other--it is non-fiction, yet written as if fictional.

I consists mostly of stilted dialogue and monologue, a lot of it while looking into the camera, opining on the existance of a dead woman's ghost and the creepy things that are happening. Creepy being noises, open kitchen cabinets, and, yes, dead mom appears. The cover scene is brief as younger daughter freaks out.

We've been using it since he was one month old, and now he is three months. It is very comfortable to wear and it is the only way he is content when we are shopping!

First, when my son was a few weeks old, we tried it. He didn't like it because he was snuggled up to my breats and couldn't move. Then a month later, we tried it again. He was ok for awhile, but this time I couldn't get him out. Yesterday I put him in it, finally facing out. He looked super uncomfortable! He wanted out within minutes. This time getting him out was ridiculous...I think I have \\"last years\\" model, as mine looks slighly different from the picture. I ordered mine approximately 10 months ago. I think they have lowered the back so the baby can see out better when facing out. I hope they have worked on the hinges that are supposed to be able to lock with one hand. (right!)

It was then that I began to feel that it wasn't supporting her well enough. With the clasps at their tightest she still seemed to be falling forward and having to stare at the pavement on our walks. I also began to feel that it just wasn't supporting her weight (even though she only weighs about 15 lbs) Then we inherited a Snugli front and back carrier from a friend and it solved all of our problems. I'm back to using a Snugli everyday! If you plan to use a carrier for your child beyond her newborn days go for the front and back version, you'll be glad you did.

It fit around her very well, but I had two issues with it. In mommy-facing position, her face was crammed against my chest and I was afraid she was not getting enough air (no, I'm not well-endowed, but I suspect that would complicate the issue even further...). I tried forward-facing position, and that worked much better, but not until she was taller since the back is meant to support the baby's head at an earlier age. Bottom line, it is a great item for tall babies who have enough head control to face forward. I don't like the mommy-facing position because of concerns that baby is not comfortable. For the smaller babies, I highly recommend the SlingEzee carrier, which is extremely versatile and comfortable to wear. I use both of my carriers (this one and the sling) depending on the activity I am doing.

It was hurting his (for lack of a better word) boy parts. I left the carrier at the dr's office. Something that I also noticed was the material between his legs was far to wide and tight.

While It is easy to get the baby in and out of the carrier, it is not easy on one's back. There are no lower straps, so all the weight is put on your upper back. After about fifteen minutes of carrying my baby, I get a backache. Considering that I carried my baby a lot, this meant I got a backache a lot.

It moved slowly, well slowly as possible, through Wolf's and Jesse's whirlwind engagement but before even a quarter of the way through the book, I was picking up on many of the threads that hanged from this story. From people who were introduced to the plot before being abruptly killed off or barely mentioned again, such as Red Cloud and his tribe, to the fact that the last 20 pages of the book were incredibly rushed as though the author had given up on an actual plot and was just winging it.

Since most of the songs were unreleased in their current form I don't liken it to a compilation like I would Retro. I consider it an album of its own regardless of the age of the material. That being said I can safely say this is one Kmfdm's better albums. I like the guitars on Godlike. I own other disks with this song on it and this is one the best. Like any version isnt good. Agogo the song has that cool Parliment Funkadelic kind of groove to it and I'd be the first to say that it should have been included on the extended version of Angst along with the metalized version of Hole in the wall. Maybe Sasha can re-release it like Naive was and change the cover color. Tan maybe? food for thought. The cover of U2's Mysterious Ways is a treat.

This sloppy fit makes the gauge somewhat inaccurate and the gauge tends to fall off the ratchet when moving it about.And a general comment.

It has enough capacity for ice & 6-8 oz of mix. Ergonomics are excellent - easy to hold on to and shake the hell out of it. You do, however, need to keep pressure on the strainer lid & small cap to keep them sealed - that is to be expected. I do have a question for others who have used this shaker - I don't find the \\"bullet\\" top useful when shaking. When using the bullet top to cover the top of the shaker (with strainer lid & small cap in place), the small cap comes off inside the bullet top while shaking. With the small cap loose inside the bullet top the shaker leaks. Seems the small cap should stay in place with the bullet top in place. Do I have a defective unit? I took one star off because IF the bullet top WERE designed to keep the small cap in place, the shaker would be even more ergonomic and PERFECT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shaker","review":"This product met my expectations, it's easy to clean, comes apart nicely and works great.

Fine, other than I have to go through the hassle of waiting in line at the post office to return the wrong one. Except, if they don't ship partial products, then why did I receive a partial product to begin with? I received the second, mind you the replacement order, and the same exact thing happened - I received only the bottom piece.

After no more than 20 minutes of fiddling, I (A 200 POUND EX FOOTBALL PLAYER MADE OF PURE TESTOSTERONE) was unable to get the top of the shaker off because it was literally jammed into the bottom piece.

They look very similar... but you figure it out quickly.I would also suggest that you NOT install the control boxes to the wall until you have the system up and running, just lay 'em on the floor and then mount them after testing the stystem.Also , no need to use templates, just use the double sided tape (included) and then used your back panel as a drill guide.

I've gradually added more items as time/$ allows. Overall I'm very happy for the added peace of mind for a reasonable cost. At the very least it might be a deterrent. It was easy to set up and add other components later. My tip is keep the main unit in a central location to limit the distance from the different sensors. I do wish I could have a few more choices for which sensors are armed/on delay/off.

Everything works like it should.

I have been using it for 3 weeks. Easy to set and so far no false alarms. I read the directions twice before installation. Pretty straight forward if you read them. I ordered both the SC-1000 and the SC-10 because I wanted two more remotes (which work great by the way) and two more sensors. That was the cheapest way. The SC-10 remotes and sensors had to be programmed to the SC-1000 panel. If you read the directions, it's easy enough. I put the dialer upstairs in a bedroom near an AC outlet and phone jack and set it to silent. The SC-1000 control panel, which has the siren in it, is in a corner and can't be seen. It's very loud. If you have a remote, the panel can go just about anywhere. I have turned it on and off from outside the house. I emailed support with a minor question and they responded within a few hours.

But when we called the company to ask questions about the product, we only received one call back (when we were not home), and after we returned the call, we never heard back from them again.

Not impressed at all for Geotrax, I think it would have been better for the Little People sets."},{"rating":"2","title":"To infinite and beyooooond !!!!","review":"To wait for new Geo Trax series... some months.To deliver it at home... less than a week.To assemble it ... half hour.To see the happiest face from my child, when he saw the plane flying...

A family member got it for Christmas and I got hooked. It's unobtrusive, yet addictive. My sister said \\"At the right time of the month, this could really get to you.\\" It's not maudlin, just very heart-felt and pretty. I recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"There's no way it could be better!!!!","review":"Gorgeous sound, full and vibrant, bringing back memories of the big bands and the good old days in romantic music. This is music for lovers, words, melodies, a great voice - it has it all, and as said above - It couldn't be better. I had to go through it twice at the first setting. I already think it may be my favorite of a large collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty darn good!","review":"I've been looking forward to this album ever since I heard about it. Henry Mancini was one of the last songwriters capable of writing great melodies (along with Michel Legrand), and unfortunately there's no one who has come along to take his place. Monica Mancini has a very good voice and she doesn't get in the way of her father's wonderful songs with a lot of vocal tricks. The songs are well chosen and the album showcases some of Mancini's most haunting melodies. Patrick Williams' arrangements also sparkle.Favorite songs: From Moment to Moment and Two for the Road.I hope Monica Mancini puts out more albums, because there aren't very many good young singers out there. She's one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The fruit does not fall far from the tree !","review":"Monica Mancini performs her father's work. Usually, that is a dangerous feat to do since the talent of the child will be weighted against that of the father. And when your father is a great composer, a multi-award winner of Emmys like Henry Mancini, many would like to see whether the talent has been bestowed on the children as well. Monica Mancini, as a singer, has acquired a beautiful vocal quality and a great sense of artistry in singing her father's wonderful hits. The CD is one of my most favorites so far and I can continuously listen to her, especially during the wee hours of the morning. Monica Mancini is a compleat singer who has enamoured her audience with her beautiful performance and what better way to show off a promising singing talent than interpreting these great songs of her father ?!!!I really recommend it to the max. Great singer, great songs..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Talent is Heriditary","review":"Monica Mancini has an excellent voice, the arrangements are excellent and of course the source material by her dad is incomparable.

Yet ever since a dashing American saved her from an angry mob, Joss's thoughts had turned most impure.The son of an American Indian and an English aristocrat, Alexander Blackthorne had been sent to England for some \\"civilizing.\\" But the only lesson he cared to learn were those offered by taverns and trollops. When a marriage of convenience forced Jocelyn and Alex together, Joss knew she would need more than prayer to make a loving husband of her WICKED ANGEL.The story moves along at a fast pace and is very easy to read. It captures your attention from the first page and doesn't let go until the last. The characters are strong and likeable. It is definitely worth every penny and you won't regret reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb","review":"Dumb, noncreative stereotypes, no story, no acting, no nothing (double negative?). However, if you're an insecure rejected teen this will continue your fantasy stardom and provide the slapstick humor you never grew out of. The usual studio teen themes of alcohol, drugs, hot tubs (or pool), a few boobs and pretend sex, trashing - it's all comic book there.Four/five star reviewers came from the aforementioned demographic.Three star reviewers safely indecisive.Kudos to the studio & producers for the latest tactic to squeeze more blood (money) to not include Special Features unless you pay extra.Kudos to the studio & producers for the unimaginative copycatting of the too often used and cheap actor with handheld camera documenting vehicle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as it was supposed to be","review":"This movie failed to live up to all the hype and its delivery was sloppy.

There was nothing funny about the movie.

I didn't laugh once. A bunch of teenagers at a party and nothing really happens.I know they were going for the home filmed look, but the camera is SO shakey it makes you nauseous trying to focus.I really wish I turned this off right away, I just kept waiting for it to get good or something to happen.This just might be the worst move I have ever seen!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SuperBad","review":"No really , just watch Superbad instead.

A+ !!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugly and unfunny excuse for a \\"movie\\"","review":"I went into this movie based on strong word of mouth about how good it was and I regret spending my time and money on it. It was basically an hour and twenty minutes of unlikeable losers doing a lot of idiotic things and trying to get lucky. The main character named Costa was the most detestable person on the planet, I seriously wanted to dropkick him in the face the entire movie. The only reason why I didn't walk out was because I was hoping that he would get what he deserved in the end.

It's non-stop party flick that kept us wondering what would happen next. Definitely a movie that we will watch more than once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unless you are a Stoner --it's a WASTED DATE!","review":"Not only are the characters seemingly wasted, but so is your money unless you like inane, stoner humor, or at least something that pretends to be humor. From the early previews I thought this was some kind of sci-fi flick, you knows, kids have a party while parents are out of town and aliens land and destroy the hood. NOPE! No such luck. It's just STOOPIT! I had to spell it like that because stupid doesn't come close, plus I has t'roin' a little NY accent in there, for those of you who already watched this waste of time.

At first I was like not another first person digital film, I was expecting another cloverfield. Could I have ever been so wrong, this movie had me and the wife in stitches. The amount of destruction and mayhem cause in this movie was AWESOME!!!!!! If I was 17 I would want my party to be just like this one in the movie. It's hard to believe that this cast was there first movie ever. This movie is a definate buy on Blu Ray when it comes out. Come on June 19 get here on tomorrow, I have 5 days to go :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Teenage fun","review":"Purchased this for my teenage daughter, and we watched it together.

Better off buying the other blu ray version that has the extended cut along with a dvd copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Honestly, terrible","review":"This movie is trying very hard to be superbad. Unfortunately, the character Costa is the most annoying whiney bitch ever, and unlike Jonah Hill's character in Superbad, completely unlikeable. This is unwatchable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing every guys deam","review":"This movie was amazing especially if you can relate. If you cant or you dont have a crazy party side to you u wont enjoy it. This movie is a sit down and watch every detail from beginning to end to get the full effect.

All this in the name of \\"fun and good times.\\" Just goes to show how many people are living in the same devolving bubble.Let's hope that this bubble of our immoral zeitgeist bursts before it's too late."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie EVER!","review":"This was possibly the worst movie ever. It actually frightens me that people could be stupid enough to think up something like this. For instance Not one action that occured in this movie would be allowed to happen in real life. The plot is almost non-existant, other than the continual quest to \\"finger bang\\" a chick, and to throw a large party to become popular, there really is no plot. Quite possibly the worst part was the ending, which there is a lack of satisfaction due to the fact that the kid burned down half of his block and his parents just let him get away with it..... In short, I would rather clean the toilet than be forced to watch this movie again."},{"rating":"1","title":"another party movie.","review":"This might be ok if you cared about the characters at all. But they are annoying whiners and this flick is just another flick about teens wanting to party. Only unlike other party movies that can be sorta fun this one is about these guys wanting to be BIG SHOTS. This was a huge bomb coming from a major studio and it doesn't have much humour even as compared to the hangover. Which is just as dumb and about partying too. This one though would annoy teens even as there is NO plot really. just a extended party video or just a music video with no reason to call itself a movie, and teens avoided this movie as much as everyone else did so even they realized this one was not a movie. The blu ray looks good but it's not staying in my collection that is for sure. I did keep the hangover films though. Those are good dumb party movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well .....","review":"Hmmm, what can I say about this movie? I guess it lived up to its billing, and there's really only so much you can do with this kind of premise. Maybe I just wanted so kind of big twist, some life-altering events that really hit home.

The actual cable length, however, is only 23\\"--which means it does not stretch up onto the desk, and one must crawl underneath to plug and unplug usb devices. My parents are older, and this is a hardship for them. The hub itself works ok--one of the ports is fiddly and works only intermittently--but the short cord makes it very inconvenient.

The film stays true to this idea all the way through, and basically states that thinking in the correct way (or asking God) will garner you gifts along these three dimensions.

However, in my experience, as a very intuitive person and one that has learned to pay very close attention to the physiology (a term he never used, but is what he is talking about) of my body, I've gotten burned many times when I did not listen. Friedman confesses to having an anxiety and other disorders, and this practice he calls the Thought Exchange worked for him.

I had to fight to remain awake for the whole video, maybe it would have been better if I did go to sleep. I guess I got my money's worth, a dollar for the statement in the beginning and a dollar to reminded about the same statement in the end. I guess this video works well with most people, because psychologists have proven that most people only really listen to the beginning and ending of any instruction and miss or ignore or are distracted for the details in the middle.

Waugh's second book about the Mennyms, living ragdolls with all too human characteristics. This time the Mennyms lifeis threatened by the local government's plan to tear down the Grove for a new road. Albert Pond, a human relative of Aunt Kate, the dolls' creator, is drawn into their lives, with difficulty on both sides, and helps to preserve their secret. A lot of fun to read aloud (or silently). Waugh writes well; having been a teacher she recognises good writing, i suspect, and is a wonderful developer of character. There are a couple of moments in the plot where i feel it develops a little less strongly than it might -- Albert's interest in another, newfound, relative is one -- but the overall story is a delight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Francesca thinks this is Waugh's best book yet!","review":"I loved this book because it was a thrilling sequal to The Mennyms"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great book","review":"I think that War Torn must rate as one of the most under-appreciated books of 2003, so for anyone that does read it, they are in for a literary and historical treat. Set in both Berlin during the time of the destruction of the Berlin wall and in Mostar (Bosnia) during the civil war that divied the sity in two, War Torn is not only a well told story but it provides an interesting perspective on the civil war in Bosnia - which is something that I knew very little about. Unlike many other \\"war\\" books that take a birds eye/macro point of view, War Torn provides a very personal view of the effects of this kind of war on an individual and a family. The concurrent fall of the Berlin wall in which two sides of the city are rejoined serves as a good counterpoint to the separation of Mostar and the break up of Marta's marriage.I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense!","review":"I have to say, to my shame, that I really knew very little about the war in Bosnia, so this book was informative to me.Written in a storyline that adds fact with fiction, it catches you up into an emotionally packed adventure, that will tug at your heartstrings and prick at your conscience.In this book we are shown the impact a war has on individuals and families, but we are also given a glimpse into traditions we know nothing about; yet things we all hold sacred in our own ways. A great story bringing to light truths we should always remember, but allow ourselves to forget, least we lose our comfort zone in life.Hate,love, war, adventure all packed into one moving novel.This is a thought provoking work and one you will remember for a long time.

I really did try to get develop an interest in the book, but Marks' writing style is devoid of any flavor. His powers of description are noticeably absent, being replaced by a collection of nouns which he thinks will evoke an image of Europe. Before he starts another book I suggest he first sits down to read everything he can by Alan Furst.

They have done an excellent job and I recommend it as an alternative to DK Eyewitness and to supplement the Rick Steves' advice focused book.

Joni must love your State of Montana because she has followed up \\"The Only Thing Bluer Than His Eyes\\"(my favourite track of all time)with a superbly haunting \\"Blue Montana Moon\\",a beautiful ballad which is complimented in the smooth relaxation stakes by an equally excellent \\"Long Hard Ride\\".

The other reasons are that they are sung by a lady who has a great voice & alot of enthusiasm, & the songs are just good music - they are not over-produced & the musicians are playing traditional country music instruments; no synthesizers or wailing elctric guitars.

Braindoll are the only group to touch upon the soul of that sound, to bring such complex and variety of emotions to the fore with their music.

The harness is so easy to adjust and buckle. All you do is turn the knob to raise and lower the harness, no more re-threading thru the back! It fits great in both my big and compact cars, neither of which have LATCH. All the cushy comforts of this seat are great, but when the paramedic was installing it and telling me all the ways Britax tests their seats that other mfgs don't, I was really glad I'd spent the extra $$$.

We have 3 Britax car seats. I purchased the Wizard for my 6 month old because of the \\"improved side-impact protection\\". While I am certain my child would be very protected in the event of a collision, we will never be able to see because he won't sit in the seat for more than 10 seconds. The headrest wraps completely around the sides of the head, which not only prevents movement, it prevents him from seeing anything that is not directly in front of him.

The adjustments are super-easy and it's easy to get baby into and out of the seat.I'm giving it only 4 stars because it is difficult to get it to the full 45 degree angle that is required when it is rear-facing.

This is not because i am a security-guru (really i'm not) , it is because of the bad writing style. Sometimes it isn't really clear what the writer wants to say with the lessons and if he takes the reader serious.Another Problem with this book, it is full of so called \\"considerations\\" and \\"guidelines\\" instead of a serious, stong security training (most of them are really useless because they are so obvious that you know those even without the book).I strongly recommend to do not use this Book for 70-298 Training, even if you are a fan of the MSPress series.

Overall, the book is a review of what I know from the core MCSE tests and a double-check on my security common sense.On the other hand - I can't say how it could be written better, Security is a learned skill, and taught best in the wild. Therefore I recommend this book - at a minimum you will get an impressive asterisk next to your MCSE on your resume and at best you'll get an insight into security on a Windows network."},{"rating":"1","title":"I bought all the MS Press Books for self-study, but this....","review":"To all, this is my last exam for MCSE status.

The author spends a entire chapters speaking in generalities and leaves how to design security and remediate security risks to your own judgment.Wait, I take some of that back. The author does use some specification in the book and refers to all administrators, users and clients as female.

The main character of this book is Charlie Bone. He is a boy that can talk to the people in painting or photographs. He always wants to help people even if it gets him into trouble. In this story he and his friends find out that there is an invisible boy in their school and they try to rescue him. They run into many dangers from people who want to keep the invisible boy.I thought this was a great book. It definitely is a fantasy kind of story. The people who enjoy reading about magic and amazing powers would certainly like this book. I would like to read another book by this author because I love fantasy stuff and there are other books that follow this one. This is the third book in the Charlie Bone series. I would absolutely recommend this book to fantasy adventure lovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't Put It Down!!!","review":"This book was a really interesting book. When I went to my school fair, and saw this book on the shelf, I just knew I had to buy it. After I read the first two (which I finished in a day) I knew this one would be equally as good. I was right. I couldn't put it down and finished the book in a day. I read til 11 o'clock at night, it was that good.This book is about a boy, Charlie Bone, and his friends and how they find an invisible boy in the attic, Ollie Sparks. A shape-shifter, Yolanda Yewbeam, takes the form of a 12-year-old-girl named Belle. She tries to stop Charlie Bone and his friends from rescuing Ollie Sparks.If you have not read the first two books- Midnight for Chanrlie Bone, and Charlie BOne and the Time-Twister- you should read those books before reading this one. OTherwise, you will be a bit clueless about some of the concepts and people in this book. For fans of Harry Potter, you should DEFINITELY read this book and these series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zep has so many hits, some had to be excluded.","review":"I'm a BIG Led Zeppelin fan and the songs on this album are all worthy Zeppelin hits. No one buying this album should be disappointed because the songs are all great and they sound much better now that they're remastered. The only thing is that Led Zeppelin had so many good songs on their albums, it is impossible to include them all on one cd. Why are there only 2 songs from the 2nd and 3rd albums? Why were songs like Heartbreaker, The Lemon Song and Celebration Day left off? If you want the full Led Zeppelin experience, buy the original albums (the 4 cd box set is good too). If you're only looking for a taste of some of Led Zeppelin's best earlier work, this is a great album. By the way, if you're getting this for Stairway To Heaven alone, you'll be surprised that Led Zeppelin's other songs are great too and sometimes better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Early Days: Has it all! well almost","review":"This single CD is a compliment to anyones collection. With songs such as Black Dog, Dazed and Confused, and the well-known Stairway to Heaven. Just toss it in your player and you get over an hour of pure Led Zeppelin. However it is lacking some of the deeper tracks which happen to be my favorite. I have all of the released Zeppelin albums, but lately I've been using this CD more. Its just so easy to toss it in and get a variaty of their sound. My opinion is that if you're a hardcore Zeppelin fan like myself than you will love it.

Everything Zeppelin recorded was good, and each original album stands alone. There's already 2 boxed sets and a 2 disc greatest hits set (Remasters) and now this waste.

Where are such hits like Heartbreaker and Celebration Day? It is impossible to make a greatest hits album for Zeppelin because all eight of the studio albums are greatest hits of their own.

It has a gap of more than an inch where the blue bucket sits that the lid does not cover. Any little rainshower and the sand is wet.

But then I saw this one and agreed to let my son have it for his 4th birthday. I just knew what a hit it would be since my two boys (4 & 2) just love playing construction site in the dirt. I should have stuck with my first instinct. The lid doesn't fit well, so needless to say there is often rain water in it- which is a breeding ground for mold, algae, and mosquitos. The digger is also awkward to use. I spend more time removing the water and wet sand than the amount of time my kids actually get to play with it. This toy has real potential but with the poor design it is a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Disappointment!!","review":"My kids are really into construction, so I was excited to get this sandbox for them. I was very disappointed to find out that the lid does not fit well and there is constantly water in the sandbox.

I would stick with the Turtle Sandbox, the kids seem to have more fun and it is less maintenance."},{"rating":"1","title":"a little tikes dissapointment","review":"When I saw the ad for this sandbox I decided that my 2 year old son had to have it. Boy was I wrong. The box itself retains water when it rains, I had to drill holes in the bottom so the water could drain. As a result there is wet sand most of the time. The crane is difficult to work for kids of any age. My kids ended up playing in the neighbors turtle sandbox."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!","review":"My business partner and I purchased this sandbox for our small pre-school. Alright..we admit it, we were dazzled by that cool crane...however, it is incredibly difficult to use. The kids spend more time sitting on it than digging with it. The cover does not do anything to keep water out, although it has provided us with a lovely science project as the kids have been able to see the sand turn a variety of colors from the algae and mold growing in it!(Hence the high rating for educational value!:)A phone call to Little Tykes proved a waste of time and energy! Thank God for the reasonable people at Toys r Us in Bellingham, Ma. who helped us out!Again....DO NOT BUY THIS.....a far better value and product is the Step 2 sandbox.

The bucket did crack as stated in previous reviews, although Little Tikes supposedly fixed this and made it stronger.

If you use it, wear a hard hat!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sandbox Fun","review":"My 4-year-old is a sandbox nut and I wanted to buy only one that he could grow with. This sandbox is it. Pouring rain all day did not bother it - all the sand and toys inside stayed dry. The lid works fine, I wish it were sturdier to support heavier children but then the lid would likely be too heavy for one adult to put on.

Even with the lid on the box, pushed down tightly, there is no way to keep rain water out of the box. I have had to replace the sand several times because when it would rain there would be alot of standing water, which in turn would mold the sand. Also my son which is 3 cannot operate the excavator arm and gets aggrivated.

Our son absolutely loves trucks and dump trucks, so this was a huge hit with him. We didn't even put the crane on for the first year. We are going to save it until he is older and can work one properly. Which will only make it even more fun when he sees the addition!"},{"rating":"2","title":"not a fair value","review":"The sand box is great fun and the attached toys are a nice idea but really get in the way when not in use.

Even with the lid on rain water was still able to get inside. So everytime it would rain we would have to go out and buy more bags of sand because the sand would get ruined. We got this for my son when he was 4 and was never able to use the digger. My husband and I even had a difficult time using it. Eventually with little use the handle that controlled the digger broke off. Great!! This sandbox should have been recalled for many many reasons. So my advice buy a different sandbox!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Construction Sand Box","review":"We have the new construction sand box and it has been a huge disappointment.

The company should consider a larger version of the same thing.

I called little tikes several times and spoke with several different customer service reps and supervisors. Originally, they would only give me replacement toys (EXCLUDING OTHER SANDBOXES) worth the purchase price of the sandbox. The replacement toys not only COULDN'T be sandboxes, but they also couldn't be larger \\"truck ship\\" toys. After much complaining, they finally agreed to replace the sanbox with their dinosaur sandbox as well as other toys of my choice totalling the original purchase price.

This is a terrible design and should be pulled off the market..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Would be fun, but rain leaks in","review":"Poor design allows rain to leak in around the edges so although my 2 year old son and 5 year old daughter love it, they've only been able to play with it twice in a month. It takes 5 - 6 fifty pound bags of sand - and that doesn't dry out quickly. You have to put it someplace where it will always be out of the rain - and since its BIG, and too heavy to move much - that's not easy. Fun, but not flexible and not useable most of the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not made like they used to...","review":"Gee, I guess we should have just kept the Little Tikes Turtle Sandbox! At least rain water didn't leak into it! Little Tikes says the cover lid is \\"only to keep leaves out\\". I guess if the designers would have constructed the bucket area to keep water out instead of Little Tikes telling the customer to drill drain holes into the sandbox and fashion their own gasket to keep the water out, the sandbox would have been a better toy. If you get this and plan to put it outside (where a sandbox is supposed to be), you'd better 1) have tools to modify it 2) buy a vinyl cover 3) Buy sand all the time because the wet sand from rain water really smells and is unsanitary 4) Pray it never rains where you live."},{"rating":"1","title":"Welcome mat for germs","review":"I agree with all the people who have given this sandbox a poor review. I have tried everything to get it to NOT collect water and it doesn't work. I have also owned the turtle sandbox as well and both of them collect water and things grow in there that I can not identify. Dont waste your money. You will be so disappointed. If anyone should ever find a worthwile sandbox please share! Kids love to play in sandboxes and mind did too. Unfortunately they spent more time crying because I wouldnt let them inside the swamp than they did playing in it. If you live in a nice dry climate then you are lucky yours might have a longer life.

We went online to search, we then showed him a few pictures of Little Tikes sand box's. Within a few minutes he picked this one hands down. We now have it in our yard we asked him what he liked about it, he said the crane and how you can scoop the sand & move it around he also said that, he liked how the sandbox extended and he has a place to drive all his truck on. For the money it is worth it, it is very durable, and it is fun. I also like that, when you are done you can cover it up and not have to worry about animals getting into the sand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Construction Sandbox","review":"This sandbox is great when the kids can play in it.

Ours is always wet and gets moldy as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly designed sandbox","review":"We were very excited to buy this sandbox for our son over a year ago. Unfortunately we spend all of our time getting water out and other debris that gets into it. My son has enjoyed the sandbox when it is cleaned up and uses the digger and dumper well on it. My main complaint is that the lid does not fit very well. I emailed the company and they told me to drill two holes under the blue bucket to allow water to drain and not go into the sandbox. We have tried this and it still does not do a very good job. It is very misleading to have a lid on it like many other sandboxes, yet it is useless. We have finally talked our son into giving it up for another plain one, just to keep it clean and dry. I am disappointed that the company has not redesigned this sandbox to make it a joy to have instead of a nightmare."},{"rating":"1","title":"no so great","review":"Constantly full of rain water, no drain plug.

The blue scoop part comes out easily and all the sand starts falling out because the blue scoop is part of the wall. The lid that is supposed to convert into part of the fun cannot hold up a toy truck and espcially not a child - it just collapses. I was really disappointed in Little Tikes with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY Disappointed","review":"I bought this last summer for my two young grandsons, 18 months and 3 who live in North Carolina and generally have more sun than rain. One rain and the sand was a swamp mixed with outside dirt and leaves. It was dumped and refilled and a few weeks later another rain swamped it again. It sits on the high side of the yard and under a tree. The lid is fairly useless and quite flimsy for any trucks to be driven on it and the crane is much too stiff for the 3-year-old to use so both boys are quite frustrated with this expensive toy. I waited to see if the interest in this sandbox would pick up but they have given up on it. Plus we threw away the sandbox they had. Save your money. Buy a better made sandbox and IF you want them to have a sit on crane buy one of the $45-$55 ones- They are 1/4 of the cost, easier to use, and last much longer.Save your money,Save your money, Save you money.We buy our grandsons many expensive toys - this is one to take a pass on."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste...","review":"I was very excited to see this sandbox, and went to great lengths to find one for my 2 boys last summer. I was very disappointed that not only does the lid not keep the rain and grass clippings out (which results in filthy, ruined sand in no time at all) several of the parts on the scoop broke over the winter. This was not from overuse, as the kids hardly touch it - which is fine with me given the condition of the sand. I e-mailed Little Tikes and was quickly replied to with a promise of replacement parts - much time has passed and the parts aren't here."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"Fills with water and its a battle to keep sand from being moldy or algae covered.

I almost went to sleep. I think the general weight of having the London Symphony and also all of the family members at this 80th birthday celebration performance, gets in the way of what Brubeck does best: Straight Ahead Jazz Improvisation on piano. A far better bout in a symphonic setting was done with Leonard Bernstein and the New York Philharmonic along with the Dave Brubeck quartet in a beautiful blending written and scored by Dave Brubeck's talented Brother, Howard. Sadly, the Bernstein/Brubeck collaboration is not available on recording for some unknown reason - probably licensing permissions I would guess.I would recommend that the listener take the money he/she would invest in this particular CD and invest it in the 'Carnegie Hall' 2 CD set for a clearer hearing of Dave Brubeck doing what he does best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get the information that your after!","review":"I have been trying to get an idea of what long-lived, pest-free tree options I have in Central Florida and this is the only book I've found yet that tells me.

My sex life was gone because I was so worried. I was prescribed all types of antibiotics. At one point the doc thought it was from my bc pills (femcon). Then I was OK for a while. Then I got sick with a sinus infection and prescribed antibiotics which caused a yeast infection which meant more antibiotics. I've tried to eat more yogurt. That doesn't work.

It is a combination of several antifungals in one pill. Initially you think that's a good thing, but according to the research Candida adapts to whatever antifungal you're taking. So if you're taking garlic supplements for two months, the Candida adapts to it and the garlic eventually starts feeding the Candida. You're supposed take garlic a few days then switch to another antifungal..and keep rotating. This way the Candida isn't able to adapt. I didn't read about this until I had already started taking it. Save your money and just use coconut oil--that's the one antifungal that Candida can't adapt to. Not to mention it's SUPER healthy and good for cholesterol (yes I said GOOD for cholesterol!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Minimizes Bloating","review":"I take 2 every morning and ran out a week ago and the bloating feeling is back.

I realized this was due to an overproduction of yeast. I decided to changed my diet. Within 2 weeks my hair has started to grow back. I also have athletes foot and now experience less itching.Excess Sugar is the culprit.

This toy has a feature that simulates the revving of a racecar engine. It's supposed to rev when you release the cars or when you pull the release in the opposite direction. However, at any given time (day or night) the revving of racecars can be heard. The least little bump to the toy, slightest breeze in the air or walking across the floor can set the thing off. I have to store this toy in our den downstairs or it will wake up the entire house at night. If Fisher Price hadn't designed it in such a sensitive manner, it would be a great toy; but it is EXTREMELY ANNOYING.

When he tried using any of his hundred matchbox cars, we found that most of them are too big to race down the track. So if you only use the two cars that came with it, it's great. Also, the race sounds are very annoying (loud) and it's touchy- if you just pick it up to move it, it makes noise- even if you don't tip the top up. This went to Goodwill less than a month after he got it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lot's of fun for toddlers","review":"I gave this to my 2 yr old grandson for his birthday and he didn't want to stop playing with it.

A prog band from Italy. The same country that gave the world Banco, PFM, Locanda Delle Fate, Le Orme, etc. Upon buying this CD, one expects to hear more of what Italy is famous for, such as lush classical passages and long instrumental breaks, right? WRONG. First of all, the music on this CD is devoid of any passion whatsoever, and just sounds like they are going through the motions. Second, the rhythm section DOES NOT WORK, period. The bass and drums plod through every song, ruining the music itself, sometimes by dragging the song down tempo wise, and other times just not hitting the notes in sync.

How can this watch claim to be an Ironman Triathlon watch when it can't even go in the water and get wet?!!!!This happened to me twice on the exact same make and model of watch, so I would DEFINATELY NOT RECOMMEND THIS WATCH TO ANYONE!!!

It pulled away from the watch where the two upper buttons are located. The watch could be hooked back into the strap; but the strap remained loose and the upper part of the watch separated from it frequently.

Every watch from this line has lasted for a minimum of 3 years before the strap breaks or I misplace it. I have small hands and wrists, so was excited about the slimmer look and thrilled with the standard Timex functions I'm so familiar with: the back-light, 50 lap recall, a daily alarm, and water resistance. I have a moderately active job, so I expected the inevitable scratches on the face of the watch, and the band fit snugly on my wrist without cutting off circulation or getting in the way of my daily activities. What I did not expect was the fact that the face started fogging up after 5 months. Soon after, the strap and the center piece separated, and no amount of super glue could put them back together with any satisfaction. I absolutely recommend Timex, but the new \\"Sleek\\" design isn't a good choice out of the product line."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great watch","review":"Love it!

The function is really easy to use, and the lap button big and easy to press in the middle of a run. I would even go so far as to say that this watch has helped me to become a better runner.As for the color, I feel it is the very similar to what the picture indicates, mine is nowhere close to being purple.My only complaint would be that the watch band gets a little sticky when I sweat during a run, but that is to be expected, and really doesn't bother me too much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Watch!","review":"Originally, I wanted this watch to count laps. But now, my favorite feature is the interval timer. (I didn't even know what it was for when I first got the watch.) For example, as a new runner, I would set the first timer to run for two minutes, then the second timer to walk for one. As I progressed, I increased the running time. I also use the interval timers for strength training. I give myself one minute for the \\"weight move\\", then a 15 second rest. This keeps my heart rate up for the entire circuit. With the timing, I can keep the pace up instead of slowing down as I tire out.The watch is a little complicated to figure out at first, but don't be overwhelmed. You will get onto it and be \\"direction free\\" in no time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not water resistant","review":"This watch has worked well for me as a running watch for about 6 months, but I agree with those who said that it's not water resistant.

The functions are great, and I love the three different alarms. A few weeks ago, the band started separating from the main piece. At this time, the band is entirely off one side, and partially off the other. It was a great watch while it lasted - I liked the sleekness, plus the slider on the band was a great feature.

The first time this happened it died after about 8 months and I thought it was just a fluke. So I bought this same watch again and it died on me in less than 6 months this time after being exposed to water. I used to think timex ironman triathlon watches were great because I got a black one just like this 5 years ago with the same exact functions and it actually was water proof.

Yesterday I went for a casual swim, and there was the condensation under the face again. About an hour later the watch totally died. Not much for an Ironman watch- doesn't that event include a swim? My casio that I had as a kid was tougher than this watch.

The plot is great - someone being invited to dinner with Jesus, and the author did a great job of painting a word picture of what kind of conversation might occur in that setting.This book wasn't suspenseful in the way suspense/mystery books are, but it did keep me turning the pages to keep up with the conversation as fast as I could read. This is a very unique book. Enjoyable and entertaining, but it also makes the reader think. I would recommend it for anyone to read - the Christian who is firm in their walk, the struggling Christian, and the non-Christian."},{"rating":"1","title":"all about the straw man","review":"I can't believe people are saying \\"this is the best book I've read all year!\\" I hate to think what else they must be reading. This book is simply a rehashing of everything Josh McDowell has been saying for the last 30 years, placed in the context of a \\"fictional\\" tale that reads like a bad morality play. In fact, having read too much McDowell and Norm Geisler, I could pretty much predict the plot (hmm. . .right about now we ought to get to the trilemma (page turn) yep! There it is!) The conversations are stilted and forced, setting up all sorts of straw men in order to knock them over. For the Christian, it gives you a great \\"I knew I was right!\\" If I was a true skeptic with half a brain, I would recognize logical fallacy after logical fallacy and find nothing to convince me.So it's nice, trite tale. Not the worst book ever written, but certainly nothing deserving the sales and discussion it is receiving."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my money back!","review":"Simplistic and poorly constructed. This book is offensive to other religions and those who question the narrow confines of a twisted version of Christianity that is worryingly popular at this time. I was actually shocked at the weakness of the arguments and very surprised that the author did not see their obvious faults. I was expecting a book that would offer a refreshing take on Christianity, with factual and honest information. I think this would turn many away from Christianity. It is sad how the basic truths of this religion have been distorted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible.","review":"This is the only book I've read, and bought for various friends and family.

The thought is intriguing, a dinner with Jesus. Hmmm. David Gregory unfurls a story set in an Italian restaurant that ends up being mostly dialogue. But fascinating dialogue. Nick is skeptical, sarcastic, angry and not looking for anything even resembling church. He expects that this invitation is a practical joke and spends a portion of the dinner date scanning for his work buddies. But as Nick and \\"Jesus\\" talk, Nick begins to think.This is a very quick and entertaining read. One that might just make you ponder some of the truths shared within. Nick is a scientist so much of what is shared is geared toward a scientific or logical mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dinner with a Pefect Stranger","review":"A lovely book to be read and then shared with your friends. Given to me by a neighbor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"Somebody recommended this book to me, claiming that it would \\"change my life\\". After reading this thing I feel a bit insulted by the suggestion that the few deeply flawed arguments it contains would persuade me. The comparison to a Chick Tract is apt, the protagonist is a credulous idiot who is blown away by the most flimsy apologetics, and in the end he \\"finds god\\". This, like so many other books of its kind, is not meant to persuade anyone, but to re-enforce the beliefs that a majority its readers already hold. If , like me, you are an atheist looking for a good challenge to your worldview, you needn't bother with this tripe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superficial Pablum","review":"This is one of the most superficial and trite books I have ever read. The book is condescending and juvenile in its arguments. It lacks any sort of analytic integrity.

Christianity is, for the most part, internally consistent so when it answers its own questions internally, it works, which is the premise upon which this book is written. It is unlikely that this book would sway any logical skeptic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting concept marred by flawed execution","review":"The concept was interesting.

The writing is competent, but there's no real story. This is just another evangelical anti-intellectual sermon. People of faith can do better than this.What puzzles me is the author marquees his academic credentials, but his content rarely rises above Sunday school quality. It's just straw men and straw arguments, which the character of \\"Jesus\\" here backhandedly knocks down with a smugness that is extremely unappealing. The author's oversimplification of other religions is ludicrous.Think how much more interesting the dialogue would be if this \\"Jesus\\" could have dinner with the Dalai Lama, Thich Nhat Hanh, Rabbi Harold Kushner, Richard Dawkins, or even non-evangelical Christian thinkers like Karen Armstrong and Marcus Borg...But the intent here was never intellectual honesty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chick Track in Novel Form","review":"I was intrigued by the idea of a conversation with Jesus. I approached the novel knowing that it was work of Christian evangelism, but I was prepared to enjoy it. This sort of thing can be well done, and from the outset I thought it might be. Jesus is introduced as an unassuming, tender, and good-humored man, while Nick is the typical human. Unfortunately, the book's story does not last long: it soon turns into an author tract, and \\"Nick\\" becomes nothing more than a sock puppet. \\"Jesus\\" does a good job of portraying a superficially cohesive vision of Christianity, but it is one that does not stand to scrutiny. The conversation quickly becomes one-sided and shallow, doing an injustice to both Christianity by rendering it this way and to the many counter-ideas misrepresented as as straw-men. It looked to be a meaty read, but all I found was distasteful gristle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dinner with a Perfect Stranger by David George","review":"Easy read.

I never expect those to pack much punch. I gave it a shot and was very impressed.I felt like I was sitting alongside main character, Nick Cominsky and Jesus and eavesdropping on their conversation.

I found it to be a delightful junket into what could happen if I met up with the Messiah at His invitation! I really got the sense of anticipation as the two had dinner together. The various parts of the meal intertwined with the deep conversation helped the guest absorb the questions and answers from Jesus. I like to think that Jesus would make sure his guest was comfortable and could talk and listen at his own pace. That's Heavenly Hospitality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Little Read","review":"It didn't take me very long at all to finish this short story about a man who finds himself having dinner with Jesus Christ, the Son of God.

The premise behind the book is that Nick Cominsky gets an invitation to dine with Jesus. At first, he believes it is a practical joke from friends but soon learns that it is not. Nick gets to dine and speak with Jesus and ask many questions he has been having. In the end, the questions that Nick asks are similar to what most of us have had or still wonder about. For me, the book gave a new perspective on many of the topics discussed, including different religions, why we suffer, etc. The book is well written and at least for me helped to strengthen my Christian Faith. I have already purchased the second installment by Gregory, A Day with A Perfect Stranger, which focuses on Nick's wife Mattie. I am looking forward to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"David Gregory Does Great Work!","review":"A librarian friend of mine recommended the book.

This book did confirm one thing that a Christian friend said, but other then that the book is fiction. I think that Gregory is a good storyteller, but I certainly would not consider this book a book to put next to my other books of religion. I will put it next to the DaVinci Code and believe I read a great fiction and nothing more.I do want to thank D. Washington for the review and biblical reference and good viewpoint for those who would consider this book more then fiction. I would like to thank Enchanted One for the review also.If this book were a \`religious' book I would give it one star, (less if I could), but I am seeing this book as a fiction, so I will give it two or three stars for a fiction. Two stars for the lack of character depth, but three for a good idea.I like a good a fiction and mystery as much as the next fiction and mystery lover does."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dinner With A Perfect Stranger","review":"Shallow, simplistic and mean-spirited best describe the tone of this book. It seems to have been written to appeal to the already fervent Christian with the ultimate goal to line the author's pockets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enlightening","review":"A coworker loaned me the book. The book presents Jesus in a non-threatening way. Jesus cares for the protagonist in a personal way as he explains who he is and why he is the most important person in history. Jesus rebuts a few attacks related to other religions and not forcing himself on us. All this through a dinner conversation. In the end, the book is a good evangelistic tool that presents Jesus in his fullness, but more of a loving warm fuzzy than a judgmental hammer. I liked it so much that I ordered five copies to give away to searching friends.Basically, a lite read as well. And the author has much the same gift that Rick Warren shows in \\"Purpose Driven Life\\", in that he takes complicated principles and simplifies them down to easy-to-understand truths without any dilution of meaning. You'll love it, whether you are a Christian (any denomination) or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Perfect Book","review":"I received this book as a gift and enjoyed it so much that I bought it to give to my daughter-in-law.

A peculiar little book that did nothing for my faith. I want something that stretches or even challenges. This appeared to be narrow, party propaganda. Perhaps, however, this is for someone who has never heard of Christianity. I am also troubled at the numbers who raved about this book.

Idiot manufacturers need to engineer a speed reducer. I am careful to minimize hitting hard edges with the whip line. Where the whip line exits the trimmer head, I have filed a smooth bevel/radius to remove any corner/edge, because any sharp corner will nick the hardish plastic whip line and begin a fatigue crack with subsequent much shorted life. With these techniques, I normally replace the whip lines after a good duration of use due to wearing down from the tip, as it should be. Have never had one separate from the brass ferrule.

A good read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good method for making buyers feel more comfortable","review":"When I was taking teaching courses, we learned the best way to teach was by making the students \\"teach themselves\\" through asking simple questions and having students arrive at their own conclusions. It was called \\"guided learning\\". The same principle is used in this form of selling which is great for at least two reasons. First- Everybody likes a choice. Nobody wants to be told what they have to do, and be locked in a corner. Here, you ask questions which sort of leave the choices up to the buyer and so #2- he feels more satisfied about doing business with you. I HAVE been to certain places for example, calling to inquire about buying a car, where I now know the salesman was TRYING to use this method. However I found his questions were canned.. not listening and asking and trying to steer me towards an unsuitable car when I had my own reasons for not wanting that one. A short but good book overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the TeleSelling Professional","review":"While I found this book helpful in the general sense of the word, it was aimed solely at the \\"outside\\" sales rep who sees his/her customer face-to-face. It provided good reminders for seasoned sales reps, but wasn't revolutionary in it's ideas of selling. It was a short read - no more than 4-5 hours. It demonstrated very good closing tactics and objection handling, but all of this is after you make contact. It didn't explain how to get past the secretary screen, how to get the appointment or even how to find out who the decision maker is. Most of the sale, if not all of it, is done over the phone and that was completely overlooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect for pie","review":"the dish is great for pies and even just baking casseroles in. it is much deeper than i thought it would be, and if you are using pre-made pie crusts like the pillsbury kind, it isnt quite enough to fit the dish. some stretching may be required, but it all tastes good in the end. its a pretty dish and was a big hit at both my family's and my boyfriend's family's respective thanksgivings."},{"rating":"2","title":"12 inch Le Grand Pie Dish","review":"This is a superb kitchen essential.

The album is well put together and it's one of those albums that you want to listen to again and again.Standout songs are Ocean's Rise, Universal and Black token. To sum this all up, really, this album is relaxing, of course, and the songs are singable (or try to anyway)and catchy and it makes you just feel damn good after listening to it.Quite entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"melodic blackmetal","review":"This deffintaly black metal, but mostly smooth.

It is not only a good read, but it will pull you in visually and emotionally as well. It is a series of short stories all about characters in different situations, family structures, and lifestyles that are in a state of crisis in their day to day lives.How these people handle their problems, and relate to those around them is all too familiar in many ways on an emotional level, but as individuals they are unique and the author stays true to her characters, letting them handle these situations in realistic ways, like real people do.All the main characters are heros because they survive the crisis in their own ways and in doing so make you feel uplifted because you are not alone out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crisis Mode a great book","review":"This was a very good read.

This collection has allowed me to accomplish that. This set showcases the vast talent of these men and from time to time, gives a peek behind the curtain of the finished recordings.My only criticism of the collection is that several secular songs (certainly not the best of those that Sam Cooke recorded) are tossed into the middle of one of the disks, throwing off the feel and flow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Completists please note...","review":"This is not quite the complete Sam Cooke at Specialty -- it does not include the tantalising bonus track on the \\"2 Sides\\" album.Having said that, it does include the best work done by the greatest soul/gospel singer bar none.

Respect due.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"IF I COULD SING LIKE THAT AT 19 I\\"D BE FAMOUS","review":"You could see how Sam Cooke became a major star in music and the inventor of soul music (Ray Charles also gets props for that).

Not only was he the greatest Soul singer, He was definetly one of the top 5 gospel singers of all time. To put it simple. SAM COOKE ROCKS!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential Collection....But what's with the pricing?!","review":"This wonderful collection showcases the legendary Sam Cooke while he was in the process of discovering the style he would soon change pop music history with. The brilliance of the listening experience, in my opinion, happens in the details. Listen to the way that Sam instinctually fills in the pockets of the songs, with the rest of the Soul Stirrers providing a beautiful, consistent back-drop. Even when Sam is not the lead vocalist, his ability to turn a phrase and ornament a melody is uncanny. Again, the real treats are in the details.But what's with Amazon's price changes? I have borrowed this collection from friends and libraries for so long that I finally decided to buy it for myself, but the price keeps jumping from the very reasonable $19.99, to the not so reasonable current price of $29.99. Granted, $30 is pretty standard for a box set, but what I'm confused about is the price fluctuation.

Given the standard size type and almost total lack of pictures or feature boxes, the reader gets a LOT of info. It can be difficult to trudge through but it's a good resource.One thing that would make this book better (though substantially longer) is introductory chapters explaining the characteristics of the three major types of countries.

I'm serious! 16 whole double sides have been devoted to the words 'Chapter 1', 'Chapter 2' and so on. And the few pages that remain for content dish out such archaic advice as joining email exchange programs and having digital signatures in your emails. Just another book cashing in (or at least trying to) on the fact that there are still enough people out there in awe of the web."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even if you think you know it all... you can learn more","review":"Keeping it short, I believe the information in this book is invaluable. I think anyone in business for themselves should take a look at what Benum has to say about Self Promotion. I've been a web professional for many years now, and a decent amount of what I read, I had already known about. However, there is a bountiful amount of ideas and information within the pages of this book that really opened my eyes to better promotion. You owe it to yourself to check it out. No matter how good you are at marketing yourself, you can be better. This book shows you how."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Next Arrest","review":"La Ley is back armed with their new record \\"UNO\\". This CD is a prime example of true Latin rock. La Ley's hit song \\"Aqui\\" is a true rythmic tune. Beto Cueva's vocals are uuparallel. It is truly different from their past CD \\"Vertigo\\". This is more digestible, and has excellent rythyms."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Beethoven from Furtwaengler. (So what else is new?)","review":"This Beethoven Fourth is the live concert counterpart of the famous 1943 radio broadcast version, previously issued on DG Lp's. Comparing the two, this one has much more drive and impulse. Still, I have a slight preference for the broadcast version (also on Opus Kura), for its incomparable lyric grace and lighter-than-air textures. But this one is very treasurable. The Violin Concerto, with Roehn, is all passion and fire; I don't remember having been as impressed with this performance when I first heard it on DG. The sound of this CD, especially in the Violin Concerto, is miraculous in its clarity and impact. Furtwaengler remains the greatest Beethoven conductor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Egg Poacher","review":"Had a old egg poacher that finally gave away. Found this one and purchased as soon as i could.

Already the finish is coming off the bottom of the skillet. It is coated with a very thin layer of nonstick coating, which is not durable at all and not high quality. I have always washed it by hand, not in the dishwasher, so it hasn't been exposed to harsh conditions, other than boiling water on the stovetop.

It worked great for poaching eggs (and scallops) evenly. After about two years the paint started to peel off inside the cups and the lid started to rust.

I do not recommend this poacher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bottom peeling and rusting after using twice","review":"I love that this poaches eggs in 4 minutes and that the eggs come out with ease. HOWEVER, I used the skillet part to brown ground beef twice and eraser size holes appeared in the bottom. Thought I would just stick to boiling water and poaching eggs, but now the bottom is all rusty. Time to toss this out. I've had it about a month and used it about twice a week.

I probably over tightened it when originally installing it but it did not fit snugly against the pan with the metal spacer clip without wiggle unless tightened (or in my case, most likely over tightened). The poacher knob gets too hot to grasp with anything but tongs. It would be better if the lid were clear glass? The non-stick coating is good. The overall pan weight is good. It would be better if the poacher steam holes were slots so it could be picked up and handled with a fork.

There is a lot to take in if you are using it as study material for the MCSE exam. I felt the information could be better organised as it gives you information on a particular topic and then a few pages later on it gives even more detailed information on the same subject, why not keep it all together?

Mencken, gone for almost half a century, shines again in vintage newspaper columns that are just as relevant now as ever. In this day and age, almost 80 years after Scopes, when it's barely legal to teach actual science in Kansas classrooms, Mencken shows what intelligent folks have known about him all along: that he was decades ahead of his time.What would he have had to say about extremist militant theocracies like the Taliban? Or about so-called \\"Intelligent Design\\" creationist theories? Or about science textbook \\"disclaimers\\" in Mississippi schools, Trinity Broadcasting, the \\"Left Behind\\" series, the Moral Majority, and the Psychic Network?

As it is, Mencken offers nothing to the intellectual study of religion and philosophy except for an eloquent way to say he \\"doesn't like it.\\" None the less, it would appear from the reviews of others that if you agree with Mencken's athiest world-view, you will indeed enjoy having him fuel you fire. For me, I like a little more philosophy and a little less rhetoric."},{"rating":"2","title":"Undergrounded or underrated","review":"Taking off is one of those movies which, for unknown and obscure reasons, disappeared from the broadcast scene despite their high potential to become \\"Cult movie\\". The story is nothing uncommon, but certainly well represents the athmosphere of the time and portraits a typical cultural/social issue of the '70s. The soundtrack is also enjoyable and songs like Where even horses have wings deserved better backup than that granted by the media when the movie was first distributed. To those who loved and still consider films like Easy Rider, Zabriskie Point and Jesus Christ Superstar worth having and watching as testimony of an era, I suggest the viewing of this movie too: it serves the purpose to recall memories of an era and reminds us (45+) that once we too had communication difficulties with the \\"grown-ups\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Andrew Mullenax's thoughts on Helloween","review":"I think that this is a very good example of rock and instrumental.

Well i got more today and i was sorely disappointed. It's not a bad album, but a huge step down. They want to get on the radio and they want to be popular. It's obvious. They now sound like every other straightforward, modern rock Christian band out there. If you like Gin Blossoms, Third Eye Blind and bands of that nature, you will love this.

She was not the first to find the papers on Gypsy Nazi genocide.When husband Amis was professor at Manchester did he enforce university rules about plagiarism?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sladerous book","review":"Reading this book I had a sensation that can be well described by the words of the author when she stumbled on a pair of bare-assed middle-aged man in Warsaw. \\"I leapt back, stupidly gasping eek like I'd come upon a large rat\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"the success of this work is the dialogue initiate by it","review":"If you view the comments here by those who read the book you can see that the significance of \\"Bury Me Standing\\" lies in the discourse it has evoked. To those who judge the book and find fault, your comments indicate that you have knowledge about this subject we all should be made aware of. Write your own story. And to those who enjoyed this work and learned about a culture they may not be from, your positive response even from a possibly biased or flawed work contributes toward a communal empathy any human should have for other disenfranchised people. The story here is not the writer, or the prose, or proper translation; the story is that this diasporic culture exists among us and trying to recognize them is a valuable endeavor. I would recommend this to those who are not turned-off by a descriptive rather than narrative style and for people who are interested in a few facets of the Gypsy diaspora."},{"rating":"1","title":"never got the book","review":"never got the book but the cost of the book was taken out of my account. So i feel cheated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fonseca only creates more myths","review":"The book is only another example of the wide spread myth about the Gypsies: not only that the author obviously lacks more \\"academic\\" information about the ethnic group but she cannot speak a word of the language either. It is also surprising that Fonseca picks the Eastern Europe to discover the \\"real life of the Gypsies\\" completely ignoring the rest of the world where the Roma are represented as well /not excluding the US where, espacially in certain localities, there are large enclaves of the Roma/. Instead, Fonseca prefers to compilate from other sources making hillarious mistakes both when trying to examine their cultural background or when \\"quoting\\" their language.It is quiet sad that the book has been taken so seriously since it only promote more myths about the nation supersticiously repeating all the prejudices and believes about them, covering them with a guise of a serious research."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book!","review":"This book is one of the best modern overviews of gypsies today, dealing with trials and troubles. The author deals with the situation of the Roma in post-Communist Eastern Europe with a slightly biased eye, but if you take some things with a grain of salt, this book is a wonderful read and you might learn something too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"The title of this book suggests that it offers more than it delivers. Ms. Fonseca's book is based on her personal experiences living with several impoverished Albanian Roma families. I thought the scope of this book was far too narrow to be of general interest and far too narrow to be the basis for any sort of political or anthropological conclusions. If you are looking for a history of the Gypsies and discussion of Gypsy cultural contributions (as I was), I suggest you look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Tag Holder","review":"The brass is sharp looking and the plastic cover insert protects the license plate well. It's a nice addition to the back of my Prius."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product - Fairly Brassy Appearance","review":"This appears to be well made, although the plastic cover is slightly prone to cracking at the edge if you are not careful. Also a fairly brassy appearance, and I usually like polished brass as a finish. My car has chrome finish and I wonder if perhaps a gold finish might have been better. Also screw caps are a bit tricky to fit snugly so they don't fall off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Photos Not Tactics","review":"I was completely disappointed by this book. In the 512 pages only 114 were text or tactical diagrams, the rest were photos of equipment. If you like pictures of WWII Panzers, this book may be for you. If you want much info on tactics, this book isn't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass it Up!","review":"The only thing nice about this unit is the large 7\\" screen, but even that is a bit overwelming, especially at night. It was not hard to navigate the program, when we could keep it working. We received the unit after Xmas (2008) and used it around town, then on a 600 mile trip. The unit would freeze up about every 15-30 minutes, which required a reboot to bring it back. We got a couple error (fatal) messages also. POI's are not good either, not sure how many they claim, not alot of info in the manual or the website. We returned the unit for a refund.PASS IT UP, it is not worth it, pay the extra price for a known product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Be aware","review":"Pro: cheap for the functionalities come with it. Easy user GPS display interface. Big screen.Cons: Mine broke after 2 usages/reboot. Basically one of files on SD card gets corrupt and cause the gps to not start up and lock up upon reboot. I can fix this problem by deleting files in the sd card but I would need my computer to do so and the frequency of the happening was too high that I couldn't stand it anymore. It basically happens every 2 reboot or so. Too bad it happened on my 1 week road trip and I wasn't able to use gps at all.I am sure this could be isolated case but I am returning for refund. For record, I didn't order from amazon. Paid $100 new.Update: After plugging new SD card and upgrading the OS, everything is working now. I may keep it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the buck","review":"This is great for your dollar, the 7inch screen sure beats the 3.5 of orthers that you would have to pay more for. Easy to use. However I would not recommend this for someone who has a small car. Reason being is it would take up too much dashboard space. I have a big truck and this is perfect for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG Is Not Always Better.","review":"I thought the bigger screen would allow me to read the directions better, but it was TOO bulky. The preloaded directions were not accurate enough for my use. I sold it for a song and a dance and bought a TomTom a size down."},{"rating":"1","title":"size of screen is the only thing good about this gps","review":"this gps is slow to load when you can get it to load, screen is super large and clear states it has games but only has 1 game fm transmiter dose not work or this may be just this unit this the 3rd. one of this model i have bought and is the only one i got to work at all the video in is good but is very sensitive to type of media you run works with my alpine in dash dvd.all in all i dont suggest this gps too many cons. and not very many pros."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not meet expectations","review":"I wish I could recommend this item, but I can't. I spent many hours playing with it when it first arrived - I even called tech support a number of times. In short, here's what I didn't like:1) The box is very picky about the SD media used. Only certain brands with high speed capability would work.2) The box is very picky about the video formats it would play. Basically, wma is all I could get to work. divx is supposed to work, but alas, I was disappointed here. Load a high res movie in and the word SLOW does not begin to describe the performance.3) The box is very picky about the audio formats it would play.4) Picky about image files too.Here's what I liked:1) I could plug in an external video player in it and it would play it great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plenio lacks quality, dont bother with this one!!!","review":"I purchased this GPS after looking at the specs and a few reviews, i was fooled by the suggested retail price and actual prices available through various sellers. My second mistake was to purchase from TigerDirect, they wont accept a return unless the device is malfunctioning. The most major flaw with this thing is the lousy TFT display which resembles the first TFT's on the market twenty years ago. Its grainy and you can actually see the pixels and spaces between. It was totally useless for viewing photos and video playback was a complete joke. The GPS functions fair but the maps are out of date. Dont bother with this one. Live and Learn!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"unit did not access GPS signal","review":"I returned the Pleneo VXA 3000 GPS after fooling with it for several hours trying to get it to work. The irrelevant game features worked fine but it wouldn't access the GPS signal. The bright spot though is the excellent return policy of Amazon... a quick refund including S&H and insurance. I then went with a Garmin c240 Street Pilot and have had no problems with it.
