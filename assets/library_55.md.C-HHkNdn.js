Ricky Tims put together a capable orchestra to back them up. Still, the choir suffers occasionally from intonation problems, especially during grander passages that require a large sound.Most disappointing, however, is baritone soloist Charles Waldron.

This is a very predictable book that is purely romance with a mild suspense story wrapped around it to make it a viable entry into the Suspense or romantic suspense genre. The characters are flat and boring and their predictable romp in the sack takes place between pages 338 and 342 of the book, which is about the same for each of these novels. Stewart doesn't seem to take into account that if the FBI was sleeping around nearly as much as she portrays, all of her characters would have been on suspension for misconduct a time or two. But this isn't the only thing she has failed to research. Save your time and money unless you are desperate for this type of mindless dribble in which case you must be a very lonely,repressed, and socially stunted person..."},{"rating":"2","title":"book","review":"I like to read series in order.

Well written with mega plot lines all twisted together. Well developed major characters full of strengths AND weaknesses that make them easy to relate to and like...except the bad guys - they are evil personified! And equally interesting minor characters that I suspect will become the focus of the other books in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good suspense read.","review":"This is the first Mariah Stewart novel I have read. It has a good plot and is intended to be part of a 3 book series. However, each book stands alone.Three men, one a serial killer, one who murdered his wife and sons, and one young man who is just enraged, meet in a room at a courthouse. They talk about who they would kill if they could do it without being caught.As they talk they tell each other who they want dead. One says if we did it for each other no one would be able to blame us. They speculate on the deed, but call it a game.Later the serial killer starts with the young man's list. The suspense is well done. And it truly is hard to find a reason for the deaths when the suspected killer is in jail.I think it is a well written, engrossing novel. I enjoyed it, and I look forward to the next two; DEAD CERTAIN and DEAD EVEN."},{"rating":"1","title":"More like 2 1/2 stars","review":"This is a great concept for a three book series, but after this first book, I felt unsatisfied with the character development and predictable plot. Mariah Stewart did a great job of writing, though the book wasn't that suspenseful (maybe I've just been reading too much lately). The relationship between Mara Douglas and Aiden Shields wasn't fully developed. I would have liked a few more scenes where they get to know each other, or something just to show the chemistry between the two. I found that seriously lacking in this book.If you want an easy read, get a used copy of this book, but definitely don't pay full price. I'm not going to bother with the other two in the series.

Mr. Whitener's voice is so drone and expressionless that I quickly loose interest. Sorry to be so negative, but this CD is very disappointing. Stick to the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audio Hard to Follow, Reader makes text Boring","review":"I find the Reading on the audio version difficult to follow. The pauses, even at the start of a paragraph, are too small, in my opinion. The reader utilizes a monotone, with little expression. I quickly get lost trying to follow the narrative, especially while I'm driving. Net effect for audio: boring!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Introduction by the master","review":"I have to agree with a prior reviwer in that this is a very good book for one just beginning to delve into the sad, glorious, heroic, sordid and heartbreaking tale that is the American Civil War.This book serves as a fine outline of the beginning, prosecution and conclusion of the war. It is a slim volume so do not expect a extensive economic analysis of the conditions prior to the war, political events leading up to the war or during it; but as a brief overview of the war it is as good as it gets.Catton is lyrical and easy to read as usual; a fine preview to his Army of the Potomac Trilogy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trust Me, Don't Buy This","review":"The market for Portable Media Players is getting vaster as technology improves.

As problems swirl in his pastoral and personal life, he decides to take his troubled nephew and make his way back to the quaint Oregon seaside village where he spent his childhood summers...only to find that his childhood sweetheart has also returned.There are complications, of course. And how Sam (who is a very likable protagonist) deals with them is both absorbing and faith-affirming.And I love Deborah Bedford's writing. It's lovely and evocative, and makes you feel the wet sand squishing between your toes and hear the cry of the sea-gulls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I must have been reading a different book than all of these other people who rated it.

This is really just a gimmick; the record companies get a band of teenagers together who can play a couple of chords on their guitars and bass, and a drummer who can keep a basic beat.

Hoyt doesn't have a clue about narrative structure, or how to create a character, for that matter... his hero, Burlane, is a throwback to our Neanderthal past -- read the scene where Burlane is being briefed about the endangered species he is allegedly on a mission to rescue... and he can't concentrate because he's too busy ogling the Russian girls (everyone of them a beauty, of course, and all flirting with him) What a man this Burlane is! And what an ass of a character! Hoyt's dialogue is also a hoot! Hoyt had an earlier career as a college professor. Before he waste the precious paper writing another book, I suggest he go back to school -- as a student so he can take a fiction writing class and learn the fundamentals about telling a story"},{"rating":"1","title":"Book never showed up","review":"I know the book is great because I borrowed it from my local library before ordering it here.

Here, Ella longs to feel helpful while assisting her mother in their bakery. She embarks on a slap-dash cake delivery to prove herself adept, a journey that could spell trouble if Ella doesn't take it upon herself to finish up what she's started. In spite of the obstacles that ensue, she displays a tenacious handle on things. The message of striving for personal responsiblity doesn't come off as heavy handed, cloaked in slap-sticky scenes that are whimsical and funny, and finished off with a nice, quiet end that brings the tale full circle. The story is rich and the illustrations strikingly detailed. We are really enjoying this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enchanting","review":"Absolutely adorable story with a great main character and wonderful illustrations!! The entire series is awesome!!

In that amount of time, we've had two of these bulbs go dead in two different (brand new) light fixtures. I removed another dead bulb today and when I shake it, it sounds like there's a piece broken off inside. Not good. There's also a black ring on the inside of the fluorescent tube on both the of dead bulbs and another flickering (almost dead) bulb. We have other brand bulbs (Sylvania & Philips) in the same type of light fixture in this office and none of them are exhibiting these problems. These bulbs are supposed to last for years!

I go running with my iPod mini and now that I have the extra protection against drops and key knicks, my mind is more at ease. The screen covering is really essential, and the silicon sheath is sturdy enough to protect the ipod body against a fall or two. The major negative is, as has already been mentioned, the added bulk will not allow you use the belt clip or a docking station. If you don't use either anyway, this is a no brainer.

Very mid life crisis (I guess slightly past). I hope we watch Charles grow extremely old aged."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much happens.","review":"I'm surprised by the glowing reviews from the professional reviewers.

The writing is professional and witty, and the characters are well-drawn, but there's practically no mystery here at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"War and Irony","review":"In this work of blood and irony, Richard Armour bravely tackles a ticklish subject. His method, as might be expected, is completely his own. He does not satirize war. He lets war satirize itself. Bombs, he believes, speak louder than words.The author ranges from the pointed stick to the thermonuclear bomb, from the crudest cave to the air-conditioned shelter. He dwells lovingly on the scythe chariot, the Macedonian sarissa, the catapult, the ballista, the gladius, the Viking ax, the crossbow, the longbow, the scimitar, the pike, the bombard, the arquebus, and other devices that make one proud of the ingenuity of man. -- from book's back cover"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works with 2000","review":"I needed an MP3 that worked with windows 2000.

It really is a shame that it is so hard to find now, because it really does answer a lot of questions.Unlike the Watcher Guide books it gives great detail about episodes and characters There are also interesting side notes about meanings for some episodes and what the entitle idea for them were.Characters like Xander, Willow, Giles , and etc... Are also mentioned a lot, and there is no doubt that you will learn something new about the series in this.Even though this is a very heavy novel I totally recommend it. As a Buffy fan and reader I really think it is worth hunting for.If you want some other good Buffy references. Then check out the Monster Book by Christopher Golden.

Gone were all the worries about extra weight that bothered me more than anyone else. In that afternoon of a few hours, it all came together, and David made me, and everyone else in the class, feel positively wonderful and validated for the women we were, exactly as we were. I have stuck with his rules all these 20 years and while the outfits in the book may be dated, the basic concept is not. David knows what works! However, he does seem to be among the missing.

I recently went to his studio, haering about his expertise, and realized first hand that what was good in the 80's is no longer applicable in the 21st century. I think David's a bit of a fake too - he promised to send me and my sisters brushes and make up that we paid for up front, and it's now been over 6 months and we're without them.

After playing RTS's for the PC like Starcraft, Emperor:Battle for Dune, and the like, I got Goblin Commander as a Christmas gift. There are 5 clans in the game:the valiant Stonekrusher, brave and quite humorous Hellfire, magical Stormbringer,insidious Plaguespitter, and of course, the evil Nighthorde. You start out with Stonekrusher but end up controlling all of the clans. A good tactic with multiple clans is tough melee troops(Stonekrusher, Nighthorde) and devastating ranged units in back (Hellfire, Plaguespitter, Stormbringer). Different clans excell at different areas, for example Hellfire is excellent at ranged warfare (Hunters and Bombardiers absolutley shred other units) but are poor at melee, quite opposite from Stonekrusher.

So far, I would suggest this game to anyone who likes RTS's and wants one for a console, and most fans of Pikmin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Nice","review":"I enjoy this game. It's a real time strategy based game, much like pikmin only darker and there are more allies and enemies with different weapons. It's a pretty cool story too. The Stonekrusher goblins are on a quest to find who killed their human master (creater) but all the sides turn against each other. Then the battles begin. I'd say it's a long game. I'm on act 4 and its taken me more than 4 hrs. to get there. The learning curve is nice and quick. The only dissapointment would be in the graphics dept., most of the battling is conducted in an aerial view so you're allies are tiny, but when you take control of a clan and zoom in the graphs are phenomonal, from outfits and weapons to the gore!

I gave it two stars as it does stay close to Scripture.The story is narrated with brief and \\"low budget\\" portrayals of the three stories. Much of the film shows a nomad (Beduoin?) family seemingly from the time the stories were actually written.

Yes, I agree that the plot made me feel icky. Watching \\"black\\" Yvonne De Carlo writhe around on a bed with her blouse pulled down off her shoulders, complaining about Clark Gable buying her. Watching Clark Gable, who seems tired, perhaps embarassed? to be in this movie. I agree that Sidney Poitier is quite good, except when he is singing a ridiculous sea chanty in a voice clearly not his own. And yes, this movie romanticizes slavery. Yes, I know the Romans owned blue-eyed blonde haired slaves. Yes, I know perhaps one in 10,000 African Americans owned slaves. But slavery as practiced in the South was, by and large, incredibly inhumane and degrading to all involved. Meditate on selling your own child, as was often done. This movie isn't about slavery. It's about Hollywood's (read: white person's) idea of slavery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful Movie","review":"It was pure agony watching this horribly overly melodramatic, wretchedly acted film. The story line was jumbled and veered off all over the place - completely disjointed and messy. The characters were half fairy dust and half bombasity. It was astounding to see such reknown actors reduced to high school theatrics. Clark Gable did the best he could with the trite dialogue and silly scenarios. Sidney Poitier was excellent and admirably portrayed the black anger of the 1950's that this film is really about. If you could only watch his scenes (minus the awful dubbed singing)it could be somewhat worthwhile.

The late Yvonne DeCarlo was never known as a dramatic actress. In comedy she could hold her own and she was a remarkable singer, but this role was way beyond her abilities. And poor Clark Gable, trying desparately to recreate Rhett Butler when he was way past his prime. Only an unknown Sidney Poitier had any inkling of the depth of this material. Even the overblown \\"Raintree County\\" is superior to this Hollywood dredging up of a Pulitzer-Prize-winning novel.It is ridiculous to think that someone thought this film deserved to be on DVD.

Probably most of its budget went on casting Clark Gable; it is his presence that would've compelled the movie audience to go see it. To give it a decent rating would be like rating a local TV new bulletin. It's not good, it's not bad; it does its job. BAND OF ANGELS kept more innocent moviegoing audiences of its day sufficiently enthralled to make it a success.

I never knew that African slaves got packed into ships like sardines until I saw the miniseries \\"Roots,\\" yet in this movie Clark Gable reveals the shameful story of how Africans were captured (sometimes with the help of other Africans) and packed into slave ships, and how cruelly they suffered. It is like seeing the other side of Rhett Butler, a very dark side. I don't consider this movie to be so much a romantic story as it is a story about forgiveness and the hope of a new and better era. I never knew that Sidney Poitier and Clark Gable had been in a film together, and it is a treat to see two such great actors confronting each other. Poitier plays his character superbly--he is rightfully impatient for freedom and justice, yet he knows he has to watch his step or else he will be crushed. \\"Gone with the Wind\\" seems very shallow compared to this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Band of Angels","review":"Every time I've watched this movie I've enjoyed it and was very glad to be able to purchase it on DVD.

I attach it to the camera body using the Pemaraal 55mm adaptor tube from pemaraal dot com, which I also recommend as a solution for the Oly SP-550 for attaching 55mm filters and lenses. (There is no vignetting using this adaptor at wide angle, and it can stay on all the time, allowing one to keep their UV and polarizing filters permanently attached).

It took 3 weeks to get my credit and I was double billed because of the extreme slowness of the returns department. What a joke! I was charged as soon as the WRONG item was shipped too me but it takes Amazon over 3 weeks to get my credit back and I have to pay for their mistakes and ther inability to have enough stock on hand to purchase another lens. So now I'm still without what I was looking for and had now I have to purchase it from another company. Also customer service was lousey. It was very hard to understand the representative while they spoke and it was also very hard to explain to them what had happened. Thanks for nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange Book","review":"Is this research? Is it a long statistical essay? Or is it an agenda-laden piece of you know what? Has Mr. Greene ever spent a second in front of a real classroom? He criticizes Jonathan Kozol referring to his writing as \\"anecdotal\\" and not research-based. OK. But at least Kozol has done some 'real\\" leg work and visited schools in poverty stricken areas all over the US and speaks with the kids, parents, teachers, and principals. Plus, Kozol is a talented writer. Reading this book, however, one gets the feeling that Mr. Greene has been hanging with the high set rather than the homeboys.The chapter where he contends that there is no evidence demonstrating that smaller class size has educational benefits is pretty laughable. Ask anyone who has ever taught both small versus large classes. There is no comparison.Come on, Jay, even you can't believe what you've written, deep down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Propaganda","review":"I have never read such bull**** in my life. As an educator with her recent Masters in Education, I debunk Greene's theories. I suggest reading actual research done by Phd's and educators such as: A.R. Sadovnik; H. Kohl; R.P. McDermott; J. Bettie, M.A. Gibson; M. Polluck; Fine, Weis, & Powell; R. Rist; J. O'Neil .....to name a few. When Jay Greene has read from all of the experts above, spent a few years in schools doing the work of an innovative, caring, open-minded teacher, and interviewed students from underpriviledged back grounds, then he can write a book about schools. Our students are not sick patients and our schools are not hospitals, yet Greene sticks to this metaphor in order to make his reader's think that education is something as simple as a broken toy. In fact, education is about teaching our children to become critical thinkers: something Greene does not want his readers to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"its about freedom stupid","review":"I don't need lengthy intellectual arguments to understand that it is better to have parents decide where their children go to school, what they are taught, and how resources are distributed. This country was founded upon the concept of individual liberty and the \\"public\\" schools(they are government schools, not public schools) have taken this portion of our liberty away."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book on Public Policy in 2005","review":"Arguable the best book on any public policy issue in 2005, and a must read for anyone interested in education policy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Academically This Book Never Should Have Found a Publisher","review":"Greene's methodology is horrible. The entire book is based on a strawman. He creates \\"myths\\" which he himself puts into words and defines. This makes it simple for him to prove them wrong, even when there's no evidence that the Common Man actually subscribes to these myths.His definitions for the myths and how to find them true are false are tautological. They are worded in ways so that the outcome is already assured. I am unsure how the first draft of this ever made it past an editor.Regardless of whether you want these myths to be \\"true\\" or \\"false,\\" please find the answers in a better written and more credible source than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Freakonomics for Education","review":"Public school spending per pupil, adjusting for inflation, has soared in recent decades, while student performance has stagnated. This central and uncomfortable fact is the essence of the crisis in American public education today- a collapse in the productivity of spending.Defenders of the status-quo, when forced to address this problem at all, trot out a series of comfortable myths. Greene's book methodically demolishes each of them, while also providing a roadmap to genuine improvement. An important book for anyone wishing to come to grips with the real and phantom challenges facing public education today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Discussion of Why the Conventional Wisdom on Education is Wrong","review":"\\"Education Myths\\" is one of those \\"love it or hate it\\" books. Liberals who have bought into these myths will despise the \\"reality checks\\" Greene gives while conservatives will applaud his meticulous debunking of them. Are schools underfunded? Are teachers underpaid? Do smaller class sizes raise student achievement? Does teacher credentialing result in better performance? Do vouchers work? Greene reviews the research on these and other \\"hot button\\" issues to demonstrate that the conventional wisdom is very often wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bring on the Solutions","review":"Education Myths by Jay Greene is an excellent discussion of the most important topics in education policy today. The work is much more than a survey of current research. Greene has participated in several major studies while at the Manhattan Institute on such topics as vouchers, true graduation rates, and teaching democratic participation in our society. Greene's intimacy with the policy details comes through in each topic.The book is fast and punchy, and it is a true joy to read. Greene is definitely willing to take on the status quo and promote change.I enjoyed Education Myths so much that I have already bought a half dozen copies for friends, and I expect you will probably do the same.I cannot wait for the sequel.

I cared about each of the characters and loved how it was so true to life....one minute your inseparable friends, th enext you only get together in crisis or celebration (Funerals, weddings...).I loved the developement of Kathy and her relationship with the women.I also loved the way that the author subtly incorporated what was going on in society into the book (Crystal's jaunt in \\"flower child\\", Grice's coming out, The greedy 80's (Through Gayle and Lois) and woman's liberation in general for all these characters.And, a previous reveiwer refers to the \\"going to London to see Queen Elizibeth's Coronation\\" saying it did not happen....it did happen...it just wasn't the main character, Peggy, who went."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where was the Editor?","review":"Don't get me wrong; it was a good story. I enjoyed the various escapades of all the women as they grew from young wives to mature women. The men, however, are such shallow caracatures of the sensitive good husband, the redneck jock, and the abuser, that we never really get to know them.As Peggy (the narrator) matured and became a top bridal consultant in Dallas, her grammar was still as stereotypical \\"Texas\\" as it was when she was an uneducated young wife.Another thing that bothered me was that the blurb on the back refers to the wives \\"going to London to see Princess Elizbeth get Coronated\\". This never happened."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liked it","review":"I liked this book and will look for other Laurie Graham books. My only nit-picking is: I'd give it 5 stars if the \\"English\\" dialogue didn't sound exactly like the American--- an Englsih country woman certainly wouldn't use the same words and phrases as a American/Texan.

Very grating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agree with other reviewer: a pointless book","review":"After I finished this book, I wondered why it had ever been published. The characters, all military wives stationed in England in the early 1950s, were completely interchangable. There seemed to be no character development; all of the characters were two-dimensional and, most of the time, unlikable. I wondered why Kath, the English character, even bothered with this group. And the \\"gimmick\\" of including recipes for each character was completely gratuitous. It was as if the author decided: 1) write about a group of self-centered women, 2) include recipes, have an instant hit!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Military Wives Unite","review":"I absolutely could not put this book down. I read it in less than 24 hours! As a pilot's wife myself, I could relate to the characters in every way. I did not feel as though the first 50 pages were slow, I loved the book from page 1. The characters were so fun and real. The scenarios and happenings of the characters were not extraordinary, and that's what makes the book so interesting. Ignore the negative reviews and get this book TODAY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I am am advid reader and someome suggested this book for our book club. Why? This book is so terrible that almost no one in our group read it. I read it because I ran the discussion. Not only is it poorly written, the characters are dull. They do stupid things and just seem so dumb-as do their husbands. There are too many people and the story line is terrible. What is the likelyhood of these American women taking up with an English women such as Kathy? The women do not seem to care for each other and only come together at the end because of a crisis. There is not one \\"normal\\" person in this bunch of misfits. What a sheer waste of time, when there are so many good books to read. I would have given this book a zero rating it it was an option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still have not recieved","review":"I borrowed this book from a friend as I still have not received it from the company I purchased it from. With that being said. This book was not my style. I don't know if was based on real life events or if was pure fiction, either way I was bored.

It can get pictures from my phone but it cannot upload to the phone. Kind of pointless with such limited features.Worst part is the length of time it takes to update the software.

The syncopated one, two, three, four lyrics and shifting rhythms are mesmerizing and.... addictive. I have after rediscovering Philip Glass become completely addicted.

One of the main reasons for buying this on CD was to have a quality recording of similar stature but for some reason this mix has the purpose backwards highlighting the chorus at the expense of meaning.Avoid this if you ever heard the first recording or would like to hear the lyrics and the solo performers."},{"rating":"1","title":"unironic, inferior to original recording","review":"Einstein on the Beach is one of the great works of music/theatre (as opposed to opera, or even traditional \\"musical theatre\\") of the 20th century, but the rerecording suffers from the bloated, cheap pretentiousness that characterizes almost all of Philip Glass's later work. Dilettantes criticize the original for the \\"artificial\\" timbre of the synthesizers, ignorant of the idea that the sound of the synthesizers are part of the piece as a historical text, or that the grating sound of the original recording actually emphasizes the formal qualities of Glass's minimalism.

I learned about the class systems, real and imagined. I learned about Detroit, too. And I learned about the poverty in small southern towns during those years.

Talk about plodding along. I realized at one point, characters had not spoken to each other in 30 or so pages. Just page after page describing the heat and bugs and sweat....Why no closure to the Sissy story ? I also didn't get how Celeste mentally accused Mr. Tucker of molesting and murdering Sissy.

I must give credit in that the guide does tell you where to go, I'll give it that. But in order to fully experience the game, however, a far more in depth and detailed guide would be needed.

Adjusting all the height differences made no change in its ability to pick up the crumbs. It is also a very heavy vacuum and the placement of the cord is not well designed. I kept having to move the cord so I wouldn't run over it , because it comes out from the bottom of the vacuum. On a positive note, I loved the lift off and turbo brush to vacuum the stairs. I thought that part did a great job, but overall I did not like it and returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not working","review":"I bought it in local store in 2006. I have ever used it only less than 5 times so far because it doesn't pick up anything. The brush stirs up hairs and leave them on carpet. In fact, when I am trying to clean inside, it's surprised me there is nothing there. It simply doesn't work. It's light and quiet. Otherwise, I will rate it 0."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware!!!","review":"This vacuum cleaner was a great buy, so I thought until yesterday! It picks up everything, and I do mean everything. The tools that come with it our great, and they do the job right. Problem is, I only had this vacuum 4 months, and yesteday while I was vacuuming, the motor burnt up on it. Now when I try to turn it on, it does nothing. I usually have great success with Bissell, not this time. Very dissapointing :("},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Vac I've ever owned!","review":"This vac is not heavy, it's easy to clean, and it sucks the pet hair like you would not believe! I have had this vac for alittle over a year, and I have not had any regrets whatsoever! The canister can be taken apart for easy cleaning with soap and water. The filters are easy to clean as well. I let them dry overnight, and put them back in. I change the paper filter every couple of months, and I find the replacements at Walmart. There is a detachable hose with an attachment for stairs or furniture...that works great too. When I wear this one out, I am buying another one just like it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Vacuum","review":"I just got this vacuum a few days ago so I cannot comment on the longevity of this product, however, I will comment on the features. The vacuum itself is pretty heavy, but I don't consider that a bad thing. It sucks the life out of my area rugs and the hardwood floor attachment work really well on the hardwoods. The lift off feature is nice and easy and works like a champ. I figure this feature voids the overall weight of the machine because the canister isn't that heavy. I would've like to have seen a little longer hose, or at least a stretchier one. The one that comes with it is adequate because they include a telescoping extension that does the trick. I researched vacuums for days and days and settled on this one. I am glad I did, the price was right and it does a great job. I recommend it. Later."},{"rating":"1","title":"A page-turner no doubt but","review":"This book is indeed a page-turner BUT I don't find it particularly well written (even for Douglas Kennedy's standards)and also, one of the reasons I kept on reading it was there are hardly any separations/gaps in the whole text, so there is no stopping point, so to speak.I find it isn't very subtle and it could have been 1/3 slimmer and none the worse for it. What are the editors thinking/doing these days?!Also, the whole Lizzie part seemed to be added as an afterthought. In my opinion, it would have been better to mention Hannah had had 2 kids, one sentence would have helped the whole Lizzie story seem more natural in the story-telling.The author keeps using the word \\"assorted\\", for some reason.I was expecting the last Billy twist, so all in all, it is indeed a book one wants to finish quickly, but that's about it, it doesn't haunt you after that, like a good book or indeed a good movie does."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read!","review":"I just finished reading the French version and ordered the English version for Father's Day for my dad.

Heroes 4 seems rushed and thrown together. Everything I liked about the versions previous to this seems to have been neglegted. God I hope they learn that they need to keep th eessence of the game here and what isn't broke please don't fix it...this is a totally different game and it is not as entertaining as the previous versions. Please bring back HOMM 3 type game play. IMHO A much better game is Disciples 2 by Strategy First...this is what I was hoping Heroes was going to evolve into... if they had to goof with the total game design...no such luck. So disappointed, playing Disciples 2 and shelving Heroes 4!"},{"rating":"1","title":"no just no","review":"Heroes 3 was awesome and i found little to no problems with it, but this game at least for me crashes constantly or somehow ends up with glitched audio loops speaking of audio i find the game sounds very annoying in comparison to other games. i like these types of game to have decent graphics but i can live without the crazy 3d stuff if it is going to cause my game to crash at least once every scenario/campaign match i play."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"What a disappointment. So far most of the rest of the Heroes of Might and Magic series has been great. However, this particular one brings nothing really interesting or new to the series. From what I've seen so far the big deal that has been made about it seems to be that you can now use your heroes in combat and strategy. New creatures, new maps, etc. not much else.The AI is horrible, the computer cheats constantly, gathering massive armies in short spans of time that are either impossible or difficult to counter. The cd doesn't ship with a finished multiplayer mode, and 3DO has promised a patch to make this available, but I am unsure if it ever came out. The soundtrack is pretty typical for this series, nothing impressive. All in all, if you want to play a good Heroes of Might & Magic game go back to 2 or 3, after all there's not a huge difference in the games."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor job by 3do. This is not Heroes, but a all new game.","review":"I was upset and disapointed with this game. The change was far more then needed, or wanted.

I really can't understand how you ever loose a hero in this game, they are all to powerfull. A barbarian fighting against 20 dragons? I think I will throw away all my arms to give them a fair chance...This game is to easy. Having a powerful hero you wander around the map collecting all the treasures. The AI will never attack you and wait when you have build up enough troops to attack his last castle. Wow what a challenge....Videos as a reward for finishing a campaign? No way.Multiplayer sooooooooonnnnnnnnn........??????There are some nice additions but with an AI as challenging as taking away candies from children you can't take it seriouly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as fun as I thought it would be","review":"This game really dissapointed me.

My new computer came with Windows XP which heroes does not support and claims that on their site. They cannot offer you an update or grade to the games you have to make it compatible with XP because coding is too involved. So instead they force you to buy a new copy Heroes 4 that is compatible with XP but at the same time they take away Mutiplayer capabilities. Whats with that? Now I cannot not enjoy playing the game with friends on-line (Peer to Peer). Oh, Oh I get it. The upgrade for Multiplayer use will be available in Heroes 5 at [price] a pop?

While they have added some pretty neat new features (mentioned above), they seem to have taken out everything that was so terrific about hmm3. I liked being able to upgrade my creatures and the random map generator was the greatest thing going. Gameplay is so much slower in 4, although the campaign scenarios have better stories and a little more action and mystery to them, ie you have to complete one task in a scenario before you can move on to the next as opposed to just find the grail kind of thing. Overall, I don't think I'd really recommend this game, stick with heroes 3."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game...SAY NO","review":"Well, I bought this game about the day it was released. My brother moved away, and we used to have a lot of fun playing head-to-head Heroes III over the net.

I installed, it, and clicked \\"Multiplayer.\\" Oh, gee! \\"We're sorry, this feature is not yet implemented, please check our website for updates.\\" I was incensed!

That's why it got worse and worse. Some changings would have been great to make the game more interesting.HOMM 4 has changed and it is great!

HOMM4 is very poorlyprogrammed. It runs slow right off the bat, and quickly andsteadily slows down until it locks up the system, requiringa cold reboot. It's a serious memory leak. I've run intonumerous other bugs as well, such as the weapons shopssuddenly ceasing to work, inventory items vanishing, etc.The AI is also poor, making the game much too easy to win,even at high difficulty levels. This is a sad end to what hadbeen arguably the greatest game series."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing adventure game","review":"amazing adventure game for all ages. was much better than the third but unfortunately there has been a delay on the multiplayer expansion."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game would be AWESOME if the A.I. was a lot tougher!","review":"I really love everything they did to Heros 4 except for the fact that the A.I. stinks. When I play Heros 3, I lose at least 50 percent of the time. However, when I play Heros 4, there is almost no possiblity to lose to the A.I. For that reason, this game is REALLY BORING. I was very disapointed. If they patched the A.I. it would really give new life to this game. But, this game might be a very fun multiplayer game.

If you liked Heroes 2 & 3 (true improvements over #1), this is likely to disappoint you. Annimations are poor, important arrtibutes are hidden in screens way too cluttered in \\"decoration,\\" and the new magic system is just plain poor.

I have been briefed by experts on al-Qaida and thought I knew a lot about how they operate but this story detailed new information that I later found was accurate.

The book is a concise chapter-by-chapter survey of various contemporary issues, including: abortion; euthanasia; genetic engineering; sexual promiscuity; crime and punishment; drug abuse; the family; pornography; homosexuality; technology issues; environmentalism; the media; and other issues. This book is hard-hitting and is resounding reply to those secularists who ask that Christians sit on sidelines of the political realm. If you like this book you'll probably like Understanding the Times by David Noebel and The Trouble with Democracy by William Gairdner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moral Dilemmas","review":"I found this book to be singular in tackleing such difficult issues with a Christian perspective. The general idea behind this book is both well needed and a long time coming. However, i felt mislead by the title, as i thought it would contain more of a presective of how Christians SHOULD think about such dilemmas. Also, i found this book to be poorly written at times.

To be brutally honest, I was shocked at the wierd, ugly garments in this book -- to call them \\"designer\\" is an insult to designers like Elizabeth Zimmerman, Meg Swansen, Alice Starmore, Lily Chin, Debra Newton, etc. Who on earth would wear such stuff? Even the dog sweather is totally ridiculous. I was hoping for some fresh, new Aran designs, expecting some designs to be trendy, but not this--this stuff is just plain bizarre. I will admit -- there are some beautiful pictures in this book, but if that's what you're looking for, then get a coffee table book on Ireland.

Academy award nomination in the Best original Screenplay category. Africa in the 1860's. A safari guide is the last survivor of the expedition he organized. He must now run through the savanna, pursued by the best warriors of a bloodthirsty tribe. If I thought a lot about Samuel Fuller's RUN OF THE ARROW during the first 20 minutes of THE NAKED PREY, I must admit that I didn't have the time to think about anything but the movie afterwards, I was literally scotch taped to my sofa ! With only a few lines of dialogues, tom-toms, the environment of the animals and some local dialects, Cornel Wilde delivered a film that should stay in the annals of the adventure movies genre. Masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE NAKED PREY","review":"One of the best movies I've seen,I really enjoyed it.Very realistic and well made,for its time.Cornel Wildes direction was superb."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where is the DVD?????","review":"Unbelievable.

Cornel Wilde does almost everything in it. It's a blend of Hollywood drama with national geographic scenery and realism. The lack of dialogue and its cinematic authenticity draw the viewer into empathizing with \\"man\\" as he flees for his life. It is spellbinding!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Naked excellence!","review":"This is a movie with little dialogue and lots of acting. The commentary is also very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"garbage","review":"This is a really bad film. A bunch of archtype evil ivory hunters in Africa get captured and tortured to death. What we get is evil 1960's white-man-in-africa stereotypes combined with african \\"tribal\\" sterotypes leading to a very long, brutal and ultimately mindless progression of violent torture scenes.Rather than being tortured to death, Cornel Wilde's character is made the subject of a human hunt. The hunt serves as the second half of the film which is like a roadrunner cartoon. The coyotes keep coming but the roadrunner always gets away.This film is really the worst sort of junk. A parade of stereotypes, a bunch of ugly violence and a boring plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tired exotica","review":"Let's be real.

This one tops the list! Meghan and Bruce are real- they make mistakes, feel passion, and don't always do the right thing. In other words, they're just like you and I. The story is a simple read with a lot of heart. I highly recommend this story to anyone who is looking for a good Christian read with real characters trying to make their way through life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lighthearted fun","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. Meghann shows the everyday struggle of being a single woman-when all your family thinks you should be married. She thought it would be easier to make someone up, than to continually explain that she isn't yet married. But, she quickly realizes that one lie turns into many more and the truth is her only way out. Being a Christian doesn't mean you're perfect, but that you try to do right. The characters dealt with their lies by praying and asking for forgiveness, just like we as Christians must do. I recommed this book to anyone who wants to enjoy a funny look into the life of an all to human single woman dealing with wanting to please your family while still trying to be true to your faith. The characters learn about themselves and each other on their round about journey to finding out that true love doesn't always happen the way we imagined, but that doesn't make it any less real."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute, Light Reading","review":"Not the best book I've ever read, but it is a cute story and a fun read.

How these 2 people could call themselves Christians is beyond me. Meg must have a real problem with men to begin with. She has little trust in men. She is expecting a man to be perfect with no past. She is too skittish, unforgiving and too judgemental. No wonder this woman had to fabricate a boyfriend/husband! In normal life, Bruce would have given up long ago on this woman. To fabricate such a lie and follow through on it to the point they did proves they have no real solid belief in God. They each had the opportunity to come clean with each other about their true feelings long ago. I think the author had to write a certain amount of pages, because she could have wrapped this story up 200 pages earlier. A waste of time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mary-Kate and Ashley: Our Story","review":"Before I first ordered this book, I was skeptical as to if it would actualy be interesting.

For instance, Mary-Kate and Ashley lead somewhat normal lives. They have squables between their siblings, as well as homework trouble, just like any other teen.

After a few minutes of 'reading' it, realized how crappy the pictures in the book are. Seemes like 90-99% of the pictures are washed out, grainy, and horribly reproduced here. Was there any quality control as this book went to press? And for those 'new, never before seen pictures' they are pretty ho hum. Because its not totally horrid, I'd give it 2.5 stars.

But this honey-cone shape fabric cut into the skin of my forehead so much, it left a honey-cone imprint on my forehead for an hour (keep in mind, this is only 15 minutes ride). The imprint will last for up to 2 hours on my forehead. I don't understand why the other reviewer, Flo Troche, said its comfortable. My guess is he must be working for this company or something.

Watch this movie and find out. You'll see a horrible story line with unsympathetic characters try and create a narrative for the music. The effect: disastrous. Kirstie Alley's whinning narrative supercedes the music in most points. The unimaginative child's remarks to his mother's, Kirstie Alley, narrative show that the writer's have no understanding of children or what to do with good music. The only thing worse than the story line was the awful animation.

Adults may love this load of old tripe, but kids are likely to refuse to continue in any form of classical music education. Prokofiev should be shot, the self-indulgent twit. Thankfully he expired some time ago, but his instrument of child torture continues beyond the grave. If you want your kids to like classical music then get them something lovely and tuneful.

I'm very pleased, though, and surprised that this actually is \\"jumbo,\\" as stated. If I ever need to purchase more of these or order replacements, I'm definitely going with the same hammocks because it makes the out of control toy collection look like I have just a few.The material of the hammocks is a nicely done and good quality polyester; they should both last for a long time with continued use. The rope (mesh? I'm not sure what to call it!) is very sturdy, stretchy and durable. I love the product, but I'm not sure I accounted very well for the size. \\"Jumbo,\\" in relation to children, is usually such a loose term. Normally everything is just too small.

Set-up took all of about 3 minutes and my wife arranged the animals inside the net so that they all face out and look at our children when they are in bed. Kids love it! At first I thought it wasn't going to be big enough but I was very surprised at how many large stuffed animals it holds. I recomend placing the biggest ones in first and then stuffing the smaller ones in around them. The only draw back is that retrieving an animal can be a bit tricky because we have so many crammed in there. An additional net would probably solve this problem but we do not have another corner that would work.

In December (four months later), it abruptly died (would no longer turn on). The warranty on labor for this TV set is only 90 days. Even though parts are covered for a year, the labor would have cost me $100-150, which isn't economical for a product of this price. I even explained this situation to Philips and asked if they would cover the labor anyway, and they declined to do so.The fact that Philips is only willing to fully stand behind this product for 90 days should say something about its quality.

The whole repair takes 5 minutes, excluding a trip to Radioshack, if you have just basic $10 tool set.

Sony charged me over $700 and refused to return the 'physically damaged screen' as I requested so that the 'intentional damage' that I 'caused' could be verified. To confirm that this is a design flaw Sony included with the repaired computer NEW instructions as to how to prevent damaging the screen noting that 'the LCD screen may be sensitive to pressure or added stress'.

However, in attempting to be objective, he goes so far as to appear credulous in relation to Islam and hostile in relation to Judaism and Christianity. Although he acknowledges that Mohammed was human, he glosses over or completely ignores the killings of opponents that Mohammad is known to have ordered as well as the fact that his marriage to Aisha was a marriage to a 6-year old child (which marriage he graciously waited three years to consummate). Similarly, the word for word divine inerrancy of the Qu'ran is taken as a given, while the same belief about the Hebrew and Christian scriptures is treated as a rather ridiculous myth. Finally, although the book was updated as recently as 1995, Lippman essentially ignores the rise of militant Muslim fundamentalism. All in all, an extremely disappointing book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same undefensible formular repeated over and over","review":"The Koran does NOT grant men and women the same rights.

So, I rate it 2-stars.I enjoy watching movies, but that enjoyment is ruined by this still scene of a steam locomotive rounding a curve at the beginning of the chapter!I encounter this phenomenon in fully 10% of the DVD's I buy.

All I can say is that they must be reviews of another film. This is one of the worst Sherlock Holmes films I have ever seen, which says a lot when you think of some of the black and white stinkers that are out there.Apparently , according to this film London consists of about three streets and is occupied by about five people. Plummer played more of a man in The Sound of Music then he does in this film.This Holmes is constantly falling down and getting knocked out. Stick with the likes of Without a Clue or Young Sherlock Holmes."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 stars out of 4","review":"The Bottom Line:The production values of this Sherlock Holmes vs. Jack the Ripper film are decent but Plummer and Mason never seem comfortable in their roles and the movie goes through the motions of a Royal conspiracy without ever engaging the viewer; unless you're a Ripperphile who's already seen From Hell, there's little reason to make time for this turgid bore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't hold up","review":"Personally I get tired of the current movies with their hyper-kinetic MTV editing and pacing (see From Hell). So I am more than open to the movies from 10-20 years ago where the pace was a little more relaxed. But even having said that, this movie is still TOO slow, and TOO talky. The cast is fine, though as other people have mentioned James Mason is perhaps 10 years too old for his role. And a personal pet peeve: it annoys me when you have a period piece film but then the actors have contemporary hair cuts. Christopher Plummer's hairstyle is circa 1980 and NOT 1880 as it should be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not true to the spirit of Conan Doyle","review":"The problem with MURDER BY DECREE is simply this: That it is a product of a sensationalistic screenwriter who, while deeply influenced by a late 20th-century revulsion against the abuses of power, cooks up a plot way out of whack with the material that one finds in the original Conan Doyle. No more on this for fear of being a spoiler. I say sensationalistic because of the Hollywood emphasis on blood and gore and violence against women. Some of this is stomach-turning. Conan Doyle would have hated the film's lack of the decorum that his works observed. This really isn't for people who cherish Sherlock Holmes within the sensibility of the Edwardian era, which sidesteps the sickening in its thrill-seeking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Sherlock Holmes Thriller","review":"Christopher Plummer and James Mason are brilliant as Holmes and Watson, respectively.

The stars are Christopher Plummer as Holmes, James Mason as Watson, and Donald Sutherland. Amazon's goofy alphabetizing of actors aside, this is a fascinating and well-made thriller, if exceedingly violent, and probably the best mash up of Holmes and the Ripper.

Christopher Plumber is remarkably good at portraying Holmes. While staying true to Conan Doyle's description of the character in most respects, he adds a little more emotional depth in this interpretation which is effective in giving the character more dimension and helping the viewers to relate a little better. James Mason as a smarter version of Watson than what we're used to seeing and the extremely gifted Genevieve Bujold as a mental patient are both expertly cast. The story is very interesting, imaginative, suspenseful and masterfully told in a convincingly Victorian atmosphere. No Sherlock Holmes fan should miss it.Jennifer K.

Who can argue with the reality of decline; the substitution for institutional maintenance for evangelism? Unfortunately their response to the challenge is gimmicky and shallow. For example, they envision \\"worship\\" consisting of chats with a holographic Jesus and Mary on the challenges of family life. Is such a retreat into entertainment the only way to reach today's generation? Is it even possible for such entertainment to be authentic worship, or have we settled for a Disneyland version of reality? The authors don't consider such questions, nor do they address the question of resources, envisioning the megachurch, with its wealth, to be the only option for the future. Current trends indicate the future is not quite so monolithic. There are other books tackling these issues with far more practical advice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lost in the Forest","review":"Bandy's work is always thought provoking, and this book is, too.

I really like Carly Simon, but she's not always in good voice here, the choice of material is uninspired, and some of the arrangements (e.g. God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen) just ...Don't trust all the favorable reviews -- listen to this before you buy it. (I'll Be Home for Christmas, which you can sample here, is probably the best cut on the album.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"Like some of the other reviewers, I am a Carly Simon fan and REALLY wanted to love this cd. I was excited by the prospect of her harmonizing with son Ben (who sounds like his dad) on a few tracks. ... I listened to it twice and that was quite enough. Now I feel like it's just taking up space in my cabinet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Special","review":"I was disappointed in this CD. The songs are somewhat \\"blah\\" and don't show off Carly Simon's wonderful voice. In the duet with Willie Nelson, it was as if they were both singing unaware that the other was there. I had high expectations, given that I still LOVE her older albums. Maybe my expectations were just too high..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Cozy Addition to the Collection","review":"At first I was reluctant to buy this CD based on some of the tepid reviews here and the casual manner in which it reportedly was recorded. Boy am I glad I got it. It is very intimate and cozy. Just loved the informal feel to it. Like a good friend singing to you with spirit to spare. I would highly recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Re-release Rip Off !!","review":"Why are recording artists re-releasing albums with \\"bonus tracks\\". I bought this CD the first time only a few years ago. Already a new version?? As a Carly Simon fan, I am supposed to contribute to her retirement fund by purchasing the CD again!? I guess if Mariah Carey can re-release \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" 3 times each time with additional songs and sell 4 million copies, why not Carly. I think if an artist appreciated their fans, they would release new songs on a CD single or just a new CD. I feel ripped off. I will step off my soapbox now, but not re-purchase this CD. My Christmas CD this year will be from the Lovemongers!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Quick One...","review":"This album seems like it was recorded quickly. With it's minimalist instrumental backing, and heavy use of keyboards, it sounds like little care was taken to \\"get it right\\". The exception is the fine title track that shows son Ben inherited his parents ear for melody. Too bad the rest of the album is so poorly executed. The low point comes on Simon's duet with Willy Nelson on \\"Pretty Paper\\"...rarely have two voices been so mismatched."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carly at Christmas, a dream come true!","review":"I will say that it toke awhile for this album to grow on me, it's not flawless like many of Carly's other releases. Like Carly has said, it's very much like a live album. Her voice, and the sound of the recording, is very raw and very real here, and it works. Christmas Is Almost Here is one of my favorite Xmas songs ever, and Heaven is another wonderful new cut. Her covers of the classics Silent Night and God Rest, Ye Merry Gentlemen are just beautiful. Like I said, it may take some time for this album to grow on you, but after a few Christmases with it, it will become a staple and a must for your holiday season activities. Now Carly, how about another Christmas album?"},{"rating":"1","title":"plastic threads strip out","review":"I liked the idea of a composite bodied air tool thinking maybe it would not get so cold after extended usage, but I didn't get a chance to use it enough to tell a difference, unfortunately the air adapter that comes threaded and installed from the factory is weak because of the plastic and came apart while using it.

Very attractive fan, quiet, stable and moves a lot of air.

It's been up about two weeks now. I never think a fan is easy to install, but this went very smoothly. With the light kit and taking down the old patio light, it took me about two hours from start to finish. But I was very careful reading the directions and didn't get ahead of myself (which I can tend to do when I think I know what I'm doing!). I will say that based on the other reviews, I had hoped it would put out more air. I definitely have the blades spinning the right way, and it sounds like it's moving a TON of air, but I don't feel that much of a breeze. I wonder if I should have gotten a larger downrod (I just used what was in the package) if that would have helped give more clearance to the ceiling, making it quieter and able to move the air more? Still, seems like a good fan, and I liked the styling a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool","review":"I bought this for my deck but used it in my kitchen. I added an antique light kit and rooster and red tractor pull. It is made of a plastic that looks like wicker. It is amazingly easy to clean. So much better than wood. It really keeps the room cool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality - DON'T BUY HUNTER - CHEAP PLASTIC","review":"Don't buy these!! I bought 2 for my outdoor kitchen and it lasted 6 months. The first heavy rain storm that we had with a little wind (not tornado or hurricane force wind) and the blades came apart at the area that looks like metal but isn't. The fan is made of plastic, not just the leaf blade. The part that looks like metal and attaches the leaf blade to the fan is plastic....very misleading by the picture and description. I called Hunter and they won't replace the blades since they say it was an \\"act of God\\" issue. I told them the issue was they made outdoor fans of poor quality material and can't survive a basic rain storm and that \\"act of god\\" is generally used for tornadoes and tropical storms."},{"rating":"2","title":"Visually Pleasing Outdoor Fan","review":"Havent used it long term as of yet, but these are nice looking fans.

In fact, we bought a second one for another room. This fan is well manufactueed with sharp and subltle styling. You cannot beat the wind generated from teh leaf shaped propellars. Fast delivery in perfect condition with all parts."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful fan","review":"We needed an exterior fan for our deck and read the reviews and decided on the Hunter Bayview 54\\". Great fan for the price!! The color is a deep rich brown, a nice contrast to our all white ceiling. The installation was not too bad, installing the mechanism for the remote was the hardest. Fan is fairly quiet, on the highest speed we did notice a slight squeaking. Construction overall is very good. Would buy the fan again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I had hoped for","review":"This outdoor fan is whisper quiet and gives off a strong breeze. I only buy Hunter Fans and this one did not disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hunter Bayview Palm Leaf Ceiling Fan","review":"Purchased and received this item from Amazon. Item arrived in perfect condition. Installation was straight forward. When I attempted to connect the Hunter Remote Control kit # 27185 the fan would not work. When I disconnected the fan control the fan works perfectly but with no speed control.I am completely satisfied with this fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Porch Ceiling Fan","review":"I purchased this with the idea of having a fan that did not scream out 'notice me' over the other items on my porch. But with the textured blades I do get a tropical feel with great function. I am quite pleased.Hunter 23979 Bayview 54-Inch Five Blades Ceiling Fan, White Wicker Palm Leaf"},{"rating":"1","title":"pull chain problem is not fixed","review":"We installed this fan on our outdoor patio just a week or two ago. Pull chain is a problem. I haven't figured out how to use it. Should I pull staight down, or stand to the side? Neither works well and it feels as if the chain is going to come right out of the housing. Not good for a brand new fan. I would look for an alternative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely fun","review":"i own these 4 the psx and n64 and these are ultra fun games. These will take hours away from your day.

The graphics have been scanned terribly. Which seems to speak volumes for the quality of the rest of the content. The charts from the book are too small to read comfortably on the kindle. Those should have been typed and formatted just for the kindle version. The biggest sin is the missing list I found; which happened to be one I truely needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This book contains everything having to do with reading.

The characters are fairly well fleshed out (some more than others). The story is certainly enjoyable and there are a few surprises towards the end. That's always good. If you're looking for a serious treatise on the state of humanity at large, well there's actually a little bit of that here. If you're looking for an interesting take on what it would be like to live in a comic book universe, then I recommend this. It compares favorably in my mind to Playing For Keeps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Super Hero Fun","review":"Other People's Heroes is a fun read. The premise is interesting and the character interactions and growth are well done.Several of the ways that characters use their powers were novel and just plain cool. If you likeWearing the CapeorConfessions of a D-List Supervillainthen you will probably enjoy this book and vice versa."},{"rating":"2","title":"Other People's Heroes is a GREAT read!","review":"This was a great book. The characters were interesting, and it was definitely not your typical story. I liked the anti-hero, regular guy with sense of values that the people in the story had. It was nice to see everyday drama, and even self-esteem issues as well as dysfunctional relationships. I look forward to seeing what the author will come up with next."},{"rating":"2","title":"very user friendly book","review":"i started reading it 2 nights before my exam and it really helped improve my grade...a VERY helpful resource"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lyrical acid trip","review":"This is a very unusual book- even for Francesca Lia Block. It is fantasy novel with magic, but it is also a \\"civilization collapsed\\" kind of book. Some themes you'll find: environmentalism, antimaterialism, magic, acceptance of aging, anti-drugs, guilt over being gay etc.Meaty, unless you're familiar with her other books, which consist of the exact same themes.It is lyrical, sometimes too wordy (yes I know that most people love her for that very reason).Lots of different plots, but ,sorry to say, not a very strong plot over all. Love, magic.I would recomend getting it at the library before splurging. It's interesting and unusual, but not excellent. Primavera is better, so is I was a teenage faery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible. Just Terrible.","review":"I am probably the biggest Francesca Lia Block fan you can find. I am always gushing about her books to all my friends and recomending her to everyone. So, you can imagine my dissapointment when I discovered the utter tripe that is Ecstasia and it's companion book Primavera. These books went out of print for a reason. Because they were horrible. What I have always loved about Block's books is her ability to blend fantasy with reality, and her awe-inspiring descriptive language. These two books have removed reality altogether, and what we are left with is overdone fluff with too much metaphor and no substance. Comparing these books to masterpieces like Violet and Claire, Echo or the Dangerous Angles series is like comparing a chocolate chip cookie to eating handfuls of sugar out of the bag."},{"rating":"1","title":"HARDLY eddie's best","review":"stick with Dressed to Kill and Glorious, because next to those Circle is hackneyed, repetitive and ... flat. dont get me wrong, i love eddie, he's fabulous, but if you're buying his shows, skip this one. i wish i had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Circle - Eddie Izzard concert","review":"very dissappointed in this concert.

Where should you do it? How will particular types of guys respond to the break-up? A rolling-about-the-floor funny tome of break-up advice I came across for some story research.Covering everything from when you should break up with someone to the after shocks (your mother's coronary and rantings that you'll become an old maid, among other potential gems), it's fun reading for anyone with high-enough self-esteem, regardless of sex, even though it's definitely a woman's book. It's a great conversation book full of cheap laughs, even though it's real as hell."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great book","review":"It's nice to see Fillion lighten up a bit after her first (also excellent book). I hope she writes lots more with Ladowsky. This is a great read and should be read in public."},{"rating":"2","title":"The perfect gift for the friend whose guy you hate","review":"This is a fun frolic of a book which can be read right through but is best sampled in witty chunks. It's vicious, mean, funny, pointed and, best/worst of all, a \\"how-to\\" book you can actually use. Oh, to have been dumped by one of these two: done this well I might almost have enjoyed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK for 20-somethings, still short on relationship experience","review":"I was disappointed. It was not nearly as sage and nitty-gritty practical as the book, \\"How to Dump your Wife\\" (a gem,) but then marriage imposes more legal realities that require real assistance. This \\"Guy\\" book probably would have been more entertaining, as well as useful, in my 20's or even 30's. But for anyone over 35, one's real experiences, friends, family, movies, magazines, etc., have probably already covered most of those points, which were often presented tongue-in-cheek anyway. I considered it mostly \\"fluff\\" despite the promise of \\"meat\\" on the Today show interview and the Table of Contents. I wish I'd looked through it before buying it right off the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wonder if these two ladies are single?","review":"I find this book a total waste. These two authors seem to be capitalizing on their emotional short falls when it comes to relationships. I do understand that everyone is entitled to his or her opinion. That is my intention, to express my opinion. I feel that these two ladies have no real dealings when it comes to relationship. The way that they portray all men is very insulting. The authors try and give you the impression that all men are stupid and insensitive. This is not true. I am sorry that these two ladies have never experienced a true relationship. As far as their impressions of men go, these two ladies will never experience a loving, give and take relationship. I repeat again \\"a give and take relationship\\". For the men that you have dumped in the past using these tactics, more power to them, they are better off without the likes of these two emotionally distressed ladies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter drivel","review":"sounds like neither of the authors have had any experienceing in dumping guys.

I had to depend on gifts from them or when I would visit for my supply. It became a tradition for my sister, sister-in-law, my mom, and I to have Market Spice tea at our family Christmas party each year. It makes the whole house smell wonderful and nothing beats the slightly sweet, spicy taste. I am so glad Amazon has it available now and I can get some any time, especially since I have gotten several of my friends hooked on it too. Although I no longer have to make my supply last I do have a tip. If not used within 6-8 months the tea will get a bitter taste.

And yet a single reading of the extraordinary \\"John Fury\\" reveals Dunphy to have been Capote's artistic equal, though a totally different kind of writer. \\"John Fury,\\" about the Irish poor in Philadelphia at the turn of the century, belongs with such realist or naturalist urban classics as Frank Norris's \\"McTeague,\\" Stephen Crane's \\"Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,\\" and Upton Sinclair's \\"The Jungle.\\" Dunphy's prose is hard, sharp, and spare, as befits the story's theme---the grinding, soul-deadening effects of a family's poverty. It is not a happy story, but it is a vividly real one.Dunphy is a writer whose works, including the touching \\"Nightmovers\\" and \\"First Wine,\\" as well as the brilliant novel-memoir \\"Dear Genius,\\" deserve to be back in print.

When I received the book, I thought it couldn't be true. There are lots of pictures, actually only pictures, yes, but they're drawn in such a way that even if they were all accurate re-drawings from primary sources, you cannot figure out how the garment looked. The drawings look like a very poorly done line drawings, with nothing clear - lots of lines that give a flat picture with no details. Besides, as the book covers such a large era, it gives only few pictures for each period and the pictures given are often not very typical for that time. Even Peacock is better than this. In the back, however, is a list of sources the pictures were re-drawn from, so you could actually go and check the accuracy.

After studying Jack Gilbert and his suffering due to the loss of his beloved life I learned to appreaciate the deeper meaning behind pain and loss. Gilbert lost his wife and is daily conflicted by the remembrence of her, as is apparent throughout \\"The Great Fires.\\" His constant bitter reminder of how depressing his life is further pushed me to concentrate on the good things in my life and to live optimistically."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply wonderful","review":"I have both Monolithos and the Great Fires. I remember and reread poems from both these volumes, continuously. Not all the poems, for me, are memorable, but many are. This is much much better than average for most poetry books by the typically annointed \\"major\\" poets. Gilbert takes care and time to read, his words are set in, play out through space and silence. The grief and loss he expresses are not the point for me, most poetry is about this, but he implicates his own sentimentality. And I like the \\"form factor\\" of his poems, the line breaks, line lengths, etc. And finally, I like the way he approaches his \\"career\\" which seems, to be an \\"un-career.\\" Very little self-promotion, conference hopping, log rolling, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow","review":"Jack Gilbert knows how to write poetry. Pompous and arrogant? Maybe, but what, may I ask, is wrong with being arrogant enough to publish a fine, slender volume of your own work over an entire decade, where many contemporary writers would have published 3 or 4 books of poems in the same amount of time, much of it little more than filler to flesh out a book of \\"poems\\"? Arrogant indeed..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Macbeth with Fine Speeches","review":"Jack Gilbert has about five or so poems in him, which he has written over and over, always sticking to the sure thing, not taking any chances.When his poems are good, they are very very good-- and when they are pompous and inflated, when you get the feeling that he often gets by by making his voice \\"big\\" rather than true, when he protests too much, postures and tries to put on grandeur as if it were a hat for the camera.... Well, you get the idea.There are some very good poems in this book, but the author's repertoire is pretty limited, his thoughts predictable, and his lifetime achievement slim."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash","review":"It's a pocket mattress protector, so you have to have to slip the entire mattress into it and zip it up. A tremendous hassle, especially the larger youre mattress, and it's prone to rip in the process. It says it can accomodate up to 12\\" deep, but my 6\\" (futon) mattress just about fills it. It's not quiet, krinkles like rice paper and just as sturdy. So I wonder how truthful it is about being really hypoallergenic and waterproof....?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy and it Tears","review":"I was shocked when I attempted to put the encasement on. It tore in several places and I ended up using tape to put it back together. Don't waste your money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"We purchased this product for my son's apartment bed. Encasing the mattress was not actually difficult, though I would highly suggest two people performing this rather than one. I have purchased other mattress envelopes--not Aller-ease-- but was not able to get the size I needed.This protector is shoddy, flimsy, and not worth your while or money. After encasing the mattress, we discovered the side \\"seam\\" was split and the zipper was apart. My son managed to get the zipper tracked, but the torn seam renders this product less than optimally protective.It might be waterproof if a couple drops were sprinkled on it, but I would certainly hate to trust it to protect more than that!Run away from the Aller-ease section if you are planning to purchase this product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great combo of Biography and Social History","review":"This is much more than a discussion of Jefferson and his home. Interwoven throughout the narrative are threads of colonial life. Slavery, Jefferson's personal relationships, the lower class white aristsans of Monticello are all discussed in detail. This makes the book a good biography, and a great social history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great insight into a portion of this unique man","review":"Having just toured Monticello, I was intrigued to learn more about the man that conceived and built this home and the many clever mechanisms within it. The book more than fulfilled my hopes of giving substancial insight into Jefferson's mindset and rationale for the many changes he made to it. If you like learning how and why unique structures like this come to be, you'll love this book. It was as satisfying as a similar book, The Builders Behind The Castles by Taylor Coffman which covers a similar reflection on the building and constant changes to Hearst's San Simeon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Felicia Mason is good","review":"When I first started really reading black romance novels, this book was one of the many that I began reading.

I read it in one day!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"SERENITY refers to a SLOW TEMPO...","review":"The other reviews seem to have missed the point of this disc: it's simply a culled set of GG's recordings of SLOW pieces for a totally relaxed listening experience. Hence we have adagios, andandes, largos, sarabandes, etc. This follows on the heels of Karajan's Adagio series which seem to have been successful.This is a lovely set and there's nothing wrong with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really dumb idea, people","review":"Leave it to the bean counters at Sony to accomplish the previously unimaginable: reducing Bach and Glenn Gould into Muzak.If you are interested in Gould's Bach recordings, start with his '81 (not the '56) recording of the Goldberg Variations or his Partitas. His French Suites are also excellent and are among Gould's more \\"normal\\" recordings. If you just want to learn and to understand Bach, stay away from Gould. That is because Gould's Bach recordings are far from the norm, although his musical ideas are always stimulating and at times controversial. I love his Bach dearly but it is an acquired taste. Gould played Bach to challenge his listeners to rethink the composer. Gould did not play Bach so that intellectually lazy morons can listen to it while taking their bubble baths.One star for this idiotic album because Amazon's dialog box lacks the option to choose anything less.If you just want background music, try Yanni."},{"rating":"1","title":"He frickin' hums on every cut","review":"Ok, not the most sophisticated review but....

Its Athlon 64 3200+ processor is really powerful and reliable. 128MB of dedicated video on a ATI Radeon card gives you very decent 3D gaming, that is more than enough for me. You can burn DVD's, listen to music with some very powerful speakers (they are very good for a notebook), and on top of that, a 6-in-1 media card reader to check out the pics from your camera.

If you are interested in purchasing this book, be sure that you obtain the official Government Printing Office publication that is in full color. This edition is a republication with poor quality black and white scans of the book and the price is actually higher than what you can pay for the true book.

The beautiful rich and catered woman ends up working building a house with her brother's best friend whom she had an affair with. You would think there would be some excitement. Except there's none. Not even the hurricane heading for the construction site pulls enough excitment.Like Housekeeper's Daughter both charactors are really likeable and the storyline is really good but instead it just dry as a dust."},{"rating":"2","title":"cute shoes","review":"We were surprised how nice the shoes looked, they have a nice suede bottom, and they make great dress up shoes.

I was totally in awe how a man can capture every little detail of Billie Holiday's life, as well as those who were around her...those that new her the best and AT her best. He tells the truth in all of it's entirety. The information gathered to produce this book is very well written, for it gives the reader a set time that a certain event has taken place. He(the author) goes into a summary of each period to give the reader background information about people that played a part in her life. This form of writing helps the reader not only learn of the life and times of this great performer, but also helps the reader imagine what is going in her (Billie Holiday's) lifetime as you read. It's like a great movie fit into a little book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well researched biography, w/ anecdotes that steal the show","review":"Using interviews with friends/acquaintances and Holiday herself, Clarke has put to paper a methodically-researched and equally smartly distilled portrait of Holiday's life. The anecdotes, relayed in the tellers own speak, steal the show, giving true insight into Holiday's person."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Blues","review":"I approached this book hoping that it would educate me and be an interesting read. I have already seen the movie about her life and read Lady Sings The Blues, so I was hoping for a more in depth look at the lady. To be truthful, this book is not up to that challenge and throws little new light upon her life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bore me to Death","review":"I read \\"Lady Sings the Blues\\" and loved it, but once I found out that it was ghost written, I decided to find a farely accurate bio of the great Lady Day. This had the best reviews on Amazon.com, so I borrowed it from the library. Lucky for me. This book was long winded, dry, and boring. It read like a thesis paper. The quotes and anecdotes were misplaced and some had nothing to do with the passage it was featured in. Some of the stories were like listening to your Grandfather tell some gawd-aweful long story that doesn't have a single narrative. I think Clarke couldn't decide if he was writing about the times or Billy Holiday. Granted he mentioned everything under the sun to give the reader as sense of the times and culture, but there was little devoted to Billy per se. Great research, but it needed a better editor. My search continues..."},{"rating":"2","title":"I WANT MORE!!!!!","review":"As an Urban Studies and Public Policy major, many of the concepts in Cashin's book came to life for me. I believe that Cashin's book gives detailed explantion on the various structural problems in the housing market and in the school systems.

Things took a more intriguing turn when he learned the honored game of golf from a young Derrien Edwards. Adrian thought his instructor to be an accomplished young man, but when he found Derrien to be Miss Derrien Edwards, golf took on a whole new meaning for the viscount. The game of golf is a metaphor for the game of life here, and Andrea Pickens has depicted it well. The traditions are preserved, and the romance within the traditions is very interesting indeed. It's refreshing to see romance at the very beginning, with twists and turns all the way to the end just like a well designed golf course."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book for detailed sectional or thru hikes on AT","review":"There are many books about the AT, but this one is superb for it's detail and attention to partial sections for hiking.

I saw some \\"military grade\\" green laser pointers for sale, but this was less expensive and not too bulky. (I don't worry about how I look holding a small flashlight in my hand in class). As others have noted, there is only one control: you hit a button once to turn on the flashlight and twice to turn on the laser; hit it a third time to turn off. It comes with a nice nylon case and a small strap. It fits nicely in my palm. The light is bright and the laser point does tend to widen a little (although I don't have the \\"galaxy\\" pattern that someone else mentioned) with distance, but that makes it easier to see for presentations. One problem I've noted is that the button can get pressed accidentally in my bag--this happened once and nearly drained the batteries, so I had to replace them. It takes 3 AAA batteries that fit into a cartridge in the handle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid at all costs!","review":"1. After you click on the flashlight, you click again for the laser, then again to turn it off. it should have separate buttons for the two.2. beam is way too wide like a shotgun spread. not useful at all at any distance.3.

This book will help anyone who is dealing with fear and anxiety attacks. It is helpful to read what someone else has been through and to learn from their experience. I recommend it because it refers to the Bible and God who is our hope and help...because He is the best help we can get for such a problem with fear. There is peace and hope for anyone who will take the lessons in this book and apply them to their life.Hope you find your peace in this stormy life.Brenda"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational","review":"This book was an encouragement to me during my struggle to overcome panic disorder.

Not only is the sound, tempo and mood different than \\"Sleep Now\\", but overall, it's an average to below-average effort of electronica music with no feeling or true substance. It's as if he chose a rhythm, set it on repeat and layered each song with a few subtle variances. I found the music on \\"Pacifica\\" to be boring and nuetral elevator music.

This got worse with each use until it got about 8 inches from the brass ends. The holes enlarged so big that water jetted out there and little elsewhere. I have owned 3 flat sprinkler soaker hoses in my life. Each one was the harder green material and not clear like this. Each lasted about 10 years.

Some mounting tape is not gonna stick to slick surfaces no matter how much you use, but with this product, only one two-inch strip firmly held tiles I mounted above our cooktop. Midstream, I decided I wanted the tiles in a different arrangement, and it was easy to lift them off the wall, without tearing the paint, and move them.

When mounting an item, you can remove/reposition (for perfectionists like me, this is a huge plus!). Let it sit for a while and it becomes more permanent. Keep in mind that this is just foam tape, and not ideal for holding very heavy items. 3M recommends that the items you mount not exceed 2 lbs.

The same gas that runs your mower, weed whacker, chain saw, pressure washer and generator just fine. They also fail to mention that the gas cap is indeed vented. The usual repair charge is $60 but after only getting 6 difficult starting uses in less than 6 months I returned it for a refund.I have never received such rude customer service as I did from Troy-Bilt.

The blade arm is not secured sturdily enough to the body of the edger so it continuously bounces up and down and side-to-side. The bouncing causes the blade to cut into the plastic blade guard - then it stalls. Finding a metal blade guide to replce the plstic one with is impossible.

After assembling, adding oil and gas I went to pull the rope to start the engine and it would not budge an inch. I cannot believe it was allowed to come out of the factory like that.

Rather than 30 attempts to start it, it was now 15-20 attempts. I took it back to Lowe's again, and now they want to charge for the repair. Before taking it back to Lowe's the second time, I took it to a local small engine repair. They quickly diagnosed the problem as a defective carburetor and said Lowe's should warranty the repair. When the primer bulb is pushed, it should shoot gas into the carburetor throat. Mine shoots the gas onto the outside wall, no where near intot he carburetor.

Richard Neer for years seemed happy playing a narrower and narrower playlist at his NYC station. Unlike some jocks that stood up for the format by leaving for other stations where they could remain true to the early rock radio ideals, Neer just kept collecting paychecks at WNEW-FM as they became more and more what he is now writing against. And now, Neer is a talk announcer at an all-sports station, making his credibility even less for this topic.

I have several laptops that sit in docking stations, so the lock hole for most normal locks is not accessible while the laptop is in the dock. But the VGA port is on the side of the laptop so I thought that this product would be perfect. And while it came packaged nicely and looked sturdy, it was expecting the VGA port to look like ones on the back of a desktop -- protruding from the board. But on most laptops I found that the VGA port is recessed so this lock will not work. Too bad. I had high hopes. :-("},{"rating":"2","title":"Great For Big Jobs","review":"Having a large roll of plastic is so much more convenient than buying individual drop cloths.

This is not just a tale of boy meets girl, but a story of two emotionally fragile young adults who over time come to understand their own complicated histories while learning to love and trust one another. Many a romance film fall into predictable formulas, but this film is full of surprising twists and turns bringing the viewer on a journey through the challenges and healing that can develop even in the most difficult of circumstances.

Apparently the adhesive wasn't strong enough to hold it to the camera screen. Unacceptable and a total waste of money. Prior to it falling off, my observations were: 1) It's not particularly clear, and made the screen look almost sparkly, and 2) It had a lousy fit, with exposing the screen on all four sides.

It gives the oatmeal more texture and flavor.The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the cost. I was happy at first to get it on Amazon, because at my health food store it was $7, and I could get it on Amazon for about $5/bag.

It was more about how the mother is hurt and guilty about her son's death than it was about Pat. I was hoping for more about the story of why a man would give up all the money and fame to fight in the Middle East, but it was really more about anti-war and \\"I hate the government\\" from the family's perspective. Not was I was expecting. Not what I wanted."},{"rating":"1","title":"I must be missing something","review":"A family spends the entire film talking about the disgrace of this man's death being used to promote wars (uh, it was?) while they completely promote their own agenda and seem to think this was the single most important thing that's happened in the two wars. Sorry, but they didn't do their son, a genuine and decent man, any favors."},{"rating":"2","title":"a story of patriotism and american injustice","review":"A great story about a patriotic family with balls, who wouldn't be lulled into complacency about the death of their son while serving in the military.

He was dressed as a hadji and was waving his arms at troops on ground, so they shot at him thinking he was a terrorist, not one of their own. Sure he was a brave guy for forgoing the easy route (wealthiness in the NFL) and for serving his country, that is more than 99% of this country can say. But when Pat Tillman is mentioned in groups of soldiers,his name refers to someone messing up or making a stupid careless irresponsible mistake."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real Eye Opener!","review":"Coaught this documentary recently on Showtime. I did not know that much about the details of Pat Tillman's death and even less about the coverup that involved the highest defense officials in the country including our Commander-in-Chief. Terrible lies were told, not only to the Tillman family but to the American people. Selling a war to the masses is tricky business and selling an unjust war requires lies. This film documents a death that the government used to sell the war.I applaud the Tillman family for fighting for the truth. I only hope that more of these families exist in today's America. In my opinion the fight was worth it because it opened my eyes. Makes me wonder what else the government is covering up in the name of war. If ever faced with such a fight for the truth, I pray that we all can do as well as this family has done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sanding sponge!","review":"Durable and just the right amount of flexibility.

It does not contain many details but rather explains only basic plot elements for a number of films. It covers the silents up through the thirties in adequate detail, but then glosses over the 1950s and skips ahead to the seventies. It also mentions some of the greatest horror films (Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead, Texas Chainsaw Massacre) in only one sentence and describes them as \\"violent\\" films which offended many people. Horror Movies includes multiple photos of films that it barely mentions in the text. After chapters on the topic of horror films, it sums up their importance in one paragraph. Since this book was published in 1984 and obviously cannot include more recent movies, and in light of its brevity on some of the most important movies, I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A contemporary , believable love story!!","review":"Erika and Steve are a happily married Christian family with one great kid, teenager Ethan.

There was a lot of information crammed into this book. There were some good real-world examples to illustrate their points throughout the text. They were able to present both the verbal concepts as well as the mathematical models together. The graphs were numerous and useful. Math presented within the text was not as easy to follow intuitively. Concrete examples were covered in class instead.Because of how much material this book covers, I would not consider it fun leisure reading for most, but would recommend it for classes, or at least some supplemental reading if you want to apply the models.Granted, I have not seen other books on industrial organization, but I thought this was a pretty good book on its own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge disappointment...","review":"This book is full of mistakes!

The other thing that bugged me was that the leadership generally sets the tone for the organization so if the leader is a certain personality type then that will probably prevade the organization so there's no need to look at the organization's type but instead to look at leadership and see what type of culture/values they portend andthen work at that level to make change.

And when I said her voice \\"peaked\\", I used that term loosely. Her singing is terrible. But with her recent departure from the worlds biggest girl band, one cannot blame her for trying. It is just a shame that her first single had to be like this, a poorly written, poorly executed, mediocre pop tune."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is the Camera writes to buffer speed that limits you...","review":"So to answer the questions to \\"frenzel\\" and \\"Izzybee\\" none of you two would be able to utilize high transfer speed of this card nor for ie.

But by no means is this the average rock musical - senseless rock songs set to a stupid story - no, this musical has real heart squeezed into every song. The stories of these children really are the moving force to every song, though some of the songs are just meant to be fun, but such songs as \\"If I Had A Million Dollars\\" and \\"Let Me Come In\\" really let the stories from the children take the lead. \\"Sounds,\\" in my opinion, is the best song on this CD, a rock musical with a bit of jazz strewn througout.

Although the author also described the effective measures used by USAF to defend air bases in Vietnam, it is very clear that a clever enemy can use a relative small unit to harrass and even cause quite a damage to the air bases.No matter how powerful an air force is in the air, it is still very vulnerable on the ground.

The drawings in the book are beginner level, amateurish drawings and it's really sad to see that these guys are actually teaching students in an art school.Aside from the obvious lack of personal drawing skill on the authors' parts, there is a lot of bad advice from an animation drawing point of view, like too much emphasis on measuring and copying the model and a completely misunderstood/misrepresented view of the all-important line of action.Stay away from this book.

After listening to Eschenbach's fresh rendering of the Dvorak New World Symphony, I had HIGH expectations. Alas, I agree with the reviewer drawing comparisons with Otto Klemperer. To me, the pace was mostly plodding, lacking in excitement, and the overall sound was kind of muddy. Even the Haydn Variations just poked along.In fairness, I'm spoiled from listening to very best Brahms ever recorded. I'm speaking, of course, of Bruno Walter's monumental Columbia recordings from the early 1960's. Szell and Furtwangler also seemed to \\"get\\" these works.

But the book's title and cover art have already given you information Saara does not have: she has a date with destiny on the ill-fated last voyage of the luxurious RMS Empress of Ireland.En route to that May 29, 1914 date, you will find a young girl confronting the joys and tensions of family life, sibling rivalry, a father's job loss, the changing loyalties of friends, the challenges of school, and the ever-present need to scrimp and save and spend both sides of every penny.Karen Autio immerses you in the rich world of Canada's Finnish immigrant culture, giving you enough time to get to know everybody on a first name basis, before she plunges you into the cold waters near Point-au-Pere in the St. Lawrence River where 1,012 lives are lost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't even be tempted by this one","review":"It's rare that I get upset enough to actually write a review for a book, but I figured I'd better pass a warning along before other well-meaning readers get sucked into this.The full story can be found on Lynn Abbey's site...if you are interested. But the highlight is that this series was originally supposed to be at least a trilogy (although Lynn says she had it outlined through at least book 5). This book contains the first 2 books of a trilogy THAT WAS NEVER FINISHED, AND PROBABLY WON'T EVER BE! So if you like to be left hanging in the middle of a story with loose ends flying all over the place, then this is definately the book for you.

I recommend this book to everyone, regardless of your background. The author uses realistic situations that help you understand the daily walk with God's love. The author is very down-to-earth, understanding, sarcastic, and captivating enough to keep me reading until the very last chapter.

It is incredibly well written, and the subject could not be more interesting. I will admit to being absolutely exalted over her victories, and crying bitterly over her wrongs and death. I am not very religious, so don't think that by saying this I am trying to win you over to Joan's faith. That isn't it at all.

Yes, this is supposed to be Mark Twains masterpiece, but, at least to this reviewer, it does not even come close the Twains masterpiece Huckleberry Finn.Perhaps it I read this book before September 11th, I would had fared better. But the French have lost their soul. Even though in Joan we find a Frenchman (or should I say, a French woman) who has integrity and is willing to fight and die for a righteous cause, all what the French do now is irritate me."},{"rating":"2","title":"What do you believe?","review":"Reviews of this work seem to split. Some call it a quite boring book, expecting perhaps something more akin to Twain's more famous writing. Others consider it excellent storytelling and a tribute to the famous saint and symbol. The 800 pound gorilla on the couch that no one seems to mention, however, is the religious nature of the narrative. Do you or do you not accept that Joan was visited and guided by angels? If you do, then the story holds together wonderfully as a tribute to the purity of spirit of Joan. If you don't accept the angelic visions and visitations, the story comes off as an unbelievable fawning over the young woman. In other words, what you make of the book may largely depend on what you bring to it. Twain's characteristic humor and irony come through in a few careful places, showing the unmistakeable skill and intelligence of the author. While wonderfully writtena and excellent storytelling, this is a very different read than most of Twain's other work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle edition is riddled with OCR errors","review":"This is the first Kindle book published by Ignatius Press I have purchased (and I have purchased many) that is riddled with typographical errors.

With almost reverent respect for Twain, I beg to differ. While claiming no great expertise on the historical figure of Joan of Arc, this work falls far short of giving any sort of objective description of her life or accomplishments. This work falls more along the lines of sugar-coated heroine worship suitable for a 10 year old than it does a historical narrative of a live human being.Mark Twain was a first-rate story teller and humorist. Few have risen to his level. Unfortunately, he mixed his inclination for a good story with historical fact and the result is neither a good story nor historical fact.There is good reason that this is a little known work of Twain's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hippy Dippy And Uninteresting","review":"Ugh. I got this book expecting to read about a courageous young girl and what I got was just a boring account on how sugary sweet and hippy dippy she was.

It was also very uninteresting and I would have gotten more entertainment out of reading my neighbor's grocery list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joan the greatest","review":"Some folks dont get what Twain was trying to do, he did something that no one else has ever done for Joan of Arc, he has breathed life into the young woman we read about in the pages of history and made it come alive. the information contained in this book is correct, not made up. the was the true Joan of Arc. the new movie: the messenger, is an affront to this book, where this book shows the sprituality of Joan, the movie leaves you wondering if she was sane. Mark Twain respected and revered Joan above all other women, including, much to the chagrin of the publishers, Mary.

There are a number of good books on the subject, \\"Evil in Modern Thought\\" and \\"A Problem from Hell,\\" are two that I recommend highly.Morrow's book is, however, in a class by itself, because of the way he directs questions of morality to the reader so that you have little choice, but to get personally involved in his exposition. This, in my view, is the whole point of studying the matter.I find the smug and condescending review by Publishers Weekly to be excruciatingly irritating and suggest that the reviewer should take a hard look at his or her own objectivity. Morrow's book is incredibly thoughtful and deserves a wide audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ethnic And Exotic Rules The Day!","review":"This DVD is a collection of 10 music video much like what you would see on MTV only this collection consists of songs/videos you definitely will not see on American television.

David Stern simply inserted the tradition Hebrew words for various Jewish cultural events (Pesach for Passover...), reinserted the Jewish names of the disciples and other individuals mentioned, but in fact this is a very Baptist translation of the New Testament. I would recommend \\"A Jewish Annotated New Testament\\" if you really want a truly Jewish perspective on the New Testament."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jewish New Testament","review":"I love this translation because it uses the real names of the people in the bible, such as, Yeshua which is the real name of Jesus. Or for instance, Ruach-HaKodesh (Holy Spirit) or talmid (disciple)etc. Where these original names are used, there english meanings are printed in the lower right corner of the right page. That was a great asset considering that in the Complete Jewish Bible if you didn't know one of these names, you had to look it up in the glossary each time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clearly Based upon Mistranslations","review":"This text claims to correct \\"mistranslations\\" such as Romans 10:4 (\\"the goal at which the Torah aims,\\" rather than \\"the end of the law\\"). One need look no further than than the original Greek text, which clearly demonstrates that it is rightly translated as is found in orthodox (orthodox as in \\"right belief,\\" not the Orthodox Church) translations. A first semester Greek student can easily recognize this.One should research this prior to purchasing this book, as this is a very simple method to prove that this text is written from a biased standpoint. This is curious, as the book itself claims to correct an \\"anti-Jewish theological bias\\" found in orthodox translations.If it is truth you seek, do a little research on your own. Do not take my word for it... this is a simple issue to debunk. The truth is obvious here, and if one tries to find it, one will find it within five minutes of simple research."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading There is no 'Jewish' New Testament","review":"This review is not meant to offend Christians and believers in the New Testament.However it is dishonest to speak of a 'Jewish New Testament'.Why, because there is no Jewish 'New Testament' Jews have had to go through generations of persecution, efforts to force to convert us to Christianity. We constitute a small percentage of the people of the world, less than two - tenths of one percent. One out of every three human beings on earth is a Christian.'Judaism is based on what Christians called the Old Testament plus the Oral Torah, the Mishna and the Gemara.

I cannot believe the \\"Reader from Oklahoma\\" actually READ the book. If you are going to review the book -- please Read the book! Your comments are pure gobbledygook!

You didn't read the book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spiritually insightful but too much emphasis on the Cold War","review":"Kengor's book is well reseached and provides tremendous insight into Reagan's faith. His emphasis on the Cold War is overdone. At points, I thought I was reading a book about the Cold War instead of one about Reagan's faith. He could have eliminated 50 pages of Reagan's passion to end the Cold War and the reader would have still understood Kengor's points and the magnitude of this issue. Finally, the book is written more like a textbook as opposed to a biography, but still a must read for any Reagan fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that interesting","review":"Hmm a book on Ronald Reagan's spiritual side. Maybe I was hoping against hope that it would not start with the premise that Ronnie was this Centuries greatest President, no such luck with this master piece. We all know the strengths of the great man but with this book we get to look at them all over again in a religious light, I wasn't impressed with the tone or insights of the book (there aren't any apart from what you've already read in the other reviews). Maybe as I'm not a great fan of Ron it was never going to be too interesting but I expected something more than what I got, which was well researched, reasonably well written and non-offensive to those of a more left wing persuasion, but still rates as one of the tamest most sycophantic books I have ever read.

I originally bought this because I had been searching for a good recording of Narcissus. I first bought the Narcissus MP3 from Amazon, then later bought the entire CD.I grew up in the 50's and this is the sort of music my mother played on our piano (I'm still looking for a recording of Majesty of the Deep).

I'm pleased to report that the fix is simple.Shanghai II runs under Windows XP just fine, Windows 2000 as well. What it requires is that the game reside and run off a *DOS* formatted drive! So you must either pop in a second, smaller drive and format it for DOS, or do as I did - simply partition off a 300MB portion of my HD system and format that with extended 32-bit DOS.

In trying to squeeze too many cultures living in too broad of a time frame in just one regular sized book, the reader is just confused on the relation between the choices of cultures displayed. Most of the individual sections are just too short to show the coinage and much less the history of these peoples. One should approach this book as a long, long magazine article that presents some non classical cultures and just that. It is not even a book, as the others in the series are, that entices you to look deeper into the bibliography and that at least gives you the 'big picture'. This book only succeeds in confusing and making the coinage of those already almost unknown cultures a little bit more obscure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black Classic 11 Stethoscope","review":"This product works as advertised.

The provinces are very different from Manila. I got more of a sense of the author's dread and foreboding than much insight into what really happened, or into the cultural, political and economic background to the murders.James Hamilton-Paterson writes much more insightful books about the Philippines."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Good Fiction writer","review":"The book is a great work of fiction. Let it be known that Berlow most probably did not spend so much time researching.I hail from Negros Occidental and know the Gatuslaos (the family he constantly lambasts) very well. It is quite unfair that the author continuously makes up stories about incidents that never happened and describes people very wrongly. All, while he portrays everything to be factual as he promotes a very communistic and radical ideology."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate and irresponsible","review":"Alan Berlow is a good writer, he is detailed and you can easily picture yourself in the locations he describes. I think he can be a very good fiction writer, which is essentially what Dead Season is. I am a Philippine resident and I have read similiar accounts of the events Berlow mentioned. Yes, there are cover ups and the usual government corruption, but what I think was foul was his irresponsible descriptions of some people, which brings no value, except picture Berlow as a racist."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Ben, It's Ben","review":"I have to disagree with Mr. Tapscott's review to the extent of who makes the disk really worthwhile. I love Teddy Wilson's graceful piano, but here he is somewhat limited by his rhythm section, and even with his marvelous touch there seem to be times that he is just going through the motions. That is, until Ben Webster appears and the temperature rises appreciably. \\"Mellotone\\" and \\"Ben's Blues\\" are just delightful, but you should go straight to \\"Stardust\\" and \\"I Can't Give You Anything But Love.\\" The former, played without the verse, is both tender and powerful, completed by a final tenor saxophone cadenza that will test your woofer's capabilities. The latter is Webster playing this light-hearted medium-tempo piece as a serious love song, and I would think that every woman dreams of a suitor so ardent and slyly suggestive. The only thing wrong with this disk is that Webster should have entered much earlier, as he drives Wilson to show that fire can underlay elegance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not get into this book.","review":"In the past I have always enjoy her early books.

I am not clinically depressed, so you don't have to be to benefit from this CD, but I would definitely give this to my friends who are.

My daughter received this cassette player for her 3rd birthday ... and as the family, young & old, gathered around to listen to music, we were shocked to hear Outkast singing about sex and another group singing about teenage boy fantasies. I am appalled. This toy is going back to the store AND I am filing a complaint with SPECTRA (the maker of this toy). It's a crime that this toy company is marketing sex to preschoolers. Here's a thought for Spectra toy makers - how about selling and marketing a SSC toy with SSC songs?! Proceed with caution!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Think before you market (Where's the zero rating?)","review":"As a teacher and a parent of an eight year old who would like this item (and whose daughter happens to fall within the company's recommended age level) I am appalled at the lack of thought and responsibility that went into the production of the music that accompanies this product. As sickly sweet and boring (to adults) that some children's music can seem, suggestive lyrics are not appropriate or appreciated by this parent. On top of that, carcinogenic substances don't belong on items intended to be touched by human beings, especially ones that are still developing. This is one item that will not end up under our tree."},{"rating":"1","title":"Appalled and Song Artist and Lyrics","review":"I agree with the previous reviewer. This is totally inappropriate music for any toddler, child, teenager or young adult. I am shocked that Toys R Us would sell such a product that includes obscene lyrics to young children. The manuacturer needs to recall all the products immediately and replace the cassette tape. Otherwise, my 3 year olds loves the idea of singing along with another tape of her favorite songs and getting the family to join in with her. If it wasn't for the cassette of obscene lyrics, I'd give this a higher rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Believe me I owned this toy!","review":"I bought this toy for my daughter a while ago. I thaught it was cute, but the songs on the cassettes are inappropriate for young children.

And it's an Oster, which I thought was a trustworthy brand. I bought it in December, and after about five months we noticed it began to toast unevenly. One side of the bread would be toasted to perfection and the other side would still be soft. I got to looking inside of it as it was toasting and noticed that, while all of the heating elements in the middle of the toaster worked, the ones on the outsides were almost completely dark. Which explained the uneven toasting. So, two stars because it's a sharp-looking toaster, and because while it worked it worked fine, but crapped out after only a few months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lever now won't stay down...after 4 toast cycles...","review":"I don't think I broke the darn thing, but after 4 toast cycles..in like 5 days now...the lever will no longer keep the toast down, and the button LEDs no longer light.

The only issue I have with it is that the white letters are starting to wear off near some of the buttons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works perfectly; looks great","review":"I bought this from Target (Amazon was sold out) with some trepidation, since several reviewers said it worked poorly. Many said it only toasted one side of the bread or bagel. However I decided to take a chance since it got some good reviews, too, and it looks really cool. The short power line is no problem if, like most people, you've got outlets near your countertop. It toasts evenly and perfectly. It accommodates thin bread slices and fat bagels. It has plenty of features, all of which work, at a surprisingly low price. I strongly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG disappointment!","review":"This toaster is sooo bad that I returned the first one thinking I got a lemon.(Hoping because I love the shiny red)It only toasts on one side. It takes two times and usually it burns. Features are nice but.... All I want is even toasting and I have never even had one piece of good toast. Going for ratings next time not color."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty but broke on third use.","review":"This toaster is very nicely styled and seems to be well designed.

It does not toast consistently, either under-toasting or burning, even if it's on the same \\"number\\". Sometimes it toasts on one side, but not the other. I just want toasted bread and I don't want to pay $300 for a Dualit, is that asking too much?!?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Inconsistent and Unpredictable","review":"Inconsistent and unpredictable toasting on ANY of the settings. It's a gamble every time we try to toast (room temp or frozen) bread, bagels, waffles, or our coveted Poptarts. Sadly, we've burned enough food to feed a small nation. You pretty much have to monitor the entire toasting process. We strive for a medium golden \\"toast\\" result; not too light or dark. The middle setting barely produces a very light toast so we toast it a second time on the lowest setting and if we don't watch it and pop it up every 10 seconds to check, the toast is burned! We've experimented with the entire range of settings. The only consistency we get is BURNED food! Don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Already broken!","review":"Bought this toaster less than two months ago and it's already broken. The control buttons (one of the reasons why we bought it) are not functioning, neither is the darkness control knob. Once it's put into the toast position, it does not shut off, you have to push up the lever manually. My son put in some Toaster Swirls only to set off the smoke alarm.

Both across a slice AND between the 2 slots.Settings change from use to use - say I used \\"5\\" for an English muffin, next time the \\"5\\" setting will result in a different degree of toasting.Unfortunate, because I do like the color.Back it goes, luckily I saved the box and the receipt.Note - not purchased from Amazon, but I doubt it would make any difference, other than Amazon's ease of return/replacement - I am happy with all my purchases here.P.S.

Plenty of room in the slots for bagels or thick-sliced bread. Nice row of indicator lights.CON: Performance was terrible. From the mid-point on the dial down to the number 2 setting, one side of the bread was brown and the other assorted shades of black. The lowest number produced nothing.

Hope you fare better than we did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best toaster I've ever had!","review":"Super toaster. After years of mediocre toasters (including another Oster), we've finally got one that works like it's supposed to.It evenly toasts the bread on both sides, does it just right. The warm function is great - just press the button & it keeps your toast warm if it pops up before you're ready for it.Toasting bread properly shouldn't be rocket science - but it seems so hard to get a good, reliable toaster these days. This one does it just like it should. Finally.It also looks great. Love the red! I believe it also comes in silver (or at least I saw that one offered at Target along with this red one).The only negative I can find is that the crumb tray slides out from the back. Since that's the side facing my wall, that's a bit awkward. But, honestly, I don't empty the crumb tray all that often anyway, so it's not much of a drawback.If you're looking for a toaster that won't have you pulling your hair out, get this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Stylish!","review":"Out toaster of over 10 years died last weekend and while we were shopping at Target we saw this \\"retro\\" looking toaster and fell in love with the look..Now we weren't sure how this toaster was going to operate but we were somewhat familiar with the Oster reputation and decided to take the plunge..Well let me tell you..not only does this toaster look cool but it can certainly toast up a storm and beautifully too! There are preset buttons on the front of the toaster that allows you to make perfect toast or bagels every time! In the past we used to toast out bagels in our toaster oven which was kind of cumbersome but with this toaster the bagels come out perfectly every time!! The toaster looks great in the kitchen..takes up hardly any space and has that cool \\"retro\\" feel to it..It comes in red, copper and brushed chrome..we ended up getting the red one. What a deal! So if you're in need of a new toaster you can't lose with this gem!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"Toasted unevenly.

Also the characters including the hero spent an inordinate amount of time swilling down vast amounts of alcohol and drugs - how any of them managed to stand up, much less get out of bed the next day, is beyond me.

And lots of fine observations . . . what you'd expect from a poet. Yet the novel is flat, bereft of narrative energy, its characters nuanced but uncompelling. I've read all Leithauser's novels, and my favorite is his quasi-autobiographical book about young Americans in Japan, \\"Equal Distance.\\" Ever since that book, it seems to me that he's been searching for themes and characters worthy of his talent. Alas, what's missing here, despite his best efforts, is a good story.

My parents Braun hand blender costs a bit more but they've had it for about 7 years and we use it all the time and it still works very well.Plus a minor complaint, the cup for blending that comes with this is a little too wide so food and sneak by and not get blended, plus it splashes more easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"Results count","review":"I gave this to my wife as an early Christmas present and I was glad I did.

On plugging the blender in for the first time and placed the stick in my jar of mayonnaise and pressing the button there was a loud bang - it blew up and black came through the blender machine. I have now been told that one must not purchase electrical products from America because they do not work in New Zealand. It would be a great help if I had been told this before I purchased. I am totally devastated because I am a pensioner who has saved for this machine and it is of no use to me now. Is it possible that you can be of any help in providing a replacement machine for New Zealand use.I look forward to hearing from you.Kind regards,Andrea"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cuisinart CSB-76BC","review":"I gave this as a gift because the receipient specifically requested this immersion hand blender. I did investigate this and other hand blenders at a store, and would not have chosen this one for myself or anyone because it makes far too much noise. Otherwise, it appears well-made and is a suitable size. There are other brands that cost slightly more that do operate very quietly, and that for me is the single most important criteria for owning and using one of these. I personally feel that the Cuisinart brand of kitchen appliances does not offer the quality and value of several other brands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate this blender","review":"Yes, another review from a finger emergency. My daughter got 7 stitches after her run in with this blender. Although it is a safety issue, that is NOT the reason for the negative review.

The blender was wonderful when I first bought it and then, poof, it stop working (2x). I too thought it operated so well at first that I bought another one thinking that the first was just a lemon. As another reviewer wrote the drive shaft stopped working on both. The motor turns, just as powerfully as before, but something is broken in the stick and it doesn't turn the blades, which makes it useless. I have always thought quite highly of Cuisinart, but after purchasing two Cuisinart SmartStick Hand Blenders, I do not hold Cuisinart in high esteem any longer. I also purchased one of their coffee makers for Christmas - grind and brew all in one pot and had to bring it back because it was defective (the basket kept popping open during brewing). So, I will no longer be purchasing Cuisinart products, especially this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another disappointment from cuisinart","review":"I like my cuisinart food processor, and foolishly bought other cuisanart products that all, every one, proved to be junk.This immersion blender has a soft plastic hex bolt that fits into a soft plastic nut.

I had such high hopes for it after researching immersion blenders extensively. I had a Philips for years that would power through anything but is no longer made. What caused the demise of this blender? A blueberry and not a frozen one. Somehow it got caught between the blade and the wall and completely stripped the poorly designed plastic housing unit where the blade portion and the motor meet. Shouldn't a metal blade be able to easily cut through a tiny piece of fresh fruit?Four months, that's it! I suppose if you're simply pureeing already cooked soup, you'll be fine but I would not recommend this for smoothies (even un-frozen ones)or for anything un-cooked - those pesky blueberries. Frustrating, to say the least!On the plus side...the color was cute."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't pollute the planet","review":"Don't buy this blender if you want device that will last long. Because of it plastic connector to the motor it will stop working soon and you will end up throwing it away and buying new one. Mine stopped working after 2 years of occasional use. Thanks to the warranty I returned it to Costco and got my money back. Since I didn't use it that often I decided not to buy another one, but use regular blender and food processor that I already have. I dont miss it. I sent email to Cuisinart customer support and expalined that product has major design flaw. They gracefully promised \\"to look into that\\". Every time in the store when I see their immersion blender on the shelf I check the connector design. It is remains same - plastic. Recently I send email to Consumer reports and they were sympathetic. Not sure if they will do anything. But you can do for sure. DON'T BUY IT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted less than 6 months","review":"We've had a very bad experience with this blender. After not even six months of mild use, the body and the bottom part do not lock together anymore so we had to throw it out as there is no way to open it and try to fix it.

I will write back later after more time passes to note how durable it is.From my experience with this product, it is both easy to use and easy to clean. We use it often in my household to make shakes and mix soups. It has taken the place of our food processor and blenders in these cases, and is so much easier to clean than the other two. We simply detach the blender from the handle and run the blade under water.One last point to make, this is an item easy to store as it doesn't take up much space.- Easy to use.- Easy to clean.- Easy to store.- Affordable quality.Very happy with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gave as Christmas gift","review":"Gave to my daughter-in-law for Christmas.

I will never buy another one of your products.I am now researching better immersion blenders.

Upon reviewing the item description, it does say in the fine print \\"This Brushed Chrome SmartStick Hand Blender is made from ABS housing\\". Well in my book Chrome is metal and ABS is plastic.

Works great.For the unfortunate people who have been injured by this product, I sympathize. The good thing about them giving a one star rating is that it draws attention to the fact that the power button is easily depressed and if you are trying to remove something from the blade you could activate the switch without even realizing it till it's too late. NEVER put your fingers near the bottom unless it is unplugged! EVER! In fact don't even do that when it's unplugged."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheesy plastic faux-metal housing","review":"Got one from this site about a month ago. So far it's been used to make baby food, cream soups, and \\"froth\\" milk for lattes. It does fine chopping smaller chunks of food, but doesn't work well to aerate liquids (as suggested in product literature) no matter how shallow or deep it's submerged. The blade assembly snaps off the motor handle easily, but the cheap plastic housing and button make me worry about it breaking w/in the year. As with most other Made-in-China items, the \\"brushed stainless/ metal\\" finish of the motor housing is actually plastic; had I known, I'd have just gone with the usual white plastic. The included plastic blender cup is nice for smaller jobs. For the price I was expecting a little better manufacture."},{"rating":"2","title":"powerful and easy to clean","review":"this is my second birthday-gift-immersion-blender.

This has proven to be a great time saver and my favorite appliance. The stainless attachment is so easy to clean and the unit is powerful enough for all of my applications. Run in in clean water and voila, its clean. I love it so much and you can't beat the price. I just bought one for a friend. The measuring cup it comes with is really handy to mix in, great for smoothies too. For really small volumes it does no work so well, but then it would not be called an \\"immersion\\" blender. It might though, if you ground down the guards, but then it would be crazy dangerous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short lifespan","review":"I purchased this blender for my parents back in late 2008. The average usage is about 10-15 minutes everyday in blending cottage cheese and flaxseed oil. It suddenly stopped working for no reason after about a year. When I called customer care, they sent me a replacement and I was happy about the service. The replacement blender stopped working last week (after about another 18 months). I was told by customer care this time that the replacement was under the warranty of my original purchase - which is 3 years and it just expired 3 months ago (based on my purchase date on the receipt). I was quite disappointed at the quality of the product and even disappointed by the warranty policy. Would I buy this blender again? No. Would I trust Cuisinart to stand by their products? No."},{"rating":"1","title":"plz show more realistic pics","review":"None of the photos show that this is actually plug in, rather than battery operated.

Then this morning, the one I replaced it with, which gets daily use making babyfood and smoothies for my kids--the razor sharp serrated blades came off while making their food. Thank god it was just as it started--if it had stopped blending when most of it was blended up, I could have unknowingly served the blades to my kids.

Powerful, easy, everything you want. HOWEVER, mine broke after four months of use in our house. (Too late to return to Amazon). Nothing commercial, nothing harsh. The \\"Limited Three Year Warranty\\" requires that I send the unit back to Cuisinart along with $10.00 for \\"handling.\\" When you figure all the cost involved, its just about as cheap to replace as to use the \\"warranty\\". I will be choosing another brand for replacement and hope that either their product is more durable or their warranty isn't as poor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Disposable Gadget","review":"This was a wonderful kitchen appliance for about 2 weeks. Then it stopped working. I would rather pay moremoney and get a longer lasting unit than settle for this cheap piece of junk. I thought Cuisinart was supposedto be a good brand. It couldn't whip my cottage cheese, keffir and flax oil concoction without burning out. (We'retalking about the consistency of yogurt here...)I hope Cuisinart re-tools this thing because it could be a really handy kitchen gadget if it had a long life.This is the first online review I've ever done.

I hope these reviews we do raise the bar for ALL PRODUCTS and make manufacturers produce higher quality consumer goods. Especially brand names such as Cuisinart. What were they thinking?"},{"rating":"1","title":"LOVED it until it broke WAY TOO SOON!!!","review":"Let me preface my comments by telling you that I am a Cuisinart fan and a stick blender convert. My disappointment here is that Cuisinart has let me down with a shoddy product that used to work well; now, after only 1.5 years of minimal, lightweight use, their stick blender has let me down!Although most of the small appliances that I own are Cuisinart, and they have been wonderful and dependable and I love them, the first stick blender that I ever bought was an inexpensive Braun model. It worked well, was not fancy, easily made smoothies and pureed soups (which is all I wanted it to do), and it lasted for about 7 years. When it was time to replace the Braun, I decided to go with this model of Cuisinart's inexpensive stick blender; it has performed just like the Braun, which is all I needed, and done the same tasks, which is all that I wanted it to do. However, the Cuisinart stick blender only lasted 1.5 years! What a bust!"},{"rating":"1","title":"broke after less than 2 year of use, warranty useless","review":"Before buying this blender I had owned a Kitchenaid hand blender, which gave out after 3 or 4 years of use. When I went to buy a new one the Cuisinart model was cheaper, so I figured I would give it a try. I don't think it's ever performed as well as my Kitchenaid model, and the plastic cup it came with started cracking and leaking after a year or so of being put in the dishwasher. The plastic cup my Kitchenaid blender came with is still going strong. But I was still reasonably satisfied with the Cuisinart blender until it died today, after a year and 8 months of using it once or twice a week. Cuisinart says they have a 3-year warranty but the fine print is you have to pay to have it shipped back plus send them a check for $10 to cover shipping the other way. It's not worth my time!

However, I was looking for a good milkshake mixer, and this item will NOT mix ice cream - - NO MATTER HOW SOFT THE ICE CREAM IS. Apparently, I had too high expectations for this thing and the reviews were so great I thought it might work. It DOES NOT.

The only thing negative that I noticed is that it doesn't really pull the product up into it's blades.

I asked why if it had only been 5 months why I should I pay anything. I was told that since it is a low cost item it is cost prohibitive to charge the shipping both ways. If it was a $500 item they would pay the shipping. The shipping would be the same cost as buying a brand new one.

All was well until the wand portion rolled onto the floor. Although there is no visible sign of damage, the unit no longer turns. I contacted Cusinart, told them what happened with the hopes they might offer me the opportunity to purchase a new wand section. Had I lied and told them it just stopped working, they might have covered it under warranty. In telling the truth and in finding that I can not purchase the replacement wand, I find I have spent $29.95 for nothing. A manufacture that doesn't offer the opportunity to purchase replacement parts has taken planned obsolescence a little too far in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"stopped working after 4 uses","review":"Was happy to get it and start blending for guacamole and hummus. The 4th time (about 6 months later) the thing started stopping intermittently and then completely quit. Sometimes it will kick on for a few seconds just to tease me.

I've had this for about 6 months and use it very frequently. It makes quick work of any fruit/veg/nut concoction that you can dream up. The blade part pops off very easily to rinse off after each use so cleanup takes no more than a couple of minutes. I also think the price is great for such a quality item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of Cuisinart Hand Blender","review":"I have owned a Cuisinart Hand Blender with the chopper attachment for about a year and a half. The chopper quit after three uses (gears were stripped) and the stick blender only lasted for about 10 uses, also a stripped gear problem. I returned the product card when I received this item (Dec. 2010) but since it was a gift, I do not have a receipt. Cuisinart refuses to stand behind their three year warranty as I do not have a proof of purchase. Why bother to return the product card if they don't recognize it? So, if you expect your stick blender or chopper to stand up to ordinary kitchen use for more than six months, avoid this product. Better still, avoid all Cuisinart products as they will not honor their warranty. You will be wasting your money. Look for another company; Kitchen Aid comes to mind. They care about their customers and provide a quality product. I would not give any stars but it's the only choice I have."},{"rating":"2","title":"So glad I bought this!","review":"I don't know why I put off buying this for so long!

I've really gotten in to a healthy life style recently and the main reason I wanted an immersion blender was for all these great lowfat, low carb soup recipes I've found. First thing I made was an all fruit smoothie with just a little yogurt to add creaminess and some ice to keep it cold. The SmartStick worked beyond expectations! I did crush up the ice a little bit per the booklets recommendation, but I'm not sure it's all that necessary.. Probably helps reduce ice chunks. Anyway, I love it so far and you can't beat the price for the quality!

The motor was still working great on the braun after 10 years, however the cord started to fray and split from the unit. So I bought this one. It has plenty of power and seems really smooth. Its a little looser since its two pieces instead of one solid piece like the braun.

Only the 3/4th of the attachment seems to be metal. The connection assembly is also plastic. The whole blender is quite cheap looking. Hence the negative reviews about this item not being sturdy. I shouldn't have disregarded it before I purchased this item. Absolutely FALSE advertising. Cuisinart and Amazon should be ashamed of themselves. It works well, but I don't know how long it will last to be honest. $30 I spend is too much for this blender."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy drive","review":"As in a previous review the drive shaft connection on my blender sheared after six uses.

It was difficult to use and cumbersome to hold. It worked a few times for mixing liquids, then died and only hummed.I didn't bother trying to return it. The price of the postage wasn't worth the trouble. It made a quick trip to the dumpster instead.I had purchased a cheapo stick blender years ago, which got lost in a move and had thought to replace it with this.

Firstly, the threads for the connection wear out really quickly (leaving you wondering why there is black dust in the unit), and the plastic connector also breaks easily. I've had two of these already and they both broke within a year. Don't bother (unless you just want to use it 2 or 3 times and then throw it away, as in that case, it works great)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it.","review":"Got this as a gift and I love it.The main thing I use it for is juicing up bananas. I have a juicer, which can murder anything you put in it - apples, oranges, celery, carrots. I use the cup this blender came with to catch the juice. When it's 3/4 full, I put in a cut up banana, then go to town with this hand blender thing. It's amazing. In no time flat the banana is decimated and the drink is just amazing. I love it.I've also used this for big pots of soup when you need to break everything down. I also made a killer broccoli and cheese soup with it.-I love this thing because it's quick to use and easy to clean. That's it. There's no clunky blender to drag out, no annoying thing to clean. I usually just rinse it off and it's fine. I live in a condo and space is limited, and so this thing is awesome to keep tucked away until I need it. I can't recommend it enough.

I made a slow cooker spicy/sweet corn soup, which blended up perfectly smooth and creamy in no time at all, without the hassle of the usual cooling/moving to blender/returning to pot/reheating. Can't wait to make potato-leek soup using this. I also really like how it froths up the milk to turn my morning coffee into a latte and also looking forward to making morning smoothies, when the warm weather returns, too.

I've only used it twice, though. I used it to make carrot soup--easy peasy, and I was able to get just the texture I was looking for (not completely smooth)--and to make non-traditional apricot, fig and hazelnut mince pies. For the latter, I chopped the dried fruit and toasted nuts by hand first, and made sure to blend in short bursts. I was a bit concerned that the texture might be a bit much for the blender to handle but the banana and orange juice provided enough moisture/liquid to keep things moving. It worked a treat. It's really easy to clean after use, even when it's been used to make something really sticky (like the mince pie filling). I'm delighted with it so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love love love it!","review":"I am completely satisfied with this product. I love that the blade and shaft separate from the motor/body.

If you buy it, put the receipt where it is easily accessible, cuz you'll probably need it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice little blender","review":"I was pretty skeptical after reading someone say that a 200 watt immersion blender wouldn't be very powerful; they were wrong. We bought this primarily to make baby food and it has quickly reduced apples, pears, carrots, etc to a perfect consistency. We're now excited about using it for our cooking as well. We have owned it for about 3 months without any problems. It feels solid, I have no reason to believe it will die anytime soon. Overall very happy with this, it has proven my doubts wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it! Works Great!","review":"I just rec'd this item. I've made several milkshakes & creamed asparagus soup.

It is quiet, it works well, and I'm wondering how I ever lived without it.Though I've given in 5 stars, I almost gave it 4 just because of a few small details. Many immersion blenders are multi speed and this is only on/off. Some come with attachments for whisking and chopping. This does not.

Absolutely useless and a total waste of money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"HAND CLEAN vs DISH WASHER","review":"After reading some reviews, I feel this is an important piece to some of the failures of the mixer. In my instruction book (the one no one reads) On cleaning it stated DO NOT place in a dish washer, which is why mine failed after placing in the dish washer multiple times, the shaft on the blade end started to become harder to turn, thus when place together with the motor end placed greater stress on the junction between the two. (The plastic piece that strips/breaks) Causing it to break or fail. Not 100% sure if the rubber seals were effected or the metal shaft was effected in some way.Overall it was a excellent mixer, and if I just took the time to HAND CLEAN it, I'd still be using it today. Looking forward to trying this again.Just goes to show, taking a little extra time to take care of your kitchen tools they'll last longer, and read instructions - I did but was dumb and dismissed the hand wash line. Hope this helps all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very satisfied","review":"We're very happy with this blender.

Throw some frozen fruit and yogurt in the cup, jab it with the wand for a few presses of the button, and voila! Your healthy completely smooth creamy blended breakfast is ready. Rinse the removable half of the wand in water, leave it in the sink, and you are off to school or work! When you come home later and catch up on dishes, you will find it is as easy as cleaning a fork or spoon to get the SmartStick ready for the next day's use. I CAN'T say the same for my blender which takes forever to dismantle and is waaaaay too bulky for a simple morning smoothie. Do yourself a favor and get this for quick simple blends. If you need to mix batter, or do heavy cooking - this can get you by if you are patient enough to let the motor cool off - but you are better off with a traditional blender for the biggies. Get this for the easy quick stuff. And its no vita-mixer. You can't just throw in un-chopped fruit. So be realistic."},{"rating":"2","title":"My New Favorite Kitchen Gadget","review":"I bought this immersion blender to use to make my own baby food. After using it to make my first batch, I was sold.

I've also used the KitchenAid stick blender which costs at least $25 more, but this Cuisinart has worked just as well for my needs. I've used it to blend large batches of soup and also to make smoothies in a cup. It is definitely not as heavy duty as the KitchenAid and only has one speed. The top housing is a very light weight plastic as are the buttons and that makes it feel a little cheap.

I am completely satisfied with this purchase. I was amazed the first time I used it and I now look for recipes that I can create with this. It is an enjoyable experience.Edited for additional information on 14 October 2010:After using this hand blender heavily, it developed a high pitched grinding noise when running. To fix this and restore the original operation, just squirt a small amount of WD-40 down the inside of the shaft. Run the hand blender for a few seconds in the normal, upright operating position while the WD-40 works into the bearings. Once it reaches the bearings, the noise will immediately disappear. Try not to use too much WD-40 as you don't want excess oil leaking through the shaft into the food. I'm attaching a picture of me squirting the oil in the product images so you can see where to apply the squirt of WD-40.WD-40 11005 Lubricant, Aerosol Can with Smart Straw, 8 Fluid Ounce, 3\\" OD, 2.63\\" Length"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent blender!","review":"This filled my need for a compact yet powerful blender for making smoothies.

I am surprised they haven't pulled it from the market because it is designed to fail.The problem is PLASTIC: it will not stand up to use, even over a short period of time. Those who have not used the product long will no doubt give it a glowing review, but it won't be long before the plastic wears down and the device will no longer work.Indeed, the \\"chopper\\" attachment which came with my purchase NEVER worked.

The company is also not very helpful in responding to complaints I guess that are totally embarrassed by the poor quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breaks after a few months of light usage","review":"If I could give this product a zero, I would. Worked wonderfully the first dozen times I used it. Then it slowly started coming disconnected at the hinge and finally it would not stick at all. The blade would work half of the time.

Rolling up the cord and sticking it in a drawer is no great chore, but after the convenience of pulling it off the wall with just enough cord to stay out of the way of other things on the countertop spoiled me. My regular use of a hand mixer like this makes me really want it ready to grab. I wouldn't mind buying a mount if it were available as an option. Now I'll have to rig something up.One thing I do like over the Braun is that the mixing part of the device comes off and away from the motor portion for easy washing.I'd say \\"Buy it.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the trick!","review":"Very nice tool to have in the kitchen.

After 6 months it began to make horrible screeching noises. They became worse and worse. The unit never ceased to function, but the accompanying noise made using it impossible to tolerate. I paid to have the unit exchanged ($10, plus me shipping the unit to them). The new unit arrived quickly and new in box. It worked great. For 5 months.

Very powerful. Works great to make cream soup too. This practically eliminates the need for a full size blender. A lot less clean-up too."},{"rating":"1","title":"single motor speed","review":"The motor only has one high speed so if you are not submerging the head in a sufficient depth of a sufficiently viscous solution, it will splatter everywhere. For example, I tried to blend a couple cups of liquid in a mixing bowl with high sides and it made a mess because it could not go slow enough. Maybe it's better in a deep cup but that reduces the tool's flexibility in food preparation. I have a Bosch hand drill bought new for the same price as this blender and it has variable motor speed, two gear speed ranges, forward and reverse, more torque, and more interchangeable elements available for it. Cuisinart is selling a twelve dollar tool here for a lot more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Upset customer","review":"I bought two of this blenders to be used in my kitchen. Unfortunately after few days of using it stop working. Is not a motor problem but the material which is used to make the parts is so poor quality that is not able to hold the bottom part, which is the one that blends.I contacted the company and they asked me for my information, I provided, since then I have passed almost two weeks and I have not answer yet, meanwhile am stuck with two blenders unable to make my cakes neither to buy another one.I will never buy anything from this company, they don't appreciate the customers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for baby food","review":"A nanny suggested using a hand blender for homemade baby food. Bought this product based on good reviews. Very easy to use and feels solid and sturdy during use. Super easy to clean - just detach and rinse with water. Powerful - just a couple of 'whips' does the job and it's easy to control for more chunky texture (for my older baby with new teeth). I would tend to get over-pureed mush in a regular blender and would have to take the whole thing apart to get the food out from around the blades. LOVE that the included beaker has measurement indications. I blend and then feed right out of the beaker and I know exactly how much he's eating. Highly recommmend to parents who either want to make all their own homemade infant food or for blending up your own table food for older babies - providing much more variety and texture than jarred stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great tool","review":"My husband and I have used our blender several times now and so far it has been great.

I've used it for soups and sauces to far with great results: it takes seconds to puree soups--without all the mess and fuss of using a food processor or blender--and the two sauces I've blended with it came out smoothly in just seconds. I did pick up a piece of bone, which jammed the blade--my \\"bone-headed\\" move--but with very careful prodding, it popped right out. It is very powerful and the blades are very sharp, so do be much more careful with it than with other kitchen tools. Oh, and unless you want your kitchen redecorated from floor to ceiling in pea soup, so remember to turn it off when lifting it out of the liquid. Seriously, it's an easy to use, easy to clean, helpful tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"this is the best investment I've made in a long time.

I've packed up my big blender and my gimicky gadgety magic bullet in favor of this. And you can put the blade part in the dish washer! It IS plastic and can see how you could strip the plastic part that attaches to the blade. And the plasticky nature is why I give it 4 stars instead of 5. Since its not too expensive, I won't be surprised if it doesn't live for more than a few years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't last, poor design","review":"This was a great immersion blender while it lasted.

I use this for everything from large soups to scrambled eggs, batter, fruit and vegetable purees (for my baby). It is easier to clean up than other blenders--just pop off the blade arm from the motor and wash it right away. It is so strong that it creates a suction so if you put in on the bottom of a deep pot FULL of soup it will lift the whole thing! If you are planning on using it for smoothies and you are using frozen fruit you will need to precut larger pieces (like strawberries) so that it will fit in the gap around the blade, and use crushed ice--though if you are using frozen fruit you probably won't need to use ice."},{"rating":"1","title":"absolute nightmare","review":"Generally, Cuisinart is a good brand.

I have used it only once, so I cannot comment on how well this hand blender will hold up over time, but, wow, did it ever do the job, easily blending the chunks of vegetables in the pot.

I have used it once so far, but was impressed by its ability to blitz a soup pot of cooked vegetables to a super creamy consistency. With this tool, I will no longer be waiting for cool temperatures to pour portions into a blender. Also a plus is no more messes from spilled ingredients while transferring to a blender; the tool goes right into the soup pot, still hot after turning off the burner.I have no idea how long the Cuisinart SmartStick 200w will last, but it is a fun tool and at a low enough price that I would not hesitate to buy a second if needed a couple of years later."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Thing Since Sliced Bread","review":"After my boyfriend and I had amazing cream of vegetable soup while on vacation, I decided that I would start making my own version.

It takes a whole pot of vegetables down to nothing in seconds! It's very powerful. It works great for my soups, sauces, and nuts. I even use it to blend tofu to make desserts. The only downside is that the blade is about 3/4\\" from the bottom of the unit, so make sure that you have at least 3/4\\" of product to blend. The bottom half pops off and can be washed separate from the top unit that plugs into an outlet.

I was very excited about it when I made butternut squash soup! Clean up was a breeze. Everything seemed great until I tried to make strawberry milk. I cut up the strawberries, added milk and honey and started to blend. Before long, the blender started to smell, and the blade wasn't spinning. When I took it apart to see what was going on, the unit that holds the shaft for spinning the blade was warped/melted therefore no longer able to grid and spin it. This was only the 3rd time I've used it and I wasn't using it on anything too intense...no ice or anything. I contacted the manufacturer but I haven't heard back. Extremely disappointing!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awesome.. when it was working","review":"This hand blender did the trick when it was at it's prime- it even blended frozen fruits for smoothies! But, it stopped working all of a sudden (after a month) and the blade twirled idly when the motor was running fine. I contacted Cuisinart but they took FOREVER getting back to me (they neglected me for a month!) and getting me a replacement part- but guess what? they sent me the part for the wrong model. Now, I don't know if they're interchangeable or not, but my blender is still not working. I contacted Cuisinart once again but it'd probably take another month or so for me to enjoy my smoothies once again... I'd probably recommend this blender if you're doing easy jobs like pureeing soups or blending cream cheese for cheesecake- but not for heavy duty stuff like crushing ice or pulverizing frozen fruits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely easy to cleam, Powerfull","review":"Does the job and very easy to clean.

In fact, using the hand blender in the cup makes a small suction, so that the blender will not come out easily.All in all, an excellent buy for the price and well worth having.

Used once to mix pancake batter which it did fairly well but I used a bowl instead of a pan, which would have had a flat bottom. Next thing I noticed was that the cord, because of the way you have to hold the blender, comes out the side of the blender TOWARD YOU. So, if you have to plug it in above your counter top,(the way most cabinets are built), the cord will come across the bowl/pan or the counter you're mixing in or on, come toward you, then it has to make a loop to get to the blender. Also, I attempted to clean the inside of the mixing end with a brush used on dishes - forget that - had to use my finger up behind the blades to get the soft batter out. Blender should come with a brush just for that job. Another important point, the instructions say to limit run time to 50 seconds.

It was used with care, following the instructions, cleaned and stored after each use, so that was not the problem. It stopped working entirely as the 2 pieces no longer fit well together--the cheap joint was worn out. It is the worst of its kind I have ever owned in 30 years of cooking.

The emergency room doctor told me I was lucky I still had my finger. Instead, I'm grateful to have had only 15 stitches and a disfigured hand. The snarky comments to the poor soul who did lose her finger were misguided --this is not about intelligence. This blender is an accident waiting to happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst product ever","review":"The first time I used this blender, I thought it was fantastic. It saved a lot of time and hassle that I was able to blend my soup right inside the pot, on the stove. I called all my family members and recommended it to them. Well, I should not have...

It will seem like magic--suddenly those blended soups practically make themselves! Awesome! But, if your experience is like mine, even though you baby your appliances, even though you hand wash everything, even though you never drop the item, around the 10th use it will simply STOP WORKING. I read the reviews, and I knew it could happen. I took the chance thinking that those other people just didn't take care of their things. Guess what? I was wrong. This is a terrible product!

My finger got sucked up in the blender and as you can imagine, ripped it to shreds.

Even made my own spaghetti sauce by roasting tomatoes and veggies in the oven and then cooking in crockpot for a while. Then just blended quickly with this. So simple and easy and clean up is very easy. It is really strong and seems to blend up anything with out a problem. I havent tried ice yet but the package says to use crushed ice. Way easier then transferring hot things into your blender and pouring back into the pot which is what I was doing before for such recipes.

So easy to clean, and it snaps securely together and apart. The non-motor part cleans easily in the top rack of the dishwasher, and rinses off easily if you're about to re-use it. I use mine mostly for soups and smoothies, and will be using it for homemade baby food soon. The included cup is great for smoothies & the upcoming baby food portions. I absolutely love not having to transfer soup to a blender or food processor, I can just blend it right there in the pot! I haven't had any trouble with countertop splatter, but I also try not to use it foolishly, or in really shallow liquids (tilt the pot and you're fine). It is a strong blender but I haven't had any problem controlling it. An indispensable kitchen tool!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stick Blender","review":"This is an excellent kitchen tool.

I was able to do everything in a single pot, without moving it to a blender. The SmartStick has a blade surrounded by metal casing at the bottom. The blade is like the blade on a blender - it grinds up everything, including tomatoes, onions, garlic, peppers and other stuff. The only thing that took a little figuring out was how to move the stick to get all the things to go to the blade. Basically, I had to take it off the bottom of the pan and move it around a bit. Once I started it became obvious what to do.After use the stick comes apart and the bottom goes into the dishwasher, the top gets wiped off. Simple.And my family ate all the soup and would have had more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect gift","review":"I had one for myself and bought this as a gift for a friend.

I use it in soups, when preparing sauces, and even when I'm making smoothies! It's very strong. I use it to make a vegan cheese sauce.

This immersion blender whips through the ingredients with no trouble, and I have a smooth, delicious sauce when I'm done! It also makes smoothies better than my blender, but I do have to add the fruit ingredients in stages (since they're all frozen and rock hard.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Right Tool for the Job","review":"Read some compliants the \\"Stick\\" doesn't handle large frozen objects like ice cubes and frozen strawberries and that a standing blender works better... well duh?

I was hoping to save some money and have more options of what to give them than comes in the little jars. A friend told me all I needed was a steamer and an immersion blender. I decided on this one and have absolutely loved it. Cleanup is literally putting it in the dishwasher and it gets all my purees super smooth (carrots, peas, sweet potato, broccoi, apples, and pears so far).

Also, the earlier model had a stand to hold the blender, which we (fortunately) can still use for the new purchase; otherwise, the Quisinart would have to sit on the cupboard top or be put in a drawer, which wouldn't be nearly as convenient or easy to use. Still, we're pleased with our purchase; my husband uses it every morning to make his special protein-energy drink for us, and I use it to make really fluffy scrambled eggs.

I know how handy this smartstick can be! I used mine for so many years that it finally broke! It is great for making home-made soup right in the pot! Very good product and so much easier to blend right in your pot without having to transfer to a blender! A great item for the experienced cook!"},{"rating":"2","title":"overkill and top heavy","review":"This is a very large item and enough top heavy that it dumped my first attempt all over the counter. A few years ago I had one about half this size that I liked very well. I'm sure this one is probably more powerful and will probably handle larger things better - like pureeing in a pot, but it seems like overkill for smoothies. It takes up more space on the countertop than I expected, and the little plastic carafe that comes with it is too lightweight and ill shaped to support it. The base is narrow and the top large, which makes it spill over more easily. I'm going to look for a heavier and larger, straight-sided glass to use it with. Or possibly set the little plastic carafe inside a heavy straight-sided bowl to make it more sturdy. I find it especially odd for these two items to be paired together because the carafe for my smaller stick blender was taller than this and had a wider base and straight sides."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Handy!","review":"I am so happy I purchased this product! It has been so handy to puree soups or mix things that are liquid. It was so cumbersome before this product to transfer soup to a blender to liquify it.

It did a great job blending things that were not too firm (like frozen berries) or too large (big pieces of banana). If large or firm items were in the blending cup, the motor really struggled and there was a faint burning smell. So, I used only crushed ice and made sure the items I put in it weren't very big. If I did those 2 things, it made great smoothies. I usually washed it by hand. But yesterday I was in a hurry so I put it in the dishwasher on the normal cycle. Should not have been a problem since the product description states it is dishwasher safe. The plastic parts on the blending shaft melted. The warped plastic no longer fits on the blender, so it is now useless. Such a shame; I really liked this blender!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little product good for the price","review":"I had previously owned a bamix, with all the interchangeable blades.

Even if they both break after one year, it's worth paying the extra $15 for the Cuisinart because it handles so much better. The Oster one has WAY too much suction and it's like trying to ride a rodeo bull. The Cuisinart is SMOOTH and lighter weight.**"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"This is a wonderful kitchen aid. We live in Oregon so I make loads of soups.

It allows you to put in two full cups without worrying about spilling, and your drink is not in contact with the plastic stopper for hours.Definitely better than my previous system of using an old juice bottle and reheating in a microwave.It seems like a bit of money for something like this, but the cost will soon be forgotten while the quality will be enjoyed for a long time to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply, filth","review":"Rather than go into a long review, I will keep it simple. This book ended-up in my trash bin after the first chapter. In the Hand of Dante has absolutely nothing redeeming about it whatsoever and is just pure trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Egomaniac's Experiment","review":"It has taken me a while to get to this review because I so disliked the book, I wanted to get some (hopefully) cogent thoughts together. This may have been an experiment on the writer's part, or perhaps plain ego alone. Either way, it failed miserably.The jacket relates that the author was self-taught in the classics. He decided to show off all he learned in grossly overwritten prose throughout two-thirds of the book.The other third is written in gross language. He makes himself the protagonist/hero, yet you never get to know what kind of man that character is - except ego driven in fiction as well.The plot had potential, as did the underlying theme of Dante's soul-searching and difficulties writing his classic. None of it came off, however.Perhaps the best part was a thirty page diatribe about the publishing industry.If ever a book was \\"jus' showin' off\\" this was it. I am sorry so much potential was wasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tosched by your presence, dear","review":"Nick Tosches has never been an author to underestimate his own considerable abilities. But here he swerves dangerously into Hunter Thompson parody territory by making himself the lead in what could have been a fascinating rumination on the title character, and then digressing with a silly screed lambasting the publishing industry (probably lifted verbatim from the memos about this book). Stick with his biographies (especially \\"Dino\\") and music criticism unless you still think swearing profusely in every sentence is the stylistic mark of a hard-bitten alcoholic mess of a middle-age hero (cue Ozzy)."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books I have ever read","review":"This book is crazy. There is way too much usage of the \\"F\\" word; which if appropriate in establishing something w/in the book, I am fine with, but there did not seem to be a good reason for the constant profanity. The author is constantly berating the reader and anyone else he can think of. While reading the book, I felt angry. If there was something in the book of merit to make me feel anger, I would not have a problem with that.There does not seem to be a plot and it is very hard to follow where it may be heading. The previous commentary was very diplomatic about the first half of the book. I on the other hand suggest this book be avoided.This is my first and last Nick Tosches book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless Drivel","review":"I concur with the majority of negative reviews of this book. I'm no prude, but the excessive use of profanity throughout this book is tiresome and honestly lazy on the part of the author. If you enjoy endless narcisstic tirades by disgruntled writers and agree with the main characters that the only good use of a woman is to provide oral satisfaction, this is the book for you. Otherwise, don't subject yourself to 376 pages of slop I don't think can even be called literature. I will not be reading any more of Mr. Tosches' work, you can be sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your time.","review":"This book was an utter waste of the time it took me to read the 300+ pages.E.G. - the bombastic, egocentric author spends about 12 pages ranting against the modern publishing industry in an aside that has nothing to do with the rest of the book; it only serves to stroke his own ego from atop this overwrought pedantic soapbox."},{"rating":"1","title":"I did not make it past 30 pages","review":"Without repeating what everyone else has said, I think the only thing that needs to be said is that this writing style is definately not to my taste. Frankly, reading it felt like the equivalent of slogging through heavy mud and did not feel worth the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"An incredible waste of paper and ink","review":"The potential for a great story was there - Vatican intrigue, Dante's struggles, corrupt publishers, and a protagonist you love to hate. But the writing was too forced. Almost as if Tosches was following his self-taught method to write a classic - one part obscure latin, a dash of self-loathing, a healthy pinch of angst, and a healthy use of a thesaurus. After all, why just tell a story when one can spin a yarn, weave a tale, narrate an adventure, pontificate, illuminate, elucidate and enlighten."},{"rating":"1","title":"Offensive garbage","review":"So apparently I missed the warning on the cover. I was extremely intrigued by the description and ready for a good book. Within the first two pages I was so offended by the cheap, excessive use of profanity, not even necessary to the character or story, I literally threw it in the garbage. Don't waste you time or money. Perhaps Mr. Tosches should read a few pieces of good literature to see how it's done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Idea--Terrible Execution","review":"The idea of this novel was why I bought a copy of it--the discovery, by an aging priest-librarian of the Vatican, of the original manuscript of Dante's Divine Comedy written in Danti own hand. Unfortunately, the book rambles excessively and at times is incoherent. By page 90 or so the author gets into a long-winded, self-absorbed, masterbatory diatribe about stupid editors and incompetent publishers--the author's sour grapes no doubt. Don't waste your time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It hurt... It really hurt!","review":"Try as I might, there was simply no getting through this horrid book! Encouraged by a promising description, I bought it in an airport, thinking it would be a good way to pass the time in my travels. I can understand instances where profanity and utter nastiness can have literary merit, though in this work they were simply egregious. It was almost as though Tosches was simply trying to be profane for sheer shock value. After suffering through a number of chapters, I left my new ... hardback on the airplane for the next poor soul who happened upon it. I would not recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad that I couldn't finish it","review":"This is quite likely the worst book I have ever read. The premise on the dust cover is quite promising, but Nick Tosches couldn't fulfill it. Perhaps an author who is less in love with himself could write a good story with the same premise. I really tried to work my way through this mess, but I eventually had to give up about half way through. I couldn't stand the punishment anymore. You can sense the fact that there is a story to be told but you cannot get past the author's pompus, self absorbed style to find it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh.","review":"Bought this book because I love Dante and had heard wonderful things about Nick Tosches. After reading it (and I finished it only because I wanted to see if it would get any better) I still love Dante but think that Tosches is overrated, pretentious and suffering from testosterone poisoning. Believe me, I'm not a prude; so-called offensive material can certainly be thought-provoking and enjoyable. But in the contemporary portions of this book the author seems to be crude just to show what an iconoclastic stud he is, while at the same time having nothing of interest to say. In the historical portions of the book, by contrast, he does have something interesting to say but it's buried under an overly vague, artsy-fartsy, stream of consciousness story structure. I'll be selling my copy of this book and rereading the Divine Comedy instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rampant Ego Obscures Talent","review":"Nick Tosches undeniably has talent. Unfortunately for the reader, Tosches is very aware of this fact and wants the reader to be aware of it (the book refers to Tosches' \\"legendary\\" poetry readings!). A series of riffs on truly tangential subjects (e.g., the woeful state of publishing in America today) undermines what could have been a great story. When Tosches focuses on the task at hand, the book is gripping, and the sentences sing (sometimes with melancholy beauty, other times raging jazz, and still other passages sound like a dirge). But the sheer weight of Tosches' ego overwhelms all.The modern story of Nick's verification of Dante's original manuscript is far more engaging than the parallel story of Dante actually writing his masterwork. Rather than building to a crescendo, this book also trails off towards the end, giving the impression that Tosches merely lost interest in his tale. And by then, so had I."},{"rating":"1","title":"Puerile Stew Spew ( and overpriced at FREE)","review":"This is the first (and last)Tosches to which I willing will subject myself.To list the factual errors the book contains would require another book longer than the original.Remarkably, the author demonstrates repeatedly that he is ignorant in any number of languages. His style is that of a teenager who imagines he or she is the first person to use the F-word in public ( poor Lenny Bruce could have avoided jail fifty years ago had he had the prescience to anticipate N.T.).The author's perverse interpretations of Judaic concepts and history are unfortunate ; his poorly disguised antisemitism deplorable ; his use of ethnic slurs disgusting.A puerile, silly stew of nonsense posing as-- what ?? Stew, spew-a pitiful mess in any event."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother...","review":"God I hated this book. I don't say this lightly. I thought the idea was great and I couldn't wait to read it but...The author is so overrated and pretentious that I couldn't help but laugh at some sections. Did he even bother to give it to an editor? The characters are one-dimensional and the plot is lame. I totally lost interest half way through the book. I continued reading with the hopes that it would get better but it never did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tosches' Silly Mess","review":"After being both bored and confused by this novel, I feel Nick should stick to biography. A no velist he is not,no idea of structure,inability to decide who he really wants to be,the use of scatalogy for shock value alone,and the psuedo Faulknerian ramblings make this a mockery of solid literature.Buy Dino."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrendous: perfectly horrid : DREADFUL","review":"That title is the Merriam-Webster definition of the word \\"horrendous\\" and it aptly describes this book. Undoubtedly a talented writer, Tosches is so enamored with himself that he pollutes what could have been a great story with what can only be called \\"omni-loathing\\" -- one of his personas despises everything and everyone and his other(s) simply love himself so much that the story of Dante is lost and the story of Louie and \\"Nick\\" and the other scum Tosches apparently associates with becomes simply unreadable. Profanity and punditry aside (although it is difficult to put such vast amounts of it aside), this book is simply terrible and, for the fleeting glimpses of beuaty that manage to rise through the rest of his vitriol, a tragic failure.Tosches did accomplish one thing with this book and after reading it I did something that I have never before done - threw it in the garbage where it belongs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rewardingly Misleading...","review":"This book is not for the weekend reader. Yeah, it's a hard book, but so are the classics that remain unparalleled today. Some of the passages do require rereading in order to fully understand, but so what?Too many of the reviewers were expecting a twisting plot full of suspense, if you want that, go watch a movie. His writing is some of the best i have read from a living writer.And who cares if Tosches throws himself into the novel, this simply parellels the story of Dante throwing himself into his \\"Divine Comedy.\\" Also, Tosches must also be recognized for the non-fiction writer that he started as. Thus, incorporating this style into this novel.In closing, this novel has much to offer and must be carefully read to fully understand. I would not reccomend it for light reading, but it would work wonders as supplementary reading to Dante's works.P.S His rant on the publishing industry does more for Faulkner than Oprah ever did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lighten up, Nick...","review":"If you're looking for a pretentious, overblown boor, then Tosches is your man. He is so in love with himself that he seems to forget that others might have to read his self-important ramblings. I know he feels there is an artistic purity to all this (he bludgeons us with this premise over and over), but it's just an excuse for self-indulgence. There was a great story here. Too bad he couldn't forget himself long enough to tell it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cell phone cover","review":"Product seems well made and was accurately described.

I first thought of it as jazz for a new era of kids and people, but once you listen to it more, it's so much more than that.

It's fantastic and you will most definitely enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh.","review":"This is a disservice to Tortoise only because it's so highly rated. I'd have more to say about this album if there WAS more of an album to say things about. It doesn't succeed in being minimalist, and 'ambient rock' is too generous a term. There's just not much of anything going on here. It sounds like a promising high school drum and bass duo who got some of their friends together and did a few weed-infused weekend recording sessions. If you let it be a simple first-outing low-budget indie rock exploration, it's alright. I've had some nice times around the house with it on in the background.\\"Cornpone Brunch\\" is a decent track. It's the only one that gives any glimpse of the skill and creativity the band would come to achieve. If you're a Tortoise fan and want to explore their complete discography, you'll probably be interested in this album simply to witness them in an embryonic state. If you're anyone else, don't bother at all with this album and go straight for one of their later offerings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Lame","review":"I am new to the tortoise scene.

These guys are all obviously accomplished musicians and yes I understand this is their first album. But the songs on here just don't grab you and pull you in at all. I found myself constantly skipping to the next track two to three minutes into each song. A lot of the songs just sound so similar in nature and many start to get under your skin badly. Practically all of the songs on here are just lame jamming with random sound fillers to try to sound cool I guess. I was just bummed out that there was not even one song on the entire album worth a second listen. I mean common. I hope that the other tortoise albums greatly vary from this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"thrill jockeys","review":"the obvious influences of jazz, rock, and dub are undoubtedly sensed when listening to this album, in spite of charactarizations and labels and such.

The authors attempt to apply a scientific method to their analysis of start-ups and potentially succesfull ventures but lack the substance of true quality research. In the end it turns out to be a heuristic that could be summed up in less than a hundred pages if not for the authors' attempting to display their erudition.

The sparkly's, dust, occasional scratch etc. are so thick that it is like looking through them to see the movie. This is presented in a wide screen format - not really, it is cropped to appear wide screen so you have missing content like mountain tops chopped off, and standing people chopped at the knee. This movie is based on the true story of Old Mose, a bear(s) who terrorized ranchers in the South Park region of Colorado. As other reviewers have commented, this is an excellent movie. In Night of the Grizzly we see people as beasts, beasts as people, and a co-mingling of interaction between the two only rarely seen on film. Great movie but marginal product that is disappointing at $27."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Night of the Grizzly","review":"This is a great family movie picture! I saw this movie when it first came out in 1966 I was 6 years old. Warner Brothers Theater in San Pedro, CA. My older brother took me to go see it. I never forgot it. It has been quite sometime since I had last seen it. I wanted to grow up to be just like Big Jim Cole(Clint Walker). One of his best roles. I was not only scared of the giant Grizzly bear, but also of Cass Dowdy and his dogs. The bad guy played well by Leo Gordon. Great story line, beautiful scenery, good classic life situations and human values. I read a negative remark about the special effects. It was made in the mid sixties! I was totally captivated by this movie. Full of suspense, great actors and supporting cast. Excellent movie for the whole family to enjoy! H.J.

Like other reviewers have said, when you first hear Phil's voice and the AR music, you do get a little tingle, especially those of us that have always wanted to be on the show. I think the game is more fun with many people playing.Two small issues:First, I echo the issues with the final leg. There should be more questions.Second, has anyone else noticed a pattern with the Head Start? I've noticed that if you select a two team game with the red team being the first team chosen, you'll get Dallas as the city every time. This was so much an issue that I actually returned the game because I thought it was defective. Then with my second copy, I figured out that there was a pattern.I do hope that future versions of the game come out. I'll happily buy again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Race Board Game","review":"My son asked for the game since he loves the show.

We tried to play two games, but the DVD came up with an error after the 1st leg everytime. Did someone else have this problem, or what is just us?---We finally managed to get this to work. It's a fun game but like many DVDs now, it won't work on all players. It won't work well at all on our portable player, but on our little Philips player it worked great. I think they need to maintain some standards with DVDs, imagine the uproar in the past if a given VHS tape wouldn't play in all VCRs! If you can get the game to work and you like TAR on tv, you'll really enjoy the game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boo","review":"This idea of this game was great.

I was extremely disappointed in this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"One of the worse games I have ever played. You can get half way around the board by just selecting spin.

I can overlook the constant use of his favorite words: \\"declined,\\" \\"agon,\\" \\"proleptic,\\" and \\"exuberant.\\" But the constant rantings about the \\"School of Resentment,\\" which would be feminists, Marxists, Foucauldians, and multiculturalists who reduce literature to ideology, got on my nerves and struck me as its own brand of resentment.

He preaches a literary criticism that has no place in 21st-century society. No, Harold, Shakespeare is not the author whom all other authors must strive to surpass. He was great for his time, and his work continues to inspire us. This is true. But writers shouldn't try to be Shakespeare; they should strive to perfect their craft in their own social and artistic context. Sorry if you don't like the result, Harold. That doesn't mean they aren't as good as Shakespeare; that means you're old and out of touch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prententious","review":"I saw Harold Bloom on \\"Charlie Rose\\" and he came across as a vain man, with contrived dourness to seem \\"artistic.\\" And all I could think was, \\"It doesn't work if you're not an artist.\\" Critics become critics to cling peripherally to the arts, and sometimes make the mistake of thinking they are artists themselve. From reading the prose in this book, Bloom never could have written a sonnet or short story worth a damn. And he's so in love with his own opinions! This book is good just to look at for the list of important works (although some items I don't think should be on the list...What in God's name is Gore Vidal doing on it! Ugh! ). But I read Harold Bloom, and get the same feeling when I watch Keanu Reeves in a movie: \\"What in God's name is THIS person doing at the top of their professional heap. There has to be better people out there! \\" In the world of MTV and computer games, any encouragement for people to read literature is great. I just wish it had been delivered differently."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad","review":"Harold Bloom has finally buried himself in his own academic babble. Nonesense begets nonesense in this book and Bloom fights straw men of his own making while never really giving a solid, well-reasoned aesthetic to base his rant upon.As a professional writer with 54 hour minor in English, I find this book a great disappointment for it neither defends, explains, nor promotes the canon of great literature in any clear or reasonable way. It is sad to see a once sharp mind so lost in itself like this.I gave the book two stars because it does serve to stire up the conversation about great books, thus does make a valuable contribution in that light.

The Western Canon has been a marvelous read up against the literary material my university is hopelessly married to. His style of writing is not difficult at all when compared to academic writing generally; it is fluid and quite playful at times. If your university/college is forcing Eagleton down your throat (also an entertaining writer I'll admit - like or loathe his position) then Bloom is great to read along side with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bloom's enthusiasm is contagious","review":"Bloom is a better writer than many of the authors he lists in the back of his book.

I liked the book because it's like a rags to riches story. I also enjoyed the book because Mariah Carey is my favorite singer. Not only do I enjoy her music but I love how she care for the children, and has actually taken more than a few steps to help them. I would say that I was her #1 fan. Not an obsessed fan but more like a great admirer of her art. My review is named, Butterfly, because what I got from her story is that she struggled, went through some things, as we all do in life, worked hard, set a goal for herself, was determined,did so, and became the SUPERStar she is today. She's blossomed into this beautiful woman...a butterfly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blech.:P","review":"Her Story is not a book a huge Mariah fan like me would like to read...maybe to add to our collections, but not to read.

One, I love Mariah Carey, and two becasue I had a book report due for a Rock 'n' Roll class. I did not like the begining of the book at all. It focused too much on her mother. It also did not say much of anything about her life in school, which really upset me. There were two points in which the author misspelled her name! I was so shocked I almost put the book down! The pictures were all old and none of them were in color. And after all the fuss about her mother there should have been a picture of her in there!!!

I was hoping to find out something about my mentor that I didn't have access to learning. No such luck. Most of the book was a repeat of articles written on her by other journalists.The book was very positive for Mariah. The few photos that were included were beautiful!For those that don't know much about Mariah, I would say this is a good book to start out with, but do something the author didn't do...research what is being said. Read another book on her, go find another article on her, you'll find that some links were missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably the worst biography I've ever read","review":"When I boght Mariah Carey: Her Story, I thought I was finally gonna be able to read a book that talks about Mariah Carey and will have a more realistic view about her life. But what I read was an artificial biography that wrote about things I already knew. What's worse is that the author made a huge effort to compare Mariah to Cinderella, which made the book just as sugar-coated as Mariah's old music. It also turned me off that the author constantly compared Mariah to Whitney Houston, and never wrote one possible thing about Whitney.If you're not very familiar about Mariah's life--then this book is for you, but I wouldn't recommend it, save your money or buy a REAL biography."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short, but focused and informative","review":"This is an end-to-end walkthrough of using RAW with Photoshop CS.

If you are a pro or very serious about your photography, you will find suggestions on how to calibrate and speed up your workflow.All that said, I find PS + Camera Raw slow and underpowered even compared to Canon's own Digital Photo Pro that comes bundled with each SLR.

But he exists in a future world, at home with the technological gadgets and hip speech of that age. And Foster creates a whole new language for this fictional era, and it all hangs together. Like Burgess' Clockwork Orange but not that mean. Most of the time you don't have to refer to the glossary to figure out what is meant because the context is so well crafted.There's a murder mystery here that is not too hard to figure out, but twisty enough to keep the story interesting.

Any publisher who presumes to market a book with Spanish phrases in it (front page, yet) ought to have a Spanish proficient editor or copyeditor check it. Anything else is sheer disrespect.I often read publishers' advice to writers more or less along the lines of \\"if you don't care to get it right, why should we care to read it?'

The music is very good and offers some very good songs from the former front man of Texas Latino. The song highlights include one of my favorite versions of Anhelos- think Los Aguilares, Enfocate- a very nice Cumbia that adds the awesome sound of Vallenato, Maldita Vieja which is more of your traditional cumbia with a little sax, and accordion, and La Reyna Del Baile another cumbia which is sure to get you out of your seat to dance. Overall I gave the cd four stars due to a couple of pop songs that didn't interest me, but I would have given it a five star rating just for the song Anhelos and the cumbias...if that makes any sense. 5 songs Tejano/Norteno Rancheras, 4 cumbias (style various), and 2 Pop songs. A good one to own if you like variety, but I wouldn't pay a crazy price for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"how to do the tiger claw attack","review":"I first saw this blade at my friend james's house when he introduced me to beyblades. the next day he was sick of them and gave me his driger s blade.

Both its repetitive and lengthy text as well as its dully colored illustrations do not entice one to contine reading past the halfway point.And although there is a happy ending, the reader is left feeling sorry for Matthew and Anna, not rejoicing at their freedom.I do not know if Lindgren meant this to be so, but the story has the very strong feeling of being a metaphor for life on earth versus an after-life in heaven.Unfortunately, not destined to be a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value and Quality for the Price","review":"This ring was very light weight and was comfortable to wear due to the comfort fit design.

I'm a Beyblader champion & expert named Dranzoon and I know how to make a great endurance type of Beybladez. This is just counting all the original Beybladez + Metal Draciel. You could make a Beyblade with 11 endurance just out of Dragoon Storm and Metal Draciel. What you have to do is use Metal Draciel's attack ring, Dragoon Storm's weight disk, Dragoon Storm's left spin gear and Metal Draciel's blade base. You could also buy a left spring launcher which would make it stay up for 40 more seconds and Dragoon Storm ripcord. You could then have Beyblade comps with your friends to see whose would stay up for longer.WARNING! Don't battle unless you're battling a really weak one because it's attack would only be 3 and defence 5.

The development of Dr. Beckett from a background role to one of the front core characters was a good move by the executives of the show.

The characters really make this show; they all have very distinct personalities and are quite well written. Like any TV show, the eps range from okay to very good, fortunately most of the eps are excellent and two \\"The Storm\\" and the \\"The Eye\\" are as good as TV gets. As a plus, the effects are stellar. I'm hooked now.

This spin off not only has beautiful locations and solid writing, but a solid cast of characters. You really come to love each of them and episodes are dedicated into exploring their real issues and trials. This first season is my favorite (barely beating out the 3rd) because of some of the Rodney McKay centered episodes. All of the interactions between McKay and Sheppard are immensely entertaining.

There wasn't much of a plot or point to it at all.That said, don't let this stop you from watching the rest of the series.

Bunch of weird stuff at the end too, but I haven't bothered wasting my time on any of it. Preview for the next episode, then it sort of replays, but without sound.Overall, I like the series ok, but the presentation is HORRIBLE.Remember, the show starts at the 2 minute mark, and you need to fast forward either 2.30 or 3.00 minutes for the commercial breaks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent Series in a botched DVD release","review":"Stargate: Atlantis is amazing.

The commentaries with the actors, particularly \\"Sanctuary\\" with Torri Higginson and Rachel Luttrell and \\"Hide and Seek\\" and \\"38 Minutes\\" with Rachel and Paul McGillion are hilarious. The behind-the-scenes stuff is pretty cool to watch, and the episode quality is fantastic. Love this set!For those of you who haven't been fortunate enough to see it, I'd still encourage you to get this collection. I've introduced six of my friends to this show, two of whom said they hated all things sci-fi before seeing it, and all are now thoroughly addicted.

Only a couple of episodes feel borrowed from SG-1, other than that, this series truly is incredible. Almost every single episode is action packed and full of adventure. The new characters haven't had the years to grow like the SG-1 cast has, but they have amazing potential in the years to come to be just as good as SG-1.

Sherrie's soulful blues voice shines on \\"Flatland Blues.\\" I found the entire CD package to be a nice accompaniment to the music, from the photography and layout, to the personal notes included with each song's lyrics.

The song spoke clearly and succinctly. Vocal delivery was on-point. The music is strong and keeps listeners attentive. Most importantly, it all meshed quite well.However, I'd also like to say that the way that Aguilera expresses the sentimentis amazing. By weaving the fact that she's also longing in with the fact that she's also not easy, there's an actual sincerity to every word she sings.So, Christina Aguilera and \\"Genie In A Bottle\\" were meant for each other.

Christina's vocals are soulful and sultry at the same time. Check out her song on the \\"Mulan\\" soundtrack to really hear her talent.

She merely sounds like a stronger Britney here on this gem written and co-arranged with Steven Kipner, who is a renowned collaborator on tracks such as \\"It's Your Move\\" for Diana Ross. We have a slice of funk here that moves at the same pace as its producer David Frank's hit single with his group the System, \\"Don't Disturb this Groove\\". Piano riffs underlie the propulsive infectious synthesized funk that ushers in a chorus that entices and intrigues. Although she is not in the vocal form she was on \\"Reflections\\", and that may mislead people to think she is a Britney wannabe, there is a depth to this song alone that \\"Baby One More Time\\" does not have, and further releases will reveal an expanded vocal range for the up and coming star."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS GIRL'S GOT IT","review":"And I think that everyone who hears this song knows it.

( A Marine Veteran of that war was kind enough to lend me his copy before I joined the Army.

For example the power struggle with the Senior Sgt. in his Platoon, the overwhelming heat and the plain hard work needed to just survive let alone the fighting an elusive and talented enemy.

And therein lies the rub. He detests Bauhaus-inspired work so much that he has no perspective. He is guilty of the same pretentiousness and arrogance of which he accuses the architects whom he dislikes.There is a great deal to be said against architects who prefer form over function, theory over practice. But any legitimate criticism is lost in this diatribe. Saying over and over again \\"it's ugly and I don't like the architects' politics\\" is not particularly persuasive."},{"rating":"1","title":"From Bauhaus to Our House","review":"FBTOH is way out of date, not dealing with the best of Louis Kahn's work, which doesn't neatly fit any of Mr. Wolfe's categories. I wonder how he would categorize Frank Gehry, whose work came after the writing.I am intimately familiar with Bauhaus Fever, having survived its convusive early days (early 1950s)in the Department of Architecture at Penn, where the students revolted against the Beaux Arts tradition. Having experienced that first-hand and also having been turned off by Mr. Wolfe's public image, I avoided this book until June 2006, when I broke down and borrowed it, hoping to learn a bit more about the Bauhaus as an idealistic socio-political movement, somewhat of a Protestant Revolution.All I learned: 1)The Bauhaus stank of garlic, and 2)Mr. Wolfe's writing is toxic and best avoided by those who prefer peace of mind to rabble-rousing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book to read","review":"I never knew the author of From Bauhaus to Our House also writes fictions. I thought T. Wolfe was one of those Post-Modern Architecture critics. The content was a good review of what I learn in school. And now I have a clear understand of Modernism and Post-Modernism. Wolfe was very emotional in \\"From Bauhaus,\\" I wonder what his fictions are like. \\"From Bauhaus,\\" however, sounded unfinished to me, I thought he didn't really answer the question he proposed in the title, \\"From Bauhaus to Our House,\\" he didn't really get to the \\"house part,\\" it was more like \\"From Bauhaus to our CITY.\\" I am still not sure why our houses are the ways they are now. At last, it was worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best","review":"This is not Wolfe's best as it is basically an extended rant against the influence of Bauhaus architecture, which, while somewhat entertaining, doesn't really explain much. For a better analysis of what Harvard art historian Sigfried Giedion called \\"the hanging curtain of glass,\\" try his outstanding book, Space, Time and Architecture, which does a much better job of tracing and conceptualizing the evolution of 20th century architecture."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mostly baseless rant","review":"There are a lot of legitimate arguments to be made against the Bauhaus and Purism, but Tom Wolfe seems too interested in writing a sprawling rant to really explore them. Only once, near the very end, did he mention that many of these buildings were not built on a human scale -- in my view, their biggest flaw. Instead, the book focuses on these issues, which seem minor in comparison:1. Glass, steel, and concrete are bad.2. Simplicity is bad.3. Architects who bad together into compounds are bad.It's hard to accurately judge this book properly, since I read it 30 years after it was written. Still, if Tom Wolfe wanted to make a case against this type of architecture, it seems like he could have set his ego aside and done a much better job."},{"rating":"1","title":"a showpiece rant","review":"Wolfe's little book is actually an extended polemic against the Bauhaus school and all its offshoots in architecture and design. Although never boring, I found nothing new here. In fact, I found several direct steals from Robert Hughes's landmark SHOCK OF THE NEW (1980), the book and teleseries which came out the year before Wolfe wrote his little screed. I'd advise anyone interested in pursuing the iconoclast's case against modern architecture to check out this earlier work as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A typical Wolfe romp","review":"If you're already acquainted with Tom Wolfe's literary style and political opinions, you can pretty well guess where this brief skewering of modern architecture is going to go.

Geeks gets stolen from a party that's thrown inside the govt. high-tech top-secret lab by... never mind. If you've reached so far, you might also have guessed that you probably don't even want to know what's next! And guess what, I'll help that thought - 'cause I won't say anything else.

It's not exactly a sequel - the events in this happen concurrently with the events in the theatrical film, involving the minor characters featured in the film.Without giving too much away, the \\"plot\\" involves Bruce and Lloyd's invisibility cloak, its theft and attempts at its retrieval. The only thing this film has going for it are the cameos by most of Get Smart's cast, including one of the leads. Other than that, it's rather predictable, uninteresting, and simply not funny, despite two otherwise talented actors in the lead roles.Thankfully, this disaster runs just over an hour. But that's 71 minutes of my life I'm never getting back.

They were badlydrawn, had terrible sound effects and little of thememorable big-band orchestra music which Tom & Jerry waswell-known for...Why do I mention this?Well, I'll tell you...It's because even those awful, late Tom & Jerry episodeswere a whole lot better than this absolutely terrible movie.\\"Tom & Jerry - The Movie\\" is an insult to the fans and almosttarnishes the memory of the greatest cartoon characters ofall-time.Stick to the originals!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Excelsior?","review":"Seems like this film was produced with good intentions, but the result isn't very entertaining. Tom and Jerry lose their home, and after a few minutes of Tom chasing Jerry through the city, each realize the other can talk, and become friends. Then they start singing mediocre songs. The new \\"Friends 'til the End\\" team up to help a runaway girl reunite with her father and defend her against a mean aunt. What kept me from completely regretting paying the DVD rental price was the inclusion of two classic cartoon shorts, \\"Just Ducky\\" and \\"The Invisible Mouse.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"I expected this to be a movie with lots of chases (it has 1)Tom & Jerry make friends during the movie and can all of a sudden talk.

Within the neoprene slipcase is a vinyl halfsleeve that I slip my laptop into, and then I can toss in my power cords and other accessories on the other side without having to scuff up my laptop. The padded neoprene provides enough cushion to protect the laptop from your normal bumps and jolts, but don't expect it to provide significant protection from a shoulder height drop. The shoulder strap is sturdy as are the handles, and they sit well on the shoulder or in the palm. If you are looking for something a little bit more than a sleeve where you can carry some extra papers and computer accessories, this is a great item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for what I needed","review":"This really is perfect for what I need.

Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very lightweight, easily fits my 16\\" laptop","review":"The neoprene bag is extremely lightweight, and provides ample room for my 16\\" widescreen laptop and a paper notebook (along with the power brick and mouse in the side pocket). The only two issues I have are that the strap connectors are not metal (they are plastic), and that there really is little protection for the laptop screen (no hard panel in there). I cut a piece of thin plywood and placed it in the bag for this purpose, and it works out fine. Would be nicer to have something already built in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough space...:-(","review":"I purchased it by looking at the image shown here on Amazon, but when I received this item i was disappointed.

We were just looking for something to be able to protect the laptop & hold the essentials while traveling. The shoulder strap is a must-have. We have only used the bag on a couple of flights, but it seems to be very well made & sturdy enough. Of course it's not going to provide a lot of protection if anything heavy is put on top of it, but it keeps the laptop from being scratched & is easy to carry around.

Luckily i grabbed the strap quickly before it landed. This bag is very poorly put together, all i had in it was my laptop and my stats book which together, cannot weigh more than 5lbs. Reviews say that the padding is \\"2 inches thick\\", not at all. the padding is a quarter inch on each side at best, there is only a little divider inside to slip the notebook into. This divider only has padding on one side, so if you were to have a book inside as well, there would be zero protection on that side. A really crappy bag, I am returning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"After two months","review":"I bought this bag and thought that it was a good solution, small and light, yet big enough to slip in both my laptop and a book.Well, don't try putting that book in there. After just over two months of ownership I was walking along and the shoulder strap pulled out sending my computer plunging down to the concrete. The stitching that secured the shoulder straps had come out.Do not buy this bag, if it can barely last me for two months, it certainly cannot last the test of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice bag, Nice Price","review":"It's an excellent bag, well padded, well built.I carry a huge 17\\" vaio that probably weighs in at about 8 lbs with the power brick.One of the features i LOVE is the elastic portion of the shoulder strap that prevents the strap from digging in to my shoulder every step i take.I recommend it for any notebook on the heavy side."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I wanted","review":"If you don't want a bulky notebook case with lots of pockets then the targus slip case is probably what you need. It's very light and has a very thin pocket on the outside. The only drawback was my bulky power cord barely fit in the outside pocket. It looks great and has a pretty good quality feel to it. I'm very happy with this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it seems","review":"I just returned this case due to the fact that the picture seems to show, and another review comments on the metal clips on the shoulder strap.

Though it fits, it's not the greatest notebook case I've had. So if you can find a better one, slightly higher in price, it might be worth it over this particular one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great price, but I can't really use this","review":"After reading some of the reviews, I decided to order this slip case. Well, first thing I noticed was the plastic clips for the strap. That's reason enough not to trust the integrity of this bag. The padding is minimal and I think should only be used as a slip inside another solid well built bag. I have to say that the price was terrific and it arrived quickly, nothing against the seller. I just think that some of the reviews here are a bit overzealous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice Bag For Laptop","review":"The Targus bag is a very nice carry bag for my laptop. The bag is a soft material like bag, not a heavy leather-like bag. At first I was concerned that the soft bag would not adequately protect the laptop. However, I took the bag / laptop to California (from NY) and found that me and the bag got along very well together. It was easy to handle in the overhead bin on the airplane. The bag protected my laptop very well. It has a few compartments for papers and pencils and such. Now that I've used it, I like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fits Dell Inspiron E1505 / 6400 nicely","review":"This case seems to be pretty good for the price, its a little something for protection and doesn't take up a lot of space.

So, usually I carry only the laptop; no cords, power bricks, or other gadgets. I wanted a lightweight case, and this is it. I bought it in 2009 and have used it daily since then. It could pass for new. There's enough padding, especially on the corners, that I don't worry about the laptop. Two pockets on one side let me carry the power brick, etc. if I need to. After more than three years of daily use, I'd buy this again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product","review":"I bought this bag for my boyfriend because he just purchased a new Mac laptop which is 15.4 inches and it fits perfectly in the case and has some extra room for papers/files or anything else you would take with you.

He also purchased a Targus zip up sleeve for his laptop which is another great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Light, but needs more padding","review":"I would rate this higher, but the padding is insufficient for a 17inch, 5lb laptop.

Good price, good company, but not very sturdy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good buy","review":"I had a Case Logic for a few years and I was very happy with it. When the shoulder strap finally broke, I decided to buy another one, but couldn't find the same model, so I settled for this Targus. What a disappointment! This case has virtually no compartments anywhere except an unsecured flimsy pocket in front. It is useful only if you are planning to carry your laptop and maybe a small notebook. I think I'll just use the shoulder strap for my old Case Logic and throw away the rest. A waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much storage","review":"There is one zippered area for the laptop, but the other pocket only has a small velcro tab.

I carry a mouse and a pair of head phones in the bag and its a tight fit.Got a lot of padding though to protect your laptop so you don't have to worry about being a little rough with it. Overall its a great quality product, and for around $17 including shipping I'd say its a really good bargain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Targus CVR217 Carrying Case for 17\\" Laptop","review":"I wanted a thin, not big or heavy carrying case for my 17\\" laptop for those times when I don't need to carry a lot of stuff. This lightweight, cushiony case is perfect. You can carry it or attach the shoulder strap. The outside front pocket is has a velco closure. Nice touch. The inside is primarily for the laptop, but can fit a few papers, and laptop accessories such as a mouse, AC cord, charger, computer lock and connector cable, but it is not a briefcase. If you want to carry a lot of paperwork and other office accessories, you will need a more traditional briefcase. I am very satisfied with this well-made, quality product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"Great book. The title is deceiving though there is little about Carlos.

If you are ever cut off and alone in Indian Territory and need help getting out,there are few things that would bring you greater comfort than to hear that he is heading up a team to come in and get you out.

Mr. Waugh is a real character and one of the true BTDT warriors we should all be proud to have serving our country. That said, what he lacks in writing ability he more than makes up for with guts and whit. This book gives you a pretty good feel for what CIA field ops do and how they do it.

Nevertheless, this is an altogether inadequate dictionary, even for beginners. There simply aren't enough words provided in this book. You are likely to become as frustrated as I was, after purchasing this book, to time and again fail to find definitions for commonplace words from day-to-day conversation.

The performances are uniformly excellent and the sound is incredible since this album was recorded 50 years ago.The track 'Moritat' is in fact 'The theme from the three penny opera', but it sounds remarkably similar to 'Mack the Knife'. Whatever the tune really is, Rollins is never less throughly inventive, as anyone who has seen him live will testify to. This track perhaps contains the highlight of the album, where Sonny Rollins trades 4's with the sadly recently deceased Max Roach.This is one of the classic Jazz albums and should be in everyones collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sound Warning!","review":"I'm too much of a neophyte jazz listener to add anything to the other reviews regarding the actual performance. But for a \\"remastered\\" version, the sound quality leaves much to be desired (hence the 4 stars). I'm guessing they used the master tape for a clothesline at some point. The overall sound quality is clear and full, but there are lots of glitches. In particular, there is the occasional sound fart in \\"St. Thomas\\" and \\"Strode Rode\\", and about 2 minutes into \\"Moritat\\", the ambience changes for about 40 seconds, which I can best describe as having a somewhat weaker left channel.Although distracting, by no means should this discourage you from buying this essential CD, but you may want to be on the lookout for (or lobby for) a re-remastered version."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great intro to Sonny...","review":"A good place to start if you are not terribly familiar with Sonny Rollins. It was nice to see this disc showcased on Ken Burns' \\"Jazz\\" special on PBS last year. Some argue this is not Sonny's best work, but it seems to be one of his best known works.

St. Thomas is a classic that belongs in any collection but signature pieces like \\"Strode Rode\\" and the ultra cool \\"Moritat\\" (Doug Watkins bass is great on this one [although Tommy Flanagan's piano does sound a bit \\"subdued\\" or \\"muffled\\") make this album a gem in any sized jazz collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sonny Rollins at the height of his emotional powers.","review":"Sonny Rollins at the height of his emotional powers. Max Roach has never played better then on this album. The interplay on STRODE RODE is amazing. A must for any jazz lover."},{"rating":"2","title":"the round sound","review":"I bought this CD a few months ago and though I liked it immediately, it took some time for it to take its place among my favorites.It's there now, though I can't say what was responsible for the delay. I was not too familiar with Sonny Rollins' work before this, and perhaps it seemed a bit predictable when compared to the fierce music of someone like John Coltrane, which I loved immediately. But eventually the roundness of the sax and the overall quality of the sound won me over.I have also noticed that this is one of my jazz CDs that even my non-jazz-loving friends seem to appreciate, something tells me that it would make a great introduction to either the genre or the artist.Once you get your copy, pay special attention to Blue 7 (track 5), which I think is the best on the CD. Also, if the wonderful track 4, Moritat, seems familiar, you may have heard a very similar version of the song done in the past with the name Mac the Knife."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the standard cd","review":"This far better than the standard cd. Especially in sacd format. I own the original DCC version as well. This version does pretty well in standard cd format. But sacd is a whole new level. You can actually hear the musician talking in the background. The only version that better was the 24 bit 192 download through a custom built $3500 da converter with a tube analog stage."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Collosal Ensemble!!!","review":"This is vintage Sonny, a must-have for any jazz fan. This disc is FUN to listen to repeatedly. All improvisors, not just saxophonists, should study Sonny's takes on \\"You Don't Know What Love Is\\" & \\"Moritat;\\" plus, hear the composer blow on his own now-standard St. Thomas. Also, as a rhythm section player, I feel this is a \\"must-study-over-and-over.\\" I'm blown away by Max Roach playing time on just the ride and hat for several consecutive choruses of \\"Moritat.\\" Doug Watkins is solid throughout and Tommy Flanagan is a perfect jazz pianist here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Epitome of Jazz","review":"I took a History of Jazz course and my professor recommended this album. He said something along the lines of, \\"This album is a must-have, even for non-fans of jazz.\\" I completely agree, if you're not intrigued by jazz, you will once you have this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shear Force of Will!","review":"One of the giants of jazz, Sonny may not have been as innovative as Coltrane, but he more than made up for it with his shear force of will. This is powerful playing from beginning to end. It is one of the most satisfying jazz recordings ever made. Sonny has a stellar group behind him giving this recording a fully rounded sound. Another must have is \\"Tenor Madness,\\" the one and only time, Rollins and Coltrane shared the same stage."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Rollins's best","review":"Sonny Rollins was at the time of this recording one of the greatest and most innovative tenorists. Today his stature is possibly somewhat overshadowed by that of John Coltrane, as Coltrane's individualism and innovative powers are very obvious. In his own way, though, Rollins also made a very important contribution as an innovator - perhaps especially in his handling of rhythm. In any case, he was certainly one of the most satisfying tenor players of his time, with a hard drive on up-tempo tracks, and melodious (never sentimental) lyricism on slower numbers. His phrasing was always interesting, articulate, and musical. This is an excellent record which shows him to great advantage, e.g. in \\"St Thomas\\" and \\"Moritat\\", though I personally think he is even more exciting when heading the trio on \\" A Night at the Village Vanguard\\", as, in truth, no pianist could really match him satisfactorily as a soloist, and he does not need a piano as an accompaniment. - Joost Daalder"},{"rating":"2","title":"grew on me","review":"I had to listen to this one several times before I truly appreciated it -- and it was well worth it. \\"Strode Rode\\" and \\"Moritat\\" are classics; \\"Blue 7\\" hits home also.Still, you might also want to consider Cannonball Adderley \\"Somethin' Else,\\" and for contrast some John Coltrane (Kens Burns has a good selection of Coltrane)."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Sonny Rollins recording","review":"I love this album, having had the LP for over 25 years. St. Thomas is so great, I wore out the grooves on that one, check out Max Roach's drum solo... Sorry, but I hate the way the other Amazon review starts out: \\"Though he lacked..\\" Give me a break! Rollins is one of the top jazz players of all time. Superlatives only, please."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overly Popular Saxophone Colossus Might Divert Audience from Sonny Rollins's True Talent","review":"While it is undeniable that the catchy theme of \\"St. Thomas\\" has made Saxophone Colossus the most beloved work of Sonny Rollins, the album fairly showcases his improvisational genius. As heard on \\"St. Thomas,\\" Rollins typically begins with cautions and then gradually develops into lyric lines. After the other musicians' solos, Rollins comes back with furious fast phrases before returning to the theme. Among the band members, drummer Max Roach is phenomenal, playing aggressive ad-libs while keeping the beat (especially on \\"Blue 7\\"). His interplays with Rollins are also thrilling (especially on \\"Strode Rode\\"). The variety of tunes, from calypso to Kurt Weill cover to authentic blues, shows Rollins's broad range of interests. Overall, Saxophone Colossus has remained as the most well-known work of his; being overly popular, it might divert the audience's attention from his true talent as a jazz improviser."},{"rating":"1","title":"RVG Remaster...Defective.","review":"I've tried two copies of this new Rollins (RVG) remaster. The left channel flutters and fades in the same places throughout both discs (e.g., track four, 2:20 - 2:30). I've heard from third parties that this is a problem with the master tapes. I find it makes the reissue distracting and unlistenable."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most melodic jazz musician","review":"Don't mind other reviews that place Rollins at at position behind Coltrane and Miles in skill and relative importance. Rollins, who is far too different stylistically from Coltrane and Miles to compare, has been utterly successful at producing the most melodic and thematic jazz of its history. \\"Saxophone Colossus\\" is a MASTERPIECE, and without a doubt is as perfect a jazz album as \\"Kind of Blue\\" or \\"Blue Train.\\" Each song contributes proportionally to produce a versatile, impressing, and beautiful album. For those who would like to get into jazz, they should first delve into this Rollins album even before \\"Kind of Blue\\", because patience is required for jazz, but less so for Rollins and than for Miles. I also recommend the film about Rollins that goes by the same title."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I've read 25 books on trading in the past year.

It is just reiteration of conventional trading maxim."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another run-of-the-mill book","review":"I bought this book seeing high ratings. Now, I feel generous even to give two stars.One appeal for this book was author's personal narrative and his claim of a loser-turned-winner after many years of struggles. There is a gap: his \\"winner\\" claim is not elaborated in any detail. What is his level consistency in terms of odds and net profits? It would have been helpful had he backed up with audited results the way Morales & Kacher did in their book using O'Neils methods (which provide decent odds when trading growth stocks in up trending markets).In summary, yet another 300+ pages of run-of-the-mill trading platitudes. If you have been trading for sometime, there are no insights here. Don't bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't help writing a review for this book","review":"I am a trader in Hong Kong. This book give me a lot of insight about trading. The chapter about the use of multiple time frame chart just open up my mind. What an enlightenment!! I recommend this book to all trader, especially to beginner. It is a good foundation. Someone said this book is too basic, I think that the basic things are the most important things for trading. Forget about, Gann, Market Profile, Wave theory, just back to the basic, KISS."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real Keeper","review":"I've bought alot of trading books, usually at 50 bucks a pop, and some of them really leave you groaning about. I rationalize that even one good idea, even it just reinforces something I already know or reminds of something I forgot or ignored then it's better that losing 50 bucks to the market. It's kind of like trading itself, you take some losses but the winners make up for it.This was a great book. One of the best sections I've seen on stops and exits. It goes more into the proper mentality than cookbook strategies, but it goes deep into areas alot of other books overlook or just don't develop beyond a few cliche's. If you're past the introduction level and already own all the indicator catalogs then this is a great pick. Not too deep into the tools, but good in that area too. Mentality and strategy development without becoming a psychology book. Excellent. The 1 star guys missed the point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful guiding and knowledgeable","review":"It is recommended for a trader starter like me or someone who need a reminder how to save money in trading.

A lot of shamanism and allusions that one can excel in 'better predicting' of the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not High Probabilty more like basic trading","review":"I would re-title this book to read, \\"Basic Trading Concepts\\". The book is nicely put together and does provide a good deal of information but the title is totally misleading in my opinion. Most of the material provided is general trading knowledge and not specific \\"high probability trading\\" methods. I was expecting actual techniques and specific entry and exit systems. If you're new to trading, this book will give you the basics. If you have been trading awhile, this book is mostly milk and no meat.JD in Pennsylvania"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time, Unless..................","review":"Central to the author's premise is that one cannot succeed if they are underfunded. Link defines underfunded as having less than 25-50k to start a trading account. While of course, the more money one has the easier it is to succeed in ANY business, it IS possible to achieve success with smaller capitalization one just needs to make smaller trades with lower priced stocks. One can still learn, and even afford to lose money it's just that their gains/losses will not initially be as substantial as a higher stakes trader. If you discover a winning strategy, remain disciplined, don't set unrealistic expectations, and don't allow yourself to become overexposed, you can succeed with a more modest account balance.Overall, a negative read. Josh DiPietro's The Truth About Day Trading Stocks was a much better read for the beginner."},{"rating":"2","title":"SUPERB ADVICE","review":"This book makes alot of sense, its not only for beginners, its for anyone who wants to be profitable.

This book really makes it clear that 90% of traders are losers and 10% winners and the winners make a living from the losers.Beside that clear concept (that will put you on the right track for a disciplined approach of the market), there is nothing really important in this book for anyone who had the opportunity to have a supervisor or head of desk.

Then, as if though the lack of action couldn't hurt it more, you have an extremely bad plot with some very cheesy villains and terrible humor that only works a quarter of the time.

Well, now i know, i should stick to the casino's if i wanna try my luck. The tape was reversing from side A to B continuosly. So, following the instructions of another user, i opened the tape and took out the black wheel next to the cassette head. That stopped the reversing, but the volume was so low you could barely hear it even after turning up the Ipod's and the Stereo's volume.

I heard the Sony cassette adapter is good, so i'm gonna try that next. Good luck..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating to use","review":"I have the same problem some other reviewers had: the audio was extremely low unless I manually adjust the cassette. It's not that easy - you have to stick your finger into the cassette slot while the adapter is in there, and wiggle it forward and backward until the audio adjusts. But that doesn't always work. If that doesn't work, you then have to turn your hand over and use your fingernail to catch a ridge on the adapter and lift it up a bit. I'd rather not have an accident on the highway by either (1) fiddling with the audio, or (2) smashing the adapter into little pieces while I drive.Hundreds of songs on the ipod and no way to listen while you drive..."},{"rating":"2","title":"for the price it's great","review":"I occasionally notice a small mechanical clicking noise coming from the cassette drive- it doesn't bother me much but then I mostly listen to talk.

I figured I'd try this cheap adapter because the model in the local store was $20 which seemed to high. I received it today and the quality is terrible. There is a lot of noise, and the frequency response does not allow for any highs. SO I plugged in my old one, just for comparison, and it's like night and day. Looking at the cassette I can see that my old one had a much larger head than the new one. That's probably the problem.

The author's research seems to be thorough and he went to archives and to the sites important to the story he tells as he wrote his book. There are no footnotes as such, but there are source notes and a bibliography which satisfies me that this is a competent and trustworthy accoount of a rivetingly daring expedition. It is at times compellingly exciting, to such an extent that one had to remind oneself that they did find the strait which bears Magellan's name and did get thru it. This book is a winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is terrific","review":"You might not have thought about Magellan much (...) but this is a great adventure story.Some of the grand subjects for biographers weren't always the nicest human beings. This fact is part of the tension in \\"Over the Edge.\\" Bergreen can't decide whether Magellan should be more scorned for his ill treatment of the crew or admired for the greatness of his navigation and ballsy achievement.The book reads more like a contemporary magazine story than your standard turgid historical work, as if Bergreen was writing about something 30 years ago instead of hundreds of years ago. It feels fresh. And it's got enough plot elements to keep anyone happy, even if you have no interest in navigation or exploration -- political intrigue,(...), travelogue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Retelling of Historical Facts","review":"Very enjoyable reading. Reads like a novel, not a fifth grade text book. However, it is NOT made clear that the Kindle version deletes the maps and illustrations found in the print version. That was disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and educational","review":"This book was a very quick read and gave some new insights into the first recorded circumnavigation of the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting","review":"This was a very interesting book about a topic which I knew very little about. The rivalry between Portugal and Spain over the spice trade caused the Pope to \\"split\\" the Earth into two halves. The problem was than nobody knew where the borders were. The book explains Magellan's path using maps which were only approximations of where continents and islands were thought to be. Perhaps the most interesting part of the book dealt with Magellan's discovery of the Phillipines and his adventual suicidal death at the hands of the natives. The sexual exploits of the sailors and natives as well as the drudgery and hardship made this a very interesting book. I enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"fascinating history","review":"This is a fascinating read, full of details (politics of the time, how ships operate, torture, sexual mores of various tribes around the world, etc.). The story of the first voyage around the world is so amazingly dramatic one would say \\"too far fetched\\" if it were fiction. Every page is so rich with detail that you want to just slow down as you read. The only slight flaw is that the characters do not come quite as alive as I would have liked. But everything else about this book is so good, it's well worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magellificent!","review":"Over 200 men and five ships set out to circumnavigate the globe. Magellan hires a chronicler, Pigafetta, to document the entire trip. Amazingly, Pigafetta is one of only 18 men to survive the entire journey. So we have a complete record of the trip, each day dutifully recorded. Bergreen expands greatly on this, providing political context for the funding and preparations of the trip and adds many historical and geographical details along the way. \\"Over the Edge of the World\\" is a fascinating account of this adventure from five centuries ago. Riveting!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating Ride","review":"Having just finished The Lost City of Z (highly recommended), I was looking for another book on exploration and found this book. What a page turner! Bergreen kept me rivetted from the first page and I found the historical context as well as the actual voyage itself extremely interesting and absorbing. I had no clue about the Portuguese/Spanish race to the Spice Islands and how influential both countries were in the 1500s. Nor did I know how advanced the Chinese were in early exploration. I cannot fathom how much work Mr Bergreen put into creating this book - all the translations, historical documents etc etc - its extremely impressive. I was amazed by the conflicting views of Magellen himself - a cruel tyrant and yet a brilliant navigator. This book was enthralling from beginning to end. I was very sad when the book ended and will be seeking out Bergreen's book on Marco Polo soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!","review":"My husband read this book in two days, lostsleep.. he was out of commision for those daysfascinated.. mezmerized.

Author's understanding of Spain highly accurate..His appreciation of the terror of the sea superb. Based on what I know, I can only assume rest of book equally well researched.I think I am reasonably well educated but there was a large void concerning pre_19 century Pacific Rim. Book helped to fill something of that void."},{"rating":"2","title":"An historic trip around the world turned into a page-turner","review":"It is a thrilling adventure story like \\"Endurance\\" but more significant from a discovery and historical point of view. You get to go on a great adventure with incredible twists and turns and gain an education along the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thrilling adventure","review":"That was a very good book. To read about Magellan's make-up and history was a great experience. Add to that the mystery, the rebellions and mutiny, the peoples encountered and you have on your hands an A-1 story. What about Sebastien El Cano? After being tortured by Magellan, he took the Victoria home, only by that time a wrecked ship, manned by a few filhty, hopelessly sick and starving people.Those men were without fear!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Compact writing, non-sentimental, ...this book is excellent. It incorporates quite a bit of shipboard terminology and habits that remind me of Samuel Eliot's \\"Admiral of the Ocean Sea,\\" about Columbus.To open the book, Laurence Bergreen offers a good description of the turbulent politics of Spain vs. Portugal before and during the expedition. Then he goes on to relate a fascinating and readable history of the world-changing voyage.Lovely work.Bonus -- My P.S. edition has illustrations and a handy map at the front, but lacks more detailed maps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great history of magellan's voyages","review":"Over the edge of the world presents a fascinating history of the voyages of magellan covering his attempts to get financing and backing, the voyages themselves, conflicts they encountered and uprisings and mutinys on his ships.The history is told in a more journalistic rather than purely academic style using contemporary accounts of magellan's voyages from his biographer Atonio Pigafetta and other sources.One of the fascinating aspects of this account is the descriptions of the Chinese fleet and the implications of its voyages. Gavin Menzes describes some of his hypotheses on the Chinese voyages in his book 1421.Overall a great historical account."},{"rating":"2","title":"Over the Edge and Beyond!","review":"This book held me captivated until the very end! It was a thrilling journey with some very surprising insights into the story about Magellan's circumnavigation that I never learned in school. Bergreen's writing style is very entertaining and successfully translates the events of Magellan's circumnavigation into a masterly woven tale of adventure on the high seas, Kings and politics, mutiny, cannibals, myths, and humanity. This book will take you over the edge of the world and beyond. If you enjoy this book, I also suggest the following true histories of adventure and strife on the open seas: 'Sea of Glory: America's Voyage of Discovery, the US Exploring Expedition 1838-1842' and 'In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex' both by Nathanial Philbrick."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little tedious sometimes but totally exciting/interesting","review":"This book is perfect for those who are interested in either historical accounts of exploration and adventure... or those who are fascinated by the perils of life on the sea. What I personally loved about this book was the detailed accounts of the people, places, and situations Magellan's fleet encountered on their journey to circumnavigate the globe. The writer, Bergreen, obtained his info from a diary kept by one of Magellan's crew members named Pigafetta. I believe that Bergreen's story was extremely accurate, easy to understand and follow (altho maps would definitely have helped), and it was full of action and adventure with mutinies, torture, hurricanes, shipwrecks, cannibals, and much much more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Plodding and conventional","review":"The fascinating story of Magellan is not told with much style, intuition, or technical knowledge here. The author is quick to invoke a 21st century tut-tut whenever Magellan is not sufficiently sensitive to the natives, which must make him feel good, but adds nothing to our understanding of the time. Lots of digressions into fairly uninteresting matters fill out the book, apparently to conceal a lack of specific information on many of the events of the voyage. No original thoughts, research, or insights. No feel for the seaman's life, such as we might get from Patrick O'Brian or someone else with a solid understanding of the subject matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"I read this as a young boy. Even better the second time around. I would definitely recommend this book. Its a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truth Stranger than Fiction","review":"Another example of how your history teacher lied to you - or at least, left out a whole lot of stuff. Amazingly, everyone has heard of Magellan, but I would be willing to bet that few people know more than \\"he circumnavigated the world\\" - a statement that is technically false, since he actually died about halfway through the voyage. Anyway, a great read - portions of this book are mystifying, as if you are reading Gulliver's Travels or some other old fiction. The ignorance of the Europeans during the Age of Discovery is willful and tragic. Still, you can't deny that Magellan opened up the modern world and destroyed ancient perceptions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Was going good, but lacked that little \\"something\\"","review":"It seems that the author was very well documented. It was very clear his effort in keeping a \\"balanced\\" position, and not to be too much \\"judgemental\\". The author tried his best to make us understand how things in the 16th century use to work (if anyone thinks that our times are tough, take a look at those days). And for all that, I am happy. But there was missing that little \\"I don't know what\\" that takes a \\"good\\" book, into a \\"great\\" book. Anyway, the book is highly recommended for anyone who wants to know about that amazing story of humankind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down!","review":"Extraordinary! A great read. It has found a special place in my 'special' books place on the bookshelf!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great read!","review":"Very good read for learning about those days when Spain ruled the world with their sailing ships that controlled trade. Lots of great history that you heard a little about but never got more of. Goes well with Carribean by James Michener and Under the black flag by David Cordingly,and The pirate hunter by Richard Zacks(might as well learn about pirates if you're thinking about ships that sailed the seas!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Written in novel format","review":"This book is unevenly written. Either the author or the book has been dumbed down. The Book gets better, but spends an inordinate amount of time in Spain examining the relationships of the players. Some of the background material is good. A sense of high drama is infused in every situation, which has it's good and bad sides in a work of history. For those who find the average history book too dry, this might be a good book. It tries very hard to give you a vantage point of the times and characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book Needs A Good Editor","review":"Sometimes the story here just drags like an anchor in the water. The book needed a professional editor who cared about the subject matter more. There needs to be more story telling, more life to the subject matter. In the end the book was dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"...nobody knows about ELCANO?","review":"It is very sad that in the presentation of the book you can find in this web, there is not any comment or even a reminder about the man in charge of the survivors of that trip. It was the spaniard Sebastian Elcano and he was the first in circunnavigating the globe. Magallanes died at the half of that trip. Let's be rigorous and give the honor to whom deserve."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating read","review":"A great read, very well written, really grabs your attention - who knew history could be so bl00dy exciting? Definitely recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"When the World was a Much BIgger Place","review":"With all the adrenaline packed adventure stories out there, its refreshing to read one that combines, history, science (crude science!), and politics with a great adventure story. SO while Magellan's epic voyage around the world and the dangers he encounters and brings upon himself will keep you on the edge of your seat, you'll also learn plenty about history, the tone of the times, and what those who lived during the 1500's knew of the world they lived in.THe author is a fantastic biographer, writer, and historian. THis ensures an accurate, fair and non-hero worshipping portrait of Magellan and those who accompanied him on his historic voyage, one which had epic repurcussions on the commerce and politics of the times. I put this book near the top of all of the 100's of adventure/travel/history books that I have read. Its also worth noting that the author was kind enough to respond to my e-mail praising his book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, not great","review":"The narrative here is good, not great. It's a powerful story, not interrupted by PC misinterpretation. It's the truth, reasonably well-told."},{"rating":"2","title":"Astounding story, wonderfully written","review":"All the stuff your 11th Grade History class overlooked!A thoroughly readable book, (I've been through it three times now), full of pathos, intrigue and death-defying moments. Magellan hadn't even LEFT the harbor on his audacious attempt to sail around South America to Asia before the King of Spain and all Magellan's backers had already abandoned him as a traitor. Unbelievable!An incredible story, beautifully written, that involves the reader with important flashes into life (and death) during the early 1500's.Get this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent! A Great Read!","review":"Excellent book! Very well and thoroughly researched, with excellent explanatory comments regarding various customs, historical mentalities, and other pertinent information to really make the account come alive. My only complaint would be that the book seems to rush rather quickly through the events following the crew's departure from the Spice Islands. Overall, very much worth reading!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened here","review":"I saw the premiere of this movie at the sundance film festival and was owe struck by the dylan performance in the movie. After watching him stroll into his seet , it made watching him perform that much better. Throughout the movie I told my friends that this soundtrack is going to be great because of all teh songs dylan re-recorded and played and the few good cover like \\"One more cup of coffee.\\" I will never understand why the soundtrack does not include any of the great songs performed during the movie and why they opted to go with more spanish and foreign language songs then english. But i suppose thats the mystery of DYLAN that we will never know. When I asked CHristian Slater what the movie was about at the after party he said one thing \\"I have no idea\\" so maybe that puts things into perspective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ego trip","review":"Save your money and buy something else. The Dylan performances are few and uninspired. The rest -- peformances of Dylan -- are sometimes good, sometimes amusing, sometimes odd, but don't amount to much as a collection. I wanted to see the movie until I heard the soundtrack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash and Garbage","review":"I bought this CD from this site used for $9.24, including tax. Thank Heaven I did.The majority of the cover versions don't even SOUND like Dylan's music. The chief example is \\"Like A Rolling Stone.\\" I love Spanish music, but come on guys! You could have done it with more rhythm. The Japanese version of \\"My Back Pages\\" was ok. The only saving graces of this album to even make a STAR was Sertab's \\"One More Cup of Coffee,\\" Jerry Garcia's \\"Senor (Tales of Yankee Power)\\" and, of course, the Dylan performances. What they should have done was thrown out four of the tracks and put in the extra Dylan performances in the film, including \\"Dirt Road Blues,\\" \\"I'll Remember You\\", \\"Blowin' In the Wind,\\" and \\"Amazing Grace.\\"My fave from this album is \\"Cold Irons Bound.\\" Vicious, angry, cynical, and just...Dylan. This and the other three good tracks make it worth buying USED. But not new."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good album","review":"This album, from the movie that I never saw is pretty damn good. Lots of good covers of Bob Dylan songs. There's an Italian rap version of Like A Rolling Stone that I'm guessing you'll either love or hate. I happen to love it. I believe that this movie was soundly panned when it came out, which may or may not be good enough reason to rent it!Viva Bob Dylan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and no new songs","review":"As a long tim Dylan fan I was hoping for more. The opening track in Japanese is a neat novelty but wears thin fast. The\\"new recordings\\" from Dylan are not new songs but new versions of two of his tunes and two covers. The cover of Dixie is really pathetic and in general he sounds like doesn't care on the other tunes either.They included Garcia's cover of Senor, which has been around a long long time and a few others that are quite weak.If you want a good Dylan cover CD, buy the new Gospel cover disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"surprisingly good","review":"This is really surprisingly good. Highlights are the Italian hip-hop version of \\"Like a Rolling Stone,\\" Bob singing \\"Dixie\\" (I thought it would be an amusing novelty, but it actually sounds really, really good--not a bad song despite its historical associations), a lovely, trippy version of \\"One More Cup of Coffee\\" and Shirley Caesar's Bible thumping version of \\"Gotta Serve Somebody.\\" Really the only low point is the version of \\"Most of the Time,\\" distinguished only by the pronoun trouble that ruins many of the rhymes, along with the general lack of information about the actual music in the liner notes (when I go see the movie, maybe I'll want to read about it--now I just wanna know who some of these singers and musicians are)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant, original and enjoyable","review":"There is a lot of good music here and serious thoughts. Listen to the preacher's injunction at the beginning. The tone is of the typical evangelistic tirade, but the words are quite different: \\"God does not suffer. He does not feel pain...People, ask yourselves a question, are you humble before God?\\" This is Buddhist not evangelistic Christian. It's a question only, are you humble or not. Meanwhile, there are foreign language and other English speaking version of Dylan classics, four great renditions by Dylan and the excellent band that had Larry Campbell, Charlie Sexton, Tony Garnier. It ends with the \\"Dixie Hummingbirds\\" version of a great new Dylan gospel song, \\"City of Gold\\". The original Dixie Hummingbirds are in their second century of existence now, God bless them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!","review":"This soundtrack is one of the best things I've heard in a long time. I saw the movie twice, mainly because it can't be viewed just once since so much is missed in the first viewing, but I also plan to buy the DVD when it comes out because I think this movie is something pretty special with a serious message for those who really listen and pay attention.Overall, this CD is great. Lots of interesting aspects due to versions of Dylan's songs being sung in various languages and mostly because Dylan does an amazing job on both Diamond Joe and Dixie. This one's a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"southerner","review":"This is an excellent album. I especially like \\"Dixie,\\" which is usually sung as an anthem. Dylan sings it in a much more personal and lyrical way. This is subtle. He is singing about a \\"Dixie\\" of the soul, a place before the triumph of modern industialism and commercialism, although he is certainly not immune to the present."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sound compilation.","review":"This is well done....not the BEST compilation guitar finger-style CD, but worthy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tasty sampling of six string sweetness.","review":"This CD nearly made me sell my acoustic guitar. I mean, why even try right? \\"Sad little girl\\" maybe one of the prettiest melodies ever written. This song makes you want to trek through some lovely woods on a fall day to a log cabin, where you sip warm apple cider beside a fire as the sunsets and soothing melodies envelope you. This cd warms and awakens my soul in a way that no musical selection ever has before. This is a must get, especially for guitar buffs, but for anyone who enjoys beautiful melody and technical proficiency."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recording quality superb, perfectly balanced. Fantastic!","review":"I bought this album because I am a fan of Leo Kottke, and because I had heard of Billy McLaughlin and Eric Tingstad. What I discovered was a group of unbelievably talented guitarists I'd never heard of such as Don Ross, Bill Mize, Pat Kirtley (my personal favorites in this particular album). Every song in this album, without exception, is a keeper. I went out the next week looking for more albums like this. I'm hooked!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Stuff..","review":"Stephen Bennet on a Dyer Harp guitar, Pat Kirtley's bell-like guitar work.

The CD includes some great music and new arrangements that I was unfamiliar with. Dulin plays the fire out of the piano on this CD. I heard him play live in New York, and he is a great player. I have a lot of Gershwin's music, and this CD is one of my favorites!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Celtic and World Music","review":"This music is wonderful...a blend of Celtic, European, a touch of bluegrass, and even a song with somewhat of an \\"eastern\\" influence. This is not the typical cliche accordion music...it's the way that accordion (and other instruments as well) should be played. The only criticism that I have lies with Amazon. If you search for the artist, John Whalen, the search engine says that nothing is found. You have to search by the title of the CD...Celtic Crossroads. I stumbled across his work when \\"exploring similar music\\" to other Celtic artists that I enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Shoes!","review":"These are gorgeous.

One in black and one pair in brown."},{"rating":"2","title":"Justin's Great Book","review":"The Work and The Glory: A Pillar of Light is the first in a series of books that tells how the Mormon Church was organized. It is told through a fictional family, the Steeds. This family goes through many tribulations and hardships because of their membership in the Church. The Steeds are friends with some of the key people in the organization of the Mormon Church.I really liked this book becuase it is very exciting, and always captivating. Gerald N. Lund is a great author, and is very good at making a boring subject into and exciting novel. I would recommend this book to anyone of any age."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavy on the \\"fiction\\"","review":"For a person wanting a \\"Little House on the Prarie\\" imatation I suppose that it is tolerable, however the characters are superficial and the story line is trite. You will find the stereo-typical unrealistically good brother, the extremely wicked brother, and the love interests. The representation of females through the first 3 books ( I didn't read any further books) is reprehensible! Wretched creatures that can do little more than flirt, have babies and cry. As far as anyone that wants to learn the history of the LDS church, skip this book and pick up a book by a real historian at the library. After reading much of LDS history written by those who make it their profession to create a dispasionate and accurate historical account, I find this series very disapointing. There is little of real historical interest in these books - what is there is so dilute it removes any of the real facination in the history of this religion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fictional History, nothing more, nothing less.","review":"Mr. Lund has given us a wonderful work of fiction. He presents his book as an accurate portrayal of the history of the LDS Church, even showing the mistakes and human frailties of some early church leaders to make it look convincing.Mr. Lund is an LDS author, and he presents the very sterilized view of history that the LDS church wants the world to believe. The writing style and the storytellilng are first rate, but if you are looking for a more accurate history of the LDS church, try a different book, such as One Nation Under Gods by Richard Abanes."},{"rating":"2","title":"This would make an excellent mini-series","review":"I have just started on Volume 8 of this series, and I have just one word to describe this series of books-superb. This is drama brought to life. The historical detail, the descriptions of scenes, the backdrops and the story all testify to a master author. These books would make an excellent mini-series on television and would have a wide appeal because of the drama involved (eg. the persecutions and the sufferings) and the glorious things brought to light. Once you get started reading this series, you will get hooked. I started reading volume 1 in November and am now on volume 8."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indiscribable!","review":"This book is indiscribable there is no word great enough to describe it. Gerald N. Lund is fantastic in his description of the early days of the church and the story of the Steeds gets you all wrapped up in it!

I have read the series 2 times already in the past year and have to stop myself from reading them again. I love your books and the Work and the Glory have taught me so much about this wonderful church. I have gotten to know Joseph Smith so much and want to know him in person one day. I feel like I know the Steed family and have come to better appreciate what the Saints have gone through and done for us. Thank you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"These books by Lund are absolutely captivating !!","review":"A family member started reading these books and when she was through with vol. 1-3, passed them around. I couldn't believe all the excitement that the books generated, so I started reading them myself. At the rate I'm going, I'll have all 9 vol. read by summer. It's almost impossible to put these books down. Their popularity is spreading like wild fire.

I wasn't disappointed at all. This movie had great characters,good plot, wonderful music. My only small gripe is that the ending left me wanting more movie. LOL"},{"rating":"2","title":"Reckless and wanting more out of life","review":"I've had this movie on VHS for about 20 years and never saw it on DVD prior to doing a search on Amazon. Great flick highlighting teen angst of the early 80's with a backdrop of a gritty decaying steeltown. Aiden Quinn is awesome and Daryl Hannah never looked better. Everyone knows Splash, but this was the movie she made just before it. If you've seen the show Chuck, you'll get a kick seeing a much younger Adam Baldwin. Soundtrack showcased many early 80's bands like Romeo Void which also was a highlight for me. Good movie. I was hoping it would be released in Blu ray, but not yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some IMPORTANT DETAILS are OMITTED. They left me UNSATISFACTORY due to unanswered questions.","review":"Some IMPORTANT DETAILS are OMITTED. They left me UNSATISFACTORY due to unanswered questions.- The book is beautifully printed with glossy paper and colored and black-and-white photos. Each story has more than 2 photos.- It contains 26 stories from page 8 to 350. So, on the average, each has 13 pages.- Many times they annoyed me because they left me with unanswered important questions. For example, in the story, titled \\"Silent Witness\\", the author wrote suspected rapist David Frediani were convicted twice. He appealed the verdict twice and won. There was no explanation why he won the appeals. This is a crime, not a novel. The reason for acquitting is very important here. Yet, the book does not bother with it.In short, this book is not worth reading in terms of true crimes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I like Susie Bright and wanted to enjoy this book but it's just an aimless collection of rants.

Rarely did it deliver what the title promised."},{"rating":"1","title":"*SHUDDER*","review":"This book has some fundamental flaws. Her random hypothesis, based seemingly on magic and medieval spirituality, is too far fetched to have any practical application in the real world or to any rational person. Her switch from first person to third person to a seemingly mystical nymph all in the same sentence had me at wit's end trying to determine exactly what she was trying to conclude. Having the entire book written without punctuation, correct spelling, or paragraphs had a hard edge when she was trying to prove her point at the beginning, but it soon dwindles to boring drivel and makes it exceptionally uninteresting to read. Ms. Bright should not only get out of her ivory tower, she should jump from its highest point. A must read for anyone recently lobotomized."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull beyond words","review":"I read this , but can barely remember what it said. Repetitive, stale, and not well-written.

There is a bratty, demanding girl who insists that her grandfather row across the river to buy her socks. When she stubbornly refuses to wash them, people and animals react in an exaggerated manner until her friends take the matter into their hands.

But as a mom, I do not approve this for my young child because the hidden message of the story is not positive to any young person. At the end of the story, the young girl kiddingly said that if she waited long enough, her friends at school would clean her clothes for her. While it sounds very funny and she is most likely only joking, it conveys the idea that \\"if one waits long enough OTHERS WILL DO THINGS FOR THEM\\". I would much rather pick other funny books that will teach my child positive values/characters at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always Pleasantly Surprised","review":"Robert Munsch again creates a great story that children will enjoy.

I guess I am just intellectually lazy, but I thought this was a stupid book. I only read it because I am reading the National Book award winners. I am glad I got this one read.

The recording of the instrumentation seems a little distant on some tracks, but the vocals are glorious. They are crisp, clean and up front. This set has amazingly clean sound for historic recordings from 1954 ( Magic Flute); and 1955 (all others). The only drawback that I can see with this set is that there are no librettos or any other informational insert for that matter. It's just the CDs, sleeves and box.

There is a Volume 2 available as well which features a further 30 tracks. The only slightly negative comment I'd make is that some of the songs fade out earlier than they do on their original albums, but I guess in order to squeeze in 30 tracks on each CD, they would have been struggling to fit them all in otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor vendor,good product","review":"I choses this rating purely on the service.

I am not a director and am somewhat disappointed( and feel misled)by the posted decription of this book. I would not have bought it for my collection.

He was nicknamed \\" Tom Cat Of The Keys \\" for ample reasons . He simply pounded the piano with both hands but in quite a musical jazz way . Was too young to catch his band but have I think all of his recordings. Bob's band was a cross between Bob Crosby's happy dixie crew who he played with and the great Will Bradley-Ray McKinley Boogie Woogie Band.The band had only one huge weakness it was comprised of some real heavy boozers and Bob died at a young age I think 34. If not mistaken think some of his band members did too . If you enjoyed the old Bob Crosby and Bradley Bands you will cherish Zurke's Band .This CD is well worth it simply for his strong swinging piano playing .Damn wished he lived a few years longer would have loved to have a \\"Taste \\" with him and dig his piano playing .John Rowland"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interview with History","review":"This book shows what a fascinating woman Oriana Fallaci was.

I would recommend purusing this book in the bookstore first before buying it and I believe you will put it back on the shelf and move on. However, if you have a lot of time on your hands, and have time to go to the max with \\"touchy feely\\" concepts you might be able to get through it. It is in my home library, on the shelf and will probably stay there until it gets crowded out by worthwhile books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unabashed ...","review":"Grabhorn is certainly an appropriate last name for this author since she unabashedly GRABBED the complex metaphysical philosophy as taught for many years by Abraham-Hicks, put it in her own \\"folksy\\" language, and claimed it as her own. Having listened to the Abraham-Hicks tapes, I cringed as I read the very same words and ideas, disguised, just enough, I suppose, to avoid a law suit. I am floored at her audacity. There is the very briefest of nods to Abraham-Hicks in the Introduction, but her text comes ENTIRELY from their teachings. This is a really ugly example of someone capitalizing on someone else's work."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works","review":"Though the book could be more tightly organized and doesn't explore the area of maintaining an attitude of joy in intimate relationships very deeply, the concepts she presents do work.

It is a book you would want to read more than once, possibly 2-3 times a year to keep you on track and aware of your actions.This book is also very helpful to explain the Law of Attraction to a person who has just been made aware and wants to learn more in a straightforward manner and from a different perspective. Like any concept that is new to someone, hearing it from different angles helps our minds wrap itself around it with greater ease. And successive readings of this text will help us to continue graduating to greater levels of understanding and conceptualization.I enjoyed reading this book and it is easy to read.Stephen"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much cheerleading - no depth","review":"Lynn Grabhorn discovered a secret. At least she thought it was a secret. This was the one thing that everyone has been looking for and she stumbled across it. And, let me tell you, she's here to tell you the secret. With a megaphone. And maybe a PA turned up really loud.\\"Excuse Me\\" is her secret. Don't look for anything other than cheerleading. Nothing here is substantiated. All her premises are assumed. Her belief that feelings (and their particular 'energies) mold your life are what she shouts about. Sadly this is one of her more sane ideas.The book is certainly entertaining. Her writing style is rather poor, I think, but engaging. There is some entertainment value here but I really can't recommend the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST self help book I've ever read","review":"This book is awesome.

It was the first metaphysical book I read that made sense to me. From this book I have continued. Try it on for size. See how it feels. A few other books I recommend along these lines.

Lynn's flamboyant yet sincere style makes this an easy-to-understand and easy-to-do book. With almost a decade invested in this approach, I have learned so much about how to self manage from this book.

She's essentially recommending positive thinking and sending out positive \\"feeling vibrations\\" into the universe together with such profound advice as \\"if something's bugging you, get over it.\\" I have to say that after reading the book, I'm extremely suspicious that many of the reviews here must have been written by associates of the author or publisher. I just can't believe that that many people would find this stuff at all motivating or insightful.

Seth, through Jane Roberts, teaches deeper levels of this in The Nature of Personal Reality and The Individual and the Nature of Mass Events. Lynn received her inspiration and techniques from Abraham, through Esther Hicks. The books are A New Beginning Parts 1 & 2. The website is www.abraham-hicks.com and it the best source of this information. I just saw Wayne Dyer in Boston and it is clear he is an Abraham/Hicks reader.

If you're in need of repetition to understand a concept, then this book is written for you. The concept is good, the writing is less than juvenile. If you took out the cliches, you'd have 150 pages NOT 300+. It will begin to irritate if you catch on quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weird.","review":"If you can believe right now this minute that you are vibrating to a universal rhythm, that you are the sole cause of all your fortunes and misfortunes simply via the power of your feelings, then this is the book for you. It was very strange, yet interesting, and something I just might try. Most, if not all, of it made perfect sense, and even the tiny little things I have been attempting seem to be working so far.

This book is wonderful, helpful, and very interesting but I can't help but notice all the similarities of the concepts to the bestselling book \\"The Secret\\"(which I also love). This book was written before \\"The Secret\\" came out so it seems to me that this is the \\"original\\", or at least one of the earlier books written on practicing the Law Of Attraction.

If you have negativty, or fear in your life, very often the thing you want least to happen, actually happens. Conversely, if you TRULY believe in the best for you and for others, that too, is what manifests. Lynn is not the only person in the world saying this, it's not new. She does it in a down-to-earth, if somewhat simple fashion. For some, the style is too simplistic, for other's is just right. I had to get over some of the cutesy stuff to get at the content and I believe it was worth it. I feel sorry for those who don't believe they're in control of their destiny. Although, that way, they don't ever have to take responsibility for their life. I prefer to at least attempt to take a positive approach to my life -- it serves me well. This book helps me to remember to take charge."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot of The Secret came from here! Lynn is Fantastic!","review":"A lot of The Secret came from here! Lynn is Fantastic!

Essentially they are both talking about the Law Of Attraction. This book however puts it more in a language that is easier to understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worste Self Help Book I have ever Read","review":"This book is full of good intentions gone bad. Fragmented ideas coupled with faulty logic makes this perhaps the worste book of this type I have ever read. If you are looking for ways to improve your life, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like attracts like?","review":"Having been through several physics courses and knowing physicists, I felt the author was just pulling her \\"physics\\" out of thin air. Never have I heard, from any credible physicist, that any of what she said is true. Like attracts like? I've never heard that \\"law\\" associated with any law of magnetism. Last I heard, opposites attract when dealing with magnetism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I ordered a used copy of this book and was disappointed when it arrived. It was an earlier edition than the one pictured. Even more disappointing was the amount of writing and underlining in the book. The store advertised the book as something better than \\"average\\". It was my impression that it would be almost \\"like new\\". That was definitely not the case. I did email the seller with my thoughts and was refunded the purchase price almost immediately. So, I give a \\"5\\" for customer service but only a \\"2\\" for the item itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"what planet does this woman live on?","review":"Electromagnetic attraction? Mind vibrations?

I don't think my wife got breast cancer because she had some negative thoughts and when I got to the section where she wrote \\"sin is nothing but a man-made abomination to foster control by others\\" I closed the book and said what garbage. She doesn't have a clue about life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audio version....","review":"I had begun to read the hard back version, and thought the book made fairly good sense. So I decided to buy the book on tape, because I never seem to have time to read as much as I would like! Ms. Gabhorn has a slight speech impediment which distracted me from her message. The concept, from hearing it in her voice, seemed a little too cheery and shallow. It is not that simple. To see a car (for example) that I want, and to visualize me having it, and then expect to get it is not the reality."},{"rating":"2","title":"A life changing book","review":"This book has been a life transforming guide for me and many of my friends. I have been recommending it to others who are looking for real change in their lives. It is about the Law of Attraction. Whatever vibration you are putting out there is what you will always get back. It all comes down to your every thought and once you are aware of your thoughts you can change them to a higher vibration. This book shows you how to do that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Message is good but.....","review":"I really wanted to like this book, the reviews are so good that I expected good things. Instead I got a book with a message that would have made a great magazine article but was poorly written and repetitive. She blames people for their illnesses and even blames a woman who died due to another's throwing a large rock from an overpass. The deceased wasn't vibrating at a high enough level so she was to blame.The book is poorly written and uses the word \\"dude\\" way too many times. The author also says, \\".....and no I am not retarded\\". I found this an unusual turn of phrase for a book about manifesting. I went online to find out more about the author and was shocked at what I found, she started thinking that she was going be made into a light being on another planet so she had assisted suicide. The whole story makes me wish I had not read the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excuse Me, Your Life is Waiting","review":"This book is profoundly important. It gave me goosebumps ofjoy, ecstasy and hope and made me cry from happiness! The otherreviewers are right -- you will never need another self-help bookafter reading this. The application of the universal laws are very simple but will transform your life. It is a book to be read over and over again -- a delight! Thank you, Lynn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely awesome and life changing","review":"This is the only self help one should read, if you really want to change your life. It really tells you why visualization, positive thinking, and the such, often don't work in and of themselves. I loved this book so much, and it has been making such a difference in my life. I have given copies to several people, and they too, have begun to notice changes once they REALLY begin to follow it.

You gotta love someone who names a chapter on human electromagnetic fields \\"Look Ma, I'm Vibrating\\". I'm more than willing to try her recommendation of visualizing what you want for 15 minutes a day. What have I got to lose?But... but... the thing that holds me back from accepting her whole philosophy about positive/negative vibrations and their results is I keep wondering: \\"Do successful people really do this?\\" I know people with quite a lot of money and success, and they're just as cranky, fearful and negative as the rest of us. On the whole though, Grabhorn presents very intriguing ideas, and this book has even inspired me to check out the work of her source, Esther Hicks."},{"rating":"2","title":"no more waiting","review":"This book has been very though provoking and so far I am giving the process a shot, nothing to lose right!

However, I have never been compelled to write a review about any of them...until now. I think everyone who wants to live a successful life needs to read this book. It is, by far, the most important building block in finding success. In order to understand and excecute other principles from other books, you need to read this one first. One of the best books I have ever read that explains why success is so ellusive, even when you try earnestly to achieve it. This book will explain it all!

Anyway, if you love the L-1011, then this is a great reference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"This book covers this airliner in all its glory.Beautiful photographs,superb text,good quality paper and great value make this book a real gem.Lovers of this airliner can enjoy a superb look at this aircraft.This is the first book in the \\"airlinerTech\\" series I've bought and I'm impressed.If you love airliners you will love this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ewww....","review":"Ok, I absoulutly adore Les Mis. This recording is an insult to the story, the music, and most of all, the show in general. I DO NOT suggest this to ANYONE. No offence to community theatres, but it sounds like the Somewhere Playhouse decided to put on Les Mis. I really think that if you want a sample of the show, get the Original Broadway cast, the Original London cast, the Compleat Symphonic recording, the 10th Anniversary recording, or one of the French recordings. Better yet, see it live! Just don't base your oppinion of this amazing musical on this less that horrid recording of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry","review":"This is no where even near the real thing! There is no emotion at all- they are just singing notes. In \\"Stars\\"- Javert sounds as if he's just singing a song that has no meaning for him. In \\"I Dreamed A Dream\\"- Fontine sounds all wrong- she sound old. Every one just sounds wrong in general. I have only listened to the clips but I'm glad that I didn't listen to it all. I wouldn't want to hear some of my favorite songs performed by this group. I hope I don't offend anyone but this was very dissapointing. They put no life into the songs- they didn't make it sound real and it certanly didn't touch my heart! I've been listening to many many different cast of Les Mis and this one is at the very bottum. It's not worth it- go for the real thing people!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Subpar vocalist, lots of fluff","review":"Ms Leonhart is definitely not on par with the likes of Diana Krall, Jane Monheit, Diane Schur, Cassandra Wilson, or any of today's top female jazz vocalists. Her voice is tiny, saccharine, forced. Sounds like someone had the funds to help her release 2 albums, but skip them, not worth the money. She's a typical house band singer for a mediocre lounge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good devotionally, but short on information about Abraham","review":"Blackaby has written a fine devotional book, but one that gives little important information about Abraham. In fact I think I learned more about Blackaby than Abraham. Unlike Abraham who had many problems, Blackaby presents himself and his family as totally well adjusted and successful. Whereever a failing is mentioned it is someone elses that he corrected, not his. That gives little hope to those of us who falter and need encouragement. It certainly does not conform to the life of Abraham who failed in so many ways and yet God blessed him and made him the father of our faith. Buy this book if you want devotional stimulation, but not if your goal is to learn the important lessons of Abraham."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not about Abraham","review":"I was doing a study of the life of Abraham, and bought this book. I discovered that it's not about Abraham, but about Henry Blackaby. I should've known better, having heard him give a seminar that was also mostly about himself. My copy ended up in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disrespectful to Catholics","review":"I was appalled to read on page 49 that \\"a girl with a Catholic background was saved in our church.\\" I was always taught to respect others in their religious beliefs, and that you do not have to belong to a particular religion to be SAVED.I really cannot understand how a man of God can write in this manner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Call Me Sappy But I Love This Group","review":"Sugary country for the just about anyone.

It's major virtue is that it helps clear up the end of the last one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lawhead returns to the era of Arthur's Early Reign","review":"Pendragon is the fourth of Stephen Lawhead's Pendragon Cycle, an excellent reimagining of the King Arthur legend. Set right after Arthur's coronation, with Merlin as the narrator, Pendragon tells the story of Arthur as a new king facing adversity both in England and abroad in Ireland. A huge armada arrives in Ireland while Arthur is visiting his ally Fergus, an armada looking for a new home, a home taken by force and led by the ruthless Boar. After a viscious fight in Ireland, the Boar leaves only to land in the very heart of Arthur's new kingdom which has just been struck by a terrible plague that may wipe out the kingdom. Arthur must go beyond himself and find a way to defeat both a cunning and deadly enemy as well as a way to stop a unseen plague."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book series","review":"Pendragon is a great series. There is lots of subtle story lines within the main story. Easy read as most of the books took me a week to finish. I would recommend getting the e-book as this will cost way less than paperback. Before you start the series, make sure you read the books in the proper order. This is not the same order they were published. I know its weird but I learned this after I finished the entire series. I think the order is Books 1, 2, 3, 4 (first half), 5, 4 (second half). This puts the series in chronological order.Also, if you liked Pendragon, I would recommend Hood, Scarlet, and Tuck. Its about Robin Hood but with a Welsh twist."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's UK contested adoptions - not USA","review":"First let me tell anyone interested that this book is based on United Kingdom case studies and law. Second, and more importantly, it comes across as very liberal and non-realistic in its ideology. The central theme is \\"Wouldn't it be much better if we could all work together and agree.\\" There is a strong bias against child care agencies and workers. Many of the case studies are based on a very small number of cases. Several of the case examples are of the extreme rather than typical experiences. One example told the heart wrenching story of the evil case worker who wouldn't let the dear grandmother use the toilet when she arrived early for a visit. It does present a good case for considering an open adoption."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay","review":"I enjoyed this book but it was a little slow read for me.

So, I bought this to pack my luggage instead. After an 18 hour flight with 3 changeovers and a 4 hour buss ride to a village, this bag still looked new. Not a scratch, tear, or break anywhere, and the best part is that the fragile jars I brought back all stayed in tact and the bag was still looking new.So, is it worth buying? In my opinion it is worth every cent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent bag","review":"I bought this bag because it was one of the few rolling duffles I could find with backpack straps.

It was purchased for a trip to Australia. I did not over pack it, but 2 of the 4 zippers broke during this trip! One of the end pockets is completely unusable due to the broken zipper. The other broken one is on one of the main pockets and is barely held together. How this bag made it home, I will never know.

I love to read, and the peek at the first few pages I had looked at sounded pretty good.So, we bought it.It was worth it, a very suprising book. Letting us into the mind of the alien, revealing a few deleted scenes (that, if I recall, were put back into the movie a few years after I read the book when it was re-released), and giving more detail into the hows and whys of the film.If you're curious, then I would suggest checking this book out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sequel!

I don't know why all those ingredients were wasted in this recipe; because the only thing I tasted was the cream cheese and the instant coffee. It is reprehensible that one could taste this concoction and still place in a recipe book to make others ill.The \\"fudge\\" is anything but. It never attains the consistency of fudge, turning instead, to a gellatenous mess that can't even be washed down the drain. It must be thrown in the garbage - OUTSIDE - so that it does not stink up the house.I think Ms. Finsand, and all those who contributed to this book should be required to spend the rest of their lives eating nothing but the recipes in this book. She should at least taste every recipe in the book before publishing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why isn't there a \\"negative\\" number of stars?","review":"This cookbook contains recipes with very high carbohydrate counts. I follow a low-carb diet for health reasons (not vanity), and I could never eat any of the items in this cookbook. I am an excellent cook, and I've come up with some wonderful low-carb desserts; but I was hoping for something original. Instead, I found too, too, too many carbs! People with diabetes may also have carbohydrate intolerance, and they should be careful of what they eat in terms of carbs. Even their doctors may not advise them of this problem since many diabetic diets still recommend a high percentage of daily intake be in the form of complex carbohydrates.

The Holy Spirit equips us to serve one another.5. The Holy Spirit's role in our family, church, work, and other areas of our lives.The title is a good read (around 250 pages) and may be read in a few sittings.

Oh, are they ever so ever Hoffman.By the time we learn what a drowning season is, we learn that the person who likes to attempt hydro-suicide ventures (almost as often as the tortoises lay their eggs) is not necessarily the most mentally disturbed family member. Maybe, you have to think, the others drove him to the shores to fill his lungs with salt water.Hoffman writes well. Extremely well. And, knowing that many of her other books deal with single women raising teenage kids -- something which I must assume she knows a lot about -- this book surprises you as it stays away from that common theme.If you do not like this book, I can guarantee you will not like many (or most) of her other novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing","review":"Since 2 of the main characters were named Esther the White and Esther the Black, I thought if I had to read their name one more time I would go crazy.

The exercises are useful but I think a budding writer might find this program more harmful than helpful, in it's desire to make sure you're always following his rules. In the end his approach might get you some ideas.. but not before it sucks all the fun out of the creative process.If, on the other hand, you are a type A personality who really wants a rigid set of rules so you can feel secure in tackling something creative, maybe this will work for you. But my impression is that the aim of the book is to make storytelling so complicated and boring that he wants you to give up writing by the time you finish reading it.

I wanted to see what all the talk was about. Can one really find success in a book? Well, no, one really can't, that's not how success works. But with Think and Grow Rich with Peace of Mind I did learn something about Hill the man, the giver of all financial wisdom, and it was this: I imagine that this part has been extirpated from the latest editions, but at the end of the book I read, Napoleon Hill reveals the source of his remarkable wisdom. Wise men, teletransported from Tibet. I'm not making this up.Hill was a fraud and a con man. You won't grow rich (perhaps fat, but never rich) from sitting around and reading his tripe anymore than you will from reading a bus schedule.

This book contains a lot of good information, helpful suggestions, and excellent recipes. One big change in our diet is to use non-sodium based baking soda and baking powder in place of the sodium-laden types we've previously used. While I don't understand the chemistry, it's not a one-to-one substitution with many recipes. Mr. Gazzaniga has done the research, the experimentation, and has written a book that takes a lot of the guess work out of a new way to bake -- without salt or sodium, and in a cost effective manner. Easy to understand directions from a man who once had been on the heart transplant list.

Sometimes it actually has fallen off.The rubber gizmo that is supposed to rest inside the ear comes detached *very* easily.

Therefore the microphone is reaching a long way to pick up your voice and has little ability to screen your voice from everything else around you. Unless you are in a quiet room, forget the current offerings of Bluetooth headsets.This headset is no exception. There is a little rubber ear piece with sound holes one one side that swivels to accommodate left or right ear. Unfortunately this rubber piece eventually gets loose and falls off.

Needless to say that for me the reception is certainly so much nicer through the headset than if I were to put my phone to my ear, especially while driving the car.I guess that a car charger (it comes with a wall charger) would be nice, but certainly would increase the price on this already lower priced unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"I can hear just fine, but the people I call can only hear a broken robot.

Rubbish! Absolutely not! Salvation is an excellent read. Yeah like \\"Ancient History\\" and \\"Dixie Fried\\", it doesnt add much to the ongoing plot elements, but as a standalone story itself it is a cracking read. Those people who go on about Preacher going stale now need their heads testing. Preacher has never been better."},{"rating":"2","title":"The series regains its steam","review":"While the Preacher seems seemed to dip a bit towards the middle, This issue really seems to hit the mark again and focuses on one of the things it does best, having Jesse kick the crap out of everyone that does wrong and stands in his way. Its not really a must read in the series, as you could figure out what is happening without Jesse's side trip to Salvation, but the villian in this volume is pretty wicked and worth checking out"},{"rating":"2","title":"the weakest in the series","review":"Salvation is the weakest of the nine collections, but that isn't to say it is bad in any way, it's still a darn good book (and really, it is only weak compared to its own work, and not that much weaker). The real problem is that for a while we are taken completely out of Jesse's quest to find God. And Tulip and Cassady are both missing. Maybe for a one shot it would have worked, but we were too far from where we need to be, especially at this point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet Salvation","review":"I just finished reading \\"Salvation,\\" Preacher #7, and I've got to say it's my favorite since #3, \\"Ancient History.\\"\\"Salvation\\" doesn't deal with the main storyline of the comic (neither did \\"Ancient History\\"). This time around, Jesse finds himself in a small Texas town called Salvation, where he is reunited with his long lost mother, and where he also gets to play at being sheriff. Jesse puts his pursuit of the almighty on hold and goes after a local baddy, Odin Quincannon, a truly bizarre individual who looks and acts like a demented Ross Perot.Jesse nearly falls in love with a black woman and finds himself dealing with the clan, but before the grass has a chance to grow too high under his feet, he's back on the road, chasing after God.This is one of the best \\"Preacher\\" books I've read, if not the best. It's focused, tight storytelling that keeps propelling you to find out what happens next. Now I've got to go down to the bookstore and cross my fingers that they have #8 in stock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Preacher: Salvation","review":"Salvation deffinently isn't the best in the series, but it wasn't bad.

I don't why Ennis decided to waste a precious year of Preacher with this ****..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cars, Cars, Cars and Nothing but Cars","review":"Beware this is not a book about the 50's, but a book about cars of the 50's, well actually more of the late 40's then the 50's. This book is marketed as a general book about the 50's but it is completely about cars. The section on fashion is one page, showing a man in a leather jacket. The section on magazines, is one page showing a car magazine. The section on TV is a page showing cars. If you want to know everything there is to know about cars in the late 40's to mid 50's then this is for you. But if you want to learn about anything else, look elsewhere.

I had purchased my own Red Smart Stick in November but by the following May the blade shaft had become so distorted that it no longer fit onto the motor component. I do not know for sure what happened to cause the plastic to warp. I can only guess that it was not really dishwasher safe as it said in the instructions.

I purchased 2 items the Secretary desk in black and the 2dr black Armoire and they both were damaged.The Desk came chipped and scratched and the armoire came broken in half. So I warn you if you are prepared for the aggravation of ordering this item, waiting home for the pick up of the damaged item and then waiting home another day for the delivery of the new item then be my guest.Also none of the pieces come labeled so it is like trying to put together a puzzle.

Great to listen to alone while drinking yourself into Oblivion.So go buy this album... and slit your wrists."},{"rating":"1","title":"foolish mortals! hiss","review":"It's kinda funny how something once seen as subversive like dissonant lo-fi black metal can be milked with the careerist intensity of your average rock band. All Xasthur albums pretty much follow the same formula, so if you've heard one, you've more or less heard this one too. And at this point, the pathos is strained and seems disconnected from the real world in the worst way; Xasthur's angst is like a hissing cartoon vampire cursing a smiling cartoon sun with sunglasses.The Europeans did this stuff a lot better. Try Mutiilation instead; they flirted with some of the same \\"grim kvlt\\" cliches but put out some really strong and distinct albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joyful Song & Gleeful Dance","review":"Joyful Song & Gleeful Dance is a collection of music that was played during the 17th century in Sweden.

One can find, other recordings of the Ninth Symphony, incl. von Karajan, Leonard Bernstein, Bruno Walter, et. al. but the Horenstein interpretation is subtle, beautifully-paced, propulsive (when it needs to be) - never histrionic nor hysterical - and the London Symphony plays, VERY-well. This set also includes the great Janet Baker, in Mahler's Kindertotenlieder; needless to say, this performance, also (w/the Scottish Orchestra) is excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice to have","review":"I have a 3yr. old who loves to listen to her music if she could listen to chrsitmas music all day she would this comes in so handy it's cute and pink for any girl and she can listen to her music while mom drives or ect and I don't have to ....would recomend to any parent with a child who loves to listen to music and you don't want to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible for language review","review":"Compared to other books by Miller, this is a big disappointment. The photos are poorly cropped so you can barely see what baby's holding/eating. I bought the book for my son because he's been trying to learn food words and I thought I would use it to label. However, besides a banana and a cracker, there isn't any food in this book. The other pages are \\"spoon\\" (which is fine, at least it's close), \\"bottle\\" (which my breastfed son doesn't even recognize), \\"yummy\\" and \\"messy\\". Couldn't Miller find other actual foods out there to photograph? If your child is an infant and just wants to see baby faces, try a different Miller book.

The story is so ridiculous that there is no amount of acting that can save it.

Sorry for being blunt but that's how I see it - thank god it's over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless and Tasteless","review":"I don't know how distinguished actors like Feines and Sutherland can let themselves be degraded by performing in such a piece of trash.

I've love Donald Sutherland since \\"Klute\\", and Fiennes since \\"Schindler's List\\"s but this is clearly one of those films actors do before or after they do a \\"Scooby Doo\\" film for big bucks. Tedius, hard to follow, full of metaphors I didn't get. I'm a \\"cave man\\" when it comes to movies I guess. When I saw the cover with Ralph Fiennes in what appeared to be French Foreign Legion uniform I thought he was going in as a spy to one of France's Colonies to assisinate someone.

I found it last night and started re-reading. I happened to spy a photo on the inside cover and words cannot express how funny it is. I commend you, Laurie Notaro. The photo would be funny all by itself but the explanatory paragraph below it takes the cake. I rarely laugh out loud when reading or watching movies but I couldn't stop laughing at how you described the photo. You struck a chord with the inner buffet lover and unphotogenic person in me. The book isn't too bad either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly funny book!","review":"Laurie Notaro is just as funny as ever in her second nonfiction book. This time Notaro becomes an adult (or tries to)--getting married and buying a home with her new husband. The author recounts some of the funnier moments of her life, especially her family life--Notaro's QVC-obsessed mother and tiny Nana make regular appearances in this book, as do her three-year-old nephew, a child who terrorizes everyone and everything in his path.Some of the characters come alive in this book--everyone has a mother or knows a mother like Notaro's--but I would have liked to have seen more of Notaro's husband. We aren't even given a physical description of him. But in all, an extremely funny collection of short essays; I look forward to reading more of Notaro's writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy accident!","review":"I really was not expecting to enjoy this book. All my friends read it and bragged about it. I'm a thick novel kind of gal so I was hesitant. I read Fat Bride in one day and laughed my ass off. This sounds so cliche, but I couldn't put it down until I finished. What I like is that Notaro's voice speaks for the everywoman. It doesn't matter what your background or lifestyle is, if you are a 20, 30 or 40-something wife you will 'get it' and love every minute of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfied","review":"I am engaged and preparing for my wedding, I thought that this book would be a fun read. I found that this book was extremely anti-climatic and there was absolutely no plot. I did laugh out loud several times while reading this book, but a more appropriate title would be Fat Bride turns Fat House Wife: A collection of super short stories. Another reviewer said that this book \\"tried\\" their nerves. I felt exactly the same, it was such a quick and easy read from the start but was such a struggle to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough LOLs","review":"Notaro has an interesting perspective on life and is someone who I'd love to have as a friend. However, as a comedian writer, the real laugh out loud moments were few and far between."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than her first!","review":"Sophomore novels rarely surpass that debut novel in quality, but Notaro throws that assumption completely out of her way with this second collection of essays. It's even more enjoyable than her first book,The Idiot Girls' Action-Adventure Club: True Tales from a Magnificent and Clumsy Life. Be prepared to read it and laugh - some of the essays actually caused tears of laughter to roll down my face. It's a really fun read. Yes, Sedaris continues to reign as the Master of the Essay, but Notaro's essays here are so much more enjoyable and a lot less grotesque than those in her first collection. I definitely plan on keeping an eye out for her other books!Of all the essays in the book, though, \\"The Craft Toothbrush\\" particularly stands out. Just thinking of it now STILL makes me laugh. There are many other wonderful essays in the collection, but that one is my personal favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Need a Laugh? This Is The Book For You.","review":"I hadn't read Notaro's earlier book, but couldn't resist the title and cover on this one. It promised some fun and it delivered.Each chapter could stand alone as a funny newspaper column, but put together, they tell the daily triumphs and bizarre mishaps of the author. As she finds Mr. Right, I regretted the passing of her goofy boyfriends, but enjoyed the new stage of her life. It opened a wide range of humorous topics (home owning, spousal incidents, in-laws, etc.) and she makes the most of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as funny as her first book","review":"My friends and I were very disappointed by this book, which is not as original as book one. Perhaps it is simply that too much time is devoted to The Wedding. In general weddings bore me a little.

I will give her other books a chance however"},{"rating":"1","title":"Potty humor is only so funny.....","review":"I guess I'm in the minority here.

Being an un-glamour girl myself, I was looking forward to a book about people like me.

She is funny. I laughed out loud to read some of the stuff she wrote, and that is odd, I usually just enjoy the thought, not laugh. This is sort of a study in psychology: why is she so adamant about her weight or her job? In Phoenix, I can imagine her worries about her lawn.

The syntax is beyond poor; there are misplaced modifiers and commas, inaccurate use of words, overblown, florid language, and sentences that make no sense. Yet, she is represented by the Bent Agency which I thought had a good reputation.

It is quite gratifying to see a film that breaks all the rules of Hollywood achieve such notoriety and success. How refreshing it is that originality can succeed in today's marketing obsessed world.So it is all the more dismaying that a CD like this exists. There is absolutely NO music in the film \\"The Blair Witch Project.\\" None. Nada. Absolutely zip.

Still though, they have managed to make an entire album of song's that were on his mix tape. I, for one, am not going to buy into this blatant attempt to cash in on a hot commodity by adding to this already grossly overhyped movie by paying 12 bucks for this thrown together hodge-podge of music that they obviously made at the drop of a hat to just make even more money off of this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a Soundtrack, but a Companion Piece","review":"A Soundtrack to a movie with no music? No, this is not some shallow attempt to cash in on a successful film (surprisingly), but rather a very good goth-industrial compilation disc. In the context of the film, one of the doomed kids put together a mix tape to put them in the mood as they headed out to the woods to make their ill-fated documentary. This CD is that mix, and it couples with the movie and the website (blairwitch.com) very nicely to create a true multimedia experience. Even if you haven't seen the movie, the CD stands on its own as a great goth- industrial sampler if you want to know more about that kind of music. Also, the film's haunting closing credit music is included."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was expecting more","review":"Some of the tracks are good. I'm definitely in love with Meat Beat Manifesto. Also the Laibach song is wikkid. But the other songs really didn't hit me. It dragged on and on. In addition, I wasn't too cool with the audio clips being incorporated into the CD as they were.

As WASHINGTON POST columnist Jack Anderson has admitted, no-one alive today has DeLoach's knowledge of the FBI's workings during the Hoover era. After reading DeLoach it becomes increasingly hard to believe (a) that Hoover was a practising homosexual, (b) that he indulged in transvestitism (that particular allegation derives from the unsupported testimony of a convicted perjuror), (c) that Martin Luther King was the spotless saint in which America has increasingly come to believe, (d) that the CPUSA consisted of fey intellectuals concerned primarily with the Bill of Rights.In a way, the very unpretentiousness of DeLoach's account is its strength. You come away from it, not liking Hoover, but respecting him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Inaccurate Info on Civil Rights Movement","review":"It is surprising that such a distorted view of the FBI's role in the Civil Rights Movement could still be published and taken seriously today. I guess this is not surprising since the book is written by Hoover's right hand man. The book is a total defence of Hoover and his policies. Deloach can see no wrong in anything Hoover did. Deloach is completely wrong headed when it comes to his description of the FBI's role in the Civil Rights Movement. The FBI worked against the Civil Rights Movement and saw it as a threat to the USA. There is no doubt that Hoover was a racist and unfairly targeted Dr. King for espionage and harrassment. That Deloach would still defend the FBI's harrassment of King and still cast doubt on King's honor is a shame to both his legacy and the FBI."},{"rating":"1","title":"The One Sided Story","review":"If you are a right-wing, ultra conservative member of the Christian Coalition then you will love this book.According to DeLoach the FBI has never done anything wrong, Hoover never kept any secret files, and the sexual innuendos surrounding Hoover were unfounded. This may all be true as I am sure that the tales we hear of Hoover are exaggerated in order to generate interest in the man but it is other comments throughout the book that strike me as proof that the FBI can't and shouldn't police itself.DeLoach discredits anyone who suggests that Hoover was gay but yet uses the same type of proof when detailing Martin Luther King's sexual escapades (why was the FBI investigating and wire-tapping is the better question?), that students in the 60's were wrong in their protest of the US Gov't because it could lead to communism or that homosexualtiy is thrust upon us by the media.

The DVD is packaged in a CD case, the magazine is more or less a CD booklet with a few less-than-informative interviews, and the CD has a lot of dated and pre-released material, most of the tracks clock in at under a minute.The DVD itself doesn't offer much. You get a couple of video clips with 50 Cent, Snoop Dogg, and Jadakiss but they really aren't doing anything exciting. Snoop is smoking as usual and 50 drops a few funny lines but nothing landmark.

Donald Glaude never bores the listener - his selection is bumpin, with plenty of buildups and breakdowns. To me, some standout tracks are \\"Catch Da Monkey\\" by Atomic Babies and \\"Freaque\\" by Andy Trex and Commander Tom. The former has some of the funkiest synths ever towards the end of the track and the latter you just cant help but jump up to when the drums kick in fully.The reason I gave this mix only 4 stars is due to the sound quality of the recording. It is muffled and a bit flat. I really don't understand how this got past quality control at Moonshine or whatever.. Donald's other mixes are crystal clear, and those are recorded live.

The text is Napoleonic/Clausewitzian in scope, with the classic military historian's method of studying leadership by studying proven leaders, in this case great military commanders and titans of industry. A lot of good inside information on business decisions that were made particularly in the area of marketing.

The decorative string on the handle is useful in that the diamond pattern lets your fingers grasp the sword while the string wicks away any sweat on your hands.

I enjoy this music.However, while playing the music I heard what sounded like noticeable distortion in several places. After doing several sanity checks to make sure it wasn't just my audio system, I extracted the CD onto my computer and examined the waveforms. The music is clearly limited to -3dB, and zooming in on the areas with disortion I can see the flattened tops of some of the waveforms in the distortion areas. I don't know if the music was clipped at some intermediate stage during mixing/mastering, or if someone just set a hard limiter too agressively, but the end result is very unpleasing to listen to.This distortion isn't noticable in most of the recording (I'm guessing 10-15 seconds total), so if you can ignore those imperfections this is a nice CD.

Personal favorites: the drawn lines showing the movement on different subway lines in NYC, and the collection of different rock samples and soil samples belonging to a barber in the city.

It's a collection of views into other people's minds, affirmation of things I've thought to do and never followed up on (had my own collection of cat whiskers until I moved).I wish it had a little more background on HOW these artists managed their inventory--my experience suggests that for every \\"finished\\" and shared project, there are dozens in the wings, cluttering up the studio.

It seems that the incorrect information is loaded into each database. We ended up on the side of a mountain on a very narrow dead end road, and had to back about two miles up the road (not an easy task towing a 30 foot travel trailer). We were stopped by a local, who said that happens all the time!

The display in GPS mode was to crouded with sidebar info, and street info is too small. This GPS case is used by many other manufactures, look at Uniden GPS and others. The GPS case has no reset button, so when it bugs out, no way to reset it. My delphi I took on a trip to LA, when I turned it on, the buttons glowed but the screen was dead.

The verbal navigation stopped working on mine after 2 days and it just kept saying new route in the corner and customer service could not help me at all.

It definitely has a cinematic quality to it that would translate very well into a dark comedy on the silver screen. Garcia also handled writing from a woman's perspective surprisingly well. All in all, even as a re-read, this is a fast and fun novel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and original","review":"Cassandra French is your typical twenty-something lawyer working in Los Angeles. She spends time with her friends, has a crazy mother (hers is on house arrest), a budding romance with a club owner, and hasn't been to the gym in weeks.Except, she has one dirty little secret.Tired of dating the same Neanderthals over and over again, Cassandra decides to do something about it. One afternoon, in a flash of inspiration, she kidnaps a 260-pound electrician who comes on to her at a baseball game, hoping to shape him into a man who will function properly in society. Thus, her Finishing School is born. Thngs come to a climax when she kidnaps Academy Award-winning actor Jason Kelley. Once you get past the fact that this book is supposed to be satire, its actually pretty funny and enjoyable. Although Cassie's friend Lexi is completely annoying, and Cassie's behavior bizarre, to say the least, our narrator has a lot of funny lines. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Devastating","review":"I made a large order of books including this one. I have wanted to read it for a long time and chose it as the first book to tackle. Big Mistake! It is riveting history . . . but after the first couple days I can only handle a few pages at a time. It is devastating in its account of brutal inhumanity and Solzhenitsyn's surprising introspection. It is also disturbing that one can see some of these same patterns emerging in various aspects today across the globe.While none of my comments might suggest a glowing review, I really intend for them to be. If this isn't essential reading for every person interested in either history or in humankind's destiny I don't know what is.Get it! Read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Source for CME's","review":"Having been an Registered Vascular Technologist since the 1980's I am always on the search for interesting material to keep my CME's up-to-date.

It seems that they are trying for cerebral detachment, but to me, they just are not cutting it at a minimally acceptable level for this style of music. This is not adventurous music--give me a break--hundreds of albums in this style which are much more exciting and risk taking are filling the bins of the jazz section in any good music store.

Uncertain, often off-pitch, occasionally shrieking (as in the title track), they made it impossible for me to love this album. And the lyrics! \\"He's my four-leaf clover / Lucky that he walked over\\" and \\"He's my baby / No, I don't mean maybe\\".

Every entry has at least one photograph, a rarity for such books. The maps are clear and concise; a regional map shows where each local map is located.

I listened to this in wonder, and found myself transported to states of laughter, of forgiveness, of hope and joy. In this music, I found forgotten beauty, softness, tenderness.Definitely not just your average New Age fare. For meditation, for exploration, for remembering, for sheer pleasure,\\"Goddess\\" will not disappoint you. I highly recommend spending some time with this one. If enlightenment through music is appealing,close your eyes and listen. This will carry you far in that direction. And if it's just pleasure you're after, this will fit that bill as well. You can't lose with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for anyone who likes to sit back and relax.","review":"Sometimes it's hard to stay awake through the entire CD, but if you can, you will hear an hour of beautiful music. The artists do not give their names because they feel that the music is much more important than fame. Perhaps if more artists focused on their music rather than on themselves, we would have a much better selection of music. Troika took the time to include a short history of each Goddess honored in the album which makes the rich melodies more real, more personal, as if they are speaking to you without words."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrived Incomplete!!!!","review":"I was very excited to make lamps for Christmas gifts.

I used to have one of the new iSkins but since the ipod wouldn't fit in my car charger/FM tuner with the skin on, it took forever to peel it off everytime I wanted to use it in my car. This works much better for me. It's easy to quickly access and remove the ipod from the case for car use, but the rest of the time it's a great case to bring on trips. The new ipod fits snugly in the case and the openings for the USB port and headphone jack align perfectly. The magnetic closure is nice so you don't have to hear the sound of velcro ripping every time you want to open it.My only complaint is that dust gets stuck between the plastic cover and the screen, but from what I've read that happens with every single case on the market except for the iSkin.

In fact with the exception of about 20 pages total the novel quickly looses its snazzy cyber crime appeal. In the first few pages we're introduced to a dark haired female hacker but just as quickly she's gone and the book spirals into Japanese gangs, corrupt police, horribly bland and indistinguishable characters, and it just sucks from then on out. The story is good albeit incorrectly marketed. The characters however have no identity! They all sound the same, with the exception of the Japanese characters. Sadly the book lacks serious writing talent, very little character development, on what could've been a good story. One positive note perhaps is that the descriptions of Japanese culture, etc. are really good. Perhaps this is due to the authors departure many years before from England to Japan. My advice: spend some time abroad again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Sharon McCrumb is a storyteller like no other.

I loved the characters, I loved the settings and I loved the stories. I have become so attached to Nora Bonesteel and Spencer Arrowwood that I simply cannot and will not miss a ballad novel.

Are we only now 'discovering' truth in the Bible?Or perhaps being 2000 years removed from the time of Christ, it is those who embrace the culture of death that have it wrong.Look up the very first command that God gave to man in the book of Genesis directly after mans creation. I'll share it with you here: \\"Be fruitful\\". Now find in scripture where it states that God's command to be fruitful is fulfilled or superceded by another command.

The other functions work properly and it does refreshing, breaking in and discharging batteries but I cant get it to charge batteries to a decent capacity. I dont think its faulty batteries because it does it with all of the ones I have, new or old. Energizer 2450 and 2300mah, EcoTrends 2300, Duracell 2000, Panasonic 2300 all charge to 20-230mah.

The C9000's analysis options are great for weeding out cells who are no longer really operating at nearly their full capacity and are likely bottlenecking my flashes and other gear.While I do not use the C9000 as a daily charger (though sometimes I'll trickle charge non-camera gear batteries) I do use it every few months to condition and analyze.

The wheels that the turntable coast on are at slightly different heights, so the table tends to \\"flop\\" slightly as it rotates. It also has no door to hold the batteries in the unit's base. Third, it does not support anything close to 2 pounds. Anything over one pound taxes the motor to the point where it gets jerky. I used a 1.75lb weight to test it and it virtually grinds itself to a halt. Fourth, it turns twice as fast as described. A one pound weight turns at 4 rpm, not the 2 rpm as described. For the price, I expected a much higher-quality product. This thing would better serve as a paperweight. As long as it was turned off of course.

I recommend it highly both to listeners with a broad background in jazz and to those without. Those with a background will recognize all the tunes: Song for My Father, Recorda Me, Beatrice, Three Way Split, etc. They are all great jazz tunes, redone in a hip style. Those without a background will encounter a set of great compositions, played in a very engaging manner. The rhythm section grooves--hear especially the odd time-feeling of Recorda Me--the soloists are hot, and most of all the arrangements are novel and exciting. Greg Osby's alto playing is great, and the piano playing of Jason Moran is a special highlight. It is a CD that you can easily listen to many times over.

These CD's however are so basic and boring that I found myself actually getting frustrated and annoyed. In many sections it sounds as if a child is playing the same tune over and over and over. Repetition is not my idea of soothing music.It made sense when I read the jacket insert and found that the musician just played what came to him vs. set music. While this can be inspiring for some I found it lacking interest and will be giving these CD's away.There are so many amazing CD's out there that touch my soul and I will keep looking for newer recordings to find great music or at least music that speaks to me.

While the idea might have been ok, the terrible writing and delivery made it unbelievable and honestly quite boring. Woody Allen repeated the same lines so many times - very irritating. I like Hugh Jackman as an actor, and Scarlet is not usually horrible, so I figured how bad can it be? But it was beyond bad!!! A total waste of time and money, in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"The hand of an old pro","review":"I found Scoop to be perfectly crafted entertainment. The idea of a ghost helping a girl solve a murder wasn't particularly fresh but Allen played it like a Mozart string quartet. I thought his schtick was stale but as the movie developed so did it. Johansson was delightful, sexy and vulnerable. Jackman was perfectly charming and not much more needs to be said other than watch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining, innocent fun","review":"Scoop, Woody Allen's latest, is a light-hearted murder mystery/love story suitable for teens and up. Scarlett Johannsen proves she can be gorgeous in sneakers, ponytail and glasses; Hugh Jackman is sexy and gorgeous; and Woody Allen is--Woody Allen. Johannsen is a college reporter who gets a tip from a ghost about an unsolved murder. She and Allen fumble and bumble their way into upper class British circles as they try to solve the crime--the scenes with Allen at weekend parties at stately English estates in the country are hilarious. This film is simply good, humourous fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been SOOO good!","review":"Hugh Jackman? Scarlett Johanssen? Great premise for a movie? How could this film be anything but great? Simply by Woody Allen's insistence on being on screen FAR TOO MUCH. His usual whiny, stuttering schtick completely ruined what would have been an otherwise charming film. Wanted to quit watching after 5 minutes of Woody, but stuck around for the two headliners (and the fact that I had paid for the download). Utter, annoying waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Woody should stick to New York, or at least to the USA.","review":"I don't think that Woody Allen's personality as an actor transcends the Atlantic. His kvetching and wisecracking among English society as portrayed in this film just didn't fit. Scarlett Johanssen was fine, but his performance was grating, and annoying.There was one major problem in the plot. How come the combination worked . . . wasn't that pretty much proof of the entire premise of the story. And it was never mentioned.All in all, it was predictable as far as Hugh Jackman's character was concerned, and I was glad when the movie was over. Woody should stick to New York, or at least to the USA."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth a free download","review":"My wife and I were up for a romantic comedy. This one is neither. Woody Allen was okay, but Scarlett's acting seemed forced. The plot was entirely predictable and very boring.

I do remember turning it off a third of the way through. The single copy of Scoop will also gather dust on the video store shelf.Allen lets actors drive his movies. If you want to watch actors adlib off each other for five minutes in an unedited long shot, by all means, fall asleep to any recent Allen movie. Actors, sans a good script, ruin movies.Actors in real life are beyond boring. Allen's movies are boring. As are Robert Altman's. Watch any given three minutes of Letterman and you can see actors have nothing to say.I suspect Allen makes this dreck because he gets off hanging around beautiful young people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete garbage","review":"I cared enough about your time to write this review to save you from this movie.Though the title basically covers it, I did want to address how insipid this film is on every level: extraordinarily bad acting (though Hugh Jackman is passable), transparent and awkward writing, horrible dialogue and direction...anything that can be wrong, was. No, that's not entirely accurate. The production, being set in England, was at least decent to look at.Take a hint from the cheap looking cover art (that was my first clue but I ignored it) and AVOID this film. There is absolutely ZERO tact, subtlety, and entertainment value. I don't know what movie these other people watched that gave it 3+ stars, because rating it at 1-star is being generous for me.

I had high hopes for it -- the story line was inventive and could have been very enjoyable if written appropriately.But, instead of a tight story line with a few nods to Allen's antics woven in, this movie was solely a series of Allen's (badly done) vaudeville acts with a few minor plot elements thrown in so that the viewers wouldn't walk out. Allen's monologues (of which there were myriad) were trite, repetitive and added absolutely NOTHING to the story. Unfortunately, they were all that the story offered.All in all, I was extremely disappointed. I should have known that the movie wasn't worth seeing when I walked into the theater (at 9:45 on a Saturday night), and only 6 other people were there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Purely awful","review":"I can't believe I watched the whole thing.

There is no suspense and there is no mystery. One \\"clue\\" leads directly to another. Scooby-Doo had more suspense and mystery than this movie. Jackman's charisma and Allen's goofiness couldn't save this movie from itself. My husband and I chose this movie from our to-be-watched pile when we had no internet connection, no TV, and no phone service. After 10 minutes, we chose total silence instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, plodding, etc.","review":"As the title of this review says: it's a boring, plodding, and ultimately unsatisfying scoop of ... well, you get the idea. The ending is totally blah. Like the rest of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fame Drain","review":"You used to be able to depend on Woody Allen to make films that had at least a few clever bits, and some genuinely funny dialogue. Now though, it looks like the Depends are definitely on him. The baggy pants wardrobe choices aren't fooling anybody. If I want to see a leading man in diapers, I'll rent \\"Look who's Talking\\". Every movie from now on can only lessen the Allen legend. The one thing apparent from his recent films is that he has finally succeeded in surrounding himself with people that tell him only what they think he wants to hear. Any one who truly loved and cared for the man would save him this embarrassment by telling him the sad truth about his diminished skills. I wish he were my friend"},{"rating":"2","title":"as charming as ever","review":"Scoop is typical woody allen fun, hilarious, charming, nostolgic.. Although watching woody's movies is often like experiencing deja vu, what great artist isn't guilty of repetition, we are always glad to return to the comfortable world of intelligent wit and homage to cinema that he has created over the years..scoop is, if i am not mistaken, woody's second film to take place in great britain - along with the equally charming 'match point'. Allen's comedy translates, surprisingly, well to the city of london..while we may yawn at the reccurence of themes in his movies and his occasional self-indulgence- as usual he is pitch perfect in his delivery."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Have I Missed Here?","review":"I had to give up on this movie 30 minutes into it, which is upsetting, considering I paid over $10 for a movie I lost interest in after the first 5 minutes. I totally agree with some of the other reviews, which indicated disappointment in Woody Allen's using the same old shtick for his own character. But I was also disappointed in Scarlett Johansen's portrayal, as I found it flat and almost uncomfortable.If you are intent on seeing \\"Scoop\\", I would recommend renting it, if you can still find it in a rental store."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Entertaining Woody","review":"This will bring to mind several other Allen films. Manhatten Murder Mystery, Curse Of the Jade Scorpion, and Broadway Danny Rose (Allen's Character in this draws quite a bit from the former character).This movie is really a fun experience for the viewer. Scarlett Johansen is great in it as is Hugh Jackman. The script is witty and the action moves briskly along with beautiful shots of London as a bonus.For Allen fans - this will be a nice return to his comedic form following the much more serious Match Point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pale Imitation","review":"Imitation chick-flick/date-movie, a waste of performers's talents. Woody Allen charming, but barely a supporting character. Scarlett Johansson sweet but ditsy, much given to falling into sex with men with litle forethought. Hugh Jackman in a role well below his talents, his character unforgettable beyond being suave and handsome. Johanson speaks of her adoration for his character, but we see nothing showing this developing. (Teachers stress show, don't tell.) It is hoped better vehicles come along for all involved. Instead of this, watch anything by Allen, Jackman as a worthy love-interest in \\"Paperback Hero,\\" or \\"Kate and Leopold.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"So predictable... utterly boring. It seemed like the movie was never going to end. I don't really like Woody Allen but I decided to give this movie a try. Didn't appreciate him much as an actor. His character is just not very believable. I thought there was way too much dialogue in the movie and didn't really like how some scenes were filmed, leaving out all surroundings and context. I found the movie lame, completely lacking in spark and interest, and predicted the ending from the very beginning. It's not really a thriller, not a romantic comedy and not a mystery movie either... not funny and not intriguing."},{"rating":"1","title":"HERE'S THE SCOOP","review":"Clumsy comedy-mystery concerning a dead journalist, who receives a news tip that is SO good, he leaves the afterlife to pursue it. Another trivial parlor game from Allen, that beholds a comedic and cinematic vacancy under it's brisk and snappy pace. Scarlett Johansson is all nerves and girlish charm as Allen's counterpart, and while the film is dependent on their co-presense, the sparks between them fall flat. Hugh Jackman, as an English aristocrat who may be a serial killer, serves well as the film's contrast to the silly proceedings, but stands alone like a partner without a dance. At the theatrical viewing of \\"Scoop\\" that I saw, several young teenagers, there apparently for Johansson's sake, laughed uproariously at every good and bad joke Allen cracked. If nothing else, maybe the film will have a younger generation searching Allen's backlog of true comedic masterpieces."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing","review":"this has got to be the best woody film. i love it. it's funny and intruging, and scarlett is absolutely wonderful in it- jackman looks as good as ever. a must-see, it's probably a 10+ age limit only for plot complexity and some sensualityScoop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waiting for it to end or for Woody Allen to stop mumbling...","review":"Okay.

I thought it might be a good opportunity to see some movies I wouldn't normally rent. I watched the trailer on this, thought it looked like it might be amusing, and downloaded it. Unfortunately, the only funny scene in the movie was in the trailer and I ended up falling asleep the first 30 minutes into it. After I woke up, I thought maybe I hadn't given it a fair shot and went back to try it again. I was right to fall asleep the first time through. I don't usually rate movies - or anything for that matter, but felt compelled to share my opinion with anyone who was seriously considering spending money on this one.

At the time I figured \\"how can I go wrong?\\" -- now, I think it was over priced.If you like predictable plots, mediocre acting, jokes that fall flat, and the usual Woody Allen rants, you might like this. I didn't make it through the whole movie. I know that a lot of reviewers say that you'll never guess the ending. Sadly, I couldn't wait that long, and I really didn't care after about a half-hour."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat and forgettable","review":"If you're looking for dynamite Woody Allen films, this isn't it. I actually spent a good portion of the movie hitting the fast forward button looking for substance, but was severely disappointed.The main characters are flat, stereotypical, and lack development throughout the entire film. The dialog is stale and there's virtually no chemistry between Johansson and Jackman. Allen tries to take a comedic lead in this, and while his scenes with Johansson are palatable, any of the scenes where he \\"takes the stage\\" are cringe-worthy.I personally had such high hopes for this film, and think it's about time that Hollywood stopped remaking classics that have nothing wrong with them, and instead re-package films like this that could be memorable and fall completely short. Johansson and Jackmen are great actors and I felt that with some better material that they could've at least made this something worth watching more than once on a dare."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Mystery movie to see","review":"Woody Allen is absolutely hilarious and witty in the movie.

The young actress, Scarlett Johnasson, made it all worthwhile. The actors did their best but they had little to work with.

I hope Allen hasn't burned out and that we can still look forward to a few more fine films from him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Book","review":"Having had the privilege of studying under Mark Nanos, perhaps my view of actual book is biased (it's not though!). However, you won't find the points raised about Paul and his writings anywhere else--and it makes so much sense. The Irony of Galatians is a FANTASTIC read for anyone interested in Paul studies, Judaism, and/or the early Christ-movement.It is a dense read at times--but as commented on by early reviewers, must of what he writes is directly against the status quo.

Patricia Stacey's breathtaking style, as she relates gripping family drama one minute and ponders the philosophical intricacies of the mind-body connection the next, weaves together the strands of raw gold that form her story, gold that might have emerged heavy and tarnished in the hands of a lesser writer. Like another reviewer, I recommend it to anyone who loves a child, who is interested in developmental psychology, to the many parents who struggle for the confidence to raise their children according to their own instincts in the face of a society that relentlessly questions them--but more than anything else, this is a book for anyone who is interested in reading about the mysteries that are the human condition. For in telling us her story, Pat illuminates all stories, especially family stories. An avid reader, much of what I read comes and goes; this book will stay with me and I am grateful Pat has written it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Passionate and Personal","review":"Patricia Stacey has opened up her heart and soul to share her family's experience first realizing and then regenerating the life of a child with special needs; symptoms, but no name to call this list of incongruities. So where do you start? Ms. Stacey touches the emotional buttons we all possess as human beings; whether a parent or professional. She takes us through a journey that is at times full of hope, but also webbed in bureaucratic mish mosh, medical despair and blame as well as professional and personal hope, vision and efforts unbeknown to most.

After spending several hours trying to deal with it, I ended up hiring a professional to get things working again (and paid four times the cost of the TravelDrive). The TravelDrive also apparently put some programs on my computer in a hidden way that reinstalls the U3 junk on the TravelDrive if I remove it.

Reasonably priced for features and quality (we've gotten at least six years of good service out of two prior V-Tech models - for less than $45). Handsets slightly smaller than previous models but still easy to hold. Backlit dialpads a bonus. Decent audio quality on handsets as well as on base unit's speaker. LOUD ringer in base unit can be turned off. Message playback can be slowed down or sped up. Base unit is wall-mountable like most. Reception is fine. Signal covers our 1/3 acre lot.

It had all the elements that I look for; trippy, down-tempo grooves backing female vacals, but they didn't come together into anything remotely close to even my least favorite tracks by Massive Attack, Hooverphonics, Portishead, Morcheeba, or Esthero. I love to explore new music, and my tastes are very broad, so I bought Adagio based on the reviews below. I have done this before with very good results. I have discovered gems like Kruder & Dorfmiester, Thievery Corp., and Gus Gus. There was no gem this time around. This album feels like it was recorded in someones garage. Most dissapointing was the disconnect between the music and the vocals. They simply didn't mesh.

Watch it over and over. BTW, you will have to read it, it's subtitled. But don't be dissuaded by that fact. The titling is crisp and well paced. There's something you should know about my recommendations. I love to watch movies without knowing much of anything about them, that way the story can unfold with maximum impact.

The Special Features also give an opportunity to better know the extremely admirable writer/director Fredi Murer and the actor Bruno Ganz (who plays the main character's grandfather).When the child prodigy main character has been diagnosed with brain damage and a loss of his musical skill and his extremely high IQ, he spends some time visiting his grandfather. While visiting the grandfather, the child listens to some CDs and then secretly begins to play J.S. Bach's Goldberg Variations in his previously highly skilled manner. I wept when the grandfather accidentally comes across this secret performance and then removes his hat and holds it over his heart in respect and gratitude (before quietly leaving the scene so that the boy can maintain his secret).A thorough gem of a movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"5 star voters.....THANK YOU!!!","review":"If it was not for all the five star reviews I never would have bought this gem.

I was challenged and rewarded many times.My only concern is that, as academics, the authors leave much to the reader to adapt knowledge from their examples into more pragmatic contexts. But as far as I know, there are no books in this area yet that provide a more simplified, rule-of-thumb type approach to using options in analyzing the value of business opportunities."},{"rating":"1","title":"You must have excellent Calculus skills or Don't Bother","review":"Real options is very hot right now in management circles, and so is this seminal book on real investments.

There has yet to be a practical volume of literature that can explain real options in plain english."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book for Rocket Scientists!","review":"The book sets well explaining in simple words the concept of investment and uncertainty but nothing points to what follows which is 300 pages of differential equations and complicated mathematical formulae.

The book is extremely difficult to follow and uses academic mathematical notation which is difficult for practitioners to follow. In addition, the authors have largely ignored both the underlying business operations which create real options and the existing operations literature on project management, operations research, petroleum engineering, manufacturing systems engineering, etc. which provide many of the tools necessary for practical evaluation of real options.

Her voice is very powerful a combination between Ana Gabriel and Alejandra Guzman with a twist of Beatriz Adriana.

Extremely rare and hard to find albums from this talented Mexican singer/songwriter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Greatest dissapointment","review":"I was a big fan of Flor Yvon when I heard her sing in a compilation album, Mexico Voz y Sentimiento, a few years back. Her voice was beautiful and had a tone I had not heard-it was just right for that type of music. I thought for sure she would be the next great female ranchera artist. I bought this album with great anticipation and excitement. All I can say is that she has bad management. Her choice of music for this album was horrendous. It deviates from her strengths and was badly written and arranged. Her beautiful voice gets lost in this album and the songs seem like they were written and produced by an amateur. No wonder she disappeared from the music scene. A shame indeed. I threw away the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mind calming","review":"I love this CD, it's beautifully produced.

The sexual tension builds in this historical romance as two stubborn people swallow their pride and admit their love for each otherHis Wicked Ways really should've been titled Their Wicked Ways since it involves two men both of whom have been in love with the same woman for years. Two best friends become rivals as they compete for the heart of one woman, who literally ends up in the middle. Not that I would mind being the rope in this game of tug-o-war! The story is outrageous at times and the antics of Darcy and Bronte are the best. I was certainly chuckling. The good storyline will keep you reading just to see what Darcy and Nicholas will pull next and how the outraged Bronte will handle them. And those two gorgeous men are not above tempting her at the same time! Loved it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Erotic At All--Only read His Wicked Ways","review":"Have you ever read a menage a trois story with two girls and a man where the girls were not as intimate with each other as they are with the man? No, of course not. So why is it that when it's two men and a woman the men are not intimate with each other, other than the fact that they're in the same room having sex with the same woman. What's up with that? In this story the men do not get it on. So if you like your erotica as bland as cottage cheese, you'll like this story. Two gentlemen are offered the wager that they can seduce any woman in England. The woman chosen is a childhood friend whose husband has recently died and she blames the two gentlemen for not being there for her. They do indeed seduce her and all three live happily ever after. What a waste of my money?I will not waste it on Winter Thaw."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, awful editor","review":"The Three Musketeers is one of my favorite books and Twenty Years After is practically just as good. The only reason I didn't give this book 5 stars is because the editor, David Coward, gives away the ending of The Man in the Iron Mask. He tells you what happens in the last chapter of the last book in a footnote! DON'T read any of the footnotes in the last 20 pages of the book unless you want the story spoiled, in that case just go to wikipedia."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you liked The Three Musketeers, read this!","review":"After reading The Three Musketeers I was SURE this would pale in comparison. Boy was I wrong! This book was JUST AS GOOD as the first. This book tells the tale of D'Artagnan and his companions twenty years after their first adventure ended. They have long since separated and begun their own lives, yet their loyalty and love for each other proves to be stronger than the things that hold them apart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Dark Sequel","review":"Twenty Years After is a GREAT follow up to The Three Musketeers. I actually enjoyed it more than The Three Musketeers! This book is not like the first book where there is humor and light-heartedness shown through on every page. The plot is much darker and deeper relationships are formed when you begin to find out how the past 20 years have treated these men. Some good, others bad. The 4 musketeers find themselves to be hardened against each other, according to their respective political views. The best of friends begin to become enemies. I highly recommend this book to all those wishing for a raw turn of events which will keep you turning the pages. Very heavy on the politics but in a way that binds the story together. Again, a great dark sequel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Is This Really The End?","review":"Is Twenty Years After really the end of the four adventuresome friends? Anyone who has read The Three Musketeers and this sequel will wish it was not. In this thrilling tale of friends divided by politics and united by friendship, a foreign cardinal, a powerful queen, a young king, and a Paris in turmoil, Dumas has again outdone himself. The cunning wit of D'Artagnan, the wisdom of Athos, the strength of Porthos, and the militaristic abbe Aramis are enough to return to France the power that it almost lost. In this moving tale of enemies become friends and the incarnate evil of enemies past brought back to life, one cannot help but wonder at all of the strange twists in the plot of this magnificent tale. A recommended read that will leave you wondering if this is really the last of four faithful friends or if their adventures are still just beginning."},{"rating":"2","title":"No words to describe.","review":"This book is awesome.

However, civil war endangers the throne of France and in England, Oliver Cromwell threatens to send Charles I to the scaffold, causing them to cross swords with the malevolence of men and the forces of history. The half, though, has not been told: Milady's son is out for revenge and he's deadlier than his mother. Won't say anymore about the plot, but the above is it in a nutshell. Dumas KNEW what his readers were looking for and they GOT it: swashbuckling action, heart-pounding suspense, tender romance and of course, deadly villains.

I bought the cd on a whim and am very glad I did. It has become one of my favorites. I love the variety of music and was so impressed to find that Jennifer does most of her own writing. As far as the voice quality--that's a personal preference--her voice doesn't especially stand out to me as an unforgettable voice, but the songs themselves do stand out and her delivery is very convincing. I can't help but connect with her on \\"Never Been This Far\\". The upbeat songs are fun and light-hearted, but the ballads really speak to the heart. My favorite overall is \\"Simply Yours\\". Take a listen and decide for yourself! Overall for a debut album--2 thumbs up! I look forward to the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well... one song was good, anyway.","review":"I heard 'Beautiful Good-bye' repeatedly on the radio and really enjoyed it. It's so much fun to sing along with! So, when the cd came out, I grabbed a copy. I was, unfortunately, disappointed. Most of the other songs are forgettable, and lack that special touch that makes Beautiful Good-bye so wonderful.This cd could be classified as extremely mellow country, or very laid back pop. It doesn't really commit itself one way or the other.On the up side, Jennifer Hanson sounds eerily like artist Amy Grant. Her voice is so similar, it's scary. So if you like Amy Grant, you ought to get this cd just to hear quasi-Amy singing.To sum up, there's really only one song worth listening to on this cd. Buy the single."},{"rating":"1","title":"just o.k.","review":"i totally disagree with alot of these other reviews!

I would definitely recommend these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Opaque, really?

I could identify with the characters in the book very much even though I was raised up North. I felt a spiritual connection to Jazz and The Greeter as they faced life's adversities with hope and faith. Mary Ellen has also had a personal impact on my life, and her book launch program and reception helped me realize everything IS going to be all right in my own life, personally, professionally and spiritually! The Greeter was most uplifting, and personally rewarding to read. Thank you, Mary Ellen, and start working on that sequel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wal-Mart Associate Approves","review":"I loved the book.

I was enthralled the moment I opened it, and I found the reading really easy. It tells the story of a guy named Roy whose mind (along with that of his love's) goes into the past. He inhibits Prince Ram of Atlantis while his love inhibits the mind of a neanderthal king or something like that. Anyway, the story is told through letters which are directed to her from Roy. It is a very interesting way of story telling. Anyway, now I am 18 and I still like it. I think it's one of the coolest books written. Another book I recommend is Thebes of the Hundred Gates by the same author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"The theme of the book is better developed in his other work, \\"At Winters End\\".

This is perhaps the first jazz record that I know of that successfully combined authentic african rhythms in a jazz setting. The album opens with a traditinal Nigerian prayer spoken in native tongue by Solomon G. Ilori. This prayer sets the stage for what follows; a diverse, engaging, authentic musical experience that travels from Nigeria to Senegal to Jamaica and back to America employing a vast array of percussion instruments and the immense talents of Yusef Lateef. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good example of mix of jazz and african rythmns","review":"i first listened to a tune on [..] from this cd and enjoyed the nice fusion between jazz and African rhythms, so I decided to give it a try.

The camera work was unimaginative. Just a bunch of shots taken from the sidelines. It wasn't telling a story. Nothing to indicate where the footage was taken. No slow motion \\"art\\" shots.

The instructions are all in ...Chinese? Japanese? anyway, they aren't in English. But it is fairly straightforward and not hard to figure out how to use it. The disc that holds the vegetable in place has little prongs in it, so holds the veggie very securely. It is also easy to clean, if you take the blades off--kind of common sense cleaning. It does work nicely except that when using it there is a certain amount of the vegetable that turns to \\"mush\\" instead of spiraling into noodle shapes. It doesn't have to be wasted as you can toss the mushy part into the sauce but is a little annoying that it happens. Also this mushy bit happens every time I use it, so it wasn't just a one-time over-ripe vegetable. Overall, I think its worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what i had hoped for","review":"this product worked but not as well as the other reviews would have you belive.I spent more than I had planed to spend based on the revews I read.

Nowhere is it mentioned that the whole book consists of only 19 pages. Their is nothing wrong with the quality of the book, but it should be pertinently stated that this book is for children. The price also gives the impression of a more in-depth study of waterfowl. If you want a very basic introduction to waterfowl for your children, this might be it. If not - steer clear of this one. Your money can be spent much better elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much ado about nothing","review":"There is very little of substance to this book with regard to concrete suggestions on strategies a person can use to work with ADD as an adult - especially in the work place; lots of \\"stories.\\" There is great emphasis about enlisting the help of family, friends, coworkers.

The DVD was fairly good, but seemed a little dry and slow in its delivery. As expected there are a lot of wonderful comments made about Jeff and his successes but it is taken a little too far and becomes repetitious. I think this DVD actually is somewhat of an injustice to Jeff and his accomplishments based simply on the way the thing is put together and delivered. Whether you're a Gordon fan or not, there is really nothing on this DVD that you don't already know or have seen. I would save your money until a better documentary comes out.The 2 star rating is based entirely on the way this thing is produced and not on Jeff Gordon himself who as I mentioned is much more deserving than what this DVD delivers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Special Nascar fan of Jeff Gordon","review":"Another perfect gift for a Nascar fan grandchild.

The author goes into intricate detail of how it was, what should have happenned what platforms and systems should be procured. The concentration of what physical platforms and systems in use, who authorises what and what organisations need to be in charge of this and that is indicative that the book will age quickly and have little relevance to today's defense logistics platforms, practices or procedures.The book is written from a command perspective. It is therefore looks at how logistics is used to support the battle space. It will not teach you defense logistics. It does have some noteable elements hidden amongst the text which when condensed could give you a power point page or two on logistics.If you a looking for a good book on Defense Logistics, make sure it is written by a Logistician."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feliz Navidad by Jose Feliciano","review":"Excellent that I finally found this CD.

The concept sounded good- a heated, massage cushion that can be plugged into an outlet in your home or in your car. The good thing about the cushion is that it does get remotely warm so its nice if your backside gets cold when your driving, but the \\"massaging\\" part is just some fast vibrations which makes your teeth chatter and your muscles tense up. Its horrible if you have back and neck problems.

You will never see a band with more energy! This CD has more of a country feel than their last album (\\"JD's Tasteless Chill Tonic\\" was more bluesy), and has more original tunes as well; all very well-written.

The authors explore key biblical passages to investigate the mandate, message and mission of the Christian church, especially the character and purpose of missions. With the authors representing both East and West, their scholarship has a refreshingly global character. Their approach makes good sense. As our world undergoes dramatic changes, it is important to return to Scripture to gain guidance for how the church should address changing needs. Although the flow of the book seems to falter at times, I would still highly recommend this book to those interested in missiology. If you're looking for a \\"how to\\" book on missions, you might want to skip this text."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ramblings, little to do with Missions","review":"I have been tasked to translate this book to my native language. I approached it with high hopes, having loved books in the expositive sections of this same series. Also, I highly respected its editors.What a disillusion! This book has actually little to do with missiology. Rather the authors indulge in long ramblings of ill-informed, leftist economics, geopolitics and political correctness. They do strive to be orthodox in their faith, but then they use all the religious liberals as sources and end up in verbal contortions to disguise the liberal influence...A waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turn Up The Recording Volume!","review":"Although the performances MAY be excellent, you'll never fully realize it because the recordings on this CD were done at such a low lackluster volume.

A few of the stories I liked--her antecdotes about the mikveh gave me a better feel for what that ritual was all about, and I think I understand the Jew/Buddhist relationship a bit better than I did a few days ago. But I'm not sure it should have been turned into a full book, and she padded it out with bits of silly whining (in the \\"why won't the rabbi help me marry a gentile\\" vein) and stories of utterly icky behavior (misc. tattoos, including the very last story).
