Games look great, and the 480p is nice. Even the games that are only 480i don't look too bad. I would recommend.

I've seen a couple other reviews like mine so I should have known better. I will say that the cables seem like awesome quality and would probably work well with the right system.

I was expecting a big picture downgrade, but you dont lose much. HDMI however is better, crisper and sharper picture.

Thats not the case with these cables, you get the feeling that these component cables deliver the absolute best component picture possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does What You Want As Well As You Would Expect","review":"I bought this for my old PS2 after the Sony component cables I bought stopped working (my son kept coiling up the cable after using the PS2 - that obviously damaged the delicate wires inside the protective casing). The PS2's included composite cables are way too blurry to read small text well and the images/colors can bleed, so I highly prefer component cables for the best quality. This particular cable is even better than the old official Sony PS2 component cables as it feels much more sturdy. The inputs fit both of my TVs perfectly without any effort (the older PS2 version's cable were too tight and required twisting to remove from the TV) - they aren't too loose and they aren't too tight... Goldilocks would approve. The image is definitely crisp and the cord is quite long.

This is as good as your standard Def PS2 is gonna look on an HD screen. But with the component out, you can set the PS2 to output to a 16x9 aspect ratio, so at least it's doing a full screen blow up.

I use them and they are great.I use these component cables on my PS2 and they work great. for the games that support Widescreen and progressive scan these cables allow you to see the PS2's true potential. If you have a PS2 hook up to a HDTV you should be using these cables. And if for some reason you don't have HDMI inputs on your TV I highly suggest these for your PS3 also.The only negative, which is so minor I won't remove a star, is that the cables stick a couple inches out of the back of the TV, so if you're TV is wall mounted it may cause issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not compatible with all PS2s","review":"Contrary to the product description and the box these cables come in, they are NOT compatible with all models of the PS2.

Now I've got a $18 set of cables that I can't use, and my PS2 still looks like crap on my HDTV.Thanks, Sony!

I picked up this book in the bookstore because it was labeled \\"Harry Potter fans will love Diane!\\", and I wanted to see just how good it was. As it turns out, I brought it on my flight to Italy and read it straight through. I'll have to say that Charmed Life was a bit boring, but The Lives of Christopher Chant was definitely an eyepopper.

I was looking for a similar series, when I happened across this series. The reviews for the this book on Amazon, I now realize are misleading. Besides magic, this is totally different than the HP series. The chronicles of Chrestomanci is really a set of almost unrelated stories loosely connected by the person holding the chrestomanci title. I have read The first three books and two were utterly boring. I really only enjoyed charmed life. I was unable to ever get attached to any characters because they change from book to book.

Interestingly, the earlier disc is the most attractive, featuring fresh vocal performances framed by terrific big band arrangements. It literally sparkles. The further the second disc goes, the more it gets a tad predictable and formulaic, even vocally. The sixties items, such as Move Over Darling & Let The Little Girl Limbo, are markedly inferior from a material perspective and, frankly, beneath her talents. But buy it for the first disc alone and listen selectively to the second one."},{"rating":"2","title":"All of Doris Days songs are 5 Star","review":"I grew up listening to Doris Day, my Dream is yours, Canidian Capers, are ywo of my Favorites although it is hard to pick a favorite from Americia,s number one alltime greatest singer.

It's a crime this wasn't available on CD for the last two decades, but that has been rectified by this superb Shout Factory release. While it wasn't the Tijuana Brass's best-known work from the '60s, I think it is their strongest, most consistent album (and the writer for the CD booklet agrees with me).

Highly recommended to anyone interested in catching up with a pop masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aggressive Tijuana Brass","review":"My first impression is Herb Alpert & the Tijuana Brass were ready to blow the competition off the stage, such energy.

Excellent design, high quality construction, plenty of pockets and stash places; the larger, rolling version is much the same with even more room. I ordered the new one because my partner & I frequently travel together. We decided to combine our tech gear into a single case with wheels seeking one less carry-on & a lot less shoulder/back stress. The bag quality is the same high-quality, but the extending handle for pulling the case on wheels is cheesy beyond belief-- feels ready to bend or collapse at any moment, & throws the balance of the bag off.

Well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perfect Bag for School, Travel, and Business","review":"I spent a lot of time researching computer cases for school use.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"perfect computer bag ruined by cheap telescoping handle","review":"This bag has the perfect layout and assortment of partitions and compartments. The price was great IMO. BUT.....the telescoping handle doesn't stay up. You extend it, take a walk and the thing collapses as you walk along. The little spring-loaded buttons which are supposed to lock the sections don't hold - making it useless as a tote and too heavy as a briefcase. Too bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Organized Briefcase Holds All","review":"Pros-- Holds everything one needs from home to office with space for more.

Considering what I paid for this laptop bag, I expected it to last much longer and am very unhappy that I got less than 1 year out of it. I liked the bag very much which is why I gave it any stars. It has a lot of storage and is better than any other options I have seen, but is ridiculous to last this short a time for this price. This seller rips you off on shipping, too! $20 to ship a 5 pound bag? I bought it from the same seller a year ago and it was a rip off then. But like I said, it was the best option then.

A lot of kids call thursday posers. How can they be a poser band? They pretty much pioneered this type of music. This album was revoltuionary to the whole New Jersey scence as well as the whole screamo/punk scene in general. This album actually shows screaming as a viable music form. this album was recorded raw-nothing fancy. if you like all the fancy studio stuff, chances are you are just another poser trying to be in the scene. this album is how music should be made:recorded-not produced. The only thing that needs work is Geoffs voice, which has improved on their other albums. To be honest I cant wait until thursday's next cd. If you hate thursday then you must hate music in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff!","review":"I would just like to start by saying that Thursday is a great band that has good messages and themes. I loved \\"Full-Collapse\\" it was a great work of art and \\"Waiting\\" is the the album that started it all, the band has a good sound and great lyrics. Some of the songs seem to be very deep and very understanding. The good song are well the whole cd. If you like Thursdays 2nd album you should like this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mellower than Full Collapse, but still Awesome!!","review":"This cd shows the softer side of Thursday, an awesome band from the New Brunswick area in New Jersey.

Check out Porcelain (Track #1)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This is an amazing CD...I own all three CDs from Thursday and this one beats them all.

I tried to capture videos from my digital video camera and it crashes the computer just trying to open the folder these movies are in on the flash memory card. This is the third time I have installed this garbage and once I remove it this time the disks are going in the trash along with the ~$100 I spent for it. Never again, Pinnacle!

And they charge you $25 a pop after the first call even though that first one didn't help us at all!Now that we are trying to re-install Pinnacle Studio 9 after a hard-drive crash, we are told that this dreadful software is \\"no longer supported\\" by Pinnacle! It has already crashed our new hard-drive on the first install, and after the second install, it produces no audio (just like on our first machine).

Most packages will enable edits and music, otherwise they are not marketable. Pinnacle has the whole package in that it is feature rich, but also enables you to make DVD quality (mpeg2+) disks. Many other packages only output to VCD. One competitor Adobe Premier Elements is more complicatd to use and does nothing better. For example, Pinnacle's storybook allows assembling your clips and pictures, then use the timeline for music and fine tuning. Adobe is mostly timeline with hard-to-use music overlays. For those buying consumer/prosumer software Pinnacle is clearly the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use and gets the job done","review":"While others seem to have a lot of issues with this software I have not. It is easy to use, has a good set of features, and in general is stable on my XPSP2 Intel box.My major gripe is the very slow rendering speeds. Even rendering a low bandwidth WMV file takes many times longer than the source video. A full DVD can take many hours. And, this is on a fast computer. Also, the vendor really does not have an upgrade program as upgrades (say from 9 to 10) cost more than the full retail version of 10."},{"rating":"1","title":"Infested","review":"This is the buggiest piece of software I have ever owned.

The rendering/DVD buring features are terrible. I used the cheap NERO software to assemble and burn my videos. I thought it was just my computer that crashes. Everything takes 5 times longer than it should with this program. I have newborn twins and I video everyhting. I don't have a lot of time to deal with editing...with thos program, I end up doing it in the middle of the night becasue it takes so long. Also, why do they have to charge extra for advanced features? Either include them with the package or dont have them...don't tease us.

But, I feel that I jumped too soon, without reading the feedback in forums.For the most prevelant problem faced by most users, their faq just says refrag, reinstall, apply SP etc, which are too time consuming and does not really seems like a educated advise.It is quite frustrating to waste my time on this product, hence I wanted to share the experience so people can save their time and composure by staying away.Main frustrating problem here is with the rendering hang (you can see in thier web message board. It takes lot of your time as it seems like an issue with the capture done using studio.

I have been trying for 3 months to get this software to function properly. Tech support regurgitates the staple \\"uninstall & reinstall\\" mantra. Pinnacle tries to deflect responsibility - problems are always someone else's fault - you have too many background processes running, or AMD chipset instead of Pentium, or problem with MS XP service pack 2... \\"problems\\" that don't seem to impede any other piece of software I've ever installed. The only reason I've expended as many days as I have is because this was a Christmas present from my wife who is devastated that it does not work.

This problem is documented in on-line forums, but Pinnacle has no fixes (that work) posted on their web site. Basically, you're paying for a CD that won't install because the product activation code printed on the CD cover is wrong. Pinnacle is very slow about addressing this issue on an individual basis with customers who have paid for the worthless discs. So far I have received no response from their customer support. Some customers report waiting as long at two weeks and badgering Pinnacle multiple times before receiving a serial number that will allow them to install the product.

In \\"The War Mountains\\" John Mannock has identified one of the most exotic and disturbing - the use of volunteer Muslims in the Nazi SS to fight a brutal mountain war against Tito and the Partisans in Yugoslavia. Also that much of the Arab world supported Hitler and his policy of erasing the Jews. This novel reminds me of some of Leon Uris's bestsellers from the 1950s and 60s such as \\"Exodus\\", \\"Mila 18\\", and \\"The Angry Hills.\\" I give this novel five stars and I highly reccommend this."},{"rating":"1","title":"a letdown compared to Mannock's previous work","review":"I loved Iron Coffin and Sen-Toku Raid, but this book, while adequately written, just doesn't break any new ground or intrigue me in the least.

I was very disappointed. Especially in his discussion of rule following, Brenner does not so much explain the relevant ideas as he paraphrases them. (An example: in his discussion of sections 206-223, Brenner imagines someone asking \\"suppose different people respond in diffferent ways to the same order. Who is right?\\" He answers, \\"if there is an established practice among these people then the right way will mean the customary way.\\" The answer is a direct paraphrase of the text around section 201. But simply paraphrasing or extracting from the text gets us nowhere. If you already understand Wittgenstein, you will understand this remark. If not you won't. Either way, it won't much help.) Brenner's discussion of the private language argument is better. But there's still _much_ better expository material available."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't bother","review":"I was hoping to get an overview of Wittgenstein's philosophical investigations - this is not it. According to the introduction, Wittgenstein is considered very hard to understand and the author is going to prove that his writings were actually coherent. Then he takes us on a confused trip through the works. The author gives a zillion footnotes back into W's papers and quotes from them at length. I didn't feel there was a synthesis of W's work, more of a confused roadmap. If you're a Wittgenstein junkie then you might find this book useful. I felt like I was reading a grad student's research paper. If you're a student of philosophy looking to understand what Wittgenstein is all about, then this is not the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is the Basic Premise really his own?","review":"A question to you all.Isn't Wit's basic premise about language and truth just a slant on Sausseurian linguistics with lots of blather and a critique of his (Wit's) prior incarnation in the Tractatus?

About 2/3rds of the way through it, I said to myself, \\"this is definitely a five star book.\\" However, the story gets bogged down in Mexico as McGee waits out the perfect opportunity to trap his prey. I felt like there were about two or three too many chapters written after Travis/Meyer's arrival to Cancun. As a side story, Travis is again torn between his woman of the book, versus his beach bum lifestyle, as she takes takes a career progression move out of Florida. Will he move with her?

Take bog-standard \\"heavy\\" music and throw in a healthy dose of misogyny and a weird, misguided attempt by the songwriters to create punk versions of gangsta rap-style song lyrics, and you're left with a nearly unlistenable mess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Album","review":"This album is one of the greatest albums I have ever heard. Tim Armstrong, Rob Aston, Travis Barker, and special guests including Davey Havok from AFI and Brody Armstrong from Distillers, do a superb job of mixing rock, rap, punk, reggae, and metal all into one. Travis Barker from Blink 182 actually does a good job of drumming. And just because they have a Blink 182 member doesn't mean anything. None of the songs sound like Blink 182. As for the different style for everybody. For rappers, good tracks to listen towould be Tall Cans In the Air and D.R.E.A.M.. For punks good songs would be Sad but True and One Seventeen. For rock you have D.J.D.J. and Weigh On My Mind. For reggae fans you might want to listen to California Babylon or Down In Oakland. As for metal, the best songs would be Romper Stomper and Quick Death. All those great genres can be found in one song on the songs Diamonds and Guns and We Trusted You. To anyone I reccomend to buy this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT ALBUM","review":"tranplants, a side project of travis barker and t. armstrong combines essences of punk, hardcore, dance beat, and rap/hiphop. many say that it includes some metal, but that is plain bull, it's hardcore not metal, and that's easy to see by anyone who has ever heard the two. Anyway, all the songs are GREAT, except for D.R.E.A.M. which i think is just okay (after you listen to it a couple of times it gets pretty lame). As for the rest, i could listen to them over and over again for a couple of months (which i already have done)."},{"rating":"2","title":"They Rock!!!!!!!!","review":"Transplants fuses Blink 182 And Boxcar Racer's drummer Travis Barker With Rancid's Frontman Tim Armstrong and rapper Rob Aston To create one amazing sound. There are also apperences by AFI's Davey Havok, The Distillers' Brody Dale, And rapper Danny Diablo. This Side project combines a Punk sound, Metal riffs, rap beats,a little bit of retro,hard core yelling,DJs,Some Rapping, And some good old fashion rock. This cd is something you would never expect."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"My Big Fat Head\\" is a must-read.","review":"\\"My Big Fat Head\\" is a must-read. This courageous author literally pours her heart and soul out in this novel. Jodi's story is one in which she reveals herself wholly and completely. She tells of how her struggle with food affected nearly every facet of her life. Just about every girl will be able to relate to some aspect of Jodi's adolescence, and just about every woman will undoubtedly encompass that much more strength knowing they're not alone.

(See SEC Release No. 284 5/24/05 and No. 53201 1/31/6). Thankfully his firm was shut down and Schield permanently barred from acting as an investment advisor or broker-dealer in the future.

As a previous reviewer posted, one flaw is that one character is off-stage for a good deal of the script. Not so fun for most girls. Also, this is not the best game to choose if your daughter MUST invite a large crowd. THere are roles for 8 girls. If you have 16 girls and have them share a role it ends up being very little speaking. You can \\"create\\" roles, but then what about lines? Not much flexibility there unless you rewrite the entire script. Lastly, please remember your target audience. In order for this play to flow well, girls need to be strong readers. Many 6 year olds are big fans of the AG world and you might have a daughter who is a very strong reader but the chances of 7 of her friends that age being strong readers as well are low. By age 8 or 9 most kids are reading well enough to read new material smoothly with appropriate inflection/expression, understanding the story as they read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Essential Pieces MISSING!!!!!!!!","review":"We ordered Kit's Mystery Game for my daughter's birthday party.

I wasn't even allowed to watch it when it was on but years later saw it on very late night T.V. It was a two-parter which started with the murders and concentrated on the trial which was more of a circus than O.J.'s ever could have been. Now to get back to this particular film. It is not the movie I am thinking of. It is too weird for words. This had barely any dialogue for over an hour, poorly shot and it took forever to find any info on it. Apparently this was some student film made in 1971 or 72' after the trial was completed. I felt compelled to write this so no one buys this by mistake. The real movie was based on the excellent book by Vincent Bugliosi which was very researched and lived through by the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!

All the reviewers on here are right (except the two that gave it 5 stars) -it is a horrible movie. BUT, I gave it two stars.Why, you may ask? Because I read the great book by the same name, and it was very cool to see the scene with actual footage of Spahn ranch. (burned down not long after), and to see the scene with authentic hippies.The rest of the movie is throw away. If you want a good movie, don't buy this. If you loved the book, or are very interested in the Manson trial/family and want to see footage of Spahn ranch, here it is. Be warned - you'll get five or ten minutes of hippie/Spahn ranch footage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your $$$$$","review":"The best thing about this terrible movie is the packaging it comes in.

The problem with this movie is unless you have read books on \\"The family\\" and \\"Helter Skelter\\" you will be completely lost.

My advice is steer clear of this one folks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of crap","review":"I bought this movie thinking it would be an enlightening and interesting account of the Manson family and the murders.

The printing of the photos is poor, not crisp at all. The huge disappointment though came on page 75. This photo is of a pig in a mating position on top of a sheep. This photo absolutely ruins this book, making it completely inappropriate as a childrens' book. I cannot imagine what the author and/or publisher were thinking in publishing this photo.

I am a man of upper avg. weight (215 lbs) and bought the ProForm 320 in hopes to cut down my weight. 3 months after purchasing this product direct from Sears, the left support beam failed (whilst exercising) and broke from its previously welded position on the flywheel. Knowing that any warranty coverage would only buy be 3 months more time before the next machine failure, I opted to have my father weld the support beam back in place, which held up....until the RIGHT foot support beam broke 3 weeks later. I had that one welded as well thinking I was out of the woods...WRONG. a month after that, the right inner support beam broke straight off the axle. After that, I gave up and burned the damn thing straight to hell in a bonfire behind my dad's storage unit. Cheap parts = DONT BUY!

I spent approximateley the original price again on replacement parts (they're very expensive compared to the price of the machine) only to find out that the frame broke irrepairably. Poor design, low-quality materials.The sellers claimed it would last forever, well, it didn't. After compaining they stated the warranty was over and that was all on their behalf. I also wrote to the manufacturer and got the same, five word reply after four months (!) of thorough inquiry for which they'd asked me to send pictures of the cracks, copy of the invoice, etc.Forget it if you want to use it as a trainer.

Not only because of the content, but because New Jersey Governor Jim McGreevey had named Amiri Baraka as the state's poet laureate shortly before, and the subsequent outrage over the poem prompted the state to rescind that title from Baraka.Some believe Mr. Baraka (AKA Leroy Jones) was blaming the Jews in his poem \\"Somebody Blew Up America\\" for the 9-11 attack on the Twin Towers. After reading the poem, I understand Baraka's point that he was not blaming Jews, but rather ISRAELIS.That being said, the only reason anyone bothered to read this book and its poems was because of the controversy.

Indeed, to narrow down jazz, ska, rudeboy, rocksteady, reggae, dub, dancehall, and ragga (to name a few Jamaican sub-genres) to a few titles each is foolheardy at best.While this book may well help one add titles to their collection, the book is a mere microcosm of the music of Jamaica.

And the near mad Dr. Barnes of Merion, Pennsylvania.As a result of unconnected events -- the Russian revolution, the Nazi regime's hatred of modern art, and Dr. Barnes' seclusion of his vast collection -- many of Matisse's most important works were not available to the public and hence his full artistic record was generally unknown for many years.While I respect that this was a biography (it ends with the subject's death in 1954), an afterward on the state of Matisse's current reputation in the world of art would have been welcomed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing Parts","review":"The canopy quality is consistent with the price.

If you're new to guitar and have money to burn, this could truly be an introduction to effects and tone. If you read what's available for free, this book is worth about one dollar. Spend your time enlightening us rather than informing us.

This is their first chance to get an actual video of Grand Funk and therefore will not be disappointed for $13.99. Buy a couple extras at these prices for your friends & hopefully maybe someone will make enough off it to hurry up and put out Marks performance at Bruce Willis's high school reunion in Aug.of 2003.

This album flows in my DNA now. The song:\\"Closer To Home\\" may be a rock anthem for many but for me it was and is... a very spiritual song. It's so strange how songs that we have heard in our younger years have a way coming to fruition and affect us as we age. I really like that Mark is healthy and still rockin!

The main message of the book to me is that the effort of trying your hardest is in itself a worthwhile endeavor.

I found it seriously disturbing. To think that some people find this appropriate for grade school children is shocking. The language the characters use is totally disrespectful. The overall theme of the book is obvious from the title and is essentially gender and sexual issue related. The sub theme is that girsl are better than boys. Parents should be on the look out for this type of material in their public schools. That's where I found this book by accident in my 2nd graders class. This is yet another example of people with an agenda trying to condition our kids from the earliest ages on when they are not ready to comprehend these types of concepts"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong message for children","review":"This book is inappropriate for grade schoolers.

There were a few jarring plot moments for me (such as being ordered about by a parent), solely caused by my \\"advanced\\" age, but then I'm not the target demographic for Abduction.

If your parents were murdered yesterday, would that really set the stage of your heart to begin a romantic relationship today? Does Taylor Lautner really look like a typical high school kid?

It's still a good story.One thing I really liked about this movie is that the two main characters actually showed when they were hurting.

Bad acting from everyone, including those who I would normally consider to be good, bad choreography, weird technical decisions.

I'd never seen Lautner in the Twilight movies and I was just curious...he doesn't know how to express emotion...he looks brooding, angry and happy. That's the range of his emotion...wait, brooding anger...don't waste your free time on this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I give it zero stars?","review":"This actually caused me and my girlfriend physical pain when watching it. Between the hackneyed storyline, the bland action coupled with vomit-inducing teen romance, the awkward dialogue, and the weirdly horrible camera angles (seriously, what?), there's really no reason you should ever watch this turd. Seriously, I hope you're just reading these reviews for laughs, and not actually thinking about streaming it.It was in fact so horrible that my girlfriend was too busy raising her eyebrow and letting out an exasperated \\"huuuuuh?\\" to enjoy Lautner with his shirt off. Unless you're a Twilight fan (in which case you CLEARLY don't care about logic or story or depth anyway), don't watch this. I think I had more fun in the 5 minutes spent writing this review than I did in the whole two hour runtime.

I don't know what the others are talking about but this was a good movie. This movie is about a teenager who found out he was adopted. In searching for the truth he found out that people were after him and his real parents, mainly his father is a CIA agent, which is why so much secrecy was in his life.

This is a good teen action/thriller movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"some interesting twists","review":"a few interesting twists but felt longer than stated time. could have been more cleanly edited. seems like a vehicle created just for taylor lautner. michael nyqvist was the best part of this teen flick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes Teletubbies look like Avatar","review":"Where to start? I should first say that I only watched the first 30 or so minutes. The first 15 minutes involves characters staring at each other with either the \\"I wanna do you\\" or \\"I wanna kill you\\" faces. If that isn't enough of a bad start we have to add the old, \\"I like this girl but she is dating someone else...but it's okay because they will break-up in 5 minutes because hes a douche\\", cliche. The chemistry between the two protagonists makes me cringe. Finally there is the scene where his [spoilers] fake parents are killed. The guy shoots his mom with some stupid looking gun. There is no blood to speak of after she is lying on the ground dead for 5 minutes. I swear it was a tranq gun. So in conclusion from the first 30 mintues, bad acting, overuse of cliches, and s***ty action effects. Watch at your own risk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full of Action","review":"If you're a Taylor Lautner fan you should love this movie. The beginning is kind of slow but it is just setting the stage for a non-stop action ride the rest of the film. Both the teens and the adults in our house enjoyed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for Taylor Lautner/Twilight fans","review":"This movie was better than I thought it would be, but I rented it with really low expectations. The story idea was based on an interesting concept (i.e. a teenager discovers his face on a missing child's website). The action scenes were entertaining, even though they aren't ground-breaking. Lautner has a black-belt, so I thought he did a good job executing those scenes. However, the dialogue was PAINFUL (even when Sigourney Weaver spoke) and the \\"romantic\\" scenes made me cringe. The lead actress looks all of 14 years old, so I found the make-out scene more disturbing than erotic. Overall, you are more likely to enjoy this movie if you are a teenager or a Twilight/Lautner fan. Otherwise, don't expect too much and you might get a few moments of entertainment out of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, great movie","review":"I have to say, it was a good action packed movie. Although some of it was predictable it keeps you on your toes. The acting wasn't great, but it wasn't horrible. What I found was that they didn't give away what all the suspense was for. The ending was disappointing.

I was thinking, hmmm here's a present for my sister-in-law. Right about the time we were going to give up on it, then came non-stop action pretty much and the rest of the story so to speak.

Is it the best I've ever seen? No. Is it the worst? Definitely not. It's enjoyable and has a lot in it for everyone (Taylor Lautner & action). I think its a good start to breaking away from the Jacob Black mode. I think someone should tell Lily Collins she should have TWO eyebrows - I found it very disconcerting to see that caterpillar across her brow! On the other hand, Nathan's father? Complete hottie that I don't think was credited.

The downfall for this movie was that it tried to incorporate too much story and dialogue. Well, there isn't much of a story here and the cast can't carry the dialogue, especially the lead. If there was more butt kicking and much less \\"emotion\\" and speaking lines from Lautner I may have pulled something from the film. As it stands I have wasted money and my evening. I would advise those reading this to avoid doing the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, somewhat cheesy...","review":"This movie isn't very entertaining.

The dialogue was very cheesy and, actually, just dumb. The characters went through a short build-up, hardly enough to create an attachment to them, and them were immediately drawn together while they fended off the \\"black-ops\\" guys and the CIA at once.

It took a few minutes to get started but, once it did, Lautner did a fine job (MUCH better than those silly vampire movies). He shows great promise as an actor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Story+Pretty Good Acting=Fairly Decent Movie","review":"I received this movie as a gift from my mom (who loves Taylor Lautner---GROSS!). So, I went into this movie with low expectations. There were some really cheesy parts, but there were also some good parts. The action was good and there when it needed to be. It was good to see Taylor Lautner in something other than Twilight and the acting was ok(for a young pup), as was the acting for the others. But the acting wasn't bad enough to make me not want to keep watching. The story line is what caught my attention. I won't go into details because I don't want to ruin it for anyone looking to get it, but the plot is very intriguing and keeps you wanting to watch to find out more. Overall, this was a fairly decent movie. This is a movie that is great to see it a first time, but I will probably never watch it again (at least not for a while)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Decent but typical","review":"the fight scenes are great but we've seen the moves before. the acting is satisfactory but the girl who play (i think the character is Karen) her acting was really good. Overall I give the movie a B, just because I like action flicks. . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ka-Ching","review":"It was entirely predictable the Twilight dreamboats would enter into lucrative Hollywood movie careers after exiting puberty. Throngs of female fans wouldn't think twice about paying to see any film they're in, even it was just Taylor hanging around the house on a boring Saturday. In fact, watching that would be more entertaining than this disaster. After making a career of pensive, emotional poses in Twilight, Taylor Lautner doesn't know what to do in any other situation. Please, Hollywood, no more action movies starring someone who looks like he should be hanging out at the local mall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucked!","review":"If you care for high school tensions ... this is your movie.

Taylor shirtless, and then yada yada yada. Teen flicks can be fun from time to time, but this was obviously an actor (obviously depending on his looks, as he should before they fade away) taking a paycheck in-between projects. This is a god-awful film. I'm just warning you now... I would love to meet someone who actually watched it all the way through with interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Movie's Terrible","review":"Please do not be fooled by the reviews that some of these people are leaving. This movie is absolutely terrible and Lautner should never be allowed to act. He'd be a very good underwear model but that's it.

The story is wonderful, the acting is even better!! You could not ask for better. Does Taylor Lautner ever do a bad job?Not in my opinion, and I'm not a young groupie. Lily Collins does a superb job, also. Both are seasoned actors who put their heart into this. I dragged my husband to see this, and he left a believer. Said it was one of the better movies he's seen lately. Is it because the people who disliked this movie expected to have a rerun of \\"Twilight\\" or were they hoping for something more explosive? The beginning made me wonder if it would be a teen movie, but it quickly elevated into an non-stop action movie, that left me wanting more. Jumping out of cars, running from the bad guys, cars, trains and on foot. Who could want more?? I was hoping for the best. And it delivered. Delightful to the very end."},{"rating":"1","title":"not sure why, but expected better","review":"The acting in this movie is terrible, the storyline is ridiculous and you could easily guess what would happen next.

The plot is chopped, the directing is very poor. There is a product placement every frame of the movie, accompanied by very bad acting.

(An AMAZING a cappella track, well worth the entire price of her first album). But I agree with previous posters that the four cover songs are disappointing and uninspired, to say the least. I was very dismayed after my first listen of the CD, and it did not grow on me. This album lacks her usual sizzle and spark, her unique Jonatha style. The few songs that she did actually write don't mean anything or touch me in any way....usually I at least find one or two songs stuck in my head for days, or some choice lyrics that grab me. This album fell flat, in my opinion. She is most amazing in concert, but I have no desire to see any of these tracks performed live. I hope her next album will reflect the deep creative tendencies I know she has, instead of leaving me wondering why I just spent $17."},{"rating":"1","title":"IN THREE WORDS: NOT SO GOOD","review":"Her best work is still with The Story - and some of those songs, by turns, funny, passionate, yearning, bittersweet, deserve repeated listenings. This CD? Initially, it seems pleasant, even diverting. But after repeated listenings, you hear the gears going around, and you realize nothing is fresh here, including the tired covers, a tip-off that Brooke had nothing to say here, only a CD to put out. And, yes, as one reviewer, asked, \\"where is the passion?\\" But isn't that true of so much of today's music? Where's the joy? Where's the REAL love? Those songs, those genres, those artists, are few, and they come from a better, more passionate, more engaged era. This is puny stuff and not worth your hard earned cash. Save it for Aretha Franklin!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"I've been a fan of Jonatha Brooke since I heard the lovely \\"West Point\\" piping overhead at a nature boutique I frequented years ago. With the exeption on the title song, this record was a major diappointment. In the song \\"Sally\\" she tells her friend that she'll \\"write 10 more songs\\" I wish she had done just that for this release. I would highly recommend \\"10 cent wings\\" instead of this album if you want to experience Jonatha at her best. This work really is not an example of her artistic power."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pleasant and unexceptional","review":"In the early 70's a critic reviewed a Neil Simon flop by observing that Simon didn't seem to have an idea for a play that year but went ahead and wrote one anyway. This wisecrack came to me while listening to this Jonatha Brooke CD.Back In The Circus has the feel of a contractual obligation record (which would explain the odd,odd covers--Brooke is holding the good material for her new label) or an attempt to capture some territory from Norah Jones (languid vocals, all those jazzy keyboard touches.) In either case, it's a disappointing experience for this long time fan. (At the very least she could have taken a moment to explain the place James Taylor, Brian Wilson and Alan Parsons have in her music.) I expect more punch, more guts and intelligence from JB than I'm getting here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best","review":"The problem with this album is Brooke's singing, which is so cool that it's almost cold. During Brooke's years in The Story, she tended to over-emote. Now she's gone too far in the other direction. A shame, because she's a great vocalist, and she still writes better music than almost anyone else in rock. (Too many cliches in the lyrics, though.)If you're new to Brooke, try The Angel in the House (by The Story), 10 Cent Wings or Steady Pull before this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"a big dissapointment","review":"I hate to say it, but I am really disappointed with Jonatha and this CD. Her last CD \\"Steady Pull\\" rates 5 stars - its great! She's also wonderful in concert. But the quality of her songwriting has really slipped,and her wonderful stage presence which shines on her earlier cd's just isn't here. Almost all of the songs on the disc lack any real heart or soul. And unfortunately, 3 of the songs on this very short running disc (approx. 41 minute) are uninspired covers - almost like fillers. Take those out of the mix and you have an EP, not a full lenght recording. She seems to have run out of steam and inspiration. Her limited touring in support of this disc, and her embarrasing pitch for monitary donations on her web site (i'd be happy to part with some cash for a decent disc or concert) don't bode well....I sincerely hope she can pull herself out of this slump."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coolness","review":"My roommate just got this album in the mail today from her uncle (who is Jonatha Brooke's husband, and also her producer).I am listening to it right now, and am really enjoying it. Jonatha Brooke has a lovely voice, in my opinion, and her music has a quaint but soothing feel to it.She's still early in her career, but it seems like she's getting a sizeable fan crowd. Our goal is to get the people here at our college to know about her. I think she's making progress.This CD is different from her last one, and it seems to have disappointed several people. I guess it's kind of confusing when singers change their style from CD to CD, but I think she's just trying out different styles.I would compare her to Beth Orton, Alice band, Turin Brakes, and a little bit of Norah Jones' style. So if you are familiar with any of those artists, you might want to check out Jonatha Brooke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your money!","review":"I was really dissapointed! This CD was real slow and lifeless; it also had several watered-down remakes. I don't know what happened to Jonatha; it seems she's lost it. Her last CD, \\"Steady Pull\\" rocks! It is one of my favorite CDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"Hopefully this is just one misstep from an otherwise great artist. The songs all sound canned and uninspired. It was as though the whole thing were hastily made on a desktop with loops rather than in the studio with real instruments. As for the covers...have you ever sat around with friends reminiscing about some of the bad pop groups from when you were growing up? The Alan Parsons Project comes to mind and covering James Taylor is sacrilegious and really unnecessary. Anyone interested in listening to Jonatha for the first time can safely choose from any of her previous disks."},{"rating":"1","title":"such a deal","review":"$1.50 for 447 whole words. you can get this and more for free on the net with minimal effort.

Thank you for being prompt with everything I have ordered from Amazon.com. You do a really great job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok at best","review":"Buckethead is an amazing and the most unique guitarist I've ever heard. I adore some of his other cds but electric tears just doesn't cut it as a great guitar cd. The mode of the cd is somber,icey cold and emotionless. The songs are all incredibly slow and simple. The songs do not fluctuate in tempo and feeling therefore creating an overall monotone vibe. Buckethead uses an abundance of generic effects that any other guitarist would use, that of course is not a great quality. I was looking for something unique in this cd but found it to be too similar to Pink Floyd's The Division Bell.I do not recommend this cd to anybody unless you have insomnia. I recently discovered several cds with powerhouse,classical influenced, very unique and emotional guitar playing...those cds are Rainbow On Stage and Rainbow Live in Europe. The guitarist is Ritchie Blackmore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Electric AND Acoustic Tears","review":"As my 16 yr old daughter, says \\"This is gorgeous!\\" Which is great to hear, 'cause I thought maybe only old farts like me would be enjoying it so much. I've heard only a bit of Buckethead's more mainstream shred-heavy stuff, which seems skilled, if perhaps a bit predictable. No credit is given in the (sparse) liner notes for who is playing what, so I assume it is all Buckethead - on acoustic and electric guitars, and synthetic treatments.This instrumental recording is mellow and melodic, tasteful, atmospheric and pensively subdued (the \\"tears\\" part I guess). The electric guitar playing here sometimes sounds like Mark Knopfler's, but the overall mood/effect kind of reminds me of something Canadian electronic guitarist/composer Michael Brook would do. Maybe not world class, but pleasant, soothing, and interesting enough for both fore and background ambiance..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Electric Tears by Buckethead","review":"This is my favorite album by buckethead that I have in my collection so far. I really enjoyed the chord and melodic structures of his songs. I really enjoy his electric guitar playing style very enjoyable CD to listen to in the car while driving."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome and Accessible","review":"This is a wonderful resource for relaxation for children, parents, and teachers that is comprehensive and yet very accessible in use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dispassionate and detailed military history","review":"For anyone interested in insurgency / counterinsurgency warfare in Africa between 1970 and 1990, this book is mandatory reading. Replete with the sort of detail frustratingly absent in other studies, Continent Ablaze's focus on sub-Saharan Africa allow the reader to fully appreciate the complex interations of conflicts occuring simultaneously throughout the region. As the previous reviewer indicates, this work is not strong on the politics driving these conflicts (although it certainly provides enough detail apprecite the general picture): thus an unbiased companion political volume should be sought (good luck!). However, Continent Ablaze is a very well written book whick could serve as both an ideal entry point to the subject matter and as a supplement to further other reading. Truly excellent work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The series has a few strengths, which Mr. Probert's review does a good job of highlighting. The story is fairly unique for an anime and is fairly intriguing, and the soundtrack is pretty strong. Kodama is a pretty interesting lead character. However, for me, the numerous failings of the series seriously detract from what it does well. The pacing is indeed very uneven, and several episodes simply distract from the overall story. The animation is sub par. There are a few nagging inconsistencies, and occasionally, the laws of physics simply get ignored. I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Esping-Andersen Thinks Big Thoughts","review":"As a policy analysis grad-student, I couldn\`t help but like this book. In a field where so many authors stick slavishly to what they can PROVE empirically, Esping-Andersen dares to ask big questions and think big thoughts. Interpreting the welfare state from a nineteenth centuryesque political economy perspective, he provides real insight, and defends his Marxist-inspired interpretation with flair and not a little bit of style. Not only that, but his exposition is clear and (dare I say?) kind of fun to read. If you want to understand why all rich western societies spend a BIG chunk of GDP on the welfare state, this is a great place to start"},{"rating":"1","title":"BOGUS ESP ANGLE! LACKS SUSPENSE!","review":"Aubrey Glenn wrote a bestselling self-help book on \\"creative imagery,\\" (which really sounds more like getting in touch with one's innerself plus using one's intuition/gut-feel and some guesswork). Jesse though, mistakenly believes it's ESP and pushes Aubrey to help solve the mysterious disappearance/murder of his cousin's family.Jesse's character has an overly conceited ego who literally thinks he's God's gift to women! I mean, he's eveready for sex and just won't believe not every woman wants him, too. Thank goodness after the first 100 pages, we see a more caring, responsible, and admirable side to him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Self-Indulgent","review":"Like other reviewers, I will not that it is simplistic, and mainly for people who are lower functioning, and younger than 20. This deals with practical real life information for people who want to find their first job, but never goes beyond the basics.For 300 pages, only about 20 or so pages were applicable to me, as I have Aspergers, but not at the point where I need to worry about living in a group home.Much of it I could not relate to, problems that the author had with Aspergers that I did not.Mostly, it's self indulgent. It's a collection of lists rather than a book, and he even spends a whole chapter doing math problems.This is at best, an average book. Freaks, Geeks, and Asperger's Syndrome is a better read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for children, teens, very low functioning adults & those who need to help them","review":"The autism-Aspergers continuum is quite long. This book is not helpful for people on the higher-functioning half of the spectrum. It contains information about getting and keeping entry level jobs, how to deal with the police, suggestions for making money by dumpster diving, etc. Some people may need this information, but potential buyers should be aware that the book addresses problems of children, of teens and of adults who have been unable to extablish themselves in life. It is not helpful to adults with Aspergers who hold or have retired from a professional level job, who generally function at an adequate level and are looking for ways to refine their interpersonal skills."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gives advice I want my teenager to hear","review":"When I picked up Jerry's book I had a hard time putting it down. I am a parent of an adolescent with AS and have been \\"winging it\\" for most of his life. No books for parents were ever written on the subject until 1999. I've relied on my own parenting experience of neurotypical children and professional autism journals to figure out what to do. Now that I'm preparing my child to be \\"launched\\" into college, having a life handbook that he can rely on is very important. Jerry's book is very concrete with common sense information, and an attitude about life that I hope my own son will adopt. I can recommend this book to any person on the spectrum, and also to parents of children age 11 to adulthood. Sometimes when you are feeling most challenged as a parent of an AS preteen or teen, it is very helpful to remind you where you are heading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing and Empowering","review":"This is a positive book about how to live a full life with Asperger syndrome, covering both the practical and emotional aspects of independent living... encouraging people to take responsibility and not make excuses. While I think it contains a lot of useful advice and much truth that people need to hear, I suspect that for many of the people who would benefit from hearing it the most these strong words would sting like vinegar. When you are a person with low self-esteem and learnt helplessness sometimes having someone tell you to love yourself and not give up is difficult to take. If you are ready to hear it though, this book is a refreshing and empowering read."},{"rating":"1","title":"The basics of autism?","review":"The description of this book sounded interesting and I like to read autobiographical books about people living with AS. This book, however, was not at all what I was hoping for, and I ended up returning it. It was way too basic for me. It might be good for someone just learning how to live with autism but I did not need the basic information provided such as how to cross streets and how to drive through a town."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jihad and the West","review":"Mary Habeck's insight into the nature of the enemy is a valuable asset in the attempt to preserve Western Civilization. Mark Steyn's demographic analysis in America Alone is a valuable companion. The enemy is not like us. We are overmatched in dealing with the enemy if we do not understand the basis and the threat of deviant Islam and Western multiculturalism. Jihadist ideology, Western relativism and nihilism are threats to our way of life. These two books help demonstrate why. Mary Habeck tells us who the enemy is from the enemy's own words and actions without imposing western rationalization on the Jihadist's own actions and thoughts. To listen to our leaders and the media is to appreciate how few of them have spent any time with the Koran or the books above. Jihadist ideology and demographics are the issue. It is time to know what they are. Next, we have to figure out just what it is that we believe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Knowing the Enemy: Jihadist Ideology and the War on Terror","review":"I bought this book because I wanted answers to the question, \\"Why do they hate us so much.\\" Unfortunately, I didn't like the answers but at least I understand better whatwe are up against. The book was extensively footnoted and sometimes got a little dry, but overall it was a good read and I have recommended it to my friends.Ms. Habeck does a nice job of distilling a complex socio-religious movement into the kind of prose which highlights the fanaticism of the jihadists. My take away from this book is that the \\"War on Terror\\" is indeed going to be a long struggle. Unfortunately, their desire for a theistic caliphate is at odds with the principles of democracy and the desires of free people everywhere. Once again the name of God is used for evil. We must win this war."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great song!","review":"This single is great! \\"He Loves U Not\\" by Dream is awesome! The single also has an instrumental version of the song. The song itself is awesome! It has a great beat and delivers a great message to young people. This single is definitely a must-have for people everywhere!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Pop Tune","review":"This is a catchy enough piece of pop, the verbal battle is something that makes this enjoyable, along with danceable beat, and the vocals are okay too. My two worries are that this will be more overplayed than it already is, and hit the annoying meter, or that the girls, who are VERY manufactured, (They dialed 1-800-Be-a-Star for an audition!) will not have more single material that stands up to this. I'll have to wait and see on both matters though."},{"rating":"2","title":"I actually LIKE this song!","review":"I saw the premiere to this video a few days ago on MTV's TRL(Total Request Live). When Carson introduced them, I thought \\"Great, just what we need, more boy bands!\\" But it wasn't a boy band- It was a GIRL band. The first thing I noticed of course was the girls in the group:), but the song was actually pretty good. I have this song in my head right now, and I'm glad- I like this song!

Rather, it mostly followed her through the behavior rehab place she was unexpectedly sent to by her father. It really is amazing how Abigail's viewpoint towards her actions changed as she spent more and more time at the rehab center. The book follows her through the entire program, AA and all. I enjoyed this book, though I didn't think it was 5 star worthy. It was good, just not as I expected. Makes you really glad you've never been to a rehab like that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good, But...","review":"\\"Bad Girl\\" by Abigail Vona is a good look into the life of a teen out of control and placed in a facility to help change her wild ways. Although she wasn't all that wild, the facility helps her cope with her dysfunctional family life, and the way she views her actions. She meets other girls with problems even worse than hers, but learns to listen to them, whether their life stories or advice to her. \\"Bad Girl\\" is a truue story of what happens when a teen \\"delinquent\\" is sent away to confront her life and problems. Although this book isn't as good as, say, \\"A Million Little Pieces,\\" it still speeds along quickly and is very intriguing."},{"rating":"1","title":"absolute dreck","review":"Not a memoir of delinquency but a chronicle of Vona's incarceration in a juvenile \\"boot camp.\\" Atrociously written by someone who comes across as a spoiled rich girl with a fondness for stereotypes, and whose \\"delinquency\\" seems to have involved nothing more heinous than dating a drug dealer and indulging in a brief \\"runaway\\" period to a vacation cabin with friends. Not recommended.

Wow, terrific speed!Second, it's not efficient as the ad shows, not at all. I applied it on the scouring pad as instructed, scrubbing my burnt cookware for like two minutes. The result is disappointing. I still gotta use the tip of my spoon the get rid of the numerous tiny black spots remained on the bottom of the pot.

There are more accurate accounts of how the brain works though.The examples given for persuading the virtues of mind mapping are quite laughable. However, at least they are examples. The maps themselves are in colour, and they do more or less comply with the rules.However, its more of the same infomercial throughout. Having statements such as \\"THE MIND MAP WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE\\" written across the page is a little more than irritating. This kind of informercial should be relegated to glossy brochures and marketing literature.This book is technically wrong about learning, and it is very tacky.Best to stick with note taking that people like to read.

In other words, you have learn it and use it to get much benefit.I do recommend it for kids--it's a great, simple way to organize most writing assignments, speeches, and other projects. They'll probably still have to do the old boring Roman numeral outlines, I suppose, but the mind-map can make that much easier, too!So, Buzan's a bit grandiose--mind-mapping probably won't bring world peace, but hey, neither does anything else!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hype and nonsense","review":"This book is wrong about the brain, and is wrong to hype mind mapping into every task in the universe.

Through the focus on such one-handed interviews the book in effect is putting pre-conceived prejudicial stereotypes and words in the mouths of such interviewees. It would not befit a purportedly educated person to paint brush the west with a single stroke of erasing the cultures of the converted people to Democracy.

The ideal bogey man creator for them, at least V.S. Naupaul has finally discovered himself and recognised his cause. Muslim hating can be a profitable and highly respectable status.

DISGUSTED READER"},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential reading in these troubled times.","review":"Naipaul's essential thesis here is not complex, but it does have the ability to offend. Naipaul comes from the largely Western school of separation of Church and State. In other words, he believes that a healthy, complete human culture is always complemented by religion, but should NEVER be dominated by it. He illustrates this point by examining the lives and psychologies of individuals in the so-called \\"conquered\\" Islamic states, with a particular emphasis on suggesting that religious dogma creates an incomplete and unhealthy human condition in its defenders and practitioners. In this way, Naipaul's thesis is similar to that presented by Milosz in THE CAPTIVE MIND: Only when freed from dogmatic captivity is the human mind capable of transcending our most basic appetites. If you are comfortable with that idea you will probably like this book. If you are uncomfortable with that thought, you're probably going to hate it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A powerful portrayal of life in a fanatic regime","review":"This book will obviously raise very fierce reaction as it portrays life in modern Islamic states ruled by the fundamentalist leaders. It may be hard for some people to look at it objectively. It will be easy to denounce Naipaul.But Naipaul has very carefully portrayed how the so called Islamic revolutions that replaced the autocratic regime in Iran or the colonial powers in other Asian countries, have developed their own system of autocracy and tyranny.The beauty of Naipaul's writing is that he is not describing the politics or the religious dogmas, but he is providing us with the portraits of various men and women at different places in their society. It is through their eyes, their pain and sufferings, their hopes and despairs,that we get to see these countries.I am very moved with this book and I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Islamic loyalty or slavery?","review":"The creator of Islam, Mohammad, must have been very clear man to include Arab culture as a part of Moslem religion.

What a waste of time it was reading the final third of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great build up, disappointing ending","review":"William Diehl's book is an absorbing thriller about a rogue militia group. The only problem is that he decided to graft a Martin Vail book onto it. The result is that you spend 3/4 of the book waiting for some sort of fascinating legal and/or action showdown with Martin in the middle and instead he's cut out of the climax. The Aaron Stampler character is completely out of place in this novel. He adds little except a familiar name and a selling point for the novel. Diehl could have cut him out and nothing would have been lost. Still, the plot threads together nicely and I was up until 1 A.M. reading in a white heat trying to see how these elements would fit together. The ending works, but is disappointing in its result."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak story flow with little action","review":"I just finished reading this book and tried to remember what really happened.

It wouldnt take much to learn a \\"Spectre\\" gunship is actually a 4-engined C-130 gunship with 20mm and 7.62mm gatling guns that fire from one side of the aircraft. Theres is also a 105mm howitzer in the nose. These aircraft are NOT helicopters! NONE of these weapons are detachable or in anyway usable by pulling them off the mounts. They are electricaly powered and primed. And No way Sgt Williams could hold on to one. These arent hand weapons.

The first two were top notch novels - a wonderful combination of psychological, legal, and police procedural elements that work well in these 2 thrillers. Diehl should have stopped there, as this third novel pales in comparison.Seems as if he did not know where to take the Martin Vail/ Stampler story next, and tried to wrap it around a shoot em up \\"Waco\\" style confrontation.Don't waste your money on it if you are hoping for more content similar to the first two books.

If Diehl is going to write about the milita movement; which he seems to portray as Bible-thumping Bigots, then he would be well served to learn a little about the tools of the trade. Most of his errors regarding weapons and weapon nomenclature would be laughable if only they were not so completely inane. My personal favorite is when the US Rangers are staging their air assault on the militia enclave and: \\"Sgt Williams stepped off the Pavelow troop helo with a 30mm Gatling gun whirling and spitting in his enormous arms.\\" Folks, they better be enormous, the 30mmGAU only weights 1100 pounds! Each round of ammo for that beast is a little over a pound each with the Depleted Uranium Projectiles. Mr. Diehl, if you want people to take you serious, get your facts straight. END"},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it for Vail and not for Stampler","review":"I couldn't agree more with all of the reviews of \\"Reign in Hell\\" already placed upon this website. This is quite an intriguing novel because of its involvement with current events involving religious cults and/or militia groups. However, for those who are drawn to this novel because of its inclusion of Aaron Stampler, it is quite a disappointment. At the beginning of the book, we are led to believe that Aaron will play a major role in the novel when, in fact, he simply does not (Why he couldn't have played a bigger role, I don't know. So much could have been done with his newfound identity. Also, the build-up to the ending is terrific but the resolution happens too fast with little satisfaction for those following the Vail-Stampler rivalry.). With all of this in mind, this book is quite entertaining. If you've read Diehl's previous two novels, read it for Martin Vail, not for Aaron Stampler. Doing so will enhance the enjoyment of this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do your homework Diehl","review":"Diehl should not be writing on extreme religions when he clearly knows nothing about religion period.

A hundred pages into the book, there still isn't any semblance of a plot.

If his fans think this book is only slightly worst than his best, I will stear clear of this author.This book can't even win praise as a cheap summer read. The characters are insipid, the plot is ludicrous and the tie-in with Stampler is contrived. Worst of all, the book is so bad it just isn't any fun to read. For far better summer fare, read anything by Thomas Harris (Red Dragon, Silence of the Lambs) or Scott Turow (Presumed Innocent, Sins of the Father)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge disappointment","review":"I just recently read this after having read the two previous Martin Vail books several years ago. Overall, I would not recommend it. It does a poor job of advancing anything from the previous two stories and in fact, the book would not have been any different had the Martin/Aaron characters not even been in it. Overall, it almost felt like a 'I want to retire but want one more big payday' type of book, which is a shame.As others have mentioned - a lot of the details that are provided are just plain wrong. I realize that I might have more of an eye for this as a soldier - but I start to feel like 'if the author took shortcuts with this, what else is there?' If you are going to write a book about conflict between militias and soldiers - at least learn the equipment.Also - many of the additional characters that were added were complete stereotypes and never really seemed to have any depth.Overall - a poor effort that I cannot recommend in good faith."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been better","review":"This book could have been better. I thought it was pretty lame how Aaron Stampler was brought into the book. A pychotic killer who decides to become a right-wing religous zealot? The only investigative work the FBI did to identify Stampler was dust a car for fingerprints. That was way to easy. The Attorney General was a lame character. She was supposed to be no nonsense. However I found her laughable and was actually glad when she resigned at the end. It's strange how Martin Vail goes from being a weasle of a defense lawyer to such an honest and moral Attorney General."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great new Diehl!!","review":"I have read all three of the \\"Martin Vail Trilogy\\" and have found all of them quite enjoyable. Even though I did like Show of Evil a bit more, Reign in Hell is still a good novel, if you read it more for the Martin Vail characterisation, then the vail/Stampler interaction. Even so, I found it a bit lacking in the area of \\"coutroom\\" drama, after the first RICO case we are all but devoid of legal/courtroom argument, often my favourite part of Diehl's novels. In saying this though, i found the last part, aptly titled \\"armageddon\\" was absolutely brilliant. It was fast paced and kept me reading. I admit Vail thumbing his nose at the President was maybe a LITTLE bit over the top but hey, it is so typical of his character, I suppose we can forgive Diehl!!

Bringing Aaron Stampler back as Brother Transgressor was masterful. He is a most despicable creature. The secret cadre of Vietnam vets were an interesting bunch.

I ended up disassembling it to determine what the cause was and in the process discovered that this coffee maker, like most other drip units, consisted mainly of cheap plastic castings that fit together rather poorly. That explains the complaints that others have made about difficulty getting the carafe under the drip basket. Anyway, the problem turned out to be the check valve between the reservoir and the heating element. It shut of the water prematurely making the heat sensor think the reservoir was empty. After reassembling the whole thing it still wouldn't work reliably so I ended up sending it back.

Correct this and you would have an excellant product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great as long as nothing breaks","review":"I was very happy with this coffee machine until I dropped the carafe on the ground and the handle broke. You have to struggle a little to pull the carafe out of the machine so it's easier than you might think to drop it.Anyway, I called Black & Decker to see if I can replace the handle and I was told that my only option was to replace the carafe - at a price of over $50.00 including shipping.A very satisfied customer has been instantly converted into a very dissatisfied customer. My husband and I are going to try and make a new handle, but I probably won't buy a B&D; coffee machine again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quiet, but problems","review":"We recently purchased this for our office. The good points: It's very quiet when it brews, and keeps the coffee warm for a good long time.But it's annoying in several ways. First, the pot doesn't easily fit into the unit without shoving a few times. Also, the top twists to either \\"pour\\" or \\"keep warm,\\" and the \\"pour\\" hardly dribbles. I always end up taking the top off totally to pour it. The top is then hard to get back on, it doesn't sit on the top evenly enough to twist it back on.Now I'm wondering if we shouldn't have shelled out the extra bucks for a higher-quality unit. Maybe we got a lemon?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unpredictable","review":"Usually Black and Decker products are reliable. The TCM830, sadly is not. It's barely 6 months old and is failing. The reservoir doesn't completely empty thus making the perfect pot of coffee somewhat challenging. You need to be wide awake when positioning the carafe under the brew basket; else, you'll have a counter top full of coffee. I'm shopping for a replacement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Coffee Pot","review":"The coffee pot is perfect for my needs and looks really cool.

At times it is troublesome getting the coffee pot in the correct position under the brewer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Black & Decker design flaws","review":"As stated by another reviewer this coffeemaker, after about 9 months of making the best coffee I've ever had, stops brewing mid-pot. I have 4 of them (3 being replacements) and all 4 stopped at approximately the same amount of time. I need this last one replaced and even though Black & Decker told me that they were aware of the problem, they have yet to fix it and expect me to pay full price for a new one.They offered it to me for $105. I paid $45 for the original one. Anyhow I will now be shopping for another coffeemaker with the same features I love. Stainless steel pot and the ability to pour while still brewing. I just wish it would continue to work like it should. We even still have a Mr. Coffee from the 1970's that brews but the coffee tastes horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not satisfied.","review":"I purchased this coffeemaker for my husband for Christmas. I'm not a coffee drinker, so I wouldn't know a good one from a bad one. I loved the way this one looked and read reviews and didn't read anything bad enough to make me decide I didn't want to buy it. My husband didn't enjoy it. He tried not to hurt my feelings by not saying anything to me, but I could tell he wasn't impressed. After nudging him long enough he admitted the coffee was weak and he had to add so much coffee to it to make it strong enough that it was wasting money. That was enough for me! I sent it back. Haven't gotten a refund yet, but I am hopeful I will."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice concept but unfortunate performance","review":"I should have listened to the negative reviews more closely. Some of the features were interesting but turned out to be a little clumsy ergonomically. The larger issue, however was coffeemaking. It is well known that good coffee is produced at a temperature between 190 and 205 degrees F for the full brewing cycle. Too low and the result is bitterness as the flavors aren't extracted properly. This machine consistently registered 165 degrees with a surge to about 190 in the last minute or so. Not enough. Amazon Prime didn't have the item a month or so ago so I purchased it from a partner, Design Concepts. They were nice enough to let me return the unit.I would suggest buying a 25.00 Black and Decker coffee maker (they work fine) and saving your money to purchase a 300.00 Technivorm, described elsewhere by Amazon. It will last indefinitely and is the only drip machine to produce really great coffee. Worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"Right down to specifics. The plastic water reservoir does not stay open easily while filling (plastic lid wants to close on you). After owning this machine one year (most expensive I have ever bought) the water doesn't heat up enough. It stops running before all the water is through the system, leaving a cup in the reservoir. The thermos gets cold quickly if its a cold day out (isn't the point to keep it warm??).

Unfortunately, Bernard Harcourt couches his oppositional views in a rambling, inefficiently written academese. Concise, telling points are few. The bibliography is decent. (2) Timothy Lynch's \\"'We Own the Night' Amadou Diallo's Deadly Encounter with New York City's Street Crimes Unit\\" makes a much more effective argument in only 8 pages. (Cato Institute Briefing Papers #56). George Kelling, the National Institute of Justice, and the New York Office of the Attorney General have all produced shorter, precise, and much more telling analyses of some of the pros and cons of Broken Windows doctrine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look at author before you look at book.","review":"I finally finished this book, but it wasn't easy. While Mr. Harcourt tries to show that New York (and other cities) is not any safer than it was before the Mayor began his programs I have to say it just doesn't wash. He uses the one thing to try and prove his point that just wont work and that is his own opinion. When you live in a world when all you have ever done is work in and around colleges/schools you lose a grip on the real world. Much like other \\"Professional Writers and/or Professors\\" Mr. Harcourt has watched too many liberal TV reports and read the Village Voice to often.

Our trees in this area have had a blight spread by wind and many nice trees have been cut down to prevent the transfer. Of all the varieties I have seen growing here, very few have nice skin or unblighted foliage. Hopefully I will be able to reach that goal.

The selection of tracks ranges from a deep, jazzy, sexy groove that will take you down the catwalk in the fashion mecca of the world. Both mixes features selected tracks off of Harley's label Soulstar & Muscles label Sweet Angel recordings. An excellent addition to AfterDark series has yet inspired more house music listeners to tune in on more unsung talent. Recommended !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotive and touching","review":"This is my first exposure to the series, but with this initial impression, it will certainly not be the last. The first cd is a very beautiful mix, flowing on the light and mellow side, it still delivers a chunky deep beat that has breezes of breaks drift through. The vocals are tasteful with emotional melodies that keep them touching in a sense. Track 5 and 10 are certain highlights that get a lot of attention from me.CD2 is slower, more minimal, and delightful. Although some may prefer the energy and emotion of CD1, this mix finds it's moments on Sunday mornings when you are taking it easy or in a state of recovery from the night before. Track 2 and track 8 have a very nice groove to them.You can call it mature, but I would strongly refer to it as soul-filled bliss. This is a sound for those who are seeking depth in their music but still like to dance to themselves while home alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I really love the Afterdark and Bargroove cds, but was highly disappointed in this 2 cd set. Sure, its relaxing and the music is smooth and all that but I'd rather pop in one of those great Bargroove cds to get my night going."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's so \\"grown up\\" about this??","review":"Sophisticated and grown-up?? Is that what they call dull House music these days? Elevator music must be pretty \\"grown-up\\" for some of you, too! p.s. - just because something doesn't have much of a beat and you can't dance to it does not make something mature. This is to House what chill-out is to Trance - really only good as total background music - you won't remember a single song after it's over or really notice it's there. Totally forgettable. ...but if that's what you want, then by all means!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Creative Therapy with Children & Adolescents","review":"I have used this book for over two years now. The book comes with many great ideas for therapeutic interventions. However, many of the exercises suggest that you refer to certain stories or activity sheets that are not in this book. (You must purchase an additional book to use with this one.) I would have preferred if this book had clearly stated on the cover that it needs to be in conjunction with another one. I still have not found the other book that this one refers to!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good news and bad news","review":"As a playwright struggling with a concept for a stage thriller, I bought this script based on the description, the author's reputation, and some of the reviews. The good news: this is a highly entertaining play, with surprising twists and turns throughout. The bad news (for me): \\"Accomplice\\" exposes all the old techniques and cliches of writing for the stage in this genre, making the writing of my script more challenging. I don't know whether to thank Mr. Holmes or to curse him. In any case, he certainly raised the bar with this terrific play."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweetness","review":"I'm not a Jazz expert or anything, but I know great music when I hear it and Diana Krall is a sensation. Ever since \\"All for You\\" I've been a huge fan of hers. I listen to all types of music from Rage Against the Machine to Faith Hill to Sinatra, but Diana Krall's voice to me just is in a class by itself. I haven't been struck by such a beautiful voice since Ella Fitzgerald and I wish Diana would get more plubicity because she's young and talented and there's a whole group of young people out there who would love this. I'm only 19, but I'm glad I found her in time. Fabulous CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"From China - not Hawaiian","review":"When I received this spirulina there was nothing on the bottle to indicate where it was produced.

A new generation of fighters sporting a variety of cybernetic enhancements is coming up, certain of their superiority. To prove which corporation manufactures the most advanced cybernetics, a no-holds-barred tournament is held where every fight is to the death, and Chance is the only competitor who's purely human. This is an idea with potential. But it's so badly executed, and the ending is such a complete waste, that it's a total embarrassment.This can be laid soley at the feet of the writer/director. The actors all turn in creditable performances, but they're fighting an uphill battle. Don't bother with this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"This has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. How this movie was \\"greenlighted\\" is beyond me. The director should be kicked out of Hollywood for this atrocity. Like a train wreck, though (which it was), its hard to stop watching.Everything from the production values (was the Director of Photography blind with those horrible lighting setups? Bad overdubs that were horribly noticeable. And, I especially enjoyed seeing the wireless microphone pak in the back of the female lead's sweatpants)...to the absolute absurdity of the story (let's see, apparently its a corn field in Kansas since the girl has a KC Royals penant in her bedroom, yet, amazingly, the scarecrow also ends up killing horrible actors at the beach that looks similar to Malibu...imagine that.)Not funny. Not scary. Not worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jeepers Creepers rip off!","review":"This movie is such a huge rip off of the two Jeepers Creepers films. The only difference is the cheesey nudity and believe me, it's ugly nudity. The only reason I gave it ONE star is two fold: first I can't put down zero stars; and second there were some funny lines in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"diabetes is different than hypoglycemia...","review":"This was a horrible movie, true. The main thing that irked me was they couldn't decide if the kid was hypoglycemic or diabetic. Hypoglycemic- you don't take insulin as you already end up with TOO MUCH, and that will make you \\"combative\\" and possibly pass out. However, if the kid is diabetic like they kept saying, he would need the insulin and could slip into a coma. So which is it, geniuses? They are pretty much polar opposites as blood sugar disorders. Do some research while you make your super bad movie. I also enjoyed all the visable portable microphones- is that a mic in your pocket, or are you just lumpy?"},{"rating":"1","title":"SyFy Channel Movies are better.","review":"I bought this movie at Amazon because it was dirt cheap and ONLY to see Oliva Munn's role in it.

Lousy acting and actors can't enhance a horrible script.My only reason for purchasing this movie, I'm a fan of Olivia Munn =). I've met and she's always nice to me, sadly she's only in the movie a few seconds.Olivia was probably the only real actress / actor in the movie.If you like bad a horrible horror film you may enjoy Scarcrow Gone Wild.Let me know if you can watch this movie more than once."},{"rating":"1","title":"a good movie--NOT! justin teplitz","review":"After a solid performance in Champions, movie star Ken Shamrock really lowered his standards to act in this boring film. I fell asleep immediately after Ken Shamrock's fake fight scene with a Goblin on the beach. There was no plot and no point to this unscary movie, which couldn't have costed more than $20,000 to produce (not including Ken's $1 million fee). It's sad, but it looks like Ken Shamrock has transformed from a \\"A-List\\" actor to a \\"F- List\\" actor after this snoozefestival."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was just silly","review":"I watched this for the heck of it on cable last night, and thought that perhaps I should have tried to throw darts at the moon instead. I would have had better luck hitting the moon than enjoying this film.Not all slasher films are bad, if you're into them. I'm not a huge fan of them, but there are the few exceptions that stand above the rest.The main problem with this film - and there were many - was that the scarecrow looked and walked like Jason from Friday the Thirteenth. We saw silly and inexplicable nudity, a brother who promised to show up at an emergency facility but never came (and this was never commented on), stupid guys, stupid girls...you get the drift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucked badly","review":"This was the most terrible movie I have ever seen in my life. I was actually rooting for the scarecrow!!!! Too predictable for me and very, very poor acting. I reccomend that you don't even think about buying this. Fortunately, I was able to see this on Starz on Demand. I didn't have to pay anything, but I am upset that I wasted my time on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is the weakest link","review":"The third installment in the Scarecrow series has more problems than a child star from Different Strokes. While the previous two films, Scarecrow and Scarecrow Slayer were action packed and sprinkled with humor, this film lacks both.The \`story' is nearly non-existent. It seems the director attempts to cover this fact by having every woman in the movie take their tops off, but not even that can distract from the horrible rendition of the Scarecrow. In the previous films, I found the costume and make-up to be original, convincing, and scary. This time, the Scarecrow is obviously just a guy in a burlap sack with a Halloween mask so cheap you can see his skin around the eye holes.And don't even ask how the acting was. The best actor in the film is Ken Shamrock. That says most of it right there.While I enjoy bargain basement horror films, this one should have stayed in the basement. Please check out some of the other, older films York has to offer instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"I<3Miser!!","review":"This cd is so awesome!

It fell off again quite promptly, so I contacted Amazon and they sent another which was similar to the first. The help phone number in the Manual (1-800-521-8550) doesn't connect you to McCulloch, but to a different company, Dixie Sells, where I was told that McCulloch exists only as a brand name of the Modern Tool & Die Company, which has no 800 number. No one at Dixie Sells knew how to assemble the trimmer, so I was on my own. It turned out that a bent piece of wire enclosed with the tool, but not mentioned in the Manual, is what holds the debris shield onto the tool. Because of the poorly written Manual and the lack of company support, I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfactory performance","review":"Not a satisfactory trimmer.

This collection truly showcases the Four Tops ability to 'rock the joint' with their high-energy, up-tempo songs as well as 'pour on the passion' with their smooth ballads.A real treat for avid Motown fans are the Four Tops covers of tunes recorded by Marvin Gaye, ('Sweeter as the Days Go By,' 'Gotta Say It,' 'Get My Hands On Some Lovin',' 'Lonely Lover'), and The Temptations ('It's a Lonely World Without Your Love') - also recorded by Marvin Gaye. The Four Tops certainly give these other top-ranking acts a run for their money.Another point in this collection's favor is that there are no \\"filler\\" songs - every song sounds like the singers, musicians and producers gave it their all.For Four Tops and Motown fans, this Lost & Found collection is a real must-have treasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ames Pick Mattock","review":"This is a pretty decent mattock.

As many other reviewers have said, it is not just a screaming hell fest, which is what many people expect from TrustKill - it is a well thought out, well written and very well performed album. Some of the guitar work is fantastic, delicate at times, brutal at others. The vocals are perfect for each song.

These recordings were made in Nashville toward the end of Bob's life, and they do not capture the authentic sound of Bob Wills and HIS TEXAS PLAYBOYS.The good stuff was recorded from 1935 to 1947 WITH HIS TEXAS PLAYBOYS. If you want the best of Bob Wills, buy something (anything) on Columbia or CBS.

Do yourself a favor and steer clear of his recordings on MGM or MCA."},{"rating":"1","title":"His earlier stuff with the Playboys is much better","review":"The tracks on this album are later recordings of Bob Wills from 1965 until his death. They are, by and large, not recorded with the Playboys (though one or two show up on a few tracks). Instead of the 30's/40's West Texas sound I love, these recordings have something of a Vegas/Sinatra 60's feel to them, especially in the backing.

I read a lot of reviews before purchasing and all of them said to order a size or size and a half smaller. I guess my foot is retarded because I went to the Clark store and actually try them on, and they fits true size. They took a week to break in, after that, they are the most comfortable pair of boots ever.

The pair I just got is made in Vietnam (older pair does not say) and its leather is much stiffer, even keeping into account that they are new.

Very comfortable and look fantastic, wear with jeans and your classy and rugged. In regards to size, make sure you order a size down, because they do run big. I wear an 11 sneaker and wear a 10 for the boot, I could probably go down to a 9.5. Secondly, they are suede and therefore do get dirty very quickly and easily. If you are the type of person who has to have that \\"fresh\\" look than I would recommend you go with a darker color than sand. I've found that with a brush and some proper cleaning technique they can retain their luster. One thing I do wish I had done before wearing them out is to put some suede protector spray on them.

I am normally wearing size 9, the Clarks were at least 10.5 although saying 9 on the box. Luckily, I could sell my pair to a friend and ordered another one with the size 8.5.

Otherwise, these are great shoes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product and price.","review":"After trying on a pair of Clarks Desert Boots at a store to get my size right (I bought a full size smaller than I typically wear) I decided to search online for them. Amazon had them for $80, which is about $30 cheaper than anywhere else I looked.The boots look great with jeans or khakis and are a lot more comfortable than I expected; however, the heel is rubbing a little as I break them in.

Own several suede pairs in different colors. The sizing definitely runs large for me. In Nike I wear size 12. In alot of other shoes I wear 11. In these desert boots I size down to 10.5.If there is one complaint it would be with the laces. There's only two eyelets. There's room for a third hole higher on the ankle.

It is a composite sort of leather usually on a material backing and is very hard to pick with the unpracticed eye and you have to practically damage the shoe to test this fact unless you have an original to compare them with. The best desert boots that I have come across were a Polish brand called rollers but I doubt that they exist any more."},{"rating":"1","title":"defective","review":"Great shoe, but worn for a week and I tried to use specific made cleaner for the shoe, made shoe lose its color completely.

Seems to me its a good shoe at first, but if you get dirty at all do not clean it with cleaner because it seems that the color on the shoe was painted on or stained bad. Good shoe if you don't get dirty though.

I usually wear 9.5 (I know, not big feet), but for these shoes I ordered 8.5 and it fits me great.The shoes look great, feel good, and can be worn with pretty much ant pants. I'm thinking of ordering different colors of these same shoes.They were not meant to be worn on cold weather. They are perfect for little hotter weather as they keep your feet nice, cool, and comfortable.The heal was not as comfortable as I thought. I have smaller feet so I wouldn't blame the shoes for this. It kind of scrapes my heel after few hours of walking around. It rubs my heel on the inside and it is kind of painful to walk. I think I might find some heel cups to solve this problem.They look stylish though. I got few compliments so far from both males and females.UPDATE: I still give it four star rating.

I will make an exception here and tell you that if you are in the market for a pair of Chukka boots, don't look any further.

I admit I did not initially believe the many other reviewers saying to order a 1/2 to a full size down so I bought my normal shoe size...but they were right and I returned them for a 1/2 size down. Perfect fit, but I know everyone's foot is different. Be aware, though, they do run large.Will definitely buy another pair in another color. Versatile shoe.

If I would have ordered true to my size they would have been too big for sure.I wear a size 10 in sneakers (Vans, Nike etc.), and ordered a 9 for these. They fit pretty snug, with no heel slippage or any sliding whatsoever.My only real complaint, if you even want to call it that, is that the leather (I ordered the beeswax model), appears to come with some pre-distressing. Nothing that significant, but as someone who dislikes buying distressed items it was a minor gripe. I prefer to beat up my own stuff, thanks.I should also mention that they were a bit stiff for the first week, but after continuous wear they became much more comfortable as the leather molded to my feet.

I had to buy inserts as if they were several months old. Also the sole of the shoe is gum, which after walking on them for over a week looks black and dirty. And the upper shoe retains scuffs and scratches.After wearing these shoes for a week, they look and feel like they're several months old. If this is the intended look (this is the era of pre-torn, pre-worn jeans) then I apologize.

The Desert Boot looks very similar but has a more rounded toe that makes them not as dressy and more like Doc Martins, which was disappointing because I wanted a business casual shoe to wear with chinos. The leather is also very cheap (very stiff) it creases very easy and they stays creased even with shoe trees. These creases in the toe region make them look cheap and \\"frumpy\\" and is a characteristic of a low quality shoe... Too bad I've already worn them, I would of returned them and just forked over the extra cash for the Jcrew Mcallisters."},{"rating":"1","title":"look awesome but feel like a cheap pair of bobos","review":"i love wallabees and always wanted a pair of these as they are super good looking boots and you can wear them in the summer. i was so excited when my desert boots arrived, but them i wore them. they feel horrible. they're not at all what i was expecting according to reviews i've been reading for years. they make my feet hurt and are almost as bad for my lower back as a pair of chuck taylors (which also look good but are terrible for my back). this is a rare case of the original is definately not the best as far as im concerned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Timeless my foot!","review":"I used to pretty much live in these boots, but for some reason--possibly related to the move to Far East production--Clarks now only make them in a much narrower fitting than before. They've also ramped the price up since they came back into fashion--they used to be a great, cheap option for students and the like, but they're now about three or four times the price of the cheapest alternatives. A sad end to a great British tradition of comfy, economical, yet stylish and well-made shoes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Break em in and they're great.","review":"Like everybody said be sure to size down a 1/2 to a full size. I wear 10s, ordered 9s and while they were a shade snug at first, they have broken in and stretched out beautifully. I walk over a mile in them 4-5 days a week and while they may not be the ideal walking shoe, they're surprisingly comfortable for a simple leather boot. I bought the beeswax because the resilience of traditional leather to wear and staining beats suede. I treated them with a protective spray and so far there doesn't seem to be any problems with water damage or staining. They get scuff marks on the leather pretty easily but treating them has helped. I'm looking forward to when they get worn in and beat up as they're already my go-to shoe. A fine mix of style, functionality, simplicity, and durability in my opinion. They seem to look and feel better with time like most leather products."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got what I wanted","review":"The boot was great. Order a size down.

I chose the taupe suede, I believe the pictures were very accurate (there were 2 pictures of the brown style though in the slideshow, but all of the other photos were of the true taupe suede).

The laces do not go high enough up the ankle to secure your foot in place and, for me, if I tie them tightly where the eyelets are, the boots hurt the top of my feet.

As a result, I bought another pair for my dad, who liked the comfort and design when he tried out mine.They fit true to size!However, I wanted to purchase the Beeswax version previously.

I would look around before I ordered this book for more traditional books on how to mix color and attain the shade you desire. I feel I purchased a glorified commercial in this book. My advice:keep looking for books that are less commercial and more focused on helping you learn how to mix colors already on the market.

What Sanden illustrates in the \\"29 steps\\" is nothing more than a quick (completed in one hour) color study of his subjects. He admits in the text toward the end that the portraits featured in the book actually took many days to paint. Really, what a surprise! While it was interesting to see how he prepares his canvas and blocks in his subject, Sanden does not spend any time on the techniques he uses to give his portraits their \\"finish,\\" which is what most portrait artists are seeking to improve upon. What he does focus on are his own brand of paints that he pushes throughout the pages.Don't be fooled by the portrait on the cover. If you want to end up with a finished painting that looks like that, you will NOT learn how to do it in this book.

It appears identical to what is used in her videos. The bar was easily assembled and does exactly what you would expect with a couple of minor annoyances.First, the spring collars to hold the weights in place can be difficult to get on and off of the bar, especially if you're hurrying to keep up with Cathe.Second, when pulling the spring off of the bar it get's hung on the plastic bar end caps. She ends up pulling the end cap out with the clamp half of the time. We ended up just chucking the plastic end caps and life became just a little less irritating.On the positive side, the weights are easy to handle and the bar is a good length.Overall it's a good value for light weight training."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!!","review":"When I first bought this, I thought it would be for my husband only (55 lbs is a lot!), but I didn't realize it would be possible to very quickly and easily remove the discs to get various weights. It can range from 5 pounds UP to 55. I like using 10 pounds on each side for bench presses (yes, I'm a weakling). And, even though the discs come off very easily for changing the weight, it is very safe (you definitely don't need to worry about the weights coming off while you're using them). Great for workouts, and a great price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as promised","review":"Like at least one other reviewer, what I actually received was a 45 lb. set: the two five pound plates were missing. My only option was to return the entire set. I elected to just buy the extra plates myself at Dick's (about $5 apiece). As others have noted, it is a spectacular price, especially with free shipping. Just be prepared to have to supplement the set at additional cost if you get one of the duds!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Naxos comes through again","review":"Don't have any reservations about picking up this CD. As with all Naxos recordings, the performances are first-class and recorded in such a way that you hear the music rather than the painstaking attentions of a suite of sound engineers. The transcriptions from De Falla's orchestral pieces are nice to have, but the harpsichord concerto is especially excellent and difficult to find. It rivals Stravinsky and Copland in its rhythmic invention, and Elizabeth Anderson attacks it with an energy and enthusiasm that would do Wanda Landowska proud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hypocrites","review":"If the Goads lived by the words they sing, this world would be a different place. some of the music is wonderful - Nothing Cleaner than the blood of Jesus - beautiful. But I would never spend money on it because they are arrogant, deceitful and have evil streaks in them - especially Carolyn. Curt is not pure as brother Tim puts it. Trust me. So, save your money and spend it on artists that deserve it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hippie Retro","review":"Ina Gadda da vida has always been one of my favourite pieces of rock music, so it was great to get a live performance of this song. Some of the band members have of course changed but they all played the music with much relish and skill, and time has made them even better musicians. I also enjoyed the other tracks which had a great blues beat. I was bemused at the 'hippie' clothing but then they were very much a part of that era. I am glad I purchased this DVD"},{"rating":"1","title":"Iron (rusty) Butterfly","review":"I was a bit disappointed with the performance.

With all that's happening in the world today, BAPTISM should be required listening for everyone. In any case, it's much better than the current anthologies of anti-war poetry.

A must for all Baez fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"JOAN...WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?","review":"This is a pretentious work by one of the greatest folk singers of all time. It features Joan Baez reading the poetic works of others with a smattering of music thrown in. This CD is the epitome of conceit. People buy Joan Baez CDs because of her glorious singing voice, not for her poetry reading.As a conceptual work, the premise of the CD is intriguing, a melding of poetry and music, with the poetry read against a backdrop of music. It is intended to be evocative of the times in which we live, with the poetry extending the range of the music. In its execution, however, the premise is seriously flawed by Joan Baez's reading voice, as she drones on and on, no thespian she.While it is obvious that a great deal of thought went into the selection of both the poetry and the music, it is an ambitious venture which does not work. Stick to singing, Joan. That is your gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"JOAN...WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?...","review":"This is a pretentious work by one of the greatest folk singers of all time.

This one burns just like that older stuff, but it isn't just rehash--Vertu extends fusion in some tantalizing directions. Rachel Z's keyboards rock, and Stan and Lenny have continued to grow without losing any of the fire. Like the first reviewer (relax, great review!), I wasn't sure what to do with the Kotzin vocals, but the rest of the album more than carries its own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fusion for the Millenium?","review":"The second and third reviews!... Oh the pressure!! You know a quarter century on I find I play a lot of my old fusion classics as much as ever, as vituosity in an artistic setting seems to be timeless and inspiring. I bought this disc with little expectation, mainly because I heard Stanley Clarke was working with Producer Dennis MacKay and the great Lenny White. What I didn't expect was to find a fully unified band effort where all involved shine equally. These folks really stretch and always within the context of the song, some great evocative writing here. What vocal work there is, is well done and kept to a minimum so don't allow that to keep you away from this fine disc. With a nod to the past with the homage to Hymn of the Seventh Galaxy and an eye cast to the future this work isn't so much fusion for the millenium (as the ads have been saying) as it is fusion for right now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A terrible reflection of the actual test","review":"I chose this book because it had a lot of practice tests and I didnt really need the review because I had a strong background in math from school. If you want to practice for the SAT II dont use these tests. THey are much harder than the actual test. I ended up getting an 800 on the SAT but considered not taking the day of because the night before the test I was still getting 550s on the practice tests. Luckily I chose to take my chances anyway but this book only made me nervous and did not help at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many errors","review":"There are simply too many errors in this book. Sometimes the answers in the answer key are wrong, and sometimes the explanations apparently belong to a different problem and make no sense.When a MATH BOOK has the wrong answers it deserves a low rating. If there were no errors in the book I would give it 4 stars but with the huge number of errors it contains I can't. In fact, if I could give it zero stars I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY BAD","review":"I bought this book 2 months before I took the exam and took a couple tests from it and by the scale they gave me, it looked to me like i was going to be scoring in the 500s or below. The questions in this book are SO MUCH HARDER than the actual test. They try to over-prep you by giving you super hard questions so that the ones on the actual test seem easier and you feel more confident. This was definately NOT the type of preparation I needed, and thanks to them, I scored a 650. A score I am ashamed of and now i have to take it again. I heard from a friend that the Sparknotes book is MUCH BETTER. I'm warning you, stay away from Barron."},{"rating":"1","title":"full of mistakes and not worthwhile","review":"As a student who has already taken AP Calculus, I bought this book to review stuff that I had forgotten or may have never been taught. This book has many examples, but often never actually tells you the information, which I find to be annoying. The practice tests are far more difficult than the actual test, and the answer keys contain many mistakes. When looking over the explantions/answers to questions I got wrong, I discovered that I had the right answer, but the letter answer that was listed was wrong.I can't say this book is a complete waste of time, because it did actually help me a little, but probably not enough to be worthwhile.I got an 800 on the test, but I don't think this book can be attributed with my sucess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Challenging but extremely useful","review":"I found this book to be unnecessarily thorough, however a must buy. While it does give you a lot to review and many hard problems that you won't even find on a real SAT Math test (at least 5 per practice test), it will make taking the test ALOT much easier come test day.The material seems to be geared towards stronger math students more comfortable up to Algebra II w/ trig. But don't be discouraged by the tough problems you'll find in the sample tests. I got a perfect on the actual test even though i couldn't answer every single problem correctly in the tests provided.I say do your best, then take a free online sparknotes test for a better, more realistic measure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to use but helps a lot","review":"I think this book is very useful in the sense that it leaves no surprise whatsoever. You become sure that you have gone through every single thing that has ever popped up in the 2C. You need to work with a tutor though because some explanations are not very clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"very bad book","review":"The review book is poorly organized. Instead of trying to teach you the main points you'll need to know for the exam, it tries to cram in every single thing that has ever appeared on the Math IIC exams.

However, for the SAT II MATH IIC, the book was absolutely absurd - after doing their diagnostics, reading their review lessons and, taking the practice tests, I was scared to death: this is going to be so tough and one of my most difficult tests by far, even with a 4.0 GPA, 1590 SAT, and AP calculus under my belt.When test day came, I was shocked - it was hilariously easy, so much so that I almost felt cheated for being made to worry.When it comes to test prepartions, being accurate is the most important - the same level materials and practice tests are essential to success. Barron's book is overly-difficult and not worth the money or worry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good prep, but not the best practice.","review":"If you have this book, keep using it for the review only, but not for the tests.

In terms of knowing the material, I was clueless. The kaplan book (2005-2006) tought me the basic material and then I came to this book for more (I was already familiar with the fact that barron's books are harder than the real thing) but ended up not getting it. Barron's book goes over (It talks about them, but never explains them well) words that have never appeared on the Sat II IIC test! I guess it is good practice but I recomend you have a solid math backround before buying this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harder is NOT better!","review":"Last three editions of this book are all the same, buy an older version, or better, don't buy at all.

Do all the study by sections and understand the practice problems.By doing all 9 practice tests you will not only increase your speed, but also accuracy.If you can get around 680 and above in this book, you'll probably get a 800 on the real one.After doing this bookm the real one was piece of cake, and i was able to finish it 15 minute ahead of time, and i got time to check my answers too!By doing thing book, my grades in my math class also got a lot better from all the practice, i no longer make stupid mistakes in my tests!!Note to all test takers :THE test is soo much easier if you have a graphing calculator and knows not to use it for graphs and the solve functions in it. like if the problem wants you to get the vertex of a parabola, you can either graph it on the calculator, or memorize the formulas or use calculus. So definitely be familiar with your calculator"},{"rating":"2","title":"Get a DEFINATE 800","review":"I studied this book a little bit by bit for 2 weeks or so and got an 800.

What is the minimum disk space required for a MetaFrame 1.8 installation? 30mb or 32mb? The book can't decide. Also, MCP stands for Microsoft Certified Professional.

There is decent information about rock walls, but otherwise this book really lacks in the substance needed to build fences."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it","review":"In my opinion, if a book claims to be a \\"Bible\\", it should contain at least one chapter about Jesus Christ.Although there are a lot of teachings in The Fence Bible that could be viewed as biblical allegories, there is not one word about Jesus Christ anywhere in the book. So I view The Fence Bible as nothing more than an attempt to cash in on the Lord's work without giving any credit to the Lord.Don't waste your time building fences with The Fence Bible. Stick with a real Bible. With a real Bible, you can learn how to build things much greater than fences.I'm giving this book two stars (instead of one star) because it is a pretty good book if you like fences, and it contains a lot of interesting facts.

The only song on here really that I liked a lot was Kashmir - Silent Stream Of Godless Elegy. Communication Breakdown was OK, and Solus version of Rock and Roll - your basic double bass drums and super-fast riffs typical of music of the genre. Most of the rest of it - well, I'll just suffice it to say, I personally was disappointed with this release, but black metal fans (which I am not) might like it OK.

To my ear, the English Renaissance masses such as Taverner's are more suited to choral performance than the Franco-Flemish or Italian works, which always sound clearer and more dramatic sung one-on-a-part (or two-on-a-part if the twos are truly skilled!). The interspersed instrumental \\"moments\\" supplied by Fretwork (viol consort) are beautifully played and appropriate. This is spacious, joyful music.

I couldn't afford to swing a brand new one and did not like using the small-sized spare monitor I have.The monitor does have a few nicks on the frame but nothing I can't live with. The one imperfection on the LCD screen itself is out of the way of full viewing and is minimally discomforting. The frame color is silver which caused me a period of adjustment because I am used to a black frame and I didn't realized the monitor didn't have built-in speakers when I purchased it.It's kind of fun using my old altec lansing speakers again. The price was great and the monitor would have eventually ended up with a few booboo's through my regular usage anyway; so all and all this was a great, thrifty and wise purchase-fully functional."},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest novel in the english language...","review":"Until recognizing The Recognitions, I batted back and forth between Ulysses and Gravity's Rainbow, not because I loved them, but because I recognized them as great.

There's a lot (and I mean a LOT) of well-crafted pseudo-intellectual blather from major and minor characters that tries to move the story forward, but wordiness does not make a masterpiece. I still think it's important that, first, a novel describe - the who what when where - and much of the time I was even confused about who was talking, and to whom. Other reviews mention Ulysses, and Pynchon; well even in the thickest tangles of those works I knew what was going on.

Lawrence at their worst. its filled with struggling, confused, self-obssessed artists making obscure references to second-rate classical music and irrelevant philosophies. the protagist is moody and obviously feels himself to be superior to everyone else (hence the comparison to Wolfe and Lawrence: two writers who thought too much of themselves), although personally i found him profoundly annoying. moments of vivid , grand imagery almost make this book worth reading, but doesnt quite save the book, for there are other writers who also paint strong imagery without the pretentious dialogue and postured writing style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossible to Enjoy","review":"Gaddis is certainly a gifted writer, but what he crafted here is impossible to enjoy on any level. 1000 pages of fragmented sentences, incomplete thoughts, non-interlocking, interlocking story lines and cameo characters simply does not cut it for a first rate work."},{"rating":"1","title":"the \\"Dakley Archive\\" version is slip-shod","review":"For several years, Penguin had a version of this that was very handsome and professionally printed.

The work begins with a clear and understandable, three-fold statement of the rhetorical intent in the Preface: to examine the relationship between literature, oratory and composition in the explication of black voice; to trace the evolution of black voice; and to afford black students more flexibility in constructing their own racialized ethos in writing(...)(...)Holmes by no means seeks to deny the subjective nature of black voice. Thus, in his own writing, he can neither deny, nor even escape, his own black voice and subjectivity. Nor would he want to. And any writer willing to put his own voice, and self, out on the table for examination and critique deserves credit, or, at the very least, a few appreciative readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meet the robinsons","review":"This is good fun and like the movie with the graphics.

Estleman is good at recreating the Holmesian aspect: the boughs howling in moonlit graveyards, the gas-lamps' blobby light in thick fog, etc. He's done his research as to the period and the writing style, and it does work. (Less present is the macabre horror of Stoker's novel.) On the whole, it's a great idea, and the book presents Victorian thrills and action and chase scenes aplenty. Only the end of the book is a disappointment: in order not to rewrite too disruptively the Dracula side, Esteleman must leave Holmes out of the finale altogether, making for a rather anticlimactic ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"Being a huge fan of both Sherlock Holmes and vampires, I pounced on this book when I first saw it. I expected great things from two of my favorite genres put together!Alas, it was not to be. The story is only a rewrite of Stoker's \\"Dracula\\" with Holmes kind of thrown in for flavour. There is absolutely no point for Holmes' involvement and, in fact, the client who brought him the case in the first place just sort of disappears. The story remains more-or-less true to the origional which, as I said, means there is no reason for Holmes to be there. The action, such as it is, is confusing and unnecessary. For example, a lot of space is taken up with a boat race which seemed like it was written in just to put some action in the story.As much as I wanted to recommend this, I can't. A much better mix of Holmes/Dracula is Saberhagen's \\"The Holmes/Dracula File\\". Give this one a miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Amusing Diversion","review":"There are now any number of pastiches of Sherlock Holmes. The author himself alludes to this at the beginning of this book, noting that Watson's \\"lost\\" manuscripts seem to crop up everywhere; he then ruminates on the possibility that some of them are fake. The current story interweaves Holmes with Count Dracula and his antagonists, Harker, Dr. Van Helsing, and the rest.The author (Watson, of course) insists that Stoker's account unfairly leaves out Holmes' part in thwarting Dracula's scheme to move to England. The book revolves around Holmes and Watson pursuing Dracula, and includes a chilling episode where the count visits Baker Street to try and talk to Holmes and convince him to stand aside and allow him free reign.This is an interesting story, and it's a reasonably good pastiche. I enjoyed it, though it seems a bit thin in terms of plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Closer and closer to the truth.","review":"\\"Jesus the Heretic\\" is very well researched, clearly written, entertaining and informative.

He is average height and weight and I do not understand how this isn't a problem for more buyers. The only way to prevent this problem is to loosen the straps and that is not an option because if the straps are not secure there is not protection in an accident.

Just not a good sling for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not many directions","review":"There aren't a lot of directions with this, and you would think that's okay, for a sling, but tactical slings like this are a bit different and it took some work and fiddling to work, but it worked, and I like the results."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Sling","review":"Well made from good materials- a little complex though, would have preferred attachment to my existing sling loops- will have to modify"},{"rating":"1","title":"inexpensive sling=non usable sling","review":"Well, I bought this sling because of the low price. The old saying \\"you get what you pay for\\" rings true on this item. But I thought it was low cost, low risk venture. I don't understand why this sling has a rubberized coating on the stitching. It sticks to clothing and makes shifting your rig a pain when trying to use it as a three point sling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flexible Positions...","review":"It's pretty good for the price and the sling material is nice and wide, but carrying positions not as flexible as I was hoping for with a tactical 12 guage.

The first clue is the packaging is very minimal and not like shown. Second clue, no UTG logo on sling itself. Third clue the clips on the one I got SUCK! They are nothing like pictured. Also there seems to be some kind of mold on the sling. I wiped it down with disinfectant...I just hope some crazy mold from China or wherever doesn't invade my house. No instructions, but I have found suitable pictures online. Other then that it seems functional. I wouldn't trust it on my $1k Bravo Co. AR so I threw it on my $215 Tec-DC9, it seemed sturdy enough in a moderate drop test on that. It's not worth the 12 bucks or whatever I paid for it to bother returning. I will try the UTG sling actually sold and shipped from Amazon next. With free super saver shipping it'll actually cost less. If I would have saw that option, I would have went that route."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is great for the price","review":"I'm loving this sling.

The hooks are of the same type used on commercial shoulder bags."},{"rating":"1","title":"get what u pay for","review":"well i thought i would get another high value item when i ordered this...It needs some work done on it. The positive is it's cheap and it has nice rubber runways on it. The only problem is for someone smaller your going to have 3 flat surfaces stacked on each other and when going to and from operator position the sling can get sperated and bound up in different ways. A lot of work and will be a grade A sling though.

Not to say he's the best, but also the baddest composer/musician/arranger/conductor/music maker 'round in history.

The surface is warm, comfortable silicone, and a button changes the toy between sixteen(!) different vibration and pulsation combinations. It is comfortable enough to be sat upon, but in my experience it is even better when lying face-down or sitting.Yeah, this is a wonderful toy, it can easily and comfortably be used for solo play, or, with a little imagination, it can become a fun toy when used in a pair.

Second, the heating plate doesn't keep the coffee hot enough. Third, there's no automatic shutoff, a nuisance. Fourth, the carafe drips a lot when it's poured at any but the slowest rate."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd give it zero stars if I had the option.","review":"I bought this as a replacement for a 12-y-o tried-and-true Mr. Coffee coffee maker. It is terrible: the design is such that the grounds easily back up into the water reservoir; the reservoir is impossible to clean; the carafe leaks so much there might as well be holes in it; and the venting holes in the back of the water reservoir are placed in such a way that nine times out of ten, as you are filling up the reservoir, you will splash water out the back of the coffee maker. We've spilled so much coffee and water underneath the coffee maker in the three months that we've had it that we've ruined the counter it was sitting on.Total waste of money. Save up and buy something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where did you go, Mr. Coffee?","review":"Alas, Mr. Coffee, you are causing much strife in my household. At this very moment, my wife is saying \\"I hate you.\\" We had one of your ancestors, and loved it, right up until the carafe broke. So, we bought you. Where to start....1) There is a single lid, hinged in back, that lifts up and back. This lid covers both the grinds and the fresh water tank. So, after brewing, if you lift the lid, crud drips back into the fresh water tank. This is ok if you enjoy cleaning the *entire* maker every day.2) Even if you don't lift the lid immediately, some grounds still get thrown into the fresh water tank.3) The maker itself is bulkier than the older models.I guess that Mr. Coffee had to reduce costs somehow to keep their basic model under twenty dollars.Bottom line. Don't waste your money on this guy. Dimaggio he ain't."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst!","review":"This is absolutely the worst coffee maker I have ever used.

It also drips when you pour."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not ready for prime time...","review":"We had a long happy history with Mr Coffee until this one. The basket containing the coffee filter is easily removable for cleaning, but it is held by a container which is not removable and is not washable, The best you can do is to swab the inside with a sponge. Then the spout shooting the hot water into the coffee produces such force as to rather often collapse the paper filter sending grounds into your coffee. This force also throws some of the grounds up and back into the fresh water container, which consequently gets a coating that can also only be cleaned by wiping with a sponge. The body of this unit is not submersible. They need new designers and some responsible product testers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working and I am thankful","review":"This coffee maker is disliked by many because of a few problems with the lid, the way the water goes through the coffee, and the basket, all which tend to make the coffee weaker than it ought to be.

The assumptions he makes, and the way he judges things are kind of foreign to me, and I think it gives an idea about how things must have been for the Bloomsbury types. Virginia has written that you need to have a clear, unbiased mind to write good fiction; perhaps for non-fiction, bias can be interesting. This is the only biography of Virginia Woolf I have ever read. He made her seem fairly weak, which was hard to reconcile with how strong and bright her writing is. This is a lot more than a collection of facts, and I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Virginia Woolf: A Biography","review":"Virginia Woolf: A BiographyBy now, it is the most chronologically complete biography of Virginia Woolf, also giving interesting details about her ancestors.

The album also has my other most favorite NB songs.Never Again (which totally freakin' ROCKS!)SomedayThrow Yourself Away& Woke Up This MorningThere's an original song that's pretty good too, but I don't know why they put an original song on the NB tribute, unless it was written for NB or something.

Alice is especially vicious in this one - personally taking out a few of the cast himself ;)Does a few select songs from Welcome to my nightmare, as well as From the inside. But all of the songs are great on this DVD.Also has a bonus CD of the show (one for house - one for the car). It's not Alice in his heyday.

It could be used to study acute management of emergency situation but there are other books around which are better for this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, but with one small flaw","review":"The case is sturdy and light weight.

The book was short and to the point. It was a fun little book to read. We see this woman who can get up and speak, yet, she comes through as a real person like you and me, someone we can all relate to. And her, describing her struggles with anxiety and agoraphobia, makes her all the more real. She lets us know that even though she was a Christian at the time, this did happen to her. The stories about her family, particularly her oldest son, were very amusing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs drainage holes","review":"It's what it promises to be, but because there is no drainage (which I had assumed from the picture was there) it still manages to marinate my soap in a pool of water until it turns to mush. Even worse, the little nubs then sink into the mushy soap and it dries into sharp shards. I may take scissors to it to see if I can fix the problem, but I wouldn't buy it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"soap dish","review":"very nice. the soap stays on there very nicely. a very nice product. i would buy this again. very nice"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fail","review":"This would be a good product if it had drain holes in it.

Unfortunately, Love/hate without Skid is like the Beatles without John Lennon. This album is good, don't get me wrong, but 30 minutes is more like a single, and there are only one or two tracks that catch the imagination, \\"don't play your guitar..\\" is a great song, and \\"uncle said\\" is pretty good, but the rest just doesn't hit the same spot as the \\"Blackout..\\" and \\"Wasted..\\" tracks. In fact, this is the worst album to be flaunted under the Love/Hate banner. Still, if you like Love/Hate, like me, you'll buy it and make your own mind up....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jizzy Can Still Belt It Out","review":"\\"Let's Eat\\" is a must for all Love/Hate fans, and it makes me wonder what would have become of the group had they stuck together in their original form. Gone is principal songwriter Skid, and it shows in the songwriting. Where \\"Blackout\\" and \\"Wasted\\" had maybe one or two 'filler' tracks, this one is mostly filler tracks. \\"Don't Play Your Guitar While You're Talkin' To Me\\" would have sounded good as a b-side to one of their earlier albums, but doesn't really live up to the band's early standard. Still, it gives us a newer sounding Love/Hate with rhythmic vocal delivery that borders on rap but doesn't fall into the category of Limp Bizkit or Linkin Park. That means I can still like it. Real rock and roll, Jizzy Pearl style, and his voice is worth the price of admission."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent tale for young children.","review":"This is a charming folk tale of a boy who is only half a boy and needs to discover what it takes to become a complete person.

This CD offers a superb choice of songs and I highly recommend it to real jazz lovers. Yes, Miss King is a Queen!"},{"rating":"1","title":"mediocre overview","review":"I flipped through this book before buying it, so I should have known what I was getting, but still I was disappointed. The discussion of the languages is pretty elementary. I was hoping that the discussion of game libraries for the various libraries would be of value, but the selection presented is much smaller than you can easily find online - and being a book, the information presented is out of date, too.Additionally, there are some pretty atrocious editing errors, including syntax errors in the code that completely obscure the point being made, as well as figures incorrectly matched with their respective captions.It's not ALL bad, though. There are a few examples here and there that changed the direction of how I considered using Python in games."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why 3 languages?","review":"I had assumed that I would be reading a book about combining the 3 languages to create a game. First I wanted to know why. I was distracted by the Pygame section, as I've been readingBeginning Game Development with Python and Pygame: From Novice to Professional. In comparing just the Pygame coverage, Beginning Game Development with Python and Pygame is 20x better. There is no reason to have Game Programming with Python, Lua, and Ruby. There isn't sufficient enough coverage on any one language to get a grasp, and if you're already familiar with one or all of the languages, you have to wade through all the newbie stuff to get to the meat. Where is the bibliography? The author describes several facts with no evidence such as a bibliography would provide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Game Programming 500 page overview","review":"As previously mentioned, the book is basically an overview.However, it did assist me when I was researching a choice for a programming language (Python). The book shows the pro's, con's, and example syntax which is its best point. The book also mentioned successful projects using a particular language. I was able to check out this book at CompUSA before they closed. I cant recommend purchasing the book for more than a few bucks, but it would be worth a trip to the library or ebook view.

He no longer wishes to exclude questions of the \\"good life\\" (teleology) from judgements of justice (deontology). He sees that morality must be grounded in a \\"species ethic\\" (ie: a naturalist, religious or metaphysical anthropology). This is significant as his previous work betrayed the sceptical approach to modern liberalism maintained by his predecessors in the Frankfurt School (esp. Adorno & Horkheimer). He know longer holds fast to Dworkin-esque neutrality. Nonetheless he still places the priority on deontology, a fact that makes his claims more tangible than, say, Charles Taylor's. An insightful, well presented and simple read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not overly complex","review":"Previous reviewers have complained that Habermas presents his ideas in a more complex way than necessary. I submit that those reviewers are correct that his ideas, as _they_ understand them, could have been presented more simply.Habermas is writing to academics.

It's a little easy for avid gamers, even for people who tinker around. I haven't played a video game in years and I breezed through it quickly. For kids, however, there are parts that will baffle and frustrate them for a while, and do so without causing them to lose interest in the game. The fact that you can keep dying without reaching a game over is a nice touch for the kiddies too. I would definitely recommend this for young children.Only major drawback - when you begin on each new level there are long, animated introductions you cannot skip. While it's neat that you can hear the Simpsons discussing the game amongst themselves, it slows down your progress."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simpsons game -not much fun","review":"This is an ok fun game, I'm stuck and cant go forward or backwards in the game... not sure how to play the game in order to win and get past where I am"},{"rating":"1","title":"In the words of Lisa Simpson... meh...","review":"This game isn't that great. It violates my one big pet peeve - repetition of the same challenge over and over if you don't get it right the first time. The best part about this game is the dialogue, but even that gets repetitive when you've repeated a level about 25 times. Also, it feels like the characters don't respond well to the controller, which means you are pressing those tiny DS buttons really hard and your hands get bad cramps. Last, in many cases there is absolutely no direction as to how you are supposed to complete the challenge, so you really end up doing it a ridiculous number of times (Lisa and the dolphins almost made me chuck the thing out the window!). If you want a good Simpsons game, I enjoyed the Xbox game \\"Hit and Run\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat boring","review":"\\"The game was fun only for the first time, once you finish it, it gets boring\\" That's accourding to my children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultra Sheer Cankles","review":"The fit of these nylons was good everywhere but the ankles.

A good buy for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"STAY AWAY!","review":"As an avid fan of game music, I was looking forward to listening to this CD. That was my first problem. Although the CD says \\"hollywood symphony orchestra\\", 99% of it is performed by the \\"Electronic Sounds Ensemble.\\" The first track wasn't that bad, and the second is listenable. The third just plain sucked. After that, the CD goes downhill with a horrible Prelude and a hollow rendition Main Theme of FFVII. Then comes Cosmo Canyon, which isn't all that bad. After that, its Shinra Wages a Full Scale Attack, with brass that sounds better on my MIDI synth. Then comes the worst part of the CD: Liberi Fatali. It starts out with a horrible soprano who doesn't even sing the right words. That soprano is replaced by a synth shortly afterwards. God help us. After that, its a lifeless version of My Mind, an OK version of The Spy, and an flat, boring version of Mods de Chocobo. Bottom line, do yourself a favor and avoid this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Tribute to SHAME","review":"I pray that nobody experiences Final Fantasy for the first time on this CD, for they would be given the completely wrong impression. Nobuo Uematsu's beautiful songs have been packaged up in some garbage MIDI format, and no doubt sold to capitalize on FF's rising popularity. I have downloaded better MIDIs for free, which I would much rather listen to than this CD again. The choice of tracks is very average--hardly \\"The Best\\" that Final Fantasy has brought us. I suppose it's a blessing in disguise, for when I listened to how it has butchered \\"Liberi Fatali,\\" I was glad it left more of my favorite songs alone. Don't let the cheap price fool you. This CD is poor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why, oh why, do I buy?","review":"This CD, for the most part, is a bad attempt to cash in on the Final Fantasy name. The 11 tracks that are on the CD...first of all, are short. I think the total play time is only about 35 minutes (I didn't look at the CD information, so I don't know exactly.) The First 3 tracks (FFVI) are passable at best...out of the FFVII tracks (4-7) only #7, Shinra Wages A Full-Scale Attack, is worth a listen. And as for FFVIII...oh man, did they butcher it. Liberi Fatali (track 8) sounds what it would be like if you got your high school glee club drunk one night and they decided to try and sing. I don't even know what words they were saying!All in all, for an arrangement, it stays too true to the original versions of these fine pieces, but with worse synthesis and poorer instrumentation. For a true arrangement, look for the imports of FFVI Grand Finale, FFVII Reunion Tracks, or FFVIII Fithos Lusec Wecos Vinosec. Like the plague, this one should be avoided at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't bear listening to it!","review":"I listened to this CD one time, and after flipping through the tracks to see if there was something good, I painfully turned my cd player off and never listened to it again. This CD does no justice to the wonderful music composed by nobou umaetsu for the final fantasy series. You're better off listening to MIDIs of the music from the games than buying this CD. The vocals seemed to be very off, the instruments didn't sound real, and it sounded like someone made this cd in a couple of hours. I don't reccomend this CD to anyone unless you need a new frisbee!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who liscenced this?","review":"Hmm... now where can i start? Oh I know... THIS CD SUCKS! Now i don't mean to sound critical... but when it said \\"Best of Final Fantasy 1994 -1999\\" visions of the marvelous \\"Final Fantasy 1987-1993\\" (I think those years are right) popped into my head. I mean that CD included great music, we're talking everything from full orchestra to vocal to even a little Celtic style.. To say the least i was excited... Well i awaited it anxiously and plugged it in... and my ears basically threw up. I mean who on earth allowed this to be published? I could download better sounding MIDI's! Its all synthesized crap... it wasn't so bad until i got to Liberi Fatali. A song in the OSV that sounded awesome! Remember that great choir? Well so long choir... hello to cheesy (read: ULTA-SUPER-MEGA-THOUSAND-TIMES-TO-THE-INFINITE-POWER-CHEESY) synthesized choir.

Completely disreguard any review that calls this CD orchestrated. This is all synthiesized. All electronic, and poor quality electronic, too. A couple tracks are tolerable at best (my reason for giving this 2 Stars instead of 1), but the rest...God, I'm so upset I can't even see straight! Liberi Fatali, one of the best pieces of FF ever, has been destroyed and tainted by this disgrace of a CD. Even if the sound quality on this CD came REMOTELY close to sounding good, the music has no variation to the music in the games. Besides different electric instruments, the music is exatcly the same. I own almost every CD that bears the FF name, and I can tell you that this is BY FAR the worst. Avoid at all cost. FF fans- stay away!! FF Music newcomers- do not take this music as a true representation of FF music. The real stuff is MUCH better."},{"rating":"1","title":"The saddest attempt at a musical tribute I've ever heard.","review":"Where to even begin? How about with false advertising! This cd has been touted as being performed by the Hollywood Symphony Orchestra and Chorus. Yeah. This CD is synthesized through and through, and not even well-synthesized. This album is a prime example of how *not* to arrange the music of Final Fantasy. It's a complete bastardization of Nobuo Uematsu's work, and I can only hope that the man himself is aware of it and will not allow it to happen again. I have no words to describe how awful this disc is. If you want to listen to Final Fantasy music, do yourself a favor: Get the original soundtracks. Maybe someday someone will see the errors with this CD, and correct them with a new album, hopefully with a real symphony this time instead of teasing us with promises that can't be kept.A severe missed opportunity."},{"rating":"1","title":"true fans: don't buy this album!","review":"I consider myself a true final fantasy fan, espescially the music.

There's not too many insane guitar solos or anything but the songwriting is the focus. The choruses will be stuck in your head for a long time. The keyboards are used sparingly but at all the right times. I'd like to hear more of them, though! Highlights: Fallen, Whatever Hate Provides, Face of Pain, Searching, Cry on My Shoulder.

What I found in this book was a hard and true reality of the current dating world.The book shows the struggles for women to find a life-time partner now a days. The fact that they need to be economically independent before looking for true love is just one of the many dificulties that women face today. It also shows how people in general, women and men, have become very pratical and work oriented in and outside the work place. The drawbacks in this way of seeing life and the opposite sex can be found in between the lines.Basically, \\"Why are there no good men left\\" presents and well states a problem. The benefit of reading it is to be aware of it before, the problem comes knocking on your door.It is a must read book for women and men in their 20s and 30s and also for parents willing to understand the current changes in the dating scene."},{"rating":"1","title":"No good men left, eh?","review":"Well, how about a little hint.I'm a 23-year-old guy and when I go out to clubs, dances, bars and the like, I'm amazed at how standoffish modern 18-25-year-old girls are.

As the movie goes on in some twists it ends up falling flat on its face. First we find one of the killers too soon, the story line gets confusing and the pace goes down to a crawl. Usually a movie like this will keep you on the edge of your seat, but it will bore you to death.There is no suspense. You will find yourself drooling boreishly as this movie becomes more dumb as we get to the most snoreful end. If you like movies like this, then go for Silence of the Lambs or Se7en.

They are pleased with the product; basically, they say there is nothing better on the market in the wireless department.

Available online at theonion.com or in a paper version, The Onion offers hilarious made-up news stories, features, and columns. You are guarenteed to laugh out loud just reading the headlines, especially the headlines from famous past events included in this book .... This is a must-have book for anyone with a sardonic sense of humor, and it makes a great gift. One thing to note: the type is very small in places, so a magnifying glass makes reading easier. Have fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"really small!","review":"Oops, didn't realize I was ordering a mini book. A bit of a surprise when I opened the box!

The only downside to this book is that some people may find a good portion of the book offensive, as it makes light of some rather heavy events. However, it is all in the spirit of fun.

Everyone else, however, has an obligation to BUY THIS BOOK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hillarious Parody of the 20th Century","review":"Revered as the greatest century in the history of man kind, we forget that it was home to some of the greatest mistakes and evils the human race has ever commited. A very sarcastic and realistic satire of events that have transpired before The Onion actually first started being written is gut-bustingly hysterical. Those history buffs will especially enjoy the early 1900s articles and advertisements.

They poke fun at Nixon and Reagan, yet Dukakis gets only one article. Where's the balance? They make Nixon out to be a criminal, Ike seem distracted and lazy, and Reagan somehow dishonest. Carter is praised for being a hip streaker. It just goes to show that the writers of this book have a hidden sinister agenda. This book should be burned!

Several hundred pages of satire later, you gain a greater appriciation for the American dream. I feel that this work is a way for people to look back and say, \\"God, I can't believe that...\\" While it was of course written for humor, The Onion takes a surprising look at the Century, touching base on everything from the Industrial revolution, the dust bowl, Spanish Influenza, Man on the Moon, to the Clinton scandal of the late 1990's.

Many will be tempted to dismiss the humour as juvenile, but to do so would be to miss the cultural referances and snide tone abound in the book, which serves as the true source of humour. Those naive enough to believe that the witty and clever don't swear will dislike the book. For those of us that know that obscenities can add stylistic punctuation, check it out. Both subtle and not-so-subtle glimpses into the true methods of humankind through the medium of news-parody. If you think The Simpsons is more cartoon than societal parody, you can probably skip this one. If you feel Elton John writes tear-jerk music for money, not memorandum, then you probably think like the Onion staff, and you might do well to purchase \\"Our Dumb Century.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Fall on the floor funny...a great gift.","review":"If you're looking for a gift for that hard-to-please cousin, try \\"Our Dumb Century\\". I was extremely pleased to receive this book for my birthday and I still revisit its pages nine months later. The book is a revisionist (to say the least) history of the United States in the 20th Century, and though it's obviously played for laughs, there's some definite, oddly compelling critiques of U.S. domestic and foreign policy, not to mention our societal changes. \\"G.I.s pull out of Vietnamese peasant girl, 14\\" may sound crass, but it's a fairly succinct assessment of U.S. involvement in Vietnam. It's also written from a liberal, yet at the same time politcally incorrect, point of view that should somewhat insulate it from charges of partisanship. A great gift for anyone who can read and somewhat understand history."},{"rating":"2","title":"True to its format","review":"A while ago, I heard of theonion.com, I read a couple of their articles and I was simply overwhelmed with laughter, to the point of tears.

I was riding to work in a Madison, Wisconsin city bus.

What follows?\\" It was one of those days in which the sun keeps intermittently hiding under clouds then peeking out. I couldn't think what follows, but the rest of the afternoon took on for me a very peculiar character, and I've been an Onion fan ever since. All this is to say I recommend the book.

There was only 1 or 2 levels that 2 player almost was a must though. I did use a walkthrough guide a few times when I had no idea what to do...just google simpsons game walkthrough Wii and use the 1st choice in the results!

While the comedy put into it by the writers and cast is superb, the game itself is another matter. Remember how graphics looked back in the late 90's? When 3D was still relatively new but anti-aliasing hadn't taken off yet? That's where this game dates visually.

The game play is rough at best with th ecamera shifting all around. The animated sceens look spectacular however once game play starts the visuals decline big time. It's the same run around and punch with Homer for 2 levels and that's when I just quit. I couldn't waste anymore time on a game that was this unappealing. We tried the 2 player split screen but that just enhanced the short-comings of the camera. I would not recommend.

But, I think that's sort of the point. It's a journey where the characters themselves don't matter much. It's a bout the imagination and science to back it up. Basically what I'm getting at is that you have to suspend disbelief a little when it comes to plot, and moving things along but not necessarily with the science or at least the physics. I really enjoyed the concepts in the book.I enjoyed the explanations. it pulls you along and I ended up enjoying it. The grand scale of the book and the digging into time and novel concepts of space travel are very interesting. It tackles some grand questions like will we ever be remembered, can we last forever. What happens at the end of the universe. It's worth a read and the price is good.

There's an incredeble amount of physics, astrophysics and whatever other physics there is in that novel. Baxter tries to explain his highly sophisticated ideas as plain as possible--and still fails. That is not to say that \\"Ring\\" is a bad novel. Even though \\"Ring\\" lacks real characters and emotion (as most SF novels do), the plot is superbly innovative and because of its gigantic scales more than impressive.

His books are not character centered in a traditional sense. Where he forgoes chasing a character's personal development with some clichéd epiphany or self realization somewhere mid-text; he chooses to focus on the science over the fiction. This is the essence of what is called \\"hard sci fi\\". The book covers millions of years and humanity itself becomes the character. It's a fun book with an ambitious timeline and my only wish was that it could have focused more on either the perspective of humanity or science.

Melendez,Chantel Kohl,Chauncey Matthews,Danielle White,Jordan McCoy,Katelyn Tarver,Lucy Hale, Morgan Burke,Taylor Thompson, Tori Thompson). It's an up beat, down to earth & unique type of music.

WELL, listen to the ORIGINAL version of it, sung by S Club 8 more then a year ago. It's way better. The chorus here sounds like the BACKROUND vocals on the S Club 8 version. And these kids aren't THAT talented. They are RUBBISH compared to the kids at Star Search. Chantel Kohl is the only talented one in the group and she didn't even make the band! The American Juniors totally copied S Club 8...Sundown, You are the One and One Step Closer are all covers. Even the CD cover is totally copied. Do yourself a favour and stay far away from this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"a cover song lovers dream","review":"I am disappointed that they couldn't get these kids some new songs.. \\"One Step Closer\\" was originally done by S Club Juniors who are now known as S Club 8.. but S Club 7 never did well over here, so SC8's management, who also happens to be AJ's management, is just recylcing their songs for the kind of American clone of the S Club 8.. just less people.. but whatever.. it wasn't absolutely dreadful"},{"rating":"1","title":"They are not that great","review":"Yes indeed as some Sclub8's fan here has said, One Step Closer was originally a Sclub8 song. When American Juniors sang them, they sounded horrible compare to Sclub8. Also, the song Sundown, it was their new single to be released in London, yet America already sang their song!I must say, American Juniors kids are talented, but not talented enough than Sclub8."},{"rating":"1","title":"UnOriginal","review":"Out of all the vocals, only Lucy's voice was nice. The starting was terrible. Who's singing it?? Sounds like a baby's voice! Totally unoriginal! Stole almost all songs from S Club and S Club 8! None of them, except Lucy, are talented...American Juniors are a total rip-off...American Idol is so damn better..I dun think the group will get any further at all!!.. May they have a windfall! I'd recommend you guys to buy singles/albums from S Club 8 instead of this crap..."},{"rating":"1","title":"STUPIT HORRIBLE KIDS!","review":"American Junoiors was so stupit!

Thank You Nebraska bookstore!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A detailed examination of central Christology","review":"Weinandy's \\"Does God Change?\\" addresses the Christological question of mutability in the divine nature, as is conceptually challenged in the notion of the Word 'becoming' man. Through a comparison with early and later Fathers of both East and West (though predominantly the latter), as well as with several modern thinkers, Weinandy examines in great detail the manner in which the 'becoming' of the Incarnation need not -and in fact does not- require 'change' in the divine nature of God; and in the process, the book definitively refutes several of the most common modern-day Christological errors on this front. Exceptionally dense in places, this book requires some level of academic familiarity with the field in order to be read effectively; but for those in the field, it is an extremely helpful text."},{"rating":"1","title":"You got Warhammer in my LOTR!","review":"Or, rather, \\"You got Warhammer fanwank in my LOTR!\\"I liked the concept, but the execution seems lackluster. The characters don't seem to have acutal personalities; the main characters, who are supposed to be going through some radical changes in their mindsets, seem to be following scripting directions instead of actually coming to their own decisions during the course of the story.For some reason, the three seperate \\"books\\" in Grunts all seem to be paced like they were meant to be published seperately. Note how the characters are all being introduced to the reader at the start of each of the three sections, as if the reader hadn't been paying attention for a few months between turning the pages.The rather lurid sex scene was, I thought, out of place for what came across as an otherwise fairly light-hearted fantasy comedy.Summary: Interesting theme, dull story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cover is the Best Part","review":"Was really hoping for better. Calling it satire unfairly besmirches the term satire. It's just a very juvenile effort, maybe something that might have been written by Beavis & Butthead if they were slightly more literate, or maybe a National Lampoon dropout. If a confused and slow storyline, and descriptions of Orc sex are what you are looking for, then this is for you. Kept reading thinking that it surely had to get better but never did. Don't say I didn't warn you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like some other reviewers said...good concept, but a boring read","review":"Painful read...boring and slow. I tried to finish this fast because I don't like leaving books unfinished but I just couldn't read more than a few pages at a time before I became to bored to continue. At no point did I feel remotely interested in the plot, characters or outcome.Disappointing because I like Orcs being portrayed differently to their usual cliched roles. I think a much better book with Orcs as the main characters is Stan Nicholl's Orcs trilogy. I read the omnibus edition with all 3 books in one and enjoyed it.Unfortunately that didn't have Orcs with guns. If thats important to you, there are Warhammer 40K \\"Orks\\" to check out =)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored Now","review":"I borrowed this from my cousin, along with the warning that he'd only made it half way through the book. I didn't believe him when he said that I wouldn't be able to finish it, but I too only managed to get halfway through before I stopped and realized that I was incredibly bored. I found myself wondering exactly what the point of the book was, and exactly when it was going to be made. Generally, I always try to finish what I am reading, even if I don't like it. There are only a few that I've had to give up on. This happens to be one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank goodness I only borrowed it.","review":"From the cheesy, comic book cover, to the disgusting descriptions of murders and bad habits, this book must rate as one of the worst I've picked up in years.

Was it supposed to be funny? Was it supposed to make a point? I couldn't tell, because the characters were stale and flat, the situations confusing and the resolutions unsatisfying. They should use this book as a tool to teach people how not to write fantasy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grunts","review":"This has to be the worst book I have tried to read. Murderous, foul-mouthed, disgusting and cannibalistic characters did not make this enjoyable in the least. I found nothing humorous in this book. Stay away! If I could I would rate this -10."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book.","review":"I thought this book to be a wonderfully different approach to fantasy. Told from the bad guys perspective, it was really refreshing to hear how things worked from the eyes of those perennial losers ...the orcs. Nine tenths of this book was great. Good storyline, good characters, witty...My only complaint was the futuristic aspect (marine weapons) although, to be sure, it DID add a lot of humor....other than that, I loved it"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Stake Through the Heart","review":"Anyone who has read sci-fi and fantasy has run into one (or one hundred) too many bad Tolkien knock-offs. Usually the ones that have reviews on the back along the lines of \\"A bold new fantasy in the tradition of The Lord of the Rings\\".This shambling undead corpus of lousy fantasy deserved a stake through the heart and garlic stuffing. Terry Pratchett provided this service to the quasi-McCaffery and pseudo-Lieber genre in the first two Discworld books. Mary Gentle does much the same to crappy Tolkien knock-offs with \\"Grunts\\". It dismembers the cliches, worries the carcass for a while, and buries what's left.The language is bawdy. The humor is often coarse. But it's funny as hell."},{"rating":"2","title":"A cool 20th century twist on a Tolkienesque fantasy","review":"I was in the infantry when I read this book. It was engaging, funny and remarkably accurate in a lot of ways. The only thing that seemed odd to me was that the marine sergeant seemed to promise a thicker plot without delivering. And the M-60 medium machine gun is belt-fed by the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it !! As a former Marine this is a breath of fresh air","review":"I've seen and read a lot of fantasy and science fiction. This is one of the best. Funny, very witty with a lot of well placed humor that will leave your sides aching from laughter. This novel is strikingly similar to what happens when a fantasy roleplaying gamemaster logs in great detail the events of a campaign. It has crude humor and some very subtle twists that make the novel unpredictable and exciting. As a former combat Marine, I can only wish that we had had that much leeway and creative liscence while at war. A lot of the characters are very realistically based on several types of personality that any marine would recognixe from recruit to gunnery sergeant. If ever I can send mail or email to Mary Gentle I would commend her fresh approach to fantasy. This is a MUST read for any soldier with a sense of humor and a taste for fantasy. I wish you well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top-notch, puns-in-your-face, humor!","review":"For once, someone who refuses to dwell on fantasy stereotypes. This book was just ridiculous enough for the humor to really seep through. It is a true side-splitting rollercoaster ride. As a side note, anyone who plays Warhammer 40K or Gorka Morka will recognize these boyz!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"2 and a 1/2 stars","review":"Wow.. What to say about this book..It has a great premise. How fun could it be to give a bunch of Orces modern day weapons and let them run amok?Sounds great doesn't it?That is what I thought also, sadly the book isn't very good.The author blew a great chance at having a killer book but sadly it just didn't live up to its promise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting","review":"Poorly written and rambling, with an inconsistent tone and a sense of humor that makes me worry about those who have enjoyed it. I have read a lot of military fantasy, a lot of fantasy satire and some dark humor, but this was the first book that I ever intentionally threw away rather than sell back to a bookstore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heres Hoping for a Sequel!","review":"FINALY!! - We get to see the world from grunts point of view, fantasy meets futuretech, this book is Unique!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Garbage","review":"One star, only because there's nothing lowerNot necessarily the worst book I've ever read, but a close second. The book attempts to be humorous, and misses the mark. Along the way it misses numerous opportunities for some pretty good gags. The little humor that is to be found is completely marred by graphic, disgusting, gratuitous and explicitly pornographic violence. The author should be nominated for the Saddam Hussein award for subtlety. Unnecessary examples include a pair of thieves who have a lot of potential for fun in the book, but early on rob a house and and in excruciating detail literally paint the walls with the victim family. The consistent protagonist would be a good comic antihero, but again, the image is sickly distorted by graphic descriptions of murder by rape and necrophilia. If this is supposed to be entertaining, then I sincerely hope the author is seeking therapy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fun to Read","review":"Well, I already reviewed this book, but somehow that review never got posted, and since I'm to lazy to rewrite the whole thing, here're the basics.--Great fun to read (great humor and lots of action, especially for fantasy and military fans)--C(h)ock full of adult content and situations and language--Borrowed lots from movie \\"Aliens\\"--Lost my interest in middle of book 3--Recommended"},{"rating":"1","title":"one of the worst I have ever attemted to read","review":"In all the years I have been reading ( around 25) I have only thrown away 5 books.

I thought it would be great because it folded away easily to conserve on space; the problem is that it folds TOO easily. Once they enter the hut it collapses on top of them if they touch the sides. It doesn't have a bottom so the slightest little bump will cause it to fold up...which isn't really dangerous because it's so lite-weight, but I spend most of my time re-expanding it when they do play with it...I think that it would have been better to get a ball pit and just leave the balls out (or in if you want to clean up dozens of balls everyday)...that way there is a bottom to support the tent.

There are many compelling findings and arguments presented. I especially appreciate hearing and seeing scientific data presented without having evolution shoved down my throat every other minute.

With the possible exception of 'Over My Dead Body' I can't think of anything 'Wolfe' that I wouldn't give five stars. (Just didn't like the guest characters and the story in that one.)What is there to criticize about Rex Stout's intriguing creation? The depth of Wolfe's personality and genius combined with Archie's quick wit and willingness to put up with that personality and genius makes for a delightful read.

The music, the artificial moon on the water, the drum the rise and fall of the oar heads.And besides that, nobody ever looked better in a Roman helmet than Henry Wilcoxen.

That is what \\"breakout\\" collections (like the 2LP Capitol set, \\"The Best Of The Stan Freberg Shows\\") are for. If you like what you hear on the \\"best of\\" collections, odds are you'll love the complete shows that those bits came from. And they're all here on these two volumes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"The original programs spoil any attempt to listen to break outs.

The picture quality is excellent with 5MP. The scene selections give lovely shots, specially the ''candles'' selection. Outside pictures are just great. Whenever I send some pictures to my parents overseas, they are like ''wow'' because of the clear, sharp, and high quality. Thanks very much Olympus Stylus500"},{"rating":"1","title":"too fragile","review":"I would NOT recommend buying this camera. It's nice enough, but it's WAY too fragile. I dropped mine the first day I had it (not hard, and not so that it left a mark), and the lens cover no longer opened. This because te lens cover slides into the body of the camera, and the tolerance is so small that any little ding can prevent the cover from sliding cleanly. I was able to \\"fix\\" it by gently squeezing the body of the camera (again, with no detectable bending of anything, emphasizing the very small tolerance of the fittings), but that didn't last. I'm going to look for something sturdier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy This Camera","review":"This is not a good camera. When I bought mine (directly from the factory)I was excited because the reviews all raved about its excellency, but this camera failed to perform. When I first took it out, the camera was already broken so I returned it. I got another one but that one was broken too. When I finally got one that worked, it didn't take good pictures and was very fragile. Don't waste your money on this camera, buy something worth its money like the Canon Powershot S80. I now own this camera and it is way better for a lower price. It has 8 meagpixels!! But that not being on the subject of this camera I will stop talking about it. If you are looking for a camera, don't buy this one for it does not live up to our modern-day standards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from Olympus","review":"I regret having to give this camera even \\"1\\" star. I see someone else below has had the same problem as me. It is a cheap camera case and Olympus will not stand behind their warranty.

Olympus is a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted < 4 months","review":"Stay away from this camera. It lasted < 4 months and Olympus did not honor their \\"warranty\\".

Beautifully presented book with unusual editorial and stylising quirks in its presentation. If you are looking for a book that will give you meaty information on Iman and her outlook on life, this is not the one. There is some detail about her early life, but then it explodes into pictures and interviews and different short pieces on the essence of being black and fashion etc. To be honest, most of the subject matter is merely flirted with rather than explored.The pictures and photographs are amazing and it is a great pictorical legacy for the supermodel that is Iman.It is a book you will read cover to cover in 2 hours - and something you can go back to, and flick through it again.But I'm sorry to say I didn't think there was much substance"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Am Iman","review":"All pictures - few words.

When I used what little of the product was left in the bottles, my hair felt stripped and VERY damaged! This was not the experience I had with the same product that I had purchased from the salon.

The excitement was short lived. Unfortunately I found the book out of date. I am using AutoCAD 2000i. This book is a reference for R12-14. The command buttons and dialog windows are different from R2000i. The tutorials used are similar to other CAD books. The emphasis is on learning specific commands. There is no reference to theatre drafting until the later chapters. It would be great if the book had screen shots of the drafting exercises, so you can reference to what you are drawing. A rethink of the exercise headings is needed, from Excerise 1- Printing a file to EX #1- Drawing a flat. Students need to relate the use of CAD to theatre drafting early on. The book comes with a useful CD-Rom of sample files and an instrument library. Overall, I Think Mr. Decuir has good start for a book. I hope the both of us can keep up with changes that Autodesk will introduce in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough variation","review":"Although the video was easy to follow, there was no variation between the segments. The 10 minute segments were basically the same. I was looking for a quick video that I can do in the morning but it seemed that I spent most of the time warming up and stretching and then continuing with the same moves. If you are at all experienced and are looking for a quick targeted workout this is not the video for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the old VHS Tape","review":"I was disappointed.

It is not the same. It has baically the same 15 minute excercises for the abs three times in a row. I really would not recommend this DVD for toning the Abs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for a quick workout","review":"This is split up into two different videos. It's 6-15 minute workouts. 3 of them are an abs/arms workout, 3 are lower body. You'll need weights for the arms, and a towel for the lower body. The workouts are pretty easy and quick. It's beginer stuff. I do these on my off-days, or when I'm short on time. And sometimes I'll do several of them at a time. Sometimes you can see Tamilee's nether regions, but other than that, I like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exercise video for people who really aren't serious","review":"This video is broken into six 10-minute sections. Who in their right mind would work out for only 10 minutes? This is not going to accomplish anything. Well, you think I'll just do all of the workouts one right after the other. This is silly too, because each 10 minute segment includes a warmup, small workout routine, and stretches.

I'm usually in a size 11 or 12, so I ordered a 12. While my feet are pretty wide, I've never had to purchase wide shoes.These shoes were incredibly tight. They were long by about an inch, but the width was unbearably constricted. They reminded me of squeezing on a pair of tight rock-climbing boots -- I really had to squish to get my feet in.The result was so uncomfortable, these are going back. I wouldn't have expected this from 'slip-on' shoes. It gets a two instead of a one since the quality appears great."},{"rating":"1","title":"a little disappointed","review":"This product arrived and looked beautiful. However, if you're actually going to use the tea kettle and not just have it for display, you have to go through this process of removing all the wooden pieces and placing it in a large pot of boiling water and baking soda to remove the lacquer film. I had to do this process twice and still had problems removing it. Even after removing the film, the kettle becomes discolored when you heat water in it. While the price is very attractive compared to other copper kettles I've seen, the old saying of \\"you get what you pay for\\" probably applies here.

White drove before the ovals were paved, and seems as comfortable on dirt tracks and on the road to the next race as anywhere in the world. Along the way, readers will learn as much about the stock car racing sport as readers of \\"Seabiscuit\\" found out about the life of the jockey and the history of the horse racing sport. This is a very enjoyable book with delightful accounts of team high jinks throughout the story and enough historical material to keep NASCAR fans arguing for years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give credit where it is due","review":"I want to love this book, it has a lot of great stories and incredible pictures. This came in the same day i received a book from R.I. Page, and the two can not be more different. Yet both have their place in the Runic studies, and im not one to completely dismiss all perspectives that are not conservative or completely historical.Yet one thing gives this such a low review, and for soon to be obvious reasons this is highly offensive. The story of the Rune Sowillo, is a complete rip off of the Celtic story of the God Lugh!! They did not even try to change it, it is almost verbatim taken from Celtic mythology, and they in no part of the book admit to this. This should be a criminal offense, and i hope they are reading this and recognize that they need to give credit where it is due. I wonder how many of the other stories were completely ripped off from other myths!:lugh:"},{"rating":"2","title":"Michener for everyone!","review":"Wonderfully quick historical fiction about early American History and the framing of the US Constitution.

He never got into trouble or anything. This was a struggle for me, even though I read many books. In my personal opinion, this wasn't even a decent book. I strongly reccommend getting another book by this man, because he has other, greater works. The length of this book doesn't even count for a chapter in any of his longer books."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book will not add to Michener's literary legacy","review":"This book was not one of his best attempts. It was barely even an attempt. I have read almost all of his novels and with the sole exception of \\"Iberia\\" I liked this the least.

My nine year old stepson is around people that dip REAL tobacco in similar packaging. Therefore, he idolizes this as a way to mock the older guys and their bad habit.

When we inquired about the jerky, he said it was not to eat but to \\"put in your mouth and suck the juice\\". He even packed it like grown men do their tobacco chew. Granted, a child will absorb what he sees around him but I feel the packaging makes it look too much like a child's version of adult chew; reminds me of the candy cigarettes.

THe Led Zeppelin cover is one of the best covered version of any Zep song and at nearly 10 minutes it does do justice to the original. THose of you in the mood for some stompin' hard rock get this. THe only reason it does not get 5 stars is the production could have been better, but it sounds like Gilby was going for a \\"garage\\" type feel. THe best songs on this great CD are: Girl You Turn Me On, Shrinking Violet, Barbed Wire, I'll Be There, Decide,It's Hard,How Many More Times......GO GET THIS NOW! AND ROCK ON!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Without Phil, its just not L.A.Guns","review":"If your an L.A.Guns fan like I am then you would be just as dissapointed as I was when I recieved this album. Without Phil there is no L.A.Guns wether you'd like to admitt it or not. In this album they tried to revert back to the days of there Self-Titled debut and leave the Heavy Metal scene that they tried on the American Hardcore album, but without Phil it just didnt work. Jizzy Pearl and the rest of the band were off-sync and the sound production was horrible, it sounded like they just recorded a few demos and crammed it into the album without any mixing or anything. I only recommend this album if your a true L.A.Guns fan like I am."},{"rating":"1","title":"mediocre \\"smooth jazz\\"","review":"This is a mediocre (at best) smooth jazz rendition of 14 holiday classics. I could not even listen to it once. I heard half a minute or so of each track, heard that it was more of the same bland smooth sax and electric piano, and hit skip until I got to the end. Then I took it out of my CD player and promptly got rid of it. Even if you like Christmas music, don't bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Feel Good! Oh So Good!","review":"I hear the title of this review at LEAST twenty times a day. My son is in love with the Backyardigans and I couldn't be happier at that fact. Great cartoon and great doll.

She cried evertime I put her in it. I got a Hotsling instead and she is very happy in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"comfortable but confusing","review":"We registered for this carrier for our second child. It is so much more comfortable than the snugli I used with my daughter 4 years ago (but that was 4 years ago, I'm sure they make them different now. My son loves to use it when we go shopping, for a walk and it makes house work easier when he wants to be held all day (my husband laughs when he sees me vaccuming with our son attached to be via the carrier). But I only gave it four stars not five because all of the buckles and straps can be confusing, espeacially if you out running arrands (with no instruction booklet handy)and your child no longer wants to face you and wants to look at the world around him. He just had to stare at mommy the rest of the outing. But with the instructions and a little time to spare you can learn the 'in and outs' of this carrier and love it as much as we have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never even got to try it out","review":"I purchased this carrier when my daughter was about 3 months old. I couldn't even get through the trying on process with her. I found it very difficult to manuver the plastic slide latches on the side. I think that it is very hard to slide it together with a moving baby. And my daughter hated the very small and cramped arm holes. I ended up with the \\"6 Position\\" chest carrier made by Infantino. Babies'R'Us doesn't carry this brand, but I got mine at Walmart. It was very soft, and has many different options. And there is plenty of room for little arms."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this carrier","review":"I bought this carrier not knowing how my son who is seven weeks old would take to it. I was sceptical at first but then he got sick and refused to be put down. It was really hard to hold him and do my cleaning around my house or to go out in public with out him screaming so I broke down and bought it.It is very comfortable and helped my posture and he loves being in it. My fiance and I both wear it comfortably and would recommend this carrier to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practice using it first!","review":"I really liked the Snugli once I figured out how to use it and use it the right way! At first it looked like a crazy contraption and I tried putting it on a few times without my son in it. The first time I actually tried to put him in it I could have used some help.It's fairly easy now that I know how to use it. The easiest way is to put it on you, sit down, and then try to get baby in it. Same goes when you're getting baby out, although sometimes hard to do in the car!We haven't tried it on our back yet. I think my son is still a little small for that. But that was the main reason I chose this one over the Baby Bjorn (which I think is only a front carrier and 3 times the price).Overall, we're satisfied with it and our son enjoys being able to look around and move a little instead of being stuck in his travel system seat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It!!","review":"I love this Snuggli. I use it about everyday. My daughter is now 3 months, and she absolutely loves it. I find that it is the most useful when I go to the grocery store, or Target -- some place that I have a cart and can but the diaper bag in it. My daughter just falls asleep. I think it is very comfortable. The only negative is that is has a lot of straps; I did not want to use it at first because I felt that it was such a hastle, but I have gotten used to it, and now love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this carrier","review":"I knew I needed a carrier that would work on both the front and back. I found this at K-mart and we love it. We had a simple one-piece cloth carrier that my son hated and it didn't fit my husband. It was complicated to get on as well. With the snugli, we didn't have any of those problems. My son loves to be facing out so we used that one most often, but the backpack is the way to go while cooking or doing other things that make having a baby in front difficult. My husband is 6'4\\" and 280 lbs and it fits him just fine!Buy it and you wont regret it.!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad fit for us","review":"I was given a gift certificate to use toward a Baby Bjorn, but I decided to save some money and get a Snugli. By the time I figured out the straps (it took two people!), my son was quite annoyed. Once we put him in it, he looked awkward and uncomfortable in it, like the back was too high and flappy. I felt like I needed to hold my baby up. I thought it would save time when going to the mall, but by the time I got it on, I was frustrated and ready to go home.My advice: Try on both the Snugli and Baby Bjorn BEFORE you buy. The Snugli was a bad fit for both me and my son. The Bjorn was a much better fit for us. I you want a Bjorn, try EBay. I got a like-new Baby Bjorn for $40."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have tried to use this carrier a dozen times, but to no avail. My good-natured son cries and cries in what seems to be discomfort. Though he's only 11 lbs, my shoulders ache after having him in it for only minutes--I guess the straps are not padded enough. I thought I would be saving money by purchasing a Snugli instead of a Baby Bjorn! I gave it two stars because it was easy to set up and it positions nicely--just didn't work out for us. I recommend trying it out at the store before purchasing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"My daughter loves hanging out with me in her Snugli! I take her on walks, because it's nice to carry a 12lb. weight. It's great for hands free grocery shopping and light housework, like folding clothes. The straps are comfortable, once you get the adjusted to your needs, and there is plenty of support."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Carrier!","review":"I, too, had a little frustration getting the straps all set up...I'm just not patient when it comes to reading directions. The first time I used it...I thought there would be no way I could ever get my baby in it when I was alone. Needless to say, the 2nd time I gave it a shot, I was able to get her in no problem. My husband and I aren't skinny people, and the lumbar strap wasn't big enough for us. I had my mom...QUEEN of the fanny packs...check her collection and she found a strap that we could extend it...so it all worked great! My 2 month old is very comfortable in the rear facing position and sleeps the entire time we are walking! Works better than pushing a stroller when walking a dog, too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many straps","review":"I purchased this for our 6 month old, adopted son. He is a stocky boy but well within the stated limits. I read the directions and fastened the multitude of straps. That was a task in itself.I tried to put him in (not easy alone!) only too realize he was too big to be comfortable.I went back and exchanged it for a nojo baby sling, which is much easier to use alone and does very well in accomodating our(not so little) guy."},{"rating":"2","title":"for mommy and dady","review":"I like this prooduct very much. My 11 weeks old baby fits in it very good. He likes to be close to me, so it is very good that I don't have to hold his 14 lb. I love it, and my husband likes it as well. and u can adjust his seat depending on his clothing( he can wear snowsuit and still fits in the carrier)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stylish But...","review":"Bought this elsewhere and am now browsing for alternatives. Was looking for the next step up from my soft newborn carrier. This one seemed very sturdy and stylish, and the color was great for one who hates all of the cutesy and/or navy blue baby stuff from which we are normally forced to choose. However, I was heartbroken to find it tough to use with my six month old - hard to believe that she would already be too big to make doing up the side closures practical, but that seemed to be the case (despite what Snugli's specs claimed), so hated to waste the money. I'm thinking of getting someone to custom design me one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The amazing changing carrier","review":"Great carrier. I had put the fisher-price carrier on my registry. When I got it, it killed my neck and back. I returned it for this one and have had no troubles!! My back doesn't hurt nor my neck. It distributes the weight pretty evenly (my little guy is 18lbs.). IT'll take you a few tries before you know all the straps but once you got it it's not a problem. Also it converts as your baby grows so you'll have it for a while. For the asking price it's a steal!!! Only thing I've encountered is one of my shoulder straps keeps sliding , but I don't know if it's something I'm doing wrong or the carrier. But that's it! BUy it, you'll love it to."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time and money!","review":"I was hesitant to buy this product since I had a different Snugli and didn't like that one. I bought it anyway to give it second chance. What a waste of time and money!!! My son's legs kept turning blue when he was in it! He was so uncomfortable in it and besides the fact that it was cumbersome to put on, it killed my shoulders! The waist band feature is a joke--it offers no relief and after even 5 minutes of wearing it, I had to take it off. Also, not a summer item--VERY HOT wearing it outside. I returned it and found a WONDERFUL product from Canada called the First Journey. This is an amazing product and after three clicks, you are set to go. It costs more (about or less than the Baby Bjorn) and super comfortable--no should pain at all and my baby loves it. Look up babytrekker.com and check it out! I'm so glad I researched more--it paid off."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Comfortable","review":"We were told that the Baby Bjorn was the way to go by a friend, but decided we didn't want to spend that amount of money on a carrier. Well I can't imagine that the Bjorn is any better than this one. With the support straps around the waist and across the back, it's very comfortable to wear and our daughter just loves to watch the world come at her when she's on my chest facing forward."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby hates it","review":"We got this from our friends who swear it works fine and is a lot cheaper than the baby bjorn. Well my son hated it! He just didn't sit right in it, facing in or out. We finally spurlged for the Nicole Miller one, and it is sooo much better. And is better looking. The snugli is so complicated to use. Trust me, the baby bjorn or Nicole Miller are worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this, Love this, Love this!!!","review":"What else can I say? From day one it has helped put my son to sleep if he was fussing, allowed me to go shopping since it kept him close to me and made him feel comforted, and is just basically useful. An absolute must for your infant and/or a perfect shower gift. The new mother will be thanking you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You've Got To Be Kidding Me!","review":"I had read the great reviews and registered for the Snugli. I was so excited to try this with my daughter, but was quickly discouraged. I adjusted it according to the directions, but it still really wasn't comfortable and getting a squirmy newborn in the seat is another project! I tried this several times making different adjustments with my husband's help, but was not satisfied. I should have known it was going to be a hassle when reading the reviews that basically restated how to adjust all the straps. I eventually returned the Snugli and purchased the Premaxx sling. One slip over my head and baby is in-no clips and no need for an extra set of hands. I definitely recommend taking the different carriers out of their boxes and trying them on before purchasing or registering for one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Investment","review":"I am very happy with this baby sling. It's a little intimidating at first because of all the straps, and I had to have my husband help me adjust it to fit. But all the straps make for a very secure fit.My newborn is very comfortable in this sling. She gets to lay close to me. We tested this out by going to the mall. The whole time baby slept comfortably and not once did my back start hurting. I was very comfortable the entire time and both baby and I felt secure.For me the sling is less trouble than a stroller at this point and has been a nice option.I would recommend this sling. Just be sure to have someone help the first time adjusting it to your body."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go with the Better Brand!!","review":"I registered for the this carrier because I didn't want to ask for the expensive Baby Bjorn carrier but I wish I had asked for that one. This carrier is not easy to minipulate and put on there are far too many buckles and straps. The material is very scratchy and every time I have attempted to put my baby in it he got upset and was very uncomfortable. My sister who has a Baby Bjorn uses it every day. Her baby loves it and is very comfortable because it's made out of soft material, it doesn't have a bunch of straps dangling around, and it is so simple to use. If I could go back I would have registered for the baby bjorn instead of the cumbersome Snugli."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossible to put on alone","review":"This product looks great but it's not worth purchasing for Moms / Dads who are home alone as it's very difficult to snap buckles on the back and get baby into the carrier. I've tried multiple ways of getting the baby in the carrier and it's very inconvenient. In fact, I've not used the Snugli because it's too cumbersome to put on. Before purchasing, be sure to try this product out at a baby store (preferably with baby) so you can see if it will work for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes shopping easy!!","review":"I bought this carrier when my baby was a month old,she's not crazy about her stroller because she can't see me so this was my only other option.When we had our first outing at the mall I carried her in the carrier and she loved it!She was able to look around and still feel secure that I was right there.My baby was so comfortable that she eventually fell asleep.It'll remain one of my fondest memories of her as a baby.She's a big baby though(16 pounds @3 months old) and I don't know how much longer I'll be able to carry her around comfortably!But I do recommend this carrier."},{"rating":"1","title":"beware of the less expensive Snugli carrier","review":"We received this Snugli carrier as a gift. We are first time parents and just focused on the price compared to Baby Bjorn. What could be so much better, right? Well first when our baby was a newborn she did not like how long it took to get her into the carrier. It was very frustrating trying to hold her and get the carrier fastened up. Plus another thing we forgot to consider is how it fits us. I can't use it and my husband barely can. He wears a size M or L shirt. I highly recommend trying them on in the store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many straps","review":"When I put this carrier on, I felt like I was going backpacking in the Amazon or something. It was uncomfortable and I just couldn't take having to adjust all those straps. The material is a bit rough too. My husband is tall and bigger, and after I finally had the carrier adjusted to me, he then had to readjust it for himself. We ended up trying many different carriers on at Target and the most comfortable one was the Bjorn...Sad to say, because it's so $$$. We ended up returning this one and getting a used Bjorn on EBAY. When I got it, it looked practically new. You don't use a carrier for very long and so getting the used one and it being the BEST and most comfortable... I was thrilled with my ebay purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great product - if you like screaming!","review":"Whoever \\"designed\\" this product, in their infinite wisdom, didn't include a width adjustment for the baby.

I used it on an M&P-15T;, as every round is fired one or both legs slowly goes down ,it just don't stay put! I even crank it down with a wrench and it stills moves.UTG Low-Profile Deluxe Bipod it will make you very happy with a .22lr platform. So for me its going back on the M&P; 15-22.

Do not use either for for real weapons that have any actual recoil, or you will be picking pieces up off the ground.

The first 3 were fine, however my last order of 2 bipods was problematic. The screw hole used to attach the threaded mount to the rifle were not drilled perpendicular to the cylinder of the threaded mount, which created an uneven surface, resulting in an inability to use it to mount the bipod to any rifle.

The bipod I received twists about the yaw axis when simply folding and unfolding the bipod's spring assisted legs. I called the customer service number provided on the packaging and my call was routed to CHINA!!!

I have done this several times in the past and had to sell them! The final piece of my current AR build was the bi-pod. I used to have a Harris bi-pod in past AR's, and I really loved them. I took the cut in price expecting a cut in quality, but I was wrong. The bipod mounts tight and is well constructed. My favorite part of this bi-pod is the sled legs that takes a lot of stress off the bi-pod. I put over 300 rounds through the AR at the range and the bi-pod worked perfectly.Pros- solid construction- sled feet on the legs- all parts internal, no showing springs or parts to break- Looks awesome- adjustable legs- will support an AR with 30 rd clip without clip hitting ground.Cons- bi-pod is not spring loaded (you have to deploy on your own)Fantastic value for the price. UTG makes some awesome products for less then half the price of \\"quality\\" producers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bipod for Price","review":"I put this on a 30-6 and will be testing it within the next month.

I'm glad that I did. While it is not as solid as some of the more expensive bipods I've checked out, it is in no way \\"flimsy\\". The buttons to swing the legs operate just fine. I was most concerned about the clearance. I have included a photo with a tape measure to show the height. There is sufficient height to accommodate my 25-round magazine. Overall, I think that it is a great buy for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"About what you'd expect for the price","review":"Bought this as a value-appropriate solution for a S&W; 15-22. However, the reality of its lack of stoutness is not even suitable as legs for a .22LR, at least one that anyone plans on shooting. Way too much play at the leg pivot points makes for a surprisingly unstable sighting platform even on the most stable ground/bench surface, plus the thing rattles too much for its own good. The collar-type leg locks get fouled up too easily with dirt, the aluminum construction--though nice in its lightness--damages far too easily, and the overall fit and finish seems marginal even with the price factored in. The one good thing is that its legs extend long enough to allow clearance for a full-sized magazine, but that's about it. Frankly, this bipod's probably best for a static display piece rather than for any sort of field or even indoor range work.Guess going cheap wasn't the best choice for a quality shooting experience. Live and learn (sigh)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Bipod and does the job","review":"Looking at many of the bipods I looked at the ratings and found conflicting information.

As the O-ring wears out over time and repeated use, the bolt that holds it together requires more tightening.I had to replace the O-ring with a Bellville Washer.Other than this, the \\"posi lock\\" works as it should locking the legs in place to prevent unwanted deployment and also stays locked in place during use.The spring loaded legs have a very hard spring and their locking mechanism is also reliable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Solid Bipod","review":"I have used several different bipods over the years and this one is hands down my favorite.

I'm not into being a tactical Rambo, and I don't need to spend a lot of money for something that I don't need very often. This is worth the money and unless you are in combat or a sniper, I doubt you will need anything sturdier than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great price to value","review":"For the price you cannot beat this bipod.

I originally ordered the BT model 98 bipod, but returned it once I saw it. It was too short for the M4, and the exposed springs looked to me like they would be a failure point after rough use.The UTG bipod comes with the barest of manuals. It took me a little while to figure out how to fold and unfold the legs. There is a locking button on each leg. You have to push it down (that is, toward the ground), not in, to swing the leg out. The leg length is set by unscrewing the knurled section, which allows the lower part of the leg to slide up into the upper part. Once the length is properly set, tighten the knurled section firmly--the leg will stay set even if slammed down on the ground.This bipod gets the job done, and looks as if it can take some abuse and keep on functioning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent bi-pod for the price","review":"Excellent, simple bi-pod for the price.

After careful research, the Canon seemed to fit the bill. And it does. I've not had it very long but it was very easy to setup - once you got all the shipping tape off!! Installing the print head and cartridges was a snap. All in all, it took about half an hour. As for using it, the printing is very quick and incredibly quiet. Have not yet scanned anything or printed any photos, but so far it looks like I made a wise purchase. And I couldn't beat the price!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than HP!","review":"This is my first Canon printer. Previously I owned several HP InkJet printers and one HP PhotoSmart printer. The Canon is leaps and bounds above HP. The main reason is that I have not had one single issue with it. It's smooth, quiet, prints beautifully. I like the separate ink tanks. I'm on here to buy a black replacement, which the printer kindly let me know was low. With HP, I always had issues with my PC not recognizing the printer and having to unconnect it, reconnect it, etc. I've owned this printer for about 6 months and am very pleased so far. It was a great deal at the $219.99 I paid. The copier and scanner work fantastically, too. The quality of the color copies is amazing -- especially considering how fast it copies and prints. It's so easy to be able to make a quick color copy of something rather than having to scan it in, then print it out. This printer is a great addition to any home office."},{"rating":"2","title":"So quiet!","review":"We've had this printer for over a month now and I've printed, scanned, copied with no problems and/or issues. I can't believe how quiet the printer is which is a good thing since I do a lot of late night project printing in the middle of the night when my kids are asleep.I've used the direct usb connection to my Canon camera and it was simple to print out 4X6's.Still haven't had to replace any ink cartridges even after printing out over 4 dozen 4X6 pictures and a couple of 8X10's.For the price, it's a fantastic buy and I highly recommend it!As an additional note, I've used HP, Canon, and Epson glossy photo paper and the Canon paper sample you receive with purchase had the best looking prints."},{"rating":"2","title":"Printer setup","review":"Pixma was easiest printer ever purchased, to set up and get started.

In this second to the last fiction book of the series the siblings face a series of important questions. These questions make them realize that they might have hit a dead end. Faced with conflicting decisions as they watch things fall apart around them. This is not looking to good for the orphans.This book was definitely near the top of my list of best books. This is because of the conflicting emotions. Everything seems to be falling apart around the Baudelaires. The decisions they make are extremely important. I really like the twist in the story throughout series. I can't wait for the next book to come out since it is last book. Coincidentally, it is book number 13. This book is definitely one of the best books I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Penultimate Peril","review":"This is a great book for kids. I even enjoyed it. Mr. Snicket perserveres in his self-designated task of chronicling the lives of the Baudelaire orphans. Some might ask, \\"to what end\\", and I assume we shall at least have the flavor of it after book 13. Book 12 manages to promote more mysteries than it solves - mysteries of the Baudelaire's, the VFD, the schism, and real-life mysteries such as those one might come across in certain cultural organizations known to exist since the evolution of the organism. All of this does well in the promotion of thought and research. I tend to keep a dictionary close by - not only because I enjoy reading them, but because it seems that Mr. Snicket enjoys encouraging his readers to use them.

Violet is the oldest one in the group who has to look out for the other two to make sure that they don't get into any trouble or get lost.

I can, however, find cognizance with the moral of the story that sometimes people you think you are close to, fail you with their \\"nobleness\\" or lack of guts! That you have to find strength in yourself to fight your own wars and that a family has an important part to play when you're struggling through your live. I think the gist of the story is that that the three children find succor in each other - almost a live force driven by love, that protects them and eventually helps to extricate them from impossible situations!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didnt LIVE UP TO MY EXPECTATIONS","review":"This book was not as entertaining as other books i have read from this series.

By FILLER, dear friends, I am referring to words and pages filled with STUFF that gets nowhere and provides nothing for the reader to take with them. All the other books were interesting, funny, thought provoking and fun. #12 was BORING, DULL and an insult to fans as it really feels like no time, energy or thought was put into this novel. ALSO, don't even get me started on the GRAMMER. I'm sorry but you are NOT supposed to begin sentences with BUT or ANDS. Come on...don't you have editors?

I read someone else's review that said this book was just full of \\"stuff\\" and that's exactly how I felt. I felt like each page was just full of nothing. Characters are just thrown in at random points and even the Baudelaires seem rather dull in this one. There were several parts where Snickets wit was wonderful but those parts were too sparse. I hate that I didn't like this book, it just seemed to have no real point.

Will Violet, Klause, and Sunny escape from Count Olaf's clutches? Read on and find out. And brace yourself. The twist at the end of the book was more than I could take. A Great read. Another book I enjoyed recently was the scifi adventure \\"GAAK\\" by Darryl Hughes. Four \\"Goonies\\" like misfit kids defend their small town and the world from invasion by kooky aliens from outer space.

Accompanied by beautiful photographs, including some rare sights in the sky, the book systematically covers atmospheric phenomena related to light and colour. For photographers it's a great book that will help you understand light effects in nature. The book is resplendent in the spirit of science: the topics are classified by the type of explanation for them: shadows, reflection, refraction and so on. This makes perfect, natural sense and really holds the book together. Some of the explanations include modest equations, tables and so on, but the text is always lively and readable. If you're scared of mathematics, buy it for the pictures.

It describes many natural phenomena involving light, including shadows, the color of the sky, clouds, mirages, halos, rainbows, the effects of ice in the atmosphere and much more. The intended audience in my eyes consists mainly of people who like physics but the beautiful color full-page pictures and tips on taking them also make this book a great resource for anyone interested in photography. Even physics students can benefit from this book (although it is intended for laymen, so no equations are used) - the book shows them interesting manifestations of optics in nature.

Why is that we accept bad writing through the use of stereotypes as long as that bad writing is coming from a member of that stereotyped group. All of the subplots were tact on, as if Wilson knowing his play did not have enough substance to sustain itself said \\"Oh crap! I better put more into this!\\". In the end they just add to the mess.

Tax breaks?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could this REALLY be happening?","review":"I think Mark Wahlberg is a capable actor, so I blame Shyamalan for the fact that almost every one of his lines is either a question, or sounds like a question! It's so weird, fake, and annoying. Besides the bad acting on almost everyone's part, the plot is about characters running from a slight breeze. Wahlberg practically looks at the camera at one point and says \\"Could this Really be happening?\\" This really could have been a cool, fun film, but Shyamalan really messed it all up. Perhaps he shouldn't have had so much control over the film (writing, directing, and producing). I have to admit that I did watch it twice, but only because I couldn't believe it was that bad!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great concept","review":"If you've seen any of M.N.S's films than you know that his style is different from any other \\"Hollywood\\" director. Even the acting is more subdued than other movies.What I liked about this film is that there are really two films in one. There is the \\"Happening\\" of nature taking control, and than there is the crazed hermit woman (of which I think is the best part,even acting of this film).So, like it or not, M.N.S. has given us a film in the tradition of other cult films like David Lynch's \\"Blue Velvet\\". So, put aside you're nit pickyness and watch this film for what it is, a new Cult classic. I guess the reason I did'nt give it a 5 star is that the acting at times was not the best I've seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad I now hate his earlier movies!","review":"I have been a fan of M.Night for several years, and thought unbreakable was an outstanding picture.But this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It is not only painfully unintelligent to the point you doubt MNS ever had anything smart to say at all, bit the acting is terrible (possibly because the script is so wooden) and the plot is as as idiotic as ID theory. I mean this movie is actually anti-science! And has the nerve to have a science teacher tell us science is just a \\"theory\\".Trying to pass this atrocious piece of garbage as a B movie is not excusable either, since there are many great B-movies that act the hell out of this, and most have more intelligent stories too.MNS wants me to be afraid of a tree and grass!

So much unbelievable behavior, just stupid, stupid, stupid. I've liked both Mark Walberg & Zooey Deschanel in other things, and they both stunk in this, which I entirely blame on the writing & directing. When you spend a movie constantly yelling at the characters- \\"GET IN THE CAR ALREADY!!\\", etc.- it's not a good sign. When you're actually HOPING that the main characters die, because they're so dumb and annoying and unbelieveable- that's not a good sign either.

It's badly made, badly acted, terribly written and has to go in my top ten worst films ever made.From this point in my life I will never watch an M. Night Shyamalan film ever again.A good director and good writer could have made a masterpiece with $60million - good directors don't even need a tenth of that!Shocking, really shocking and not in a good way! Please don't watch this film however much you might love Zooey Deschanel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, The Horror!!!","review":"This is an open plea to M. Night Shyamalan...please stop making movies until you realize that your perspective has become seriously compromised. Only someone totally wrapped up in their own legend would ignore/not recognize the serious flaws that make this movie a thorough waste. With a plot that strains all credibility, laughable dialogue, wooden performances (way to phone in your roles, Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel), and ridiculous special effects (i.e., the scene with the man in the lion pen), The Happening is a disaster from the opening frame to the ending credits.Others have noted the deterioration in the quality of Shyamalan's movies over the years as his ego has grown. The Happening is the final proof to all but the most devoted Shyamalan fans that his ego has exceeded his talent. While Shyamalan might get great pleasure in watching his movies, he'll soon be the only person watching them if he continues to make movies like The Happening."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Happening by Brandon M.

I thought about buying it, but I rented it, and that was a great decision on my part. I like Mark Wahlberg, but he was awful, and so was John Laquazamo!!

Night Shymalan has gone down hill after that. I can't believe I actually sat through this whole movie. After the village, which was a total disappointment I thought that would be it. With Mark Walberg in it, I thought it had a chance. I will never watch another M. Night Shymalan movie...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Comedy!","review":"If you are looking for a good laugh then I would suggest this film.

You will feel the same way when the army guy in shock of seeing the dead bodies cries out \\"cheese and crackers\\" LOL"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty disappointing","review":"The nothingness of this film was painful. It had amazing promise that just fell flat. The actors were good, except the woman who played Wahlberg's wife was pretty miscast. The storyline and plot were close to horrible. No believable scientific explanations, a vague message of a warning, but really a lot of ambivalence and lack of passion. I was offended at the portrayal of those who lived out in the lonely countryside first as killers and then as insane wicked people. Very narrow-minded view and negative toward people who live in the country. The film neither inspires us nor frightens us. Four of us adults were watching and very often we were laughing out loud when I believe we were supposed to be frightened or horrified. The blah ending was the biggest disappointment of all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cool concept, but poor execution","review":"First off, I am not a M. Night Shyamalan hater. I really loved The Sixth Sense and I enjoyed Unbreakable and Signs. The Village was average at best and Lady in the Water was pretty awful. The Happening couldn't be his third bad movie in a row, right? I'm sorry to say that this is one of worst movies I have seen this year and I've see a lot. The concept is neat and there are some creepy elements early on, but it just gets worse as it goes along. The acting is very bad from almost everyone involved and the dialogue makes things even worse. I just don't know what is going on with this once promising director. I'm glad I listened to the critic's reviews and waited for this one to hit DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too Deep For Most","review":"Up front I have to admit that the acting in this film was HORRIBLE. Now, getting past that, the story was an awesome blend of traditional sci-fi pulp and modern story-telling. The complexity of the story did not transfer well to the big screen, however. This would probably have been a bigger cult hit if it had been shipped direct to dvd and not exposed to the simple minds of most reviewers. Not the typical Hollywood schlock...which accounts for the negative press. Die hard MNS fans will appreciate the story...others will get lost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shockingly bad","review":"Let me preface by saying I'm not a troll that 1-Stars movies lightly. But this? It plays out like a parody of those old 1950s movies, before things like film-acting and special effects were invented (just kidding...uh...somewhat...).Its been a looooong time since I've seen actors phone in their performances like Wahlberg and Leguizamo have done here. NO, WAIT! Tim Allen in ZOOM, yeah, its about that speed.Truth is, though, when things fall apart, I'm a \\"blame the director\\" type of viewer (but come on guys, didn't you watch the dailies???). Fascinatingly misdirected by Shymalan, you will swear you're watching a student film. And I liked everything he did up 'til Lady in the Bathtub.Beware: Zooey's facial expressions aren't for the faint of heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"ATTACK OF THE VEGETATION !!!!!","review":"My least favorite of the M. Night Shyamalan movies. This story was asad waste of acting talent, a very solid cast was assembled. The firstpart of the film shows promise, with humans affected by a possible bio-hazzard strike. People start dying off in the eastern cities, no oneknows why. Panic and paranoia set in and it looks like something from IAm Legend. A pocket of survivors get out and they are divided on whatto do. The final premise is a bit strange, a Man vs. Nature plot. Canthey survive the angered local vegetation?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cool concept, but poor execution","review":"First off, I am not a M.

Night Shyamalan has brought us the '#1 thriller of all time', The Sixth Sense. He kept us on the edge of our seats during Signs, and left us stunned in The Village. However, his most recent movie release, The Happening is anything but happening.Being a fan of the thriller/horror movie genre, I was very intrigued by the previews of this flick. People are suddenly dying and there seems to be no logical explanation. The movie's \\"hero\\", Mark Wahlberg, tries to find the answer and save the day as he runs from the invisible killer. This makes up the entire movie plot.I kept waiting for it to get better. Let me rephrase that. I kept waiting for it to get good, and was disappointed. Mark Wahlberg's acting skills seem to deteriorate along with the plot as the movie progresses. Even he seems as though he's bored with the movie's story line. I have watched a lot of horror movies. I have seen the worst of the worst, and The Happening was definitely in the 'worst' pile."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's happening?","review":"Oh God, I love these reviews. I got more enjoyment reading the one stars than the actual movie. This kind of reminds me of the movies Mystery Science Theater 3000 used to make fun of. Killer trees...come one man!!! I thought the trees in Lord of the Rings had better action then this. What about flowers, and grass, and weeds, and shrubs, and moss, and mushrooms?!?!? What about the two guys who were in the boarded up house with openings you could stick your hands through, who had guns, and shot the kids? Why didn't they shot themselves?!!? Too many loose ends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oy.","review":"\\"The Happening\\" is just another piece in the growing mountain of evidence that M. Night Shyamalan is a horrifically overrated moviemaker. I have been duly unimpressed with some of his earlier efforts, but this one takes the proverbial cake. Bad acting, a bad storyline, an anemic cast, and a heavy dose of left-wing eco-propaganda all combine to make this an eminently forgettable story -- except for the indelible scar that it has left on my beleaguered psyche. There's really no need to say much more. Other reviewers have already told more than we really need to know. In an effort to set this one in proper context, however, I will conclude by noting that \\"Plan 9 From Outer Space\\" has found a soulmate."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star is too high!!","review":"I, like many others probably, bought this thinking that it looked pretty good...my dad and sister did the same thing...luckily my sister warned me before I opened my copy...and let me borrow hers instead.

M. Night is mailing it in here. It's a stupid premise, the acting is atrocious, and as a whole it comes across as a bad, low budget, Sci Fi Channel original. Mr. Shylamalan is surely losing fans in droves. I know I'm out on the guy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"What a piece of crap. The acting was horrible. Wahlberg looked like he threw his acting like a boxer throwing a fight. Did Wahlberg and Leguizamo do this movie because they owed Shyamalan money, or did they all get high and decide this is a really good story. The movie leads you to believe the plants and trees are making the characters commit suicide. I think they are committing suicide just to get out of the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"if you like feces, you'll love \\"the happening\\"","review":"and on the flipside, if you liked \\"the happening\\" you most probably love feces. this movie was a fecal mess belched out of the anus of everyones favorite armchair messiah, m night shyamalan. the people praising this movie as \\"brilliant\\" drank way too much of the kool aid."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"Without a doubt the worst movie I have ever seen, not worth buying- not even worth renting. Giving it one star is extremely generous (only selected because there was not a picture of a person driving an axe through his/her skull). I honestly thought it was some sort of joke after walking out of the theater. If a person tells you it was anything short of horrendous then immediately question why you have ever spoken with that individual and discount everything they have ever told you as a lie. The only movie that even compares to the pain involved with watching The Happening is Battlefield Earth, but even that movie was better. I hope every person involved with the making of this movie is struck in the head with a hammer- somebody owes me eight bucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"Scared me out of my shoes!

Highly NOT recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to par with Shyamalan's earlier films","review":"I loved the first four movies that Shyamalan did. I didn't even mind \\"The Lady in the Water.\\" This movie, however, was nothing but an environmental remake of \\"The Birds (Collector's Edition).\\" I'm not a big fan of propaganda movies. Yes, the environment is important, but I don't need that shoved down my throat by a movie that is supposed to entertain me.Now, it wasn't all bad. Shyamalan has a great eye when directing. He, along with the likes of Spielberg and Scorsese, has the gift of making every shot in the movie artistic. Even mundane conversations during the film have that artsy feel. However, none of the other elements I've come to love about Shyamalan (the unexpected plot twists, the surprise endings, the clues that you pick up on during repeated viewings) were there.Shyamalan should stick to making entertaining movies, and leave the overtly political statements to the activists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable are two of my favorite movies, so I keep giving M.

Night Shyamalan's movies are amazing and this one definitely lives up to my expectations. He wrote, produced, and directed this movie and it shows. The actors, especially Mark Wahlberg and Betty Buckley, do an outstanding job and the suspense of this film is non-stop. The entire idea of this movie, plants seeing us as the enemy because of all the harm we do to Earth, is really something to ponder. I loved the ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont bother","review":"i usually love M. Night shamylan's work. I even love Lady in the Water (it's a different story for him, but it's a fairy tale, and if you give it that credibility, it works).We rented The Happening, and it was terrible. Right from the get go, I just didn't believe it. There was some effort to allude to phenomenon in Nature we don't understand - Colony Collapse Disorder. But it was not enough to support the entire film.There was no ending. really truly no ending.This was just a venue to find as many different ways to kill people as possible, for no reason.This idea of Nature turning on us could be really fascinating, but this was not it. (The Birds is still an amazing film after all this time.)The Happening smacked of War of the Worlds at points, and not in a good way.Whoever said this is Shamylan's best work since Sixth Sense is terribly terribly wrong.Do Not Waste Your Time or Money."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie should be called \\"The Unforgiveable\\"","review":"Oh, M. Night...I've given you many chances. I loved Sixth Sense, Signs, Unbreakable, and the Village was decent. But this movie makes Lady in the Water look like a masterpiece. It was a glorified \\"B\\" movie at best, and I think I'm being generous. I could buy the storyline had another director taken on the task of making this film and developing the script to make it realistic. In contrast, it was like watching a train wreck...the dialogue was elementary and made the acting subpar and laughable. The story felt amateur and therefore comedic rather than scary. I'm suspecting that M. Night just gave up and needed to cash in to pay off some debts. Never again...never again..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh where have you gone M. Night?","review":"Garbage. Nothing else can describe this movie, but garbage (but I'll try :). M. Night is the master of mood - think of Signs, and the incredible use of music, camera angles, etc. to create an impending sense of doom. Or the same in The Village when the red robed human/monsters are coming. He's typically absolutely brilliant in doing this. And he does it very well in this movie as well, but its with absolutely no follow through. In Signs, you get the sense of doom, then something significant happens - i.e., you see an alien leg disappear into corn...not so here. The doom sense comes, then people just whammo die. blah blah blah. This is garbage, and, sadly, his movies have become progressively worse on each release. He used to be a no questions asked opening weekend must see; now I might not even consider renting his future works."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Not Happening!","review":"This is one of the worst movies I have ever sat through. The actors don't even try and the scenes that are supposed to be scary are mostly comical. There are a few bloody moments thrown in, I guess, to make this seem more like a horror movie but they end up just being gross. Mark Wahlberg is completely inept at playing an average Joe nice guy. He needs to stick to the tough guy roles. The only actor in the movie that is believable is Betty Buckley as the crazy old hermit woman. My advice is don't waste your time or money on this one. M. Night Shamaylan needs to go back to the drawing board. I usually like his movies but this one - well, it just isn't happening!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie ever","review":"My fiance and I watched this last night and found it to be downright HORRIBLE. It was gruesome, made no freaking sense--all these people just decide to start offing themselves due to some chemical in the air emitted from plants. STUPID. And Zooey Deschanel's acting was absolutely atrocious. 2 hours of my life I will never get back. Don't waste your time on this movie. THis is the last M. Night Shamalamadingdong movie I will ever waste my time on."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my money back","review":"the best parts of this movie were the first ten minutes and the credits! The script should have been used to line a rabbit cage. That would have been a better enviromental act than than this simple-minded turd of a movie. I have seen pornos with better acting. thank god I only spent 99 cents to see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money on this movie","review":"I rented this movie because I thought that being directed by M. Night Shyamalan it might actually be suspenseful - thought of Steven King's novel 'The Stand' actually - but to be blunt if I were to see this movie in a theatre I would walk out - thankfully I rented it (out one dollar and an hour and half of my life!) but at least I could walk to the fridge and have some snacks while watching it without the fear of losing out on anything.After Mark's fine acting in the 'The Departed' he took 10 steps back as an actor in this movie - what a shame.I might be out a buck but Mark's acting career might be on the line as a result of this lame movie.The plot you ask? Plants attacking the human race via airborne toxic agents that makes people commit suicide.Bottom-line: I think it will be a LONG TIME before any Hollywood studio bankrolls M. Night Shyamalan's future films after this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Was this a joke.....","review":"As my brother put it, for being called, \\"The Happening\\"....nothing happened. I think the idea behind it is interesting, but the movie just didn't meet the full potential it had the opportunity to. The acting by Zooey was terrible. I expecting much more from all I've heard of her talent. Disappointing to say the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened?","review":"This movie is off kilter all the way through but I'm giving it 2 stars because at least it's consistent in that. Overall, I found this to be pretty much a waste of time. Meanwhile, be sure an pay your lawn a compliment every now and then, otherwise, if this movie's premise is correct, it's only a matter of time until it gets you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Without value.","review":"This is really a terrible movie. Makes you wonder why anyone would actually choose to be part of something so bad. Mark Wahlberg has apparently forgotten what acting is, and Zooey Deschanel as his wife seems lost in space or perhaps spaced and lost. Totally without value as even the script is worse than bad. Don't waste any time viewing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just sad","review":"O.K., first off, I have LOVED all of Shyamalans movies to date. I think he is a creative and imaginative writer and director though many critics seem not to agree. HOWEVER, this movie; this was just terrible, the plot was transparent after about five minutes and it never picked up. I kept thinking that somehow there would be a plot twist, or some original idea that would save it, but alas, it never came. I've read that there where major revisions before this film was bought off on and I must say I wish that M. Night had stood his ground as I would hope that as he envisioned it, it may have been worthwhile. This however, I wouldent even waste the space on my hardrive to download it illeagaly."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Happening Should Be Called \\"The Non-Happening\\"","review":"This movie was just awful! Mark was pretty good, John & daughter were good,Betty was just wonderful-as always, Zooey can NOT act-she needs to find a different career. Each consecutive movie that is Made by M. Night is worse than the previous one. I USED to like his movies but it has been quite awhile since he made a good one. He's making millions off really lousy movies..sooo--keep your money. This movie is awful, just awful!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing failure of a film!","review":"M. Night Shyamalan's movies appear to get progressively worse since THE SIXTH SENSE. This movie begins out of nowhere and ends the same way. Explanations of what is happening or what has happened are almost non-existent and there is no credibility for anything that is happening. Various issues and features brought into the story, such as a mood ring, separating families, the selective nature of \\"the happening\\" all turn out to be irrelevant . . they are never developed in the film.Shyamalan has obviously been trying to cash in on his one and only successful film and watching this one, and hoping for something remotely resembling THE SIXTH SENSE, is an exercise in frustration and disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I don't have very much to say about this movie, just that it is a waste of time to watch it. I wish I could have given it less than a star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not purchase!","review":"Only redeeming quality: disturbing suicide scenes. That's about it, folks. Even if you forgive the ridiculous plot, this movie lacks direction in every way--poor casting, awkward acting, horrible dialogue, confusing photography direction, lame story telling (tepid rising action, NO CLIMAX, and ridiculous denouement). You'll spend most of the time watching wondering how a movie with pretty big-name actors in it could be so bad. Wahlberg at his worst. The funny thing is: John Liguisamo is an oasis of good acting, which contrasts and UNDERSCORES how the sub-par performance by the others. It really feels like your watching a D+ college video project with a whopper budget. I love apocalyptic movies, don't get me wrong, but this one is an utter failure. Beware of the plants; ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"This is nothing more than a Man-Made global warming indoctrination.

Unfortunatly, the farce of Man-Made Global warming is propigated by things like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad, you gotta rent it so you can laugh!","review":"I'm floored that Night keeps getting financing to make more films, with each being worse than the last. This one really takes the cake. You can't help laughing at the unbelievable dialogue which no one in real life would ever say, the not-scary plot twist, and the poor acting from people who would do better in other films and more likely with other directors.Gather your friends, rent this thing, sit back, and do a total Mystery Science Theatre 3000 on it.

Night lost his magic?","review":"I like most of Shamaylan's movies (ok, 'Lady In The Water' was pretty weak), but this one is pretty mediocre. Mark Wahlberg is really weak in the leading role - he's not my favorite actor anyways. And the film actually even managed to make Zoeey Deschanel look slightly unappealing (whereas I think she's normally smokin' hot!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"this just sucks","review":"Don't waste your time. There is no interesting plot twists with like you would expect from M. Night Shyamalan. The acting is mediocre. The deaths are unnecessarily gory without any feeling of suspense or thrill with them. I do not feel like I got any deeper meaning or insight into the human condition from the time I spent with this movie. There are also several parts of the story that could have been expanded, but did not go anywhere. At the end it felt like there were a lot of lose ends that were never tied up.

The plot is hard to get on board with, people make really stupid decisions, and you don't really get to know the main charecters that you are supposed to be rooting for. I had high hopes after viewing the trailers and was very disappointed. It seems that M Nights movies are progressivley getting worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Storyline is great. . . . but","review":"The storyline of this movie is fantastic, and it should have been able to get a 5 star rating. . . however, the acting of the main characters is really kind of pathetic. Slow, lethargic, disinterested - you name it. They attempt to hint at some troubles between them, other relationships are disconnected and odd and have little to do with the plot. Yes, with M. Knight - we expect more. He's done a number of movies that rate a 4 or 5, written, directed, whatever. . . but this one's about on par with the Village (and that was pretty dull too), however the Happening's story line is much better than the Village's. And I love Wahlberg - but jeez, what the heck happended?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Make him stop","review":"The ego of M. Night has really started to affect his work. Maybe if he let someone else either write, direct, or produce part of the film he might create a higher quality product. My theory is that Signs and The Sixth Sense were good because he didn't have the arrogance (or the power) to take credit and control literally and nominally for the whole project. He used to collaborate with talented people and was able to optimize the product based on his personal skill set. Now The Happening is just a real-life nightmare of film-making that we're all going to have to live with (hopefully as many of us will be able to steer clear of it as possible).Now would be a good time to mention that my nephew also writes, produces, and directs his own films and is putting out stuff of about the same quality as The Happening.I've never been so appalled at the lack of quality of a film before. I didn't know where to go for relief / justice--I figured Amazon was the place. Man, this was awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst major release of the year","review":"The first twenty minutes are pretty good, but folks, by the end you will witness some of the worst dialogue ever written for film. So bad, that it might give The Happening a second life as a cult film (so bad, it's good). I couldn't believe the Amazon blurb above, that said Shyamalan is a genuis with dialogue. Shyamalan's camera work is, as always, good, and he was able to stock the movie with good actors -- but you have to give those actors something remotely believable to say! I think I read somewhere that Shyamalan said this was meant to be a B movie, only the best ever done. In his Legend-in-his-own-mind dreams! I'll take a bad John Carpenter effort any day over this limp stuff. This guy has a serious ego problem, and needs to give up script writing and start looking for outside material."},{"rating":"1","title":"The absolute worst movie of 2008!!","review":"First off, I really do like M Night Shyamalan movies. I loved the 6th sense, Signs, and I liked Lady in the Water. I am a fan of his stuff and was excited to see this...until i actually watched it in the theater....This movie was soo bad, people in the movies were actually laughing and i counted 5 people that left mid movie when everyone found out what was killing everyone (it could be the 5 people left for different reasons or not). I mean i have a real open mind about movies, but this is silly. My girlfriend and I were rooting for the people to kill themselves cause we hated it so much. In the end, i wanted everyone in the movie to die...it was that bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"DUD!","review":"The wind blowing was the most exciting part of this film.

Save your $$$."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish something had happened...","review":"Well, 3 strikes you're out: THE VILLAGE, THE LADY..., and now, THE HAPPENING. What is happening with M. Night is what I'd like to know. Talk about dismal. Such a great concept that goes absolutely no where. The actors seem to move from 'what am I doing here?' to 'get me out of here!' Don't look for the pay-off. That way you won't get angry about wasting you're money on this movie.There are two highlights to this film: The opening and closing credits. You can watch the sky transform in beautiful timelapse photography as you read the names of all the criminals involved in the making of this unintentional disaster flick."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ironic Title Doesn't Save it","review":"Poorly shot, poorly acted, poorly edited and with poor music cues, The Happening is a downright terrible movie. Featuring Mark Wahlberg as a science teacher who doesn't believe in science but does love mood rings, and Zooey Descanel as his wife who is guilt-ridden over a dessert with a co-worker (not a euphemism!) and possibly also over her inability to express more than two emotions, the film features a plodding, embarrassingly juvenile plot capped off by a bit of terrible exposition that doesn't actually reveal anything, The Happening is a simply a terrible film.On the plus side, if you've ever wanted to see Mark Wahlberg give a monologue to a plastic plant, this is your movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horror-rible!!!!","review":"After reading the favorable comments of Richard T. Jameson, the Amazon editor above, I wondered if he had seen the same awful movie I had. THE HAPPENING is the worst of a long list of terrible films by M. Night Shyamalan. I honestly don't understand why he keeps getting money to do garbage. Then I went to a website called <thenumbers.com> to see what the box office numbers looked like for the film. They were impressive. THE HAPPENING's budget was $60,000,000 and its worldwide box office receipts totaled $163,000,000. It must have been music to the ears of executives in Hollywood, who care about one thing and one thing only...money!!! As long as Shyamalan continues to make money for the studios, he will continue making horrifically bad films. In my opinion, he's a one note wonder who hasn't anything worthwhile since THE SIXTH SENSE (a wonderful movie). I will never see another of his films."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's just bad!","review":"I can't believe I wasted an hour and a half and three dollars on this. It just sucks.

Sometimes I like a film for reasons even I don't grasp, because I normally prefer more aggresive films like the recent zombie and 28 days later fare. It's a slow moving film interspersed with sudden events - it has a malignant creeping up to get you sort of tone. Still I enjoyed it and have watched it multiple times thus far, still enjoying it. It's got the (all to often today) \\"Go Green of mother earth will get you\\" undertone and I could have done with a better explanation of the cause behind what actually begins to happen. But in all, It is one I'm happy to have in my DVD collection and despite some of it's shortcomings, I'll still suggest at least a rental to check it out and you can see if it still keeps you attention like it did mine, and if a purchase would be cheaper than repeat rentals."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Happening","review":"When I put this movie into my DVD player, it made all kinds of noise.

Why do they keep hiring Zooey Danschanel to \\"act\\" in movies? Didn't we learn our lesson in the TV mini-series \\"Wizard of Oz\\"? OK, her parents were associated with the cinema.

Apparently, the plants don't like the CO2 we're emitting. Funny, don't they want more of it?

Night Shymalan totally lost it.A movie about an natural disease spread in the air that causes people to commit suicide. Mark Walberg escapes the city with his wife and the daughter of his best friend. They are chased by the disease in the air every where they go and manage to escape it. They do not die in the end because it seems the disease stops one day after it started.We do not know what the heck this disease is about! Is it nature taking revenge because humans are ruining it as it was theorized in the movie? Why did Mark Walberg and his wife not die in the end? Is it their love, or is it merely that it stopped one day after it started.We have no clue.

Since then however, every succeding movie has been a struggle. It appears that the Sixth Sense was more of a wonderful fluke than a sign of things to come. The Happening falls short in many respects, including story line. There are many holes and non-sensical moments where continuity of the story is lost. The actors are fine in their roles, good even. But the story just gets lost and can't figure itself out. A shame. It's not a bad premise, just extremely poorly executed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mama Earth 1/ People 0","review":"I did enjoy this only as a movie.

I was rater disappointed in the plot though, it was transparent and after a while it seemed that we were watching a werewolf film from the 50's. This is certainly not his best work, and as director I would have thought that he would have recognized that early on in production. The story line lacked punch and that high tension that you got with \\"the sixth sense\\" or \\"signs\\".

Night Shyamalan's movies \\"The Sixth Sense\\" & \\"Unbreakable\\" beyond words as both movies were excellent! I've been sorely disappointed with each film M. Night Shyamalan has been associated with since including \\"Signs\\", \\"The Village\\", & \\"Lady in The Water\\"!However, M. Night Shyamalan's end of the world movie/apocalyptic film, \\"The Happening\\", has to be his all time worst film to date hands down. The storyline sucked, the acting was lukewarm at best and I found the majority of the characters to be annoying!! The only interesting performance was played by Betty Buckley in her role as Mrs. Jones (the isolated/crazy woman in the middle of nowhere)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad.","review":"Another stinker for M. Night Shymalan to add to the growing list.Like most of his films, M. Nights's \\"The Happening\\" has a moment or two of real good potential but on the whole is just utter garbage. The casting is great but the script is just painful to hear, while the actors are doing their best the lines they are spouting sound so forced and out of place that you actually start to feel embarrassed for them. Listening to Wallberg's theories and phony scientific approach to things made me want to laugh and cry at the same time.I really, really suggest that you pass up this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"M. Night Shyamalan should have left it with \\"I see dead people\\"","review":"Let's face it he has been going downhill ever since. However I must admit I liked \\"The village.\\" I even bought the book that he stole the story from.This film however would have been better off as a Twilight Zone quickie. It was like the fog without the fog monsters. Unless you consider most of the actors. Shyamalan somehow must have bribed Zooey Deschanel (she was great in Tin Man) to play a ditzy pandering post hippy.The story is of people mysteriously committing suicide in unique ways. What is the cause. We get to speculat and even repent for stepping on the grass. In the end who will survive if anyone?This is one of the few films that Blu-ray scenery is more interesting than the characters or the story.Tin Man [Blu-ray]"},{"rating":"1","title":"sucks","review":"this is a total waste of time. i usually like Mark Wahlberg but he just doesn't come off well as a teacher much less a science teacher....This movie just sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Acting","review":"Holy bad acting Batman. I tried hard to watch this movie. The first half hour, I figured it has to get better. Marky Mark (sorry Wahlberg, but you were Marky Mark in this stinker) was reading his lines. That guy from Sex In The City was reading his. And Zoey, I do love Zoey, was just plain not good in this film. There was a point at which I said, life is just too short to lose an hour and a half.I skipped ahead to the end. And the mystery here, nature self regulating, is actually a theory some people have about what might happen to man for what we have done to the planet. Sorry Shyamalan fans, I just couldn't sit through the bad acting to get the full effect of his presentation of that theory. Well I also take issue that the director chose to say Americans were first, and the threat was over. Except, wait a minute, let's pick on our real enemy - the disease hits the French in the last scene.At the very least it was filmed reasonably well."},{"rating":"1","title":"B-O-R-I-N-G!!!

This one is just terrible. No script, horrible acting, no meaningful plot...just an embarrassment to the director and to Mark.

I paid 1 cent (plus shipping) for this one and I still feel like I was totally ripped off. I can't believe how bad this film was. All I will remember is a wind machine blowing the leaves on trees...this one probably cost $500 to make...and that includes the special effects. Shyamalan needs to hang it up...Wahlberg is much too good for this garbage. I gave it ONE star because I couldn't give it a ZERO!

Mark is a really good actor, bordering on great. Why he chose to act in this movie had to be for financial reasons. This movie was awful. Just awful. It would have been obvious it was a terribly weak story from just a read of the script so money had to be the reason Wahlberg would risk his reputation as an good up-and-coming actor to \\"star\\" in this boring \\"movie\\". It's not good enough for made-for-cable. It's not good enough for direct-to-video. It might be good enough for made-for-TV.

He gets killed 4 times in this show instead of his usual 1 time. Not to mention the giant cyclops chasing him around the stage. The best way I can describe this show is when it's over you realize why he has continued to last after all these years. More energy than rockers half his age.

The DMM software finally stopped working all together after I ran an update on it. I tried firmware updates to no avail.

Phillips has changed the operating system so that it relies upon Musicmatch Jukebox for file maintenance. The problem is that the basic Jukebox program and plug in don't work. So, once you upgrade the firmware and software, you are left with a very expensive paperweight. I assume that all is corrected if you pay Musicmatch for an upgrade, but I am unwilling to take the chance for a couple reasons. First, the unit should work fine without forcing me to buy separate software (or they should disclose this fact so a purchaser can figure this into the total purchase price). Second, fool me once. What happens if I upgrade and the thing still does not work. All in all, Nike and Phillips should be very embarrassed.

For example, the books states that an 'inactive but healthy adult might have a VO2max of about 31..(ml/kg/min)';however, according to the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM), for someone of my age and gender 31 ml/kg/min would be about 70%!(There seems to be a mumber of other testing protocols that give different VO2max values from those used by ACSM. So I wonder if, given such variability in tests, outcomes and interpretation, whether any VO2max test is useful.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Miraculous","review":"I bought this CD from the sellers and I could not be happier! This is a frist rate production and this is quite evident from the very frist notes of the overture. Jason Darrow and Jack Cathcart have really created a genuine thought provoking pieice of work.

Or that no one would ever like you for anything more than a friend, if even that? Then, perhaps, this is the book for you. In this book, Harmony was just such a person. She listened to her co-worker, Aaron Foster, talk about his ex-girlfriend. All the while she would have given anything to have been the one he was interested in. In an amazing series of twists and turns, Aaron talks Harmony into pretending she is interested in his roommate. When his roommate falls for Harmony, Aaron realizes that Harmony really is a girl he would like to get to know better. Is it too late for him? Read this amazing story by Staci Stallings and find out. You will be entertained and inspired."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet romantic friendship story","review":"This is a great love story that will keep you turning the pages and will be hard to put down until you know how the story plays out. This is the story of Aaron and Harmony and how they find each other. Harmony is the \\"no so special girl\\" who has not been fortunate in her dating life or lack of it. She is his always faithful friend who is there for Aaron's ups and downs. Aaron on the other hand, has never noticed her until she starts dating his roommate. You will be glued to this book until you find out how these two people end up together since we all know from the start that this how it ends. I truly enjoy Staci's writing because she is always so down to earth and realistic in all her stories. Her characters are well developed and we can learn so much from them. I highly recommend this book to everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful book","review":"this book was so awful it made me want to puke it was so dumb AND MY MOM THOUGHT IT WAS TOO"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works for Me!","review":"I am a licensed Cosmetologist and highly recommend this neutralizer as it also conditions the hair.

He eventually meets up with Marvin (James Caan), his mentor and partner in crime, also uncovering a mysterious and dangerous world that could prove to be his undoing. Unfortunately, the only intriguing aspect of CITY OF GHOSTS involves the often rare glimpses into the remote and exotic culture and landscape of Cambodia. Aside from the cinematography this film has little to offer the audience, besides some laughs from Gérard Depardieu's character. The dialogue and acting are often uneven and scripted and the relationships between the characters are not convincing.Bottom line: I was disappointed in CITY OF GHOSTS..."},{"rating":"2","title":"West meets east.","review":"I would actually give this film 4.5 stars out of 5. I just returned from Bali where I found a copy of this film on DVD. The jacket suggested that it was filmed for the most part in Bangkok and since I lived there for three years I felt it was worth a viewing if only for some scenes of a city I love. Well, Bangkok gets only a brief glance as Dillon's character goes to Phnom Penh in Cambodia, a city I visited in 1996. \\"City of Ghosts\\" is an interesting and very plausible story well-acted by the cast, and fleshed out very convincingly with local characters. The cinematography together with the atmospheric soundtrack create the experience of being there. Truly a wonderful experience of a film. West meets east. And Dengue Fever!

He's lucky they never had an immunity challenge that involved writing or editing because he surely would have been the first one voted off the island.

I recommend this book to everyone who wants to accept the challenges of being human and wants more out of life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rules don't make sense","review":"The press release for this book started off with a classic non-sequitur: You can't be rich or physically fit unless you're happy, and you can't be happy unless you know yourself. There was not much thought that went into this book. In fairness it was probably written in about 3 weeks as evidenced by the flimsy size. The writing is decent, but content-wise the ghost writer didn't have much to work with.It contains probably more spin than truth. Hatch is probably a much more complex character than the one we see in this book. There is also no real Survivor material. If you can relate to the issues in this man's life you might find it interesting. Even then, it's probably not the unvarnished truth. The rest of us, including most Survivor fans, will be sorely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"It should have gone direct to audio!","review":"Its probably to be expected that someone would publish this book but anyone whos life is changed by the incomplete and un-informed thoughts of some contestant on a TV show deserves a hard-cover edition.

I highly recommend this book to anyone tired of waiting around for a break in life, ready to get serious about realizing their potential.

But the biggest problem is that you have to type step by step commands and numbers all the time. Why you have to do the next step is never explain, so if you stop to follow the book and decide to do something on your onw, you can't do it.Another problem is that you can't save your work because the book comes with copywrite cd so if you want to stop and continue later you have 2 options: either never to turn off the program or to finish few chapters at once.So as a sumary I must say another Big, Bad and Boaring Book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am disgusted","review":"The service from this company is disgusting.

Jobs Crossing, Texas becomes very real, and the reader comes to feel he actualy knows the inhabitants.There is a charm to it all, a soothing feeling. Cozy must have been especially chosen as a name for the sub-genre, just for this series. Oh, there are villains, but they aren't really all that evil. And there are murders, but only for the sake of a plot that can allow the writer to lay in atmosphere and character. I do wish I could have gone home with Biggie (who is really quite small) and J.R. and had a meal with them and played a game of Chinese checkers with Rosebud.The book is lightweight, to be sure, but so is angel food cake, and I like that as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Corny, Colloquial Cozy","review":"With plenty of stops for chow time (and chow chow) and a policeman whose priority is his pie, this homespun mystery novel (set during the Christmas season) has an accent almost as thick as the gravy covering the body of fricasseed fat man. In Job's Crossing, if the cholesterol doesn't kill you the colloquialisms might. Please note that the term \\"funeralized\\" really ISN'T an every day term in Texas, nor do we all talk like this. The charm of grandma/detective Biggie and grandson/detective J.R. almost overcomes the hokey-ness of the time warp they appear to be stuck in. While the local actuarial tables would surely indicate that Job's Crossing could be hazardous to your health, never fear, for Biggie and J.R. will surely sort things out.

I really gave it way more effort than I should have. I read 1/3 of the book but just can't do it anymore! I kept thinking once he gets past his sexual memoirs there would begin a true story but it just goes on and on with all the detailed & deviant sexual encounters. I hope this \\"author\\" learned that if you continuously write about sex it really detracts from the sensuality of the scene and becomes disgusting if not boring to read!

Some flew off after less than a minute of use. This continued even with replacement of the backing pad (but the new backing pad did help somewhat at least for a while). As a result, a lot of the sanding capability of the discs was wasted.

Although only one camera and substandard sound was used, it's still the best footage taken of the group. And it's worth the price of the disc alone. The emotional interviews with each member is icing on the cake. And the context setting for their music and roots is excellent. If you're an old baby boomer like me, it'll bring a tear to your eye.

Load times are longish, story mode is more annoying than fun, and the difficulty level of the game is too easy--this being a problem for adult players because you can totally suck or totally rock at singing and will likely get the same score everytime. The characters aren't all that customizable either, and the \\"dance\\" part of it is basically just waving your hand back and forth to rhythm (basically a cheap rip-off from Rayman's). For younger kids though, this might be an ideal game, because they won't find it too challenging and can unlock most stuff without the aid of an adult.So, in the end, if it's for your kids, find a copy less than $50 and have at it, if its for older teens and up, pass!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother With Boogie","review":"As someone who loves karaoke, I was really looking forward to the release of Boogie on the Wii. However, I was very disappointed with it.In Boogie you're doing one of two things, singing karaoke , or \\"dancing\\". The dance portion of the game is overly simplistic, and not really dancing at all. All you do is swing the controller back and forth with the beat, making your character dance. The song selection is absolutely horrible. There are a few good ones, but most of the songs seem to be geared towards girls in middle school.Don't bother with this one. It's not even close to worth the $60 you'll pay for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be improved","review":"There were lots of issues with this game. Half the songs didn't play or were locked. It was also not intuitive and difficult to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game!","review":"I bought this game simply for my own enjoyment. As a fan of older songs, \\"You're The One That I Want\\" caught my attention and I got it. $30 is NOT overpriced for this game by any means.I connected it this evening and 5 hours later, my five children and my husband and I were so tired. We laughed the entire time. It was a blast. Yes, it's not techincally a game - but so what. It made my family come together and we all just loved it (45, 32, 14, 10, 9, 7, and 6 are our ages).It's the only singing game I have found with great music on it. I highly recommend it for a barrel of laughs and fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok but a little complicated","review":"Hi, this game is ok. This is my first time with a singing type game.

The explanation and rules of the game are not easily tought and does not have any easy instructions that are included. It says on the box 30+ more songs included in game, but only about 10 are able to be played and the rest have to be unlocked. The song choice is horrible and is not listed on the box. The game is not very fun!!! If you are looking for a fun family singing game...turn away while you can. Stay away from this item!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The pitch was good.....","review":"The concept for the game was a great idea. Control a dancing character with the Wii remote with a great soundtrack of songs to go with it. The actual mechanics though leave so much to be desired it's not even funny. Honestly, there really should be more to your characters' moves than swinging the remote to the beat, and really, that's all there is to it. TO put it bluntly, if you loved games like Donkey Konga, DDR, Elite Beat Agents, Guitar Hero, etc. and they got you into rhythm/music oriented games then Boogie will be a major let down and make you realize how lucky we all were that this one wasn't the first of the genre or the aforementioned titles might never have gone over because Boogie ruined it for everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Play it at your friend's house","review":"I bought this game after playing it one time at my friend's house. We played for about an hour and it seemed pretty fun. However I now have owned the game for less than a week and it has already becoming boring for me and the whole family. The song's get old fast and there are very few stages or characters to use. The unlockables are just different outfits and are rediculously easy to earn. The singing portion has terrible voice recognition as one can simply hum into the mic and still earn gold medals even on the hardest levels. The dancing portion is also sort of lame in that you score the most points by simply moving the controller in provided sequences such as up, down, left, right. For added fun you can hit the A button to change moves- whoo hoo! To top it off this is one of the most expensive games out because it comes with the microphone. So let your friend's shell out the $59.99 and just play it at their house; don't waste your own money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing good about this game","review":"This is the most boring game by far for the wii.

The singing is easy though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good if you're twelve and only if you're twelve.","review":"This game sounded like it could be fun, at least for the karaoke part of it. We figured we could let our nephews use it when they come over. Yeah, no. This game really stinks. It loads slowly, it forces you to go through the tutorial 100% (we're talking 10+ minutes) every time you have a new character, and they use songs that weren't really meant for 12-year-olds, which means half the words are bleeped out. Mambo #5 had about three words and then a huge part was cut where he says, \\"Let's ride to the liqueur-store around the corner, The boys say they want some gin and juice, But I really don't wanna, Beerbust like I had last week,\\" which means you stood their and \\"picked your nose\\" for a few minutes before singing again. After a few songs of play I packed it back in the box and sold it to a co-worker who has a 5, 8, and 11-year-old. For dance, buy Dance Dance Revolution and for karaoke-type stick to Rock Band or, better yet, SingStar for Playstation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much boogie for the bucks","review":"I enjoy singing, and I had hoped that this game would provide lots of fun. The problem is that the game wants you to sing exactly like the original song. including all the grunts, huhs and ahs. And it doesn't care if you are actually on pitch, as long as you are following the highs and lows. So my husband, who can't match a pitch, got great scores, while I, who sing on pitch, got terrible scores because I don't do the grunts very well. So I was very disappointed. I also wish I could have know a list of songs before I purchased, because I didn't know many of the songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Collector Item","review":"I am a collector of McFarlane action figures and continue to collect different ones from different sports figures while keeping them unopened and in mint condition~ This is one of my collection and it is good to find a collector at the price this was~ A young star definitly on the upswing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Part Shipped.","review":"The item arrived in good condition and on time.

Perhaps the author considers the ship to be a shell of its former self.

It is beautifully bound and the photos are priceless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very descriptive book!","review":"This book is full of wonderful pictures of the ship, both in color, black and white, and sketches. The middle of the book has a fold out of the ship's cutaway, as well as the deck plans.

This particular book explores the notion of date rape and is developed particularly well with Jessica falling for handsome and athletic James Montegomery, a guy who seems too good to be true. Unfortunately, it seems that James is a guy with a few skeletons in his closet and it's up to Elizabeth to reveal the truth to Jessica before it's too late."},{"rating":"2","title":"good but deep","review":"it was good. i couldn't put it down. at some parts it was really gross though.i still can't wait to read the sequal.it is graet"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shipping Problems","review":"Product took way to long to ship.

Take the wheel has that and more. Steer, Restoration and I Would Know You Anywhere are excellent songs with a very diverse sound. These are the songs on the album that stay in my head and make the album worth purchasing. I hear influences of many bands as I listen to this album, (Bare Naked Ladies, Da Da and even a little BoDeans)but this feeling doesn't last long as Radio 5's music blends into its own unique sound. Most of the tracks have a fun sound while a few (like Restoration) are more mellow. The vocals are very strong all around and able to support the lyric heavy songs very well. I give this album 4 stars because I like it a lot, but not 5 because there are some slightly rough edges. It shows that there should be many more good things to come from Radio 5"},{"rating":"2","title":"Radio5 'Take the Wheel' really drives!","review":"This is an excellent first cd for this new band!

Irish music has always been popular, on guitar and fiddle. Hammer dulcimer has been relegated to background accompaniment, a member of the chorus. Not so in John's hands and heart. This is a front rank, solo instrument capable of incredible range and nuance when played by someone who knows where the music can go and where the instrument can take it. Worth every penny and each minute spent listening. Here, the sum is truly greater than the individual songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Great!!","review":"This is just an all around awesome CD.

I read the first book \\"Sacred Flesh\\" and it was a fair enough story to GM an exciting adventure, regardless of the fact that the main character is one dimensional and the rest of the characters were a mish mash of confusion. This second book on the otherhand I didn't get halfway through before I put it aside because I lost all reason to care whether the main character lived or died. The action is alright if you can keep track of what's happening. Even the sex scenes are pretty shallow. I think the writing just could have been better. I wouldn't recommend this book.

In all fairness, a comprehensive collection would need to be more like a double or 3-CD.BTW, to the reviewer from Jersey: I hope you're aware that Loose Ends is not from NJ, they are from the UK. And this is an import CD to begin with. In other words, Loose Ends' history began before you ever heard of them in the US. A track like \\"Magic Touch\\" may not be familiar to you, but it SHOULD if you are a true fan. Certainly to the fans in the UK, where Loose Ends is from, that track is an old favorite and I doubt that they could sell a \\"best of\\" in the UK without that track!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome movie","review":"I love this movie!

The drive pully behind the sanding disk was slipping out off of the shaft teeth that hold it. I found myself constantly pulling this thing apart to push the pully back in place. After about 3 hours of use the drive pully teeth were stripped out being plastic.

I found it MUCH simpler to remove the fans first. They only bolt in at the top and once they're out of the way removing the transmission cooler lines and lower radiator hose was greatly simplified.

But, after the first chapter, I was just reading superficial attacks to the catholic church, always extreme and without real context. Every comment about the catholic church had no strong support by the characters, which I also expected to be stronger, so at the end of the book -as I always expect- the reader could at least identify with some of their feelings and thoughts. At the end, the so expected revelations, the reason d'etre of the story, are just -again- superficial \\"facts\\"...

Given current events in both Rome and Israel, and that we may soon see the election of a new Pope, this book is a classic example of historical fiction at its best and most honest. Although it may be difficult to follow in some chapters as Marcus challenges the reader with his \\"novel within a novel,\\" it succeeds in showing the author's keen understanding of human nature - as well as history.

And if it were good gospel at that, I'd forgive him, but the song's lyrics read like a third grader's sunday school poem, and the instrumentation is downright annoying with lots of dated sounding motown horns.

If you have, however, I would recommend not purchasing this game. The play experience (independent of having few of the more entertaining features such as franchise mode, or create-your-own player) is not particularly rich in part because there are simply less options, and in part because inconsistent controller responsiveness make issues such as whether you can trigger a layup attempt much more relevant to your results than whether you can create a good shot opportunity in the first place.For those with young kids, the game is not terrible (the dunk contest and 3-point contest might be fun group games) but for those looking for a basketball experience similar to that on other platforms, stay away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kick ...

Even for fans who want BJR's versions of DRIFT AWAY, SO INTO YOU, etc. are cheated because the sound is muddy, and you can especially hear it when each song begins and starts to end. Buy a CD with the original versions, as BJR sang some great songs and the originals can't be topped."},{"rating":"1","title":"Billy don't be a zero","review":"I agree with the firest write up. I had not pulled this CD out in a while and think I bought it used at a pawn shop in Chciago, but the sound was the absolute pits.

The treehouse started to spin ... faster and faster ... then everything was still. Absolutely still.\\" The loyalty and friendship which bond brother Jack and sister Annie are also a refreshing break from sibling squabbles.On the other hand, it's discouraging to watch the heroes of these books visit far-off times and places and learn virtually nothing about the places they go to, because the author is so ignorant about science, history and the English language (gravity varies depending on whether you're in a building or not; \\"thou\\" is a plural pronoun; etc.).

The movie does have some cute blonds but not enough to carry the film. They use a terrible font where \\"M\\", \\"N\\" and \\"H\\" all look the same on the screen.

It is also full with personal life details which are not so important to be reported to the reader. But what has hit me most is the author's claim that the information theory was already there at the end of the XIX century, forgetting Shannon and his paper. Shannon deserves much more than only mentioning him (together with Nyquist and Wiener, clearly minor actors in information theory) in a line! This a very bad book when the author deals with history, written by an amateur, not a professional.

As the computer works by using the laws of physics, it is a truism to say that the laws of physics themselves constitute a computation. What does this statement actually tell us?I was hoping that the book would put some flesh on the author's idea, but after reading it I'm still waiting.At any point in the history of humanity, we have used our most sophisticated knowledge for explanatory purposes. When the most sophisticated machine was a clock, we described the universe as a clockwork machine. Now that the cleverest thing we know is quantum theory, we get books like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Space - an exemplary read!","review":"I had a copy of this book from when it was originally published, but because of some recent interest in the history of the Apollo program, I wanted to re-read this wonderful yarn. While it does not reflect the actual history of the development of the space program within the United States, it does represent most of the major developments very well, and is a true account of the types of events that marked this monumental effort. I particularly appreciated Michener's humanization of the political and technical struggles that were the hallmark of this phase of our history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Michener does it again..","review":"With each Michener novel I read I seem to be slowly but surely getting addicted to them. There seems to be an endless supply of stories. This novel falls into line with a lot of other novels by the same author. The story has something for everyone and maintains the readers attention with fictional characters tied to a well researched historical time line/story. I defenitely recommend reading this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book","review":"Space starts off strong in the Pacific theatre of World War II. It chronicles the lives of several men who eventually come together due to the space programs. The characters are well developed.

While it is perhaps a necessity of the subject matter, all of the main characters (Especially Mr. and Mrs. John Pope) appeared to be without fault, and their lack of emotional growth throughout their lifetimes made them boring. Furthermore, the author has a tendancy to describe trivial details of the lives of minor characters, with no hope that they will become significant to the plot later. However, I found myself enchanted by the fictional Apollo 18 mission to the \\"Other Side\\" of the moon, and some of the technical aspects of the work. The classic film \\"The Right Stuff\\" based on the Tom Wolfe book of the same name covers the space race in a much more engaging and dramatic fashion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Space: the Dissapointing Frontier","review":"Space is a thick book, but it looked from the outside like a novel that would contain a good painting from the inside of the U.S. space program.

After that I lost 80% of my interest in the story. He rambled on for a long time, apparently he thinks that right-wing christians who disbelieve Darwin are therefore anti-science, and therefore it's their fault we cancelled the space program.

It has been a real disappointment.It starts out fine, but around the halfway mark really starts to drag. There is way too much time spent dwelling on the details of the character's personal lives, even the politicians, and all of that info almost seems like it was thrown in to act as filler.Areas that could have used more material and info are just briefly touched upon or passed over completely.The USA has been headed for the dark side of the moon for about the last 100 pages, but I don't think my interst is going to last long enough to see them get there."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT a song book!!","review":"This came up in a search for songbooks -- I bought two others at the same time and this appeared to be listed as a songbook NOT A USED CD.

After all the previews I saw of it on a dvd made it look great. But was I ever disappointed when I started playing the game. I am a huge fan of Harry Potter books and movies even though I'm adult. The game was just boring, nothing but running back and forth through the same corridors and every few minutes having to play the same duel game or attend a DA meeting. There is little if any skill involved so a very young child might like this, but its doubtful to appeal to anyone above 8 or a skilled gamer. The most fun part of the game is playing Gobstones as that was the only thing challenging. If you insist on getting this make sure you have a touch screen protector as you will destroy your touch screen casting spells."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate the duels!!!","review":"I have found this game enjoyable- up to a certain extent. I just recently purchased the nintendo ds and am still getting used to it. There are a lot of things- such as some of the mini-games that I enjoy. HOWEVER, I simply detest the duels!!! Why? you may ask-simply because I cannot seem to cast a spell worth a flip. I think I am doing it right-but then I get a \\"dreadful\\" or \\"very poor\\"- and then Harry, Ron and Hermione drop to the floor- I just cannot seem to grasp the art of dueling via stylus- I think if I am able to master that- I may have a higher opinion of this game in general. By the way, If anyone out there has some pointers-feel free to pass them on to me on the discussion forum. Thanks.

They grow very bushy tall grass like and the Craftsman wouldn't cut them, but frayed them to a mess. I was really thinking I would need a gas powered hedger, but thought for $32 bucks I would give this one a try first. Good call because it was easy to setup (just 2 screws for the guard plate) and cuts the butterfly iris bushes like a knife through warm butter. Also, for a rookie like me it was pretty easy to trim them to uniform of my liking. Hope it stays that way for a long time.

The prose was sloppy & base, and the story was bland and uninteresting. The narrative basically lurches from one prepubescent sex scene to another, and the book ends with an oddly uplifting tone. Probably the most creative passages in the entire book were the metaphors for sex and reproductive organs. This book could've been written by an inventive 5th grader.

The flavor is so rich and distinctive, after you've had just a couple cups over time, you can nearly taste it when thinking about it. What's confusing to me is that I'm not a fan of bitter flavors (not a coffee drinker), but I brew this dark and drink it straight and I love it (and it is a solid, black tea).

It crashes very often and there are no patches that I could locate. Furthermore the production of economy is similair to star craft which does not fit this genre of game at all. To collect resources build various types of building for everything from technology to resource collection as well as build troops in this game system is cumbersome at best. I was really looking forward to a good world war 1 strategy game and this is not it. Troop combat does not flow well and it is very badly organized. To select groups of troops is diificult as they are not even numbered therefore you dont know what group you are selecting. Overall the whole system of managing combat as well as the economy and troop building is combersome at best.

Why Mr. Pfister felt it necessary to bludgeon the reader over the head with it yet again in Rainbow Fish and the Big Blue Whale is truly beyond me. It wouldn't really bother me - after all, there's nothing wrong with reminding children as well as adults that it's good to be nice - except the writing itself in Big Blue Whale is so poor. As in Rainbow Fish to the Rescue, Big Blue Whale feels rushed and slipshod, as if the author threw together any old story in order to make a deadline. Even a simple, predictable and cliched story can still be well-written and enjoyable; unfortunately, Big Blue Whale is all of the former and neither of the latter.

The production is reminiscent of The Roots, but I think it is much more mellow and organic. All of the songs are nice, but my favorites are Jettin, Blowing Down, The Art oF Easing, Dial 7 and Four Corners. 1994 was one of the best years in hip-hop. Illmatic, Sun Rises In The East, Word...Life, Resurrection and Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik were released during the year, but in my opinion, Blowout Comb ranks up there with those albums because it is just as good, if not better in some cases.

Obviously, an entire collection of soul song covers should follow this one.

Most striking of these tracks is the cover of the Burt Bacharach/Elvis Costello gem \\"God Give Me Strength\\" (from the motion picture \\"Grace of My Heart) Her performance on this tune is genuinely heartbreaking. And the theme for her new series, entitled \\"Nobody Else but You\\", a kicky romp, gives Bette a chance to try out her chops as a writer. All of the material included on the album suits Bette like a well-tailored evening gown. Here's hoping that Bette continues on this glorious musical path right into our hearts."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great BETTE","review":"Bette Midler is a wonderful talent and this album proves that (as if it hadn't already been proven!). She has a wonderful ear for great material and that also is shown on this great album. Tackling Teddy Pendergrass' LOVE TKO is no easy feat and the Divine Miss M doesn't disappoint, offering a compassionate take on a fabulous song.Having heard Lalah Hathaway and Joe Sample's version of \\"When Your Life Was Low\\" and loving the song as I do, I was interested in how Bette would approach the song which is steeped in jazz vocal. Her voice is amazing on this song and it makes you long for a sugar-free radio wave that would send this tune through stereo speakers everywhere.This album offers great songs and a Bette Midler that is in excellent voice and at her interpretive best. How wonderful it is for us to have Bette on TV, in the movies and in our CD players. She is truly one of the greatest talents we have, and as I said earlier, this album proves that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not fun for a Pattyfan.","review":"I'm going to be honest. I don't own this album, but being a huge Patty Griffin fan, I've heard Bette's cover of \\"Moses.\\" This is a great example of a terrible cover song. It's enough for me to give the whole album one star. When Patty Griffin sings this song, it makes your heart melt and you actually feel for this \\"tragic figure in the corner.\\" Midler's version makes you think of it as being funny and sings it in an upbeat, tongue in cheek way. \\"Moses\\" is not a tongue in cheek song. It is an exquisitely heart breaking ballad, and meant to be sung that way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another mediocre album!","review":"I have been a fan of hers from the beginning (1972) and always bought her albums on the release date. The last three albums have been a major disappointment! I am no longer going to buy on blind trust. If Bette's new TV series is as bad as this album AND her last two movies-she's in BIG TROUBLE career-wise! This album is as mediocre as her awful \\"Bette of Roses\\". The choice of material sucks. \\"HIT\\" isn't written on any of the songs on the album. Her voice is flat and it cracks when she tries to hit notes she is no longer capable of hitting. the assistance from her 'Harlettes' on these notes is SO noticeable as to totally obscure her voice from the recording! Save your money and buy this in the discount bins it will be there soon enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nobody sings like her!","review":"Ms. Midler has a stunning voice and she knows it, so on this CD she shows the best of her: romantic tunes, disco, jazz, and many more styles are mixed on this stunning CD.

I was sooo excited when I heared about the new album..I'm from germany and I had to pay the high \\"import\\" price. I loved \\"Bathhouse Betty\\", but this one...oh my god, how bad it is. Ugly choice of songs, a stupid dance track... Bette at her worst side, sorry, but this is my opinion. I hope she will be back sometimes with more quality... her voice is amazing, hopefully she chooses better songs in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have seen BETTE-R days!!!","review":"OK! I've let time pass before I wrote this review to be fair. It seems the buying public has the answer. It didn't stay on the chart for more 13 weeks and peaked just below #60. That's not too bad without any airplay. But with a mediocre television series and all the bad publicity it's been getting, she has become a bad parody of herself. I hope she can get back up again! But this CD is not the pick-me-up she delivered. She truly needs a gay man with incredible taste to guide her openly in her descision making and choosing the \\"right\\" tracks. Her best BET(TE), would be, to rush release some re-mixes of some of these tracks to rebute the CD. Perhaps even add the re-mixes as bonus tracks like Ricky Martin is doing to boost his sales up. Re-mix TKO or Imagination! The hottest tracks on here are Heartaches and the late Kristy MacCall's great In These Shoes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not liking it all that much...","review":"It could just be because I haven't listened to the album a lot of times but I don't think this is going to be a favourite Bette album of mine. I like the fact that Bette is happy and seems to have found her true self but I wish there was a bit more zany Bette in this album! Like Bathhouse Betty! I think she really should have added a little more zest to the album. There are some beautiful songs on the album though. I just find the songs are all a bit slow and sound a like. I like a distinct difference in every song. Although if you are a die hard Bette Midler fan, I would suggest buying the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bette is DIVINE!!!","review":"I just want to encourage Bette fans to go out and buy this CD and encourage others to do so as well! Most of the songs are beautifully orchestrated, produced and sung in Bette's signature style! The only missteps on this album in my opinion are 2 tracks. Numbers 4 and 8. Her version of Smokey Robinson's \\"Just My Imagination\\" is too slow and sort of drowned out by the musicians. \\"Color of Roses\\" is a pretty ballad but does not compare to others! Her shining moments are on \\"In These Shoes\\", \\"Moses\\", \\"Nobody Else But You\\" and \\"Bless You Child\\"!!! GO BUY IT!=)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Elevator Music","review":"I hope this CD isn't a sign of things to come. \\"Bathhouse Bette\\" was terrific. Energetic, imaginative.

I love many of Bette's ballads, but none on this album strike me as memorable. Please bring back the campy, brash, energetic Bette.

Bette, don't let these old fogey agents tell you what to sing! Pick your own material and stay away from the boring, unimaginative material. Her rendition of \\"Gypsy\\" was far better. I recommend it over this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe next shipment ?","review":"I never imagined that I'd give a 2 stars rating to a 10 stars diva, but Bette, what happened?

This book by Penguin is the part of the history devoted to the reign of Octavian Caesar, better known as Augustus, the founder of the Roman empire and its first Princep. Dio closely parallels the historical writing of Greek historian Thucydides, in that he is not above putting fictitious speeches in his work to convey a point. Still, his outline of the system that Augustus formed is excellent, and he also gives us a nice account of Actium, the battle in which Agrippa and Augustus defeated Marc Antony and Cleopatra.

Other than Estevez and Sheen, the other actors are unknown but effective and their performances subtle and enjoyable.

It's as if the movie was directed by two individuals, a novice and a master.The first hour contained massive, over-blown portrayals of the four major characters. The introductory dialogues were lengthly with mega doses of dramatic excess. Then after Burgos, in the second hour, a well-executed melodrama surged from s skillfully written screenplay. The actors convincingly reflected pilgrims on their peripatetic journey of renewal. The best and most moving scenes were when few words were spoken: the parador in Leon, placing stones at Cruz de Ferro, the arrival at the cathedral , and standing at the sea at the end of their journey.Anyone who has walked the Camino from St Jean to Santiago could easily identify with the four pilgrims in the latter stages of their pilgrimage."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good hike, you probably have to be there","review":"Interesting tale.

I had read a bout it a while ago, but it was never released to cinemas in my area, but now, having finally watched it, I'm quite disappointed that it wasn't. This is the kind of movie more people should be seeing. It's subtly and thoughtfully acted and written. The scenery is lovely, and I felt nothing was overdone or gratuitous. It could have been riddled with kitschy cliches but it's suitably subdued with just the right balance of drama and surprisingly, humor. The acting done by Martin Sheen is certainly worth an Oscar nomination as it that of his co-stars, notably James Nesbitt(Murphy's Law). This was well worth watching, and I can recommend it very highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"From PITA to Loveable Old Guy","review":"Emilio did a great job in directing his father, Martin Sheen, in this nicely told story of a small group of peregrinos on the Camino de Compastelo.Martin is at his best and does a nice job of making you dislike his character and then falling in step with him near the end.The scenery is fantastic and beautifully captured.We have viewed the film 3 times and have enjoyed it more each time.

This is 800km!As he goes, he meets other travellers and we grow to care about each person, all of whom have their own reasons for doing this difficult pilgrimage.After viewing this moving, beautifully acted film, my family wants to do the trip!

Well worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Treasured movie","review":"This is a movie I rented from Netflix, and ended up keeping for months. I finally bought it on Amazon b/c I felt guilty about how long I was keeping the DVD from Netflix. It is a stunningly well made movie with a moving tale, and characters that become family to each other and like family to the viewers--you see their souls. It is a movie that makes you want to see more deeply and treasure life. Thank you to Emilio Estevez for making this simply perfect movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Spiritual Journey","review":"Martin Sheen is good in every movie I have ever seen him in. His son, Emilio Estavez, has written a compelling story about a father-son relationship that focuses on generation gap issues and they have difficulty communicating even though they obviously care for each other. Everything changes when the father receives a call from France informing him that his son has died while on the Camino de Santiago, a pilgrim's journey. Watch the movie and see what happens next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting mix of personalities","review":"The actors actually come from the countries they represent.

Inspiring and emotional. Anyone that has backpacked Europe or taken any kind of adventure/risk at all will truly enjoy this movie. Brought back memories for myself! My favorite part of the film (besides the scenery) is the amazing relationships that are formed between people that in \\"normal\\" day-to-day life would never be friends. In a world where technology rules, we are becoming less personal. This movie reminds us to get out there, travel, explore, take some risks, and talk to people.I have a feeling that the negative reviews are coming from people that have never left the States or really taken on any true adventure or risk. This movie is superb and it reminds us all to get out there, take some risks, go against the norm at times and LIVE LIFE! Excellent film!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Learn about life following in ancient footsteps","review":"After watching this movie I became very interested in discovering more about the Way of St. James. I am a Catholic and knew something about pilgrimages but I didn't realize that the old pilgrim roads were still used. Although people of all stripes walk the Camino, not all are interested in a religious experience. I have since purchased a number of books that have been written as tour guides with maps, and that have reflected the ancient \\"Codex Calixtinus\\" which was the original document describing the story of how the body of St James came to be interred in Spain. The \\"Codex\\" also describes the pilgrim road, the chuches and refugios open to pilgrims. The movie is a visual journey with characters whose stories are all different.

I was a little reluctant to watch this movie. The premise seemed a little too slow and sappy but I figured I'd watch it with the family on slow night. To my surprise it was actually a very good movie, a nice little travel film, and oh, I dunno, had a decent plot too. There are no car chases, firy explosions or ridiculolus special effects, just good acting, good directing, and a zen-like exploration of who we are, who we think we are, where we're going, and why. It eases into its depth with humor and style and while it's premise borders on the religious pilgrimage to the shrine at Santiago, Spain, it's actually more of a buddy movie with a quartet of unlikely travellers who use the pilgimage as an excuse to deal with various degrees of loss; of loved ones, of self, faith, or just a writer's fickle muse.It's well worth a look, even when it's not a slow night, and maybe when you want something more satisfying from Hollywood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great scenery","review":"Great scenery and theme make up for slim plot.

But last week it suddenly ran out of power after two hours, and today it was an hour and a half before my screen suddenly went blank.It was sold as a genuine Sony one (but for about $50)and it fooled me.It only weighs 120 grams, instead of the normal 190g, and the serial number is hot-stamped and imperfect, not like the very fine stamp on a real Sony battery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sony NPFH100","review":"As stated earlier...the price is quite high for a battery, though Amazon does have a price that is better than most brick n' mortar stores and other online sites. I purchased one for my SR300 as a backup battery. The NPFH60 that came with the camera was nice...but not enough capacity for extended trips. Having these two batteries charged up ready to go before a week or two week long trip will provide ample power. It does stick out the back of the camera a bit...but I can overlook that for the extended battery life! If using a Sony cam, I would recommend this product as it gives much more power than the lower NPFH batteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must-have battery","review":"I bought this because there were so many good reviews about how long it lasts. They were true. I have been on the same charge since I got the camera 3 weeks ago. I have filled two discs and am working on a third. I have also been using the camera for playback. I still have over 200 minutes left. I'm terrible about checking batteries so I think this long lasting battery was the best investment I could make. I will keep the one it came with charged so I can use it while this one is recharging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of power. Its huge!","review":"The numbers don't lie. My SR12 cam came with the H50 (900mah) and I got less than an hour worth of recording. This huge thing is claimed to be 3900mah so it'll last for about 4x as long. Only problem is that its huge! Its depth is 2\\" compared to the 3/4\\" of the H50. So if your current battery is the H50 and its flush with the tail end of the device then it'll stick out 1 1/4\\". Thats not very sexy and now its longer than the carrying case (not Sony) I bought for the camera. The size would not deter me from getting another battery if I needed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"FAKE COUNTERFEIT BATTERY","review":"BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!!! Isn't it illegal to sell counterfeit batteries? BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!! I just received this battery and it is OBVIOUSLY not a Sony battery. It came in a little cheesy cardboard box that looked like it had been used before. The markings on this say SONY, but it does not have the correct labeling on the back. Someone should be prosecuted for selling this stuff online! I bought mine from Click and Play. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"TOO COSTLY","review":"Very costly, $95, for a battery. Almost a third of the camcorder cost. Bulky and extends way too far from the rear of the camcorder. But unmatched performance, gets charged fast and retains charge for about 10hrs. If you got to record a lot and you got some cash to burn, this is the one for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Max Time but with a $$PRICE$$ and weight!","review":"We got this battery because the OEM battery is a joke from SONY. Why would you ship a battery that lasts just over an hour with a 60 GIG HD camcorder? It did cost a pretty penny, but you get 6-10 hours of record and playback time on one charge.The biggest con is the size and the weight of the battery! I can't even get my eye to the viewfinder because it sticks out so far! A small price to pay when you don't have to worry about the battery going dead.Overall, I would say that if you are going on vacation and need (or want) a lot of battery life, then this is the one for you. Why go with the mid-range battery when for a couple bucks more you get the monster! For anyone who thinks it is not worth the money, have a battery go dead one time...can't go back and record it later!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Long Lasting","review":"Used with AVCHD Sony Camcorder.

You might also feel that this large battery compromises the balance of the camcorder in your hand. [This battery also makes it difficult to fit the camcorder into Sony's LCS-VAC Sof Carrying Case.] I recommend that you consider purchasing one or two NPFH70 batteries instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast shipping and great condition","review":"I am very pleased especialy considering the fact that I have been looking for this cd for since 1998.

The software was okay, especially after upgrading from the Philips site. However, load times were rather excessive. But, I'd spent many hours getting the the content where I wanted it, and was just starting to get happy to use it, and then the damn thing stopped working. I had it in my shirt pocket, paused it to talk to someone, and have not been able to revive it since. No, I did not run with it, drop it, or in any other way abuse the thing. It had a gentle, if brief, life of walking and sitting on my desk. And yeah, I had just re-charged the battery, so that is not the problem. After playing it less 100 hours, I guess that it is time to return the thing, and just follow the masses and get an iPod."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good!","review":"After few months the mp3 player is not working well! :-(Some problems with headphones and the sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time on this item","review":"I got this mp3 player as a present and I told the person who gave it to me not to ever buy it for anyone else. First, the first software program crashed my computer. Then when I try the second software program, Musicmatch, it would not let me download music files that I bought from their own website. Musicmatch people say it is the mp3 player and Philips says it is the Musicmatch site. I have not tried downloading CDs, but what is the point of owning a mp3 player if you cannot download songs you bought off the internet? I would just use a portable CD player if I wanted to listen to CDs. Don't waste your time with this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS.....","review":"If you are running windows XP at least. I loaded both forms of software onto my computer. The 'Nike' software crashed my computer everytime I turned it on. Once I managed to figure out how to uninstall that and got the computer running again, I decided to try the other program. Musicmatch. That program worked fine...until...you select the option to load files to portable. After that? You guessed it. Crashed everytime. So now I have a 200 dollar hockey puck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Do it!!!","review":"I was given this product as a gift and it has been a royal pain. I'm not computer illiterate in the least; however, I've spent HOURS trying to effectively download songs to this device. Its like trying to solve an unsolvable puzzle (even with the musicmatch software--which I used prior to acquiring this player).I've spent enough time on this miserable player so I won't spend anymore time on its review. Heed this warning! Buy anything else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rosa Parks song stands up well in U.S. history class","review":"I use the Rosa Parks song as the theme song for the Civil Rights Unit that I teach (11th grade U.S. history).

Philosophy, these days, often wants to fine-tune what is popular (in the sciences) and that is what this book does. Rather than reinvigorate a field in need of much oxygen this book mostly reconsiders issues in a politically correct pragmatism.

This lid is very high quality! It fits the 11-inch pan perfectly and the glass allows you to keep an eye on what you're cooking. If you're looking for a quality lid that will last you years and years, and you need the odd 11-inch size, this lid is for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jones+Nestico+Basie=Beautiful","review":"I happened to hear a sample of a few tracks on an aiplane while traveling on business the other week and it was enough to make me purchase this CD. Tracks 1,4,12 are worth the price of the entire CD. My personal favorite \\"the joy of cookin'\\" is a funky, swinging, masterfully orchestrated piece that will play over and over in your head. The personnel on this CD is amazing, from Bill Watrous on the trombone to Vinnie Colaiuta on the drums keeping it all together. A great CD for any drummer. Reason for 4 stars and not 5.......a few tunes are too slow for my taste, but that's not to say they aren't nice pieces. I recommend to anyone who enjoys the big band sound. It really swings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major, major disappointment","review":"Though it's great to see Quincy Jones finally returning to his jazz roots after all these long, long years, I cannot help but wish that it had been with a more impressive offering. For the band on this album is a studio orchestra, which contains far too many smooth jazz alumni among the few died-in-the-wool jazz players. The result is a very bland, unexciting sounding band, in which many of the solos do not mesh well with the arrangements. There are also too many ballads, and a decided lack of powerful swing numbers. The most impressive piece to my mind was the perennial For Lena And Lennie, a lovely melody which was performed with great warmth here. But apart from this, an album which has VERY little to do with Basie, unfortunately, and one which singularly failed to engage me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Swingin' Band","review":"You have done it again Quincy and Sammy. This album exemplifies what it means to have a big band. The tracks are kickin' I have read some of the other reviews of this project that were not so supportive.

But B&B is just a superbly recorded and Pro Tool'd CD -that's all-. It didn't make me shiver as Jook Joint did.

I found it particularly relavent because I had a high school friend whose mother died of cancer our senior year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book based on the customer reviews","review":"I bought this book based on the customer reviews, and I feel hoodwinked. Usually I can trust Amazon customer reviewers and have never been this disappointed before. I could only get through the first few chapters. I expect novels to bring me into their world with description and character development. This book does not do so, and reads more like a timeline of what happened: A happened, then B happened, then C, etc. The mother has some personality changes with near-zero motivation- other people get sick without changing their personalities -was she just a bi-polar waiting to happen? The girlfriend has zero character development. The father is a total wuss who doesn't defend or bother to understand his son, but the writer seems to revere him.As with another reviewer, I suspect many of the other reviews were written by the same person. I'd like my money back - but the next best thing is to save another from the same fate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Proved to be one of great inspiration.","review":"The Time Keeper was written for the soul to read. Through your intimate relationship with words you accompany your reader on a journey that from beginning to end reveals the honesty of human emotion in both its dimmest and brightest light.

Knowing Kevin in college, I recognized many truths to it from his life and as a mother of two precious sons myself, it was difficult to read at times.

They each demonstrated tremendous courage,strength and forgiveness to rebuild their fractured relationship,knowing that their time was limited.It is a story of love and how we should all appreciate those in our lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good read","review":"If you only read one novel this year, this is one worth reading. Set in the Cape Fear River valley during a time in which many of us grew up, the story tells of one woman's life from the perspective of her only son, a high school upperclassman.It's a timeless tale, dealing with edgy subject matter without becoming morbid. I've read other first hand accounts of family members coping with terminal illness, and lived through it personally, as well. The story is well developed and keeps your attention from the opening chapter until the last."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sincere and poignant","review":"This is a touching story of a young boy's journey into manhood.

Then, there are kids who are FEARFUL about nearly everything (think: Wemberly in Kevin Henkes' wonderful book).This book was very helpful to use with my child, who is a worrier extraordinaire. Any time we can insert a book character or situation into a conversation about a certain fear (\\"Do you feel like Little Rat did when she had to climb that big hill?\\"), it distances the fear from the child enough to talk about it, and makes them feel less alone and \\"the only one who's ever felt this way\\".You don't have to be a fan of the water to understand the dynamic of The New vs. The Familiar and \\"Safe\\" in this book.

Martine Jardin centered Shadowed Love in a society where perhaps even worse injustices have been perpetrated against people of color. The tragedy and brutality of apartheid, as depicted by Jardin, makes every caring person realize that racism continues to be a worldwide problem that wreaks misery and, in the form of so-called ethnic cleansing, causes wars.

This book is to basic, stamping the same stamp 3 times, and that's all that's on the front of the card. The project's aren't imaginative, most of them are designs like a child playing with inks.The other reviewer is correct good pictures, and good information on the basic tools needed, and there use. So I gave it 2 stars for these reasons. But there are other books that will give you this same information, and the projects are more rewarding and attractive. This book is for someone who probably doesn't have any or no background in paper crafting at all. Because most of this information is so basic it's mostly just common sense, if you already have a little background in crafting. But I think even if you are a beginner you would probably want better looking results.

Unfortunately he lost my attention towards the beginning when he whines about his grievous horrible sin in stealing the fruit from the tree. Couldn't he just apologize to the owner of the tree? Maybe buy the guy a new tree? Offer to work it off?The rest of the book is much like that. Augustine feels guilty, horribly guilty all the time. If you are a fan of the Catholic guilt complex, this is the book for you. If you don't think that the earth is horrible place to test you for Heaven, then try someone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated","review":"This is easily the most overrated religious book ever. I believe it is Chapter 6 where Augustine talks about how he used to steal pears just to steal them even though he wasn't hungry is the best thought in the book about how natural evil is to us and how bad we really are.There I just told you the best part of the book. Chapters 10 and 11 are absolutely horrific. Can anyone really say they understood those chapters?Augustine has a major problem with sex in general and is a really bad advice giver on that subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wouldn&#65533;t agree","review":"I wouldn't say I'd be feeling so good.

Anyone who wants to connect with themselves spiritually needs to read his books. Inspiring. Insightful. Meaningful. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book.","review":"I purcased this the first time for myself and was so impressed I bought 3 more to use as gifts. I own several of Kent Nerburn's books, and this is one of the best. It is easy reading, full of inspiring thoughts. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"More wisdom than in any small book I've ever read","review":"This book is so profound I can't describe it. I don't know how anyone could distill so much that was so important into such a small work. Love, death, parenting, drugs, nature, solitude, work. And everything is so wisely expressed. Give this book to every young person you know. No, give it to everyone you know! I defy you to read this and not be enlightened in some way you never imagined."},{"rating":"2","title":"It you could only own a few books, this should be one of them!","review":"I am nearly 50 years old and I can't remember any book I have read any more profound than this one! The writing clarity and depth of wisdom spoke directly to my soul. If I had to leave my home and could only take a few books with me, this book would definitely be one of them. Often times, I read a book and pass it on, but this one was so internally and externally thought provoking, it is one book I will keep with me always and read again and again. For each time it is read, a new truth unfolds that was, perhaps, unrecognized on a previous reading. If your heart is sincerely seeking truth in an incredibly mixed up world, this is the book you must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD.

WHile lecturing at the Fuller Institute he reserched and realised that the mission/church growth was happening around the pentecostal churches - real church growth, not just gospel presentations. And he explains why - pagans, once converted simply expect Christ to be more powerful than their old gods. He also relates how, even missionaries who do not proclaim modern day healing see God's healing hand when new converts turn and even those not converted ask for Christ to heal as it is written in the bible. God called him back to pastor with a message - Preach the word as it says, not out of experience. A very balanced account, explaining how the Evangelicals and Pentecostals are moving closer, each adressing the others objections."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast & reliable with personal touch - thank you!

I read it years ago, and still treasure it today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hold on to your Seats","review":"One would think that this book will keep to the subject of wanting what one has all throughout, but I discovered along the way that this topic covers some more ground. This book is original and does not follow the customary 'self-help' format of many other books. It does make you think with some discussions about the evolution of our instincts and how these are by nature insatiable. The author borrows from recent work in research psychology to make some of his point. The third part of the book is really where the 'self-help' suggestions start, with what he dubs the E, C & G (Empathy, Compassion and Gratitude) technique. All in all, a good book, original as the person who wrote it, expressed his own thoughts and didn't seem to borrow too much from others. It expresses a refreshing view (on a new point of view) of society and the 'moral relativism' of our day and age."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical advise for the hectic modern world we live in","review":"this is some very basic insight to living a simple, content, fullfilling life -- Miller points out, in humorous, interesting ways, the things we already know to be true, but in our haste to live up to marketing hype that surrounds us, we forget.A book that you will want to reread after a while, to imprint the lessons again .... reviewed in Time magazine, this is a book about how to be cheerfull and balanced in all aspects of your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Novel or Comic Book","review":"Wow, this is a very enjoyable Comic, I mean Novel! Ha, no seriously I can't decide what to call it, being a long time Hulk fan and reading over about 1000 of the comics, I found my mind subconsciously referring to the comics when there was lack of any detailed-descriptions. The writing was in a much faster pace with little dialog done comic-book style but the novel seems to rely somewhat on imagery pictures and an establish background for the main characters (General Ross, Quatermain, Rick Jone). All in all this is a great and almost seamless transaction from comic to novel, not forgetting it's comic origins yet telling a new and adventuress story in a Novelistic way, if your a Hulk fan this is a must."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best case ever","review":"Bought this case for my niece's new start in the school band program.

My plan for the storage unit was to consolidate my DVDs in one location (currently they are on two different multimedia storage units). If all you have are single DVD jewel cases then maybe this storage unit will work fine for you. My problem is that I have several DVD collections (Indiana Jones, Lord of the Rings, Star Trek, Star Wars, James Bond - 007, etc)that are in their own little collectable boxes that are just a bit taller than the single DVD jewel cases and do not fit on any shelf except on the very top. They are just about an 1/8 or a 1/4 inch too tall to fit in the middle or bottom shelves.It is a beautiful storage rack and went together very easily but either by design or accident they made the middle and bottom shelves too short."},{"rating":"2","title":"If I can put this together, anybody can....","review":"Although it required absolutely no assembly - just unfold and you're good to go. Stacking two is also very simple and requires no screws or tools yet is acceptably secure.The only drawback is that the shelves are 8\\" high so they only fit standard size DVDs, unless you place the oversized cases on the top shelf, or stack two units which provides extra height on the shelf where they are joined.I got the walnut finish and am very pleased with the appearance.

It's got the capacity of a spice rack.The shelves are too narrow and too shallow for paperbacks,VHS tapes or oversized DVD cases. It's also flimsy; looks like it would tip over very easily.Worst of all: it can't be returned. The cost to ship it back is almost as much as the cost of the unit itself.Maybe I'll start collecting the little liquor bottles they serve on planes.

This is a great way to learn a whole new way of listening. Brian Eno, Laurie Anderson, even Philip Glass, do not quite waft along the waves of harmonics the way Niblock does. If you are moved by David Hykes' Harmonic Choir recordings or Mongolian throat singing you already have the background to appreciate this recording. If you are into trance, you will find this refreshingly free of drum machines.

It was all about getting used to the idea that it's over and you have to get used to the idea.I also wouldn't recommend this book to a woman who has a husband because he sure wouldn't agree with a lot of the things the author has to say about beauty and love past 40."},{"rating":"2","title":"inspiring reading","review":"It's an easy read.

Barbara Sher thinks writing goals and putting them in front of you may work for some, but it doesn't for her.

I take it with my Rainbow Light prenatals and usually a meal and am not constantly reminded that I took it with a taste or if I do burp which I think is a very big plus.

They may not be everyone's cup of tea, but there's no denying good music when you hear it.

There are many different customization options to choose from and some of the mini games are quite addicting. If you want a good RPG for the Neo Geo, buy one of the following instead:-SNK vs. Capcom Card Fighter's Clash-Dark Arms: Beast Busters 99-Bio Motor UnitronOr if you already have these titles, as I do, you shoud buy Faselei! a Mech strategy RPG that looks quite promissing.

I haven't purchaced any of the individual albums on CD yet such as the South Of The Border albums but I believe that they are actually put out by the record label that originally recorded the albums and would probably be a much better quality.

This is the type of CD that you can't help but wave your hands around pretending to conduct the song!........ Ok.... Deep breathes.......o-o...I have to calm down! Now this CD features not just the best musicians but the best composers. They are John Williams (simply the best), Camille Saint-Saens (who composed one of the most famous \\"spooky\\" songs: Danse macabre!) ,and John Morris, you know.... Composed the music for YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN, the funniest movie EVER! And guess what the theme song is on the CD!.. The charming yet spooky.........'Young Frankenstein': A Transylvania Lullaby.

However, for a thematically identical recording, Rachel Barton's \\"Instrument of the Devil\\" beats it, hands down. First of all, the non-coincident selections are more consistent with the theme. Secondly, Rachel just plays better. An obvious example is on Bazzini's \\"Dance of the Goblins,\\" neither violinist plays it perfectly, but she plays it with a real flair and he seems to be struggling to keep up. Overall, Barton and her partner(s) play with more energy, more gusto than Shaham and his pianist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gil Shaham proves he is the best once again","review":"This new cd from Gil Shaham confirms his position as the greatest living violinist.

The repertoire is varied with a common theme. All are short pieces except \\"Devil's Trill\\" sonata by Tartini. I particularly enjoyed Shaham's rendition of this piece with the trills and cadenza very well executed. There is no doubt about his technical skills on the violin, with a demonstration of different playing techniques like left-hand pizzicato, spiccato, double trills, etc. He has also shown his versatility in both slow and fast pieces. DG has both instruments well balanced and recording is very clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Tripe","review":"In the sea of sewage that is popular writing about Freemasonry, this piece surfaces as one of the rankest.Combining a very few facts with a hypewractive imagination, boiled in a broth of pure fantasy with a dollop of conspiracey tossed in, we have it.

There was very little supporting evidence as to their claims. I got the feeling the authors really love being masons but would like it to be more than it is. They seemed intent on connecting it to all of history and world leadership. About half way through the book I felt like I was watching one of James Burke's \\"Connections\\". Where we start out with invention of gin and tonic and end up with the destruction of the Allied firebombing of Hamburg in World War II. You can connect the girl scouts back to the pharaohs if you use this method.What is so bad about it simply being a relatively new service organization whose members do good works; where happy, cherubic men ride in itty-bitty cars for parades?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Most Confusing Thing Ever","review":"There are times when this book goes off on a tangen. Sometimes I actually forgot that the book was about fressmasonry because it rambles on about things in way too much insignificant detail. Also, some of the investigation into the historical aspect of the reasearch unjustly discredits the many things that have already been proven by scholars and archeologist. Overall, I think the authors came to their conclusions about history because they found what they wanted to find and made sense out of things that was most convenient for them. It is sort of like looking for a cloud in the shape of an animal...if you look hard enough you will find it. I was not as dissapointed when I learned that neither of these authors has a background in history, research, or the arts. One is in advertisement while the other is an engineer ??????

It is simply an exercise in circular logic. One example should suffice: They claim that the Roslyn Chapel is not a Christian structure but a Masonic temple. Why? Because Oliver Cromwell, who destroyed all the Christian chapels all over the area spared this one. Why is this? Because Oliver Cromwell MUST have been a Mason. Why? Because he spared the Roslyn Chapel because it was a Masonic temple. It's stuff like this over and over again. I've read better treatises on de Molay being the source of the Shroud of Turin than this turkey. Be warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exciting, but full of poor research & inconclusive proof","review":"Though the authors frequently seem to reveal quite remarkable pieces of evidence, there's little if anything in this book not present in other books. Furthermore, many of the author's 'conclusions' are derived from pure speculation, with many dramatic sentences on the lines of \\"what other than (insert mystery) could explain this (insert circumstantial and often irrelevant 'evidence').\\" I do believe that in many ways, the authors have stumbled upon some elements of the truth, but they have no ability whatsoever to prove their points in a scholarly fashion. Had the authors made the effort to support their often radical claims, this undoubtedly fun read would also be a worthwhile historical text. As it stands, it's fun drivel with the occasional flash of brilliance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Recommended","review":"I charitably gave the book two points -- one for the amount of research done and the second for the proofreading skills of the editor.

Mind, I expected it, but I just didn't think that these two authors could have that much of a sense of inflated ego. I was wrong.I swear to God, will someone who writes on the Templars please take the time and read Malcom Barber's books, and perhaps 1 or 2 others that are really experts. I think you'll find when you review Barber's work that the Templars were not this occult driven organization that these revisionists would place them in.Still, this book was better researched than others in the genre, but still lacked any level of scholarly acceptance.

Losses some points as the author stretches a little in the begining to make connections but gets much better toward the middle and then more so at the end.

A must for any new 3rd degree mason but not really suggested for those thinking of joining masonry as it alludes to ritual work, which could ruin the experience for newbs.

Even if one does not hold a Ph.D nor is a dedicated student of Christianity or Freemasonry, there is much controversial literature available, some of it having been discovered among the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Nag Hammadi Library and Agnostic library, to cause one to question the authenticity of much of the Old and New Testament of the Christian Bible.

I'm an attorney and I prefer to have hard facts, and I will even take well founded circumstantial evidence if need be. These authors base all their conclusions on neither. I was frankly shocked that they would actually say that they had proven \\"such and such\\" to be fact based on their own self-serving speculations. This book is fun to read, but it will certainly not shake Christianity to its roots as it claims it will do. I don't mind the conclusions at all, but they are ridiculous when a person with objective common-sense views the same \\"so-called\\" evidence that the authors put forth to base those conclusions on. In short, nice effort by the authors, but the authors conclusions will never be respected by true academics who study, research, and write on the same general subject matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, on so many levels","review":"As a Jew, Mason, and former History major, I can say that this book has problems on so many levels that its embarrassing.

It is definitively not a book for religious zealots. Too bad the authors did not mention the female branch of the Free Masonry, the Eastern Star, and how it relates to their \\"discoveries\\". For me as an ex-catholic, ex-protestant, ex-buddhist, ex-eastern star initiate, and so on.... it is just another male-made, fussy, tortuous, absurd, aberrant form of spirituality; why to complicate your path to God to that extent?: there is God and there is you, all in between is rubbish and lies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"I was aghast that the authors, Knight and Lomas, would embarrass themselves and write such idiocracy. Their conclusions on the secret rites in Freemasonry was all based on assumptions, not historical fact. They twisted scripture and historical dates to fit their insane theories, and as they did so made the Jewish race out to be the big bad enemy and the Egyptians out to be the great heroes. The book shows just how racist the authors are against the Jews, which only makes me think that the entire Freemason's order (based on Egyptian rituals) probably are racist too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jumping to conclusion","review":"I think that the sources that the authors use are open to more then one interpretation.

The problem with this book is that the authors don't seem capable of rising above dealing with such a complex phenomenon as Christianity with intellects only. They are not inferior, but are blind and even misleading in these sublime areas as faith and God. The book does not portray the Freemasonry in a very attractive light either, judging by the ideas and views of the authors. \\"Stigmata\\" as a movie version of this book is not very bright either, but probably is a better entertainment. I'd recommend to read much more subtle and intelligent \\"Answer to Job\\" by Carl Jung instead, if you are seeking fresh ideas in this area."},{"rating":"2","title":"for people in a quest","review":"Good book, if you ask me.

To the casual reader it might spark an interest in other works on related topics.Unfortunatly, due to it's speculative nature and controversial subject matter, this book will come under fire (with whatever ammunition) is available ) by those who find the topic offensive or dangerous.

The problem is that the story is perfect,way to perfect for anyone to really believe. At every point they are faced with a mystery that has baffled scholars for years and every time a solution magically appears. Never once in their investigation do the authors find something they can't solve. By the end of the book the have not only discovered how Freemasonry began but also know the true identity of Hiram Abiff and the origin of the Turin Shroud!! All this without a single note referring to some source!! The book doesn't even have a bibliography. A little lacking in evidence to make such astounding discoveries don't you think. In the authors' defense their speculation is at least plausible if lacking in evidence and the book is a highly entertaining read with interesting little bits of information.

If you are looking for a good read on the subject, stay away from this one!

Although the book contains a lot of conjecture, it seems as well thought out as any theory dealing with this time period. The assumptions the authors make are presented as such, and, being a discerning reader, I have no problem with them. Undoubtedly it will receive scorn from many who's beliefs are challenged. The physical and scriptural evidence presented is compelling. I don't believe one has to be a Freemason or a Christian to find this book interesting.

While certain 'facts' in this book are VERY far reaching, other insights are very provable and believable! This book has definitely pointed me in some different directions as to questioning the validity of certain accepted 'facts' of history...this book is definitely worth a read.

I've been interested in connections between Masons, and the original church for some time. The first thing I thought was how could I have missed this book. The answer was; I missed it because this book is ridiculous. The book starts out well enough, very concise very informative. Then it takes a turn in an unexpected way. The authors present evidences that are twisted and strangely interpreted, and then suppose conclusions from those twisted evevidences that are sometimes so strange, I wonder if the authors didn't have the conclusion to there research before they actually did any of it. I found this book biased, lacking factually, sometimes deliberately deceiving (e.g. The authors claim the Hebrew word for \\"son of\\" is \\"bar\\" as in barabbas the word is \\"bene\\" pronounced \\"ben nay\\"). The only reason for this deception is to add validity to the bazaar conclusions that are drawn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faulty Research and Extreme misconceptions","review":"As a freemason and one who has been active in academic research, I must say that I would not recommend this book.

The study of Freemasonry is what I was searching for when I purchased this title seeing as I am a Mason myself, and I believe that I can say that is what most people who purchased it were looking for also. For the athiest, beauty at it's best!! I have studied many religions, and as most religious scholars will say, beauty, and ease to believe is most important to people these days. If you can read this and underdstand that most of it is circumstantial and \\"searched for\\" evidence, and only that, it is a great read, if you can't take it as that, you should stick to the Bible, and ask the Lord for insight yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just don't believe it all.","review":"This book makes an interesting read, but I my jaw dropped when the authors dragged the Shroud of Turin into it.

But be aware that the views and conclusions of the authors of this book are to be taken with a grain of salt. They cannot be accused of applying scientific principles to their research and many of their conclusions are based on what they expected to find. A self fulfulling prophecy, if ever I saw one.It would do you more good to read a book that deals with real history by an author who lets you come to your own conclusions.If anything, they've convinced me never to have anything to do with Freemasonry, however square and level they think they are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insulting trash, literary and archeological pornography.","review":"I agree with the previous critical review by Steven Wiles. He said it well. I felt constantly assaulted and insulted by the arrogance of these two authors who can't seem to understand how to do proper research, verified and referenced next to nothing, and delighted in their own scintillating takes on history by their own timeline, their own conclusions, and their own self-admiration of their obviously limited ability for research. This book is trash, it doesn't even pass as a good agnostic take. It made me wince repeatedly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rereading after the Da Vinci Code","review":"I returned to reread The Hiram Key, after recently reading the Da Vinci Code was amazed how much of the background to the plot this book sets out. I have long been a fan of Christopher Knight, since I heard him speak a few years ago, and read and enjoyed this book when it first came out.It remains a really good exploration of Freemasonry and its relationship to the Christian Church and for insights into the secrets of Rosslyn I think it remains the best book around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great writing, Interesting research, weird points!","review":"After reading this work by Mr. Knight and Mr. Lomas, I felt a need to research my Christian roots and question some of the worldly aspects of the early Church. Such questions as: (1) What ever became of the church of James? Is there a line from the Essenes to today's Gnostic movement? How 'Romanized' was the early Catholic church??? This alone made the book worth reading. While I think this book was great, I must be honest to someone reading this review looking for an honest opinion. Certain aspects of the research and 'evidence' that the authors present in this work are far-reaching, at best. While it would be great to trace the origins of the Hebrew religion back to the original pre-Hyksos Egyptians, calling their speculation over an unidentified mummy 'hard evidence' is a bit misleading. I urge the reader to be open minded and discerning at the same time while reading this book.Overall, however, this book was worth the read. I strongly recommend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting story, poor logic","review":"This is a good read for someone interested in the mythical history of freemasonry, but only for the sake of entertainment. The actual logic that carries one precept to another in this book is very poor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some interesting bits, but....","review":"The book has some bright spots, especially some information about the Freemasons that is not readily found elsewhere. But, overall the book is not very well written - there are many leaps of logic, which may have been quite clear to the authors, but are not clear to the reader. Certainly there other books of this type that are much better - viz, \\"Holy Blood, Holy Grail\\" or most of the books by Graham Hancock."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book takes precedence over my current reading.","review":"Upon opening the Hiram Key, I stopped reading another excellent book, James the Brother of Jesus by Robert Eisenman (and his Dead Sea Scrolls books also) -- and will resume only when I finish this great work by Knight and Lomas. They have obviously read Eisenman and much more. I am only half-way thru the Hiram Key, having been sent by it for reference to the Bible, to the Dead Sea Scrolls translations, and to the historian Josephus -- among others including Kugel's The Bible As It Was. The Hiram Key is crammed with interesting facts, speculations, insights, and imagery. This book is a milestone along the quest for a well-founded perspective on the history of religion."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Hiram Key was a bad selection for me","review":"I really did not like this book. The author's are far from historians or journalists. I found about a third of the book to have believable documentation. The rest was conjecture comparable to the Ancient Aliens TV series. I can tell they were sincere on their research, but had to stretch and guess a great deal to fill in gaps. I'm not sure why they felt they had to. The main author of the book has a real issue with religion especially Hebrew and Christianity. He was unnecessarily rude about it. Considering these guys were supposed to be freemasons I am embarrassed and disappointed for them being a freemason myself. Lack of consideration for other religions and being abrasive about it is not a normal trait for our fraternity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing But Speculations","review":"This is my first review. I write it to warn readers not to waste money buying this book. Several other reviewers in the 1 star category have it absolutely right. I thought this book would be about the founding of Freemasonry. But, the early chapters had nothing to do with this topic. They were so full of speculations, and I mean speculations, about early Christianity that I feel that's all I would get about Freemasonry - speculations, not facts.

We have 3 cats and they totally ignore the video. It looks like the video was shot with a low-grade home video camera. In attempt to capture bird sounds the volume was cranked up in a number of shots. This produces a very annoying buzz in many places. Also, very repetitive - the same bird , and for that matter the same shot, keeps coming back...

Some good archive performance pieces, but the highlight to me is Dweezil sitting at the mixing board deconstructing a couple of tunes to show the intricate arrangements and layers that gives the music the rich sound that Dweezil said Frank called the \\"eyebrows.\\" I recommend this dvd for all musicians who are interested in orchestration as well as all the Zappa afficionados."},{"rating":"2","title":"Transduce That Marimba!!","review":"I loved this movie, as did my wife, son (a big Zappa fan), and 13 year old daughter (her first intro to Frank). What stuck with us was the obvious affection with which he's remembered by those who knew him. He was a musical genius with a blue collar work ethic, and a talent for creating music that complemented his musicians' special talents. He was a rare mix.Much of the movie focuses on that band, that band, that band........ Did a better band ever walk a stage? Getting to watch Ruth Underwood play \\"Rollo Interior\\" from \\"St. Alfonzo\\" was such a treat. And don't miss the special feature called \\"Transduce That Marimba\\", which is about.......... just watch it, OK?Frank's gone, way too early, and that's a drag. But years from now, people will listen to:Father Vivian O'BlivionResplendent in his frockWas whipping up the batterFor the pancakes of his flockAnd they'll laugh, and dance, and shake their heads in wonder.

It's that good. It's probably one of the best releases in extreme metal you'll ever get to hear. Members of Opeth, Katatonia & Edge Of Sanity come together as Bloodbath & bring forth one of the most brutal death metal releases ever. Forget Morbid Angel or Cannibal Corpse; this is far more stronger. While Morbid Angel & Cannibal Corpse often stray into guitar solos & slower songs, Bloodbath have 2 things in mind: fast pace & strong grooves. And they carry on that mission extremely well during the album's 3 songs; leaving your ears bleeding for more. Another thing worth noticing on this awsome release is the amazing vocals done by Mike Akernfeldt of Opeth. With his gore - soaked, deep hellish vocals, he proves that he has one of the best voices in extreme metal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Resource","review":"This is a great reference to anyone applying or thinking of applying to law school. Whether or not you agree with the influence US News has in law school admissions it remains a fact of life.

No Problem!","review":"If you're really into pool and billiards but can't afford to buy a table, don't fear. This game is simple excellent for simulating what happens on a pool table; all the physics are there! the game choice is great too, from straight pool to 8 and 9 ball to other games. Good call to include 1 and 3 cushion billiards too; they're great games. Even snooker is included. The career mode is good, but it should be called \\"hustler mode\\" instead. A real career mode would be a league season(s) or series of tourneys, not a bunch of games with money on the line. it's a little dissappointing that most of the good pool venues have to be unlocked; one shouldn't be limited to a biker bar and a garage, as cool as they are. the bottom line?? Get this game, whethere to shoot around by yourself, with a friend, or against a computer player. Studies say playing billiards an hour or two every day is relaxing and stress-relieving...so here you go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easily The Best!","review":"This is the best Pool simulation on the market! I've played them all and Interplay consistently does the best job of rendering a realistic and enjoyable game.If you liked Virtual Pool 2 or Virtual Pool Hall, run to buy this game! Interplay has outdone themselves on this version. The graphics and sound effects are first rate. The game play is excellent.Microsoft should take note. Virtual Pool 3 is to pool simulations what Links 2001 could have been and should have been to golf simulations."},{"rating":"1","title":"When you reach the top players you will never Win","review":"When you reach the top Players ,youll never ever Win .

VP3 carries on the tradition and even runs on XP, which VP2 wouldn't.Two player over a LAN, although a bit tricky to figure out at first, is really fun. And once you figure out how to get it going, is pretty easy after that.All in all, I think this is a great simulation of a real world game. It seems just like playing pool.I have my little boy playing it and he really likes it. And he should. It is just good clean fun. It's pretty easy to control and make shots, even for young kids.All in all, just a refreshing break from the normal games of today. No explosions, killing, or foul language...and the game actually requires some thought and skill."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Pool Game","review":"I have had so much fun with this game.There is 8 tables to play at,this is my favorite table the Hawg Pen.The graphics are great.There is over 100 players you can verse.But you must verse at least 20.I love this game and I hope you do to."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOULD NOT LOAD PROPERLY......","review":"I TRIED THREE TIMES TO LOAD THIS GAME AND IT WOULD NOT LOAD EITHER ON MY COMPUTER OR ON A FRIEND'S.

If not for the flash cards and other posters i would want to pay even less.update:now that i have a android tablet i went on the apps store and found apps that teaches dutch and they are free. if you pay for them you get even more content to learn dutch. so if you have a tablet go find it on the apps store and leave the box set. i gave it 2 stars because it was too expensive , but now i would only give it 1 star because its way too expensive and sinds almost everybody has a tablet now it would a lot cheaper to just download the apps. you would learn just as much for FREE and a lot more if you pay just a little for them. and i think it goes without saying for the rest of their products in other languages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Page Turner!!","review":"Are you looking for adventure and excitement!?

It is faith based without being denominational, religious, or doctrinaire.

The master of descriptive prose has given the uninformed reader a journey, a travelogue, of what it would be like to cross the Australian Outback. And in spite of the period of history it is set, a suspect the trip would be much the same today. Through the eyes of two American cowboys, Australia comes alive for the reader--the flora, the fauna, the heat, the dust, the water, or lack there of, the strange and the exotic are all displayed. There are rustlers, and stampedes, and romance as well, or it wouldn't be Zane Grey.

Russ Thacker especially deserves a standing ovation for his remarkably nuanced stylings.

I'd really rather be in a different room entirely when my kids pop it in the VCR. I think it is just it's sappy-whole-grain-earth-mother narrator that drives me up the wall. To be fair my kids do seem to enjoy it and it does include quite a few fun poses aimed a younger kids who have no problem pretending to be a turtle or roaring like a lion. My 2 year old loves it but I think it walks the razor sharp line of embarrassing with my eight year old (mind you she is super-cool as all eight year olds are). It's worth the money just don't buy it for your 13 year old niece."},{"rating":"2","title":"For under age 8 - GREAT","review":"My daugher has been using this from age 3. While she does have a good ability to concentrate, each indiviual pose (except headstand) is something she can do alone (meaning without assistance). She loves the music and the gentle tone of the narrator. We got it for Christmas and have given it to 2 other friends.

This video has a nice clear picture and sound. All the poses (with the exception of the handstand) are possible for both parent and child to do without any practice. My daughter has been using this video since she was 2 and is now almost 5. When she was younger she would often get bored during the video transitions between poses. Now she can make it through the whole video without running off to do something else. But she loved doing the poses and we both enjoyed the playful way the poses were presented. We recommend this one, as well as Yoga Fitness For Kids Ages 3-6."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was not happy with this video","review":"I purchased this video for my 8 and 9 year olds thinking it would be a true introduction to Yoga. This video bored my 4 year old neice to tears! This is defintely for the 3 year old age group. Thinking it would be a mini work out was a mistake. More time was spent acting silly, looking at zoo animals and learning about nature than was spent on actual fitness. If you need to keep very young children entertained for 20 minutes - this is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disapointed with Yogakids for several reasons","review":"This video was purchased for my daughter, Age 5, who has a good sence of balance and long attention span. The length of time spent explaining and demomstrating the poses is not long enough. I have found that pausing the tape, re-explaining the pose and helping her adjust her position is the only way that she learns the poses. There is nothing said about how to adjust the pose for comfort or where you should feel the strech. The animal segments between the poses are distracting and disturbs the continuity of the \\"work out\\". The animal noises suggested may be intended to encorage the chidren to enjoy yoga but I feel it detracts from the sence of peace and relaxation you feel after your practice. My daughter is in such a hurry to make the noise that the pose becomes secondary. I will purchase a book and use that to help us form our yoga practice. This tape will not be used."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Exercise","review":"This is the best exercise system I have found and this is the best tape on the ball workouts. You can get aerobics, toning, strengthening, balance - just about everything by using the exercise ball. I looked at a few tapes on this subject. This one has a tremendous amount of exercises and each is explained very well, especially with safety tips about proper body mechanics. Anyone interested in exercise, weight loss and toning the body should really use this video.

I have been discharged from PT now and was looking for a progression in ball exercises.This video provides that. It is challenging enough to keep me going, and has helped the progress in my healing back. I am very active, dance, golf, swim, hike, bike, and love the control this video gives me. It has the ability to add control and strength to my back and enable me to do the things I love. I found it challenging and disagree with the other review you have on this video. I encourage everyone to buy it, enjoy it, get back and stomach strength and as I am over 50, it gives me the low impact I need."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspiring, challenging workout if you can stay awake.","review":"I was looking for a fast paced, upbeat exercise ball workout.

This is a high priced video and I was expecting alot more than I got."},{"rating":"1","title":"some problem areas","review":"I am a yoga instructor. I bought this video for my niece but decided to return it. I thought the format was fragmented and somewhat confusing. There was too much footage of actual animals and not enough of the kids doing the poses. The narrator referred to Mountain pose but did not give instruction for it. Also, there is some disagreement in yogas circles about the teaching of Headstand, an advanced posture that was included in this video. I did like the original songs by Marcia Wenig."},{"rating":"2","title":"My son loves this video!","review":"I bought this video on the recommendation of several different people. My son (who is 2.5) loves it, and i love it too. He enjoys doing the 'tree pose', 'snake pose', and 'lion pose'. People should be warned though, it is new agey (which doesn't bug me at all, since i am pretty new agey myself! LOL!). The yoga-mama talks about how we are all interconnected, and you learn how to say \\"Ommm...\\", etc. The songs are sweet and gentle, and each pose is illustrated by different images of animals or nature scenes. We play this video for a little bit at a time, since it is divided into sections you don't have to watch the whole thing at a time. It is a very gentle and lovely...it is the only video that my son watches."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun intro to yoga for young children","review":"I almost passed up this video because of some reviews I had read. But when we saw it at the library, I decided to give it a try...and my 4 year daughter liked it so much she wanted to do it again and again! I found it to be a good video to introduce the concepts yoga to children. There is a small segment between each pose with shots of animals, which helped my daughter better undersand the pose (so don't expect the same \\"flow\\" as an adult yoga session).

It took FOREVER to get through opening credits and warnings. There's so much space between movements that after each one, my kids thought it was over! This video is simply awful because it's so boring. My kids know what a yoga workout looks like and they were very confused that there was so much added \\"fluff\\" to their yoga tape.

The Menu is easily navigated, and the picture quality is crisp. If you're looking at buying, you don't need to be sold on how hilarious and entertaining this show is. If you're debating between the DVD and Blu-ray, I'd say go Blu-ray since, at least when I purchased the price difference was only 5$ for the blu-ray quality discs.

Just started catching up with Season 4-sooo good."},{"rating":"1","title":"This show has tanked","review":"I do not know what happened, but this show has lost it.

Thanks, Amazon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Modern Family - say no more","review":"ever since Will & Grace left the airwaves, i've been waiting for another comedy with gay characters. Here it is. sure, some of it is stereotyped, but i think in the end its done in a loving manner and really does have good values placed at the end. And if it in the end brings someone who is totally homophobic to realize gays can be just as crazy and funny as straights, then its all worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE","review":"I absolutely LOVE Modern Family.

Phil and Cameron are my favorites, but that is not saying the rest of the cast isn't brilliant because they most definitely are. Very very well written show. Not one episode is a disappointment. Hope there are many more seasons to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still great","review":"What makes this show so great are the characters. The storylines themselves may not be as great as in the previous seasons. Gloria is somewhat turning into a caricature of herself but that is the only minor point to a wonderful ensemble. It will be interesting to see how the kids evolve as they grow older."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this show","review":"This is another successful season just like the first two seasons. There were many hilarious episodes such as; \\"Send out the clowns,\\" (guest actress; Ellen Barkin), \\"Me jealous,\\" (guest actor; Greg Kinnear), \\"Hit and run,\\" and \\"Dude ranch.\\"Thanks to the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences (ATAS) for the Emmy Awards for the show in the best comedy category, and to a well deserved Julie Bowen. I think she is very funny and so is her onscreen husband Ty Burrell and step mother Sophia Vergara.

The book is riddled with missing words, run-on words, sentences without punctuation, and -- curiously -- random switches between normal American-style \\"quotes\\" and French-style guillemets (angle quotes). Quite frankly, it was maddening, since I didn't know whether the missing words, especially, were \\"important\\" or not, so doubted the integrity of the text. It's certainly not worth a premium price for what's essentially an uncorrected \\"proofreader's\\" copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Margwrit","review":"While these plays by Karel Capek were written decades ago, they are still timely and are still being produced to this day. I was fortunate enough to have seen \\"Vec Makropulos\\" live in Prague Theater and it was widely enjoyed by the audience. Many of Capek's works question our existence and even though he uses insects as characters, they are not science fiction in the usual way of aliens come to earth, but more as a way of questioning why we are here and what is to become of the human race. Capek coined the word \\"robot\\" to serve as machines that morph into beings that begin to take over their human creators."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"I bought this cable for travel with my external HD and iPod.

The rotation of presidentialism and parliamentary system of government in China between 1925-1837 simply mirrored the wax and wane of influence between Chiang Kai-shek and his opponents. But Excellent book for all Chinese concerned with establishing a constitutional democracy in China. Zhao's argument that the Nationalist Government under Chiang's leadership was a strong presidential type of government is disputable. For the national government under the 1947 constitution was not a presidential system but sem-presidentialism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Single CD!","review":"I recieved a single cd product! The second disc, consisting of arias by other artists in what would make a double cd set is non-existent. It probably was an early promotion, as the Nimbus website (wyastone.co.uk) now lists this product as a single disc as well. However the selections of Caruso recordings included here are arguably his best, and the particular Nimbus transfer method seems to be very appropriate for these pre-electricity recordings. Still recommended highly, with the above reservation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good way to learn French if you're a beginner","review":"I came across this book/cd combo and have enjoyed going through 7 lesseons to date. The pronunciation is an eye opener esp if like me you're taken a few lessons as a kid and recall the grammar but no one taught you the right way to pronounce things. However if you expect this or any book to teach you conversational french you might be disappointed like I was when I tried to read an online version of the French news paper lemonde.

Part of his metafictional world of Viriconium (a city that changes its name as well as its character in connected stories in his VIRICONIUM fantasies), this tale is brilliantly and darkly brought to visual life by the incredible draughtsmanship of Ian Miller. It is the story of a failed assassination attempt on the life of Mammy Vooley, the bizarre goddess-ruler-thing of Uroconium (as the city is called this time). Too bizarre for some, this will be relished by lovers of Lautreamont, delvers in the arcane, and fans of Harrison's often-oblique but always haunting fictions."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't care for it...","review":"My students struggle with the small pieces...wish it was a little bigger.

I used to teach fifth grade and I used this game in my classroom and now use it at home with my kids. Even adults love this game! You have 7 puzzle pieces that must be placed together in order to make a picture which is found on each card. The more you place, the better you get. My child and I like to work a few cards in the morning before the bus comes. Try it, you'll like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it, but my kid wasn't in love","review":"Okay, so it's sturdy. The pieces come in double so you have back ups if you lose one. It's set up as a game about who can make the shape first. I played this with my 12 year old and got a lesson in frustration, but it was fun. In truth you have to cheat in order to get it right most of the time, because the cards are difficult. I tried at least half of them before giving up.

I think I paid around $10 for it, although my purchase was just the black two-piece filter, and not the matching cup.As I write this review, I am sipping yet another delicious cup of coffee made from that same Cafe UNO, which is finally beginning to show terminal signs of wear. In the last ten years, I've used it regularly, but not quite daily, and I've run it through the dishwasher about two thousand times. Literally.My daughter and I both use the Cafe UNO now, and we highly recommend it, both for its ability to make a quick, delicious cup of coffee, and for its longevity. It's rare these days to find a product that does exactly what it's supposed to do, and keeps doing it way longer than you expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"great live muisc","review":"i saw this musical in portland maine at mad horse theatre where it had it new england preime and i fell in love with this show. i do not have the cd but i want it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent supplemental reading for LIW fans","review":"Although this book (really more like a booklet) isn't very long, it provides excellent details about the Ingalls family. Particularly interesting were the details on Carries life. While Laura was remarkable, in ways I think Carrie was even more so. She was a printer by trade and traveled the State of South Dakota working on different papers owned by a Mr. Senn. She also held down a homestead before finally marrying a mine owner who lived at the foot of Mount Rushmore.It also contains some pictures of family members that I have never seen before (esp. of Charles and Carolines parents.)

He was kind, loved his son, was determined to protect his people, etc. There were two times when I didn't like him, though: when he met with the heroine by the wall and begged her to love him, and when he gave her the blooded plaid. The first was too humiliating and the second was too cruel. The heroine was totally unlikable. OK, so she had a troubled past, but she still didn't have to behave like a heartless *****. I do believe the hero could do better than her. But the best part of the book was without doubt Malcom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Annie Oakley - Crackshot in Petticoats","review":"This is a most interesting DVD. I never really understood who Annie Oakley was or how she became famous, and most especially what she looked like. This DVD shows you actual photos and tells the real life story of Annie Oakley.

I enjoyed it very much and am glad to have it in my collection of biographies of people from the Old West."},{"rating":"2","title":"Annie Get Your Gun!","review":"I found this bio to be inspiring!

It is easy to find what you want to learn about and copiously illustrated. Because it is just published, the equipment and technique information is up to date. The author's writing style is \\"just right\\" for conveying needed and useful information without overwhelming you with nuances.
