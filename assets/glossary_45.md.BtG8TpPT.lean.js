Well, this, along with a fast-draining, non-rechargable lithium battery, is exactly what you get with the Concord EyeQ.Yes, it's small, light, inexpensive, and a marvel of engineering.

When I returned and tried to use it again, the display was practically destroyed. It had lines all over it as if it had shattered in the heat.

The long chapter on how NFAs & DFAs work will be of interest to few people.I expected to learn all sorts of cool tricks via regular exppressions and was dissapointed. Sure there are a few good examples, but at far too high a price in time involved and money.This book will only be of use to the very few people who are really into NFA theory.

I finally got around to ordering the book and I am happy to say it doesn't disappoint. If you are looking for one book on the topic, this is it. Unlike typical \\"cookbook\\" approaches, Friedl presents regular expressions as something to be understood, not just used. This leads to a much deeper understanding of a complex topic and, in the end, makes using regular expressions much easier and much more fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Only Book You Will Need","review":"This book is fantastic. Given the complex nature of regular expressions, the author explains the material in an easy-to-understand and clear manner. The read was never dry or boring, like might be expected with such a topic. It covers the topic completely - you will not need to buy another book to learn more.

I've read through it once and there is a lot of material that it covers so it was difficult to comprehend all of it the first time through but I feel I've understood the majority of regular expressions. I think the only part I would need to read through more is the optimization of regular expressions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational, but...","review":"A good book, but it doesn't really end up offering that much. If you are good with regular expressions and understand them, this just gives a lot of more detailed, specific and complex one's. That's not a bad thing, but it's not really something you'd have any reason to use and could be done just as accurately and efficiently with a lot less code. Some of them look impressive, but are just a lot of unneeded code for the sake of looking inpressive.

I found this book to be an excellent source of information on constructing efficient regexps in Perl.Unfortunately, this book is also without equal when it comes to *poorly* presenting information.The tables are unreadable -- visually impossible to decipher, cryptic, cluttered. Edward Tufte could use this as book as a prime example of how not to present information.And it's a shame, because there's a wonderful book buried inside Mastering Regular Expressions.If this book gets proper attention from an ORA editor, I could easily give it 5 stars.

Jeffrey Friedl's explanation of what makes the various types of engines work, and the chapter on optimising regexes for NFAs were extremely helpful. As a network security administrator I find myself having to parse through massive amounts of text and data a regular basis, and thanks to this book, I've been able to better automate a lot these processes and gleam more valuable data from the waves of information waiting to be processed. This book really should be essential reading not just for programmers and web developers, but any one who works in IT or might benefit from the use any kind of scripting / automation."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is about 'Mastery,' not 'solving your problem right away'.","review":"Indispensable.Friedl's 'Regular Expressions' is in-depth and thorough. It has provided me with the framework to become proficient in crafting efficient Regular Expressions as I need them, and that's just what the author intended.It's not a cookbook to solve the problem you suspect might best be tackled with a 'regexp' expression (you know; the problem that made you think of looking at this book in the first place). But a perusal over a few nights -- not more than a week, though -- and you'll be able to work quickly and efficiently in whatever regexp-supporting environment you're in.I never give more than four stars because nothing is ever perfect, but I'd be hard-pressed to imagine a better reference or learning aid than this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than expected.","review":"I have been in computer software developer over 7 years now and never really used regular expression until a year ago. True, you can live without it. But, with regular expression at hand, you climb up another level of programming.

By the time I completed the first chapter, I already started to get rewards. My life is a lot easier now.Even with only the first 3 chapters, this book is well worth its price.

When faced with a short-fused development schedule and needing to get up to speed with regexps rather quickly I found the book to be difficult to navigate, inconcise, and the overuse of bold, italics, and foreign (Japanese?) characters and other oddities very annoying. I thought the book went way beyond regular expressions and therefore found it of little use as a reference guide.

Many of the lessons are repetitive - the same photos are used for various lessons and the same techniques are mentioned over and over again (i.e., photos - Hearst castle, Amazon Indians; techniques - nik Pro filters, Photoshop curves). And some lessons are almost unnecessarily inserted on a whim. Sammon has a well-deserved reputation as a photographer, but his take on digital photography does not do justice to this exciting field. It is an exciting time in photography, and Sammon fails to portray that excitement in his book. I would recommend Tom Ang or the \\"How to Wow\\" series of books for better content. I hope to see a more inspiring book from Sammon in the near future."},{"rating":"1","title":"No help for beginner in digital camera use","review":"Good photos, helpful pointers about taking pictures, too much info on use of Photoshop for beginners, assumption that the reader is using a prosumer camera, and almost nothing about how to use \\"your new digital camera\\"...setting white balance, using all the controls built into these cameras, how to shift your \\"mind-set\\" from taking photos with a film camera to a digital camera...worthless book for a new digital camera user...and I've been taking B/W-Color photos for 40+ years and have my own darkroom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for basic business editing","review":"I ordered this book hoping it would help me with proofreading textbooks.

I have seen other frames that are linked directly to computers, which is the quality I was expecting on my Ceiva. This was definetely not the case. I order 4 units initially, but had to return 2 of them because the flickering was so bad it was difficult to see the picture. I received another 2 replacement units...and sure enough, 1 of those the flickering is bad enough that I am going to send it back as well. The flickering is definitely one issue that Ceiva needs to work out. <"},{"rating":"1","title":"HELP!!!","review":"Product delivered in timely manner. Customer support is terrible for this product.

It's not expected to be on the market until spring 2003 at the earliest. They are looking at adding memory card capability to it, so you can add photos directly to the frame without using the internet, but stated that a subscription will still be required. The subscription's a little spendy for what you are getting. Amazon[.com] won't let prices be shown, so let's just say the monthly fee is equivalent to an individual movie theater ticket.I did purchase the frame last weekend, which initially only allows 10 photos. It takes 3-4 times of the nightly automatic dial-in before the software will upgrade to allow the 20 photos to display."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not ready for prime time","review":"All in all a disapointing experience. I called for help during normal business hours and got a recording suggesting I call during normal business hours. After several hours I still haven't had any luck getting it to work. It is a shame, I had hoped this would be a simple to use grandparent gift. It wouldn't be very kind to inflict this on an elderly reletive. The concept is good. In theory all the recipient would need to do is plug it in and I could send him pictures of his far away family. Great theory but not so great in practice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible customer service","review":"My mother loves the pictures of the grandkids, but the customer service is horrible. It's difficult to find the phone number (hint: look in the user guide). Each time I've had to call them, I've been on hold for over an hour. Each time I've sent them email, it's been over three weeks to get a reply.I tolerated the monthly subscription cost because she liked the pictures, but then the unit died (dead cpu, not a power supply problem) after only six months of service (but out of warranty so there is no replacement). Doing a little arithmetic with the purchase price, sales tax, and subscription fees, I find that I've spent thirty-five dollars a month for those pictures.Great concept, lousy customer service, bad quality control.I won't be buying another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good while it lasted","review":"It took some computer savy to get setup, but once it was, the frame and idea are really nice. That is, until the Ceiva frame broke. No warning, just stopped showing pictures. Not much luck with customer service via e-mail so far. It is hard to rate a product very high when it is broken in 6 months. It also breaks your heart when you get your grandmother used to seeing grandkid pictures on a regular basis then it is gone with no reason."},{"rating":"2","title":"I agree...but....","review":"I agree: the Cieva is a wonderful little gem.

Of course the Ceiva certainly comes in handy. And you can even upload another 750 pics since you, whoops I mean the folks at Ceiva, just upped the promo to a cool 1,000. Thanks.

With the high initial cost (...) and annual subscription (...), you can save much more money by having prints made of your digital photos (about $1/photo) and putting them in an old-fashion frame (that costs less than $20). Although the quality of the image is solid, you have to look straight into the frame in order to view it clearly (i.e., if you are looking at it from even a slight angle, you cannot see the image).And, don't forget that each frame has two wires protruding from it: one that connects to the phone line, and the other that connects to an outlet. In other words, you need to have the frame near both an electrical outlet and phone jack (not to mention you have to find a way to hide the wires).Wait until some decent form of digital photo frame is developed - and more much less."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Gift for Relatives!!","review":"This is an easy to use, gift that I have given to one set of Grandparents and plan to send to the other for Holidays.I have and will continue to recommend this product as a gift for relatives that live far away.Especially good for relatives that are not computer literate."},{"rating":"2","title":"A big hit","review":"I'm surprised at the negative reviews based on the web site. I've managed two of the Ceiva frames for almost a year now, regularly sending back pictures from Europe and Africa, with no failures or major nuisances. They've even saved me a lot on international phone calls of the \\"Arrived OK\\" variety, what with local web access numbers and overnight delivery. The Ceiva web site has improved quite a lot in that period but was never problematic.The frames themselves work well, much better than the 640x480 screen resolution would suggest. I think they traded resolution for brightness, and you can usually see the pictures from across the room, even at non-optimal angles. The resolutely-nontechie parents love them. I always crop pictures and resize them before uploading (the simplest shareware programs suffice, though I use Photoshop for more extensive \\"darkroom work\\")."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pay up!!","review":"You have to pay a subscription just to change pictures.

The concept is amazing. And because of this, I purchased 3 of them to give as gifts for the holiday. None of the 3 worked. None of the replacements worked.

Avoid the frustration and time. Argh!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Idea","review":"One of those rare products that truthfully does what it says, and says what it does.

At the request of Ceiva's customer service department, we tried several different processes to get the frame operational. To date, the product has never worked (including a replacement). Actually, it worked 4 days out of 1 full year.We were appalled when Ceiva declined to give us a refund because \\"it was too late\\". We originally requested a refund in January 2003.This is a \\"buyers beware\\" company to deal with. They cater to deceptive business practices. You might think twice before dealing with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Support","review":"I set one up for my Mom. Great idea and she enjoyed the pictures from our kids while still on vacation. But, like the other reviews, BLACK SCREEN. This happened 5 months after purchase.We contacted CEIVA's tech support by e-mail three times. Not one was answered other than the &quot;auto-reply&quot; acknowledgement. Searched the website for a phone number. None listed. Found these prior reviews about the faulty AC adapters. Couldn't even buy one!Went to Radio Shack with the frame and power supply to try other AC adapters. None worked, even with identical numbers. Back to trying for support but have not heard a thing.I don't think anybody's back there!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken Frame","review":"I purchased this frame for my 75 year old mother in law in May of 2002. Since then I have had four A/C adapters replaced for the frame, and now the frame has stopped dialing. When I called Ceiva I was told it normally costs $100.00 to repair or replace, but if I act today it will only cost me $65.00. This after waiting one hour and ten minutes on hold. If there is one thing I hate, it is to forced into making a decision on the spot by pushy phone salesman. I told the woman to cancel my membership. To cancel the membership requires a $10.00 canellation fee and you only receive 50 percent of your balance. It could be a great product if it were a little more stable, or if it worked at all. Needless to say anyone who purchases a Ceiva frame be prepared for constant problems and poor customer service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Customer Service Imaginable","review":"Although the product is great, it is not worth the aggravation of dealing with Ceiva. Ceiva has the worst customer service I have experienced in a long time. There is no phone number for Ceiva listed on their website and they are not in information. Emails to the company went unanswered for days. When I finally tracked down the phone number, I was put on hold for 27 minutes before an agent came on and told me the computers were down and I should call the following day. Since then, I have called three more times about the rebate and been put on hold for more than 20 minutes each time. It's been four months now and I have yet to see the $100 refund, despite several frustrating calls to the company. Again, the product itself is great - my grandmother loves it - but I would not buy another one until the company puts some support behind its products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Costly fact about multiple ceiva's","review":"I just recieved 3 ceiva frames that I purchased.

That's close to [$$$]. bucks... per year!Holy Moly!Before I purchased, I read the reviews, checked their website, etc. Nowhere is this info revealed. In fact they even promote \\"send pics to multiple frames\\" on their website without mentioning this.Bottom line: Way too expensive for this guy, they're going back."},{"rating":"1","title":"It broke after 8 months!","review":"I loved Ceiva -- until it stopped working. Basically, my picture has a faulty receiver; however, Ceiva says, \\"Not our problem.\\" We spent $150 on the frame plus the subscription cost, and now we are stuck with a frame that doesn't work. Obviously, the equipment is faulty, but Ceiva has NO CUSTOMER SERVICE. They've been kind enough to let me know I can fix it for $60 more. What a racket."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY CEIVA FRAME!","review":"When I first found Ceiva frame I got very excited. It was a fascinating idea. I purchased five of them only to learn later what a waste of money it was. The problem is the design and the service Ceiva provides. Invariably every one of the frames I purchased had difficulty connecting and receiving picture. The website was not accepting the serial number of one of the frames. Each phone call you make to Ceive means at least 45minutes being on hold.The representatives are very poorly trained and just read a series of instruction to you which is completely useless.They never respond to your emails to their customer support service. It is extremely frustrating. Service is poor, unacceptable and lousy. DO NOT BUY CEIVA.

I bought one for my Mom and we had an unbelievable amount of problems with it. Everything imaginable went wrong. The first one we got was bad, we sent it back and had to wait about 3 weeks for a replacement. By then the rebate period had expired and they denied my application. I couldn't get in touch with anyone at customer service who could help me, but eventually did. After that it took about 5 months before I got the rebate, and then the replacement frame failed. The customer support people said the problem was common and replaced the frame and extended our subscription. Even after all of this, I bought another one for my Mother-in-law....and guess what, we had problems with that one too! Not once but twice. We still can't get through to customer service and in the last year they've jacked up the subscription price by about 30% and cut the warrenty to 90 days!"},{"rating":"1","title":"frustrating","review":"cool idea but a waste of time and money,,pictures were not showing up although the ceiva website told us they were.

First of all, it comes in the most drab looking cardboard box. This box looks like it belongs to a product being sold off the back of a truck, not at Amazon.com. While I still believe the concept is nice, the execution is horrible. The picture is unclear, skewed to the right, and grainy at times. The screen is obviously a cheap passive matrix LCD display, which leads one to believe that Ceiva spent the rest of the high retail price on Executive salaries. I think if I had seen the product for whjat it really was, I would have spent the money on a Sony model, or not purchased one at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, but build quality falls short","review":"Wow, what a great device... So simple you could give it to your grandmother.Well, thats exactly what I did 20 months ago. Now I'm sending back the second defective unit. Neither have any signs of physical abuse, but they just crap out. This is really disappointing because its such a great product, if only they could build it better. Two breakdowns (again - no drops etc) is just unacceptable.

It is a unique idea and a perfect gift for relatives and close friends to exchange photos of love ones. I have not been able to register my Ceiva because the Web site says that my serial number is not valid. I can not get into the Ceiva Tech Support as the phone is always busy and they have not answered my E-Mail message. This tells me that they are very busy solving problems. The only concern I have with the device itself is the picture quality. You must view the photos straight on as the contrast drops dramatically as you view from the sides. The quality is no where near that of a lap top computer. If it was it would be great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea - quality not there yet.","review":"I bought this so that I could send my not-so technologically advanced parents pictures faster.

Looks great though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea Poor Execution","review":"Well the idea was great but Ceiva service hasn't caught up to the product. I bought 2 frames for my parents over the holidays. I spent over [price] on the frames and annual service thru Ceiva and have not got the frames operational. We checked the website and it was down. We called the 1-800 and spent over 8 hours on hold and never spoke to a single rep. I am trying to get my money back for the service and haven't been able to reach any one. I am in the process of filing a claim with the BBB and the Ca.

Ceiva determined the first frame was defective and had to return it at our cost. New frame won't connect either, even though settings are correct.

The frame burns out after one year plus a few days. I start doing some research and I read here that this happens to lots of these frames. They didn't offer extended warranty when I first bought it. So now I am stuck. Either I have to tell him \\"no more pictures\\", or I have to fork over another $125 for a new frame. We still have several months left on his subscription. Chalk me up as Ceiva's latest victim. The frame is just not made to last. You'd think for the price, it would last at least a couple of years. GEEZ LOUISE!

Frustrating after signing up on line, uploading images, paying subscription fee. Returned the unit.Second unit. Dead after 24 hours. I'll try anything five times, but not in this case.

The frequently asked questions would only be asked frequently by a moron and there appears to be no practical way to contact a living human being by e-mail or telephone.

The frame is great if you are going to give it to someone who doesn't mind doing a little technical support. I would say on average every four weeks the frame freezes up. It requires a little fiddling with, sometimes a call to technical support, but nothing that takes more then a couple of minutes. As long as you don't mind that kind of thing the frame is pretty cool. It's a little manual if you want to constantly rotate new sets of photos, but easy enough to do. Bottom line though, if you are thinking of giving this to someone who is unable to perform technical support (like my 90 year old grandmother) and you don't live close enough to them to drive out there to fix it for them, then don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"High hopes, poor product","review":"The product concept sounds great, and I had high hopes to use the frame as a gift for a family member. Even with the expensive monthly subscription (why not an input straight from a camera or computer?), I was looking forward to sharing images with the family.The first Ceiva that arrived showed no signs of life when plugged in. Since there is no off/on switch, I was left wondering if it was the frame, the dc adapter, or the wall plug. After trying multiple ac outlets, I returned the Ceiva for replacement.Second frame worked for about a day. While it worked it was great. Then, same thing as the first time around. No nothing. At this point I've wasted enough time on a product that isn't ready for prime time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gift for 85 year old Mom","review":"I almost didn't get this, because of a negative review on Amazon.

Since I live in Southern California I dropped in to complain. Turns out they had bad adapters -they gave me a new adapter but eventually that one failed too. As far as having more than one location, HA!The company has ONE location, in Burbank, CA where the executive offices and everything else is housed. It is a pretty high end rent district and contemporary offices. From my time there I could tell the customer service dept. was there and I heard programmers upstairs as well.

However, it was very disappointing for her when it quit working."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea, Poor Implementation","review":"This is such a good idea it hurts, but the execution is dissapointing.Set up was a breeze and the web site is friendly and intuitive. The problem is that the 12-bit color and passive matrix display produces images of poor quality. There is noticiable dithering and color aliasing, and photos are hard to see from the side.I'm sure a year from now they will come out with a model aith 16-bit color and an active matrix screen. And it will probably cost 1/3 as much.I suspect my parents will still like this, but it's not as gfood as it could be."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Gift of Dissapointment","review":"What a wonderful idea. Too bad it doesn't live up to it's intentions. I bought the frame as a gift, hoping to bring some magic of technology and a constant flow of grandson photos to my parents who will NEVER get a computer. All I brought them after driving a hundred miles and setting everything up both on my computer and at their home was a big dissapointment.The screen is so poor, it is not like a lap top screen it is more like an early game boy which means you have to be at just the right angle to view it and still the photos are totally washed out. Sony makes one for about three times the price but Ceiva was trying to make their's affordable. Even the guy at the Ceiva tech help agreed that the way technology is going there could be a GOOD affordable Ceiva in the future. Sadly the future is not here. I'm returning mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neat Product, Crummy Service","review":"This is a great concept. Initially I loved the Ceiva and miss it right now while it's broken but when my subscription is up I'll switch to another product. 90 day warranty? What's that all about? Had close to $... into it including one year subscription and 7 months into it the unit failed. Oh, they'll fix it for $... I wish I would have bought it at Costco so I could return it. Hope that Ceiva's competition puts them out of business. 90 day warranty shame on you Ceiva!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good when it works!","review":"I have purchased over 8 ceiva frames. When recieved the first it was great and I recomended it to the whole family. So they everybody bought a ceiva frame. Then one by one start having problems. ALL OF THEM BROKE! Eight different frames in Eight different homes. We have sent them back to ceiva for repairs and Ceiva sends them back in the same condition. Ceiva's tech support is not good. It's shame cause they have a good product.Bottom line is ceiva frame are great when they work. But they all go bad. So if you buy a ceiva frame get the extended warranty. Therefore when it breaks wait the 10 weeks for tech support to send it back and pray they send it back in working condition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought 4, only the first one worked","review":"I have attempted to get 4 Cieva frames working. The first one for my mother-in-law worked great. The second, for my mother was DOA - we sent it back. The third for my Dad, required tech support, that was useless, we waited until I visited and the thing was dead at that time. The forth for my Mom is still in the box, she is afraid to plug it in. This is a nice technology in concept. In practice, it is only for techies. I'd advise finding a better gift - or use paper prints. There is less frustration and cost involved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not customer oriented. Hard to get help with their product","review":"I have one of their frames that I gave to my father. It developed some problems. Their web site does not provide any telephone customer support phone number. None. Look before you buy. I emailed them my phone number and asked them to call. They emailed back a non-solution and refused to call me. This is arrogant.When the frame is within a few weeks of having its subscription expire, it starts flashing messages telling you to renew. This is while your subscription is still current. I don't mind an email reminder, which they also send, but in addition to not letting you talk to them, they think they can grab space on your frame for their content."},{"rating":"2","title":"Web interface needs improvement","review":"A great product idea, and (mostly) well-executed. The LCD is not as good as the higher-end photo frames, but this is probably what keeps the price down. My main criticism is the design of the Web site -- seems rather klunky -- requires too many screens and steps to get basic tasks done; for example, to re-arrange the order of photos. Also, I'd like to see configuration options available in the frame itself rather than just on the Web site."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT HAPPY AT ALL with this PRODUCT","review":"I purchased three of these as gifts for relatives that live hundreds of miles away as a means of staying in touch.I am VERY UNHAPPY with this product. It is EXPENSIVE to purchase and get's even MORE EXPENSIVE because you have to subscribe to the service! I bought 3 of these and had to pay for 3 separate subscriptions. (One subscription / frame).Their web site is slow (and I have a cable modem!)and very clumsy to use. You can only load photos of very low resolution ( read low quality).The users of the frame must place this frame in a place where you can attach it to a phone line and a power outlet (always very attractive to have the wires everywhere).You are much better off sending pictures via email!! Even if you have computer phobic friends it's a lot cheaper to snail mail higher quality photos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Your Daily Work Can Make You a Saint","review":"Josemaria Escriva challenges every Christian to unite his daily trails and ordinary duties with Christ's passion. Every short point in this book is a seed that can grow through prayer and meditation into an abundance of spiritual good fruits.Escriva believes that every individual can become a saint.

I have since shared it with other friends of mine. A treasure of a story, relevant to our times, I was moved by Natalie, a character I think most of us can relate to. Thoroughly engaging, this tale is not just a Christmas story, but a story for all seasons and for all people. \\"The Truth About Love\\" is a perfect escape from our busy lives and serves as a gentle, tender and most entertaining reminder that what is most important is to always come center to the heartglow."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought this book was really different but interesting.","review":"Lois Prochaska; This book was like none I'd ever read before. I related to the main character in the way that she always wanted to prove people wrong when they said she couldn't do something, but, also like me, it got her in trouble sometimes. However, I have my own idea about how things happened and will happen in the future, and mine didn't quite fit the ideas in this book, but I think it's interesting to learn other peoples' theories and such."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is the love story that was Gable and Lombard?","review":"Total fiction, and that's too bad, as it was a story worthy of telling. Badly miscast, Lombard comes off as a shrill, foul-mouthed (while she had the vocabulary of a sailor, Gable once said \\"it was music coming from her.\\")shallow wench and Gable is portrayed as a dimwit. Neither is true - Lombard was a warm, caring, giving woman and Gable had more than a veneer of sophistication. The film invents situations, or warps real ones out of recognition, never touching on Gable's infidelities, which were so painful to Lombard - in fact, to draw a simple circle around a very complex issue, Lombard died because Gable couldn't keep his pants zipped, and the film doesn't touch on that at all. To its credit, it does try to capture the essence of their love story, but it didn't have to invent, distort, and mutilate \\"The Great Legend\\" of Hollywood love stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enjoyable flick","review":"First half good, second half not so good. I think Brolin was terrific as Gable. I think he nailed the character. Clayburgh was good as well. As I said, it was quite enjoyable for an hour, then it just lost control of its story and its charm. Too bad. The actor who played L. B. Mayer was great. He had all the best lines."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gable and Lombard","review":"A whitty tale of two famous actors who's only wish is to be together no matter what the film studio bosses say.

Not sure about this one.","review":"I lived in Japan for several years, and speak Japanese. My toddler son is also learning Japanese and I thought this would be a good introduction for him to understand the concept of the country called Japan. It was very skimpy on cultural education. I had hoped the wonders or customs of Japan would be highlighted. Instead, Big Bird gets lost and meets a sad woman who ends up being the bamboo princess. It is all quite subtle and lost on most children, I would guess. Most of the songs are English, not Japanese.I was quite disappointed with this video! On a positive note, I was surprised to see that my 2 year old son seemed to be interested in it. We'll see if it can hold his interest the 2nd time through.... I'm doubtful. I know Sesame Street can do better highlighting a culture!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Big Bird Movie I have ever seen","review":"This movie made absolutely no sense and certainly did not live to the normal 'Big Bird' movie expectations. The movie was very disjointed and somewhat disturbing content for young viewers. A story focused on how a woman continously disappears and then is whisked away by a number of samurai type cloaked men in the woods. Really strange. Not sure why anyone would enjoy this story and definitely do not recommend young viewers watch it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid at all costs","review":"Way too many errors in this book both analytically and historically. The author doesn't seem to know that Max Euwe was once World Champion. He refers to him as a \\"contender for the world championship.\\" Schiller also writes that Petrosian became world champion in 1966 and lost the title after three years. In fact, Petrosian defeated Botvinnik in 1963 and was world champion for six years. He was the only champ to successfully defend his title (in 1966) since Alekhine.And the concluding paragraph for one game actually belongs to a game in another chapter.A very sloppy production.The author put Bobby Fischer's name on the cover to sell the book and didn't care about content.

The Smackdown MITB match was insanely boring and the tag team match with AW (is that even a word or a name?) was just as painful to watch. This ppv had so many no name matches it made me sick. WWE has gone so far down the crapper with PPVs that they can't even fill a full 3 hour show. How do they expect to move Raw to 3 hours if they can't do a 3 hour ppv anymore even?

The spiral weave decoration is actually a separate piece with male thread on each end of a four inch insert. You get 2 six inch rods and 2 twelve inch rods with female threads on each end. So, the shortest length of a pendand is 16 inches. Since we wanted to hang 3 of pendants at 3 different lengths, this wasn't really as close to the ceiling as we hoped. So, I cut one end off of an unused rod and made a close nipple out of it. Worked well. Love them the way installed.

But it lingers, it doesn't go away, and it keeps you thinking about it long afterwards. There are so many levels that meet or careen into each other... It is an extremely saddening book, with no happy ending, and barely a ray of hope. It is pessimistic, as many of the characters are sucked down into and feed on their own vortexes of hate or need. It is a violent protest about man's inhumanity to man, and what to depths our egocentricity allows us to stoop---Mette feels all she does is OK because she is childless; Mesud rides on a cloud of ethnic hate that becomes its own reason to exist and be nurtured; Dr. lo Schiavo has no qualms about removing love and trust in the name of 'charity' and 'humanity', and so on.

This version, even though it's \\"Illustrated Children's Library\\", is disappointingly sparsely illustrated.The book itself is nicely bound with a helpful bookmark.

This book melds statistical process control, and the Theory of Constraints, finally bringing these techniques together in one book. You'll gain a basic understanding of both SPC, and an intro to the Theory of Constraints (TOC), and Goldratts' Thinking Processes (TP). In addition to presenting the tools for process control, measurement, and continuous improvement, the book provides brief bios of both Deming and Goldratt, giving the reader insight into the background of both. Very good book, and a great compliment to other TOC material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than expected","review":"I was very pleased with the rug I received.

It appears she is seeking applause for her contribution to this book. What she fails to realize is the tabloids sell over 70,000 magazines per week for less believeable stories than this one. If you choose to read this rather dull account of a true crime story, then I am ceratin you will enjoy The Lobster Boy's Story, as well.

Ruth wrote this book because she is one nosy, selfish person. In no way does she care about any person in that book, if she did then the book would not exist. Nothing can bring Elaine and Maryann back to life. Both were women who were filled with compassion and a true love of life itself and neither would ever want their lives/names used for Ruth's immmoral, money-hungry book. The fact that Ruth attacks reviews that do not agree with her opinion, shows exactly what type of person is she. If you want a true crime book, look elsewhere.

You get a little of everything in this recording, from old favorites like 'The Thrill is Gone' with Tracy Chapman, and 'Payin' the Cost to be the Boss' with the Rolling Stones, to new songs like 'Keep it Comin' with Heavy D. The cooperation with Eric Clapton in 'Rock Me' is by far, my favorite track.

King. The man loves his music and brings out the best in people he performs with. On this cd they are all superb musicians on their own . There are some wonderful duos here. The first cut with Van Morrison If You Love Me is the kind of soulful and moving vocal that Morrison can do so well. Hearing Tracy Chapman do The Thrill is Gone is worth the price of the cd. I could listen to it over and over. There isn't a song on here that's a throwaway. I even enjoy Keep It Coming with Heavy D and Rap is definitely not my thing.This cd would be a good introduction to the blues.

They are solid feeling and still look dainty. They come out of the dishwasher sparkling and are also easy to wash by hand in the sink.

The only thing is that the one they kill isn't the real lord of the vampenese.The author captured my interest by beginning the story with a battle with the police.

The police and an angry mob are also hunting them.The police chief inspector, Alice Burgess briefly integrates Darren. Then she is kidnapped by the vampanese.

I did not care for the ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best so far","review":"This deffinatly one of the best Darren Shans books so far - it was action and suspence all the way through without any boring points - it starts off with Darren, Mr Crepsly, Harkat, Vancha and their prisoner Steve (continuing directly from the end of Allies of the Night - book 8) trapped in a building surrended by police and vigilante mobs who think that they are serial killers and ends with the death of one of the major charactors in the series.A very good read, recomended for Shan fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Killers of the Dawn","review":"This is the BEST Cirque Du Freak book I have read so far.

May God be with Daddy Pass (and Jimmy D'Aquisto too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Quick, Enjoyable Read","review":"I enjoyed this book for what it is - a short, interesting, and original story. Some criticize the book for being too light on character development, however I disagree. The setting of the story is the main character and the one that is develped most satisfactorily. Had the book been longer (and handled in a more contemporary fashion by its author) I don't think I would have liked it as much. I do not want to spoil the plot here, but if you enjoy medical/lab/biological science fiction along the lines of The Andromeda Strain, you will very likely enjoy this book about an extraterrestrial contaminant running amok in a futuristic, remote lab setting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Potential that goes nowhere","review":"The plot begins with what I viewed to be a good idea so I read on in good faith. But the thought provoking plot about life and death doesn't lead to anything.All I found was a plot that built and built, but in the end there was nothing gained or truly learned. There is zero character developement and they were all flat to begin with, though each looked promising at the outset.The book is to say the most, disappointing. What looks to be a good story turns out rather flat, however intriguing its message, there is no real story to convey that message."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underated I think","review":"Beautiful book.

This book was so disappointing.I kept waiting for the author to start the story. Perhaps I am old fashioned that way, I want a plot. Many issues and concepts were hinted at but it all came to a crashing end with no real closure. Wilson was developing great characters but he kept killing them off before you got to know them. This story of earth science against alien nature is interesting, but it is more just a short story instead of a novel. Actually, it reads like the introduction to one of those space operas (which I happen to like reading now and then, so it isn't a bad thing.)Then just when something could really start to happen, the book ends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mildly interesting but shallow","review":"The story is interesting, albeit far from being original. Characters are weak and unconvincing, and the background story is filled with boring cliches borrowed from distopian fantasies already written and forgotten thousands of times long time ago.

This new crew is sucessful and can sense theessence of the old crew in the wind.What the crap kind of ending is this?Scientifically speaking how does that work? Mystical soundwaves? Good grief that's not hard scifi and is notscientific."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't read this book!","review":"If you don't mind not knowing the history or the background of a story and just like reading about how the main characters are going to die, if you like bilogical warfare and don't really care if the characters succed in thier quest, cause they won't, or if you want to waste 8 hours of your life.

I would call it a very small space opera that has no point."},{"rating":"1","title":"claustrophobic","review":"This book is tense, cramped, and all of the protagonists die miserable deaths. Although technically complex, there is no character development, few surprises, and some potentially neat ideas were unexplored.

Big time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A seed that failed in its promise","review":"Perhaps this thing was intended to be experimental. If so, the experiment failed. The piuty of it is that this is good writing, with a strong theme and a solid, malleable plot. The entire first half of the book is good, the third quartter is what I can only describe as pregnant recividism -- and the fourth quarter pretty much dumps the story. A carefully build-up potential trickles down into futility.I can't say I didn't like the book. I can only say that I probably would have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well-written but peters out in the end","review":"I've read all of Mr. Wilson's books and he is getting better all of the time. The problem he faces is that his books, always excellently conceived, usually peter out by the end. As in BIOS, the characters are basically victims of a (well-conceived) planetary environment, the \\"bios\\" of the title. The characters are mostly stock and are removed from the novel one by one in such a way as to give the impression that the book has no real plot. It just ends, leaving me with the impression, \\"Is that all there is?\\" To Mr. Wilson's credit, the book is excellently written and the sci-fi elements all credible and in place. It's not a bad read, but I wanted more \\"novelistic\\" elements threaded throughout the book. I wanted a plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wilson is the new rising star of hard SF","review":"Much like it's predecessor Darwinia, Bios is an ambitious combination of hard science fiction and pan-universal spirituality. Wilson writes beautifully; I'm envious. Of particular interest is his treatment of emerging biohazards. Let's hope this book isn't as prophetic as it may seem to be. If you really appreciate literature and science fiction (and especially a combo of the two) you owe it to yourself to read both Bios and Darwinia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Subtle and fascinating","review":"Wilson's first off-Earth novel (as far as I know)and a fascinating exploration of the themes of communication and isolation.

Schiller and Watson have created a great little battle manual for facing all the wild, weird and wacky openings that are popular among a certain group of players. The title is a bit of a misnomer, though. Not every line given is truly \\"busted\\" in this book. And some that are rather dubious, like the Philidor Countergambit are not exposed for the frauds that they are. Further, not all the best lines are given (an impssible task in any event) which makes chapters on such important and often-seen lines as the Morra-Smith Gambit in the Sicilian too short. But the unique symbology used by the authors and the overall tone of the book is a lot of fun and worth every penny of the asking price. If you are a regular tournament player you know how annoying garbage like the Grob's can be -- buy this book and be done with it forever!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading Part 2","review":"Forgot to add, author/contributor Eric Schiller is nothing more than a mouthpiece for Dogmatic ideas.

I think for me, this is the blanket. It is warm, fairly soft, has a nice semi thick feel and is a nice Barley color that is pleasant to live with. I have had this blanket for a couple of months and overall, it's been a good deal. I couldn't find anything like it in the stores as I was trying to replace an old one that I've had for over 15 years. That Tennessee manufacturer went out of business - and so I'd buy another or recommend this Merino Wool blanket from Faribault Mills Melbourne anyday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Find","review":"Amazon is the only place I could find a wool blanket with satin binding.

It takes a good deal of attention to detail and concentration to really get the full measure from this book, although it's all in there. Despite the authors' best efforts, there is a good bit of stats jargon in the book, so a reader who is not familiar might have some difficulty. If you're at a point where learning HLM is a logical next step, you'll be fine and I recommend this book. However, if your over-eager faculty advisor told you to learn HLM, despite your minimal experience in stats, you're better off enrolling in a class or workshop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stuck with me for 20 years","review":"I read this book maybe 20 years ago, and it was good enough to have stuck in my mind all that time.

In my opinion, this video is probably good for those who already play a Banjo, but was useless for me as a beginner. It told me nothing about the strings, keys to play in, or how to tune or assure the Banjo is tuned. I was lost! I think Pete Seger is great, but this video did not help me. I am, however, going to use it later, after I learn, to improve my skills."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing.","review":"If you just want to hear Pete Seeger play, reminisce, try to sing, and philosophy, then this is a tape you will want to buy. If you want to learn to play the 5-string banjo, this tape is a waste of time. You are forever changing the volume to hear what he is saying and whoever is off camera talking, asking questions, and reminding him what to talk about is very distracting. I found little or no actual instruction value throughout the entire tape. The quality also leaves something to be desired as it appears to be a copy of the original with some distortions."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good","review":"this is a very good cd from BEELOW (check out his other cds)BOOSIE AND JUVENILE put in work on this cd,PICK IT UP -"},{"rating":"2","title":"An african story","review":"This is a story of an African family who is divided in selling or not their land, meanwhile a satellite expert is watching illegal hunters at this area, it keeps you reading at all times and you learn a lot of Africa and their illegal hunters, how they live, think and work."},{"rating":"2","title":"NFL Greatest Games Series: Pittsburgh Steelers Super Bowls","review":"I purchased the set for my boyfriend.

They were mostly right on. I havent watched all the discs yet, but, the first one was horrible. I couldnt make out the players from the distance shot. Up close was ok, but, I remember these games, and tapes are only from 35 yrs ago. They show highlights from games in the 40's or 50's that are clear, so what gives with this?That being said, I am an avid fan, and havent seen these games since I was 12 yrs old. So, it was fun to watch again. I would say you must be a diehard fan to watch these DVD's, and thats a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where did they get the source for these games","review":"Like a previous review indicated - the quality of these games are below standard - there has to be better quality footage in the network vaults - these look like they were copied from a bootlegged VHS tape instead of the network source tape -- having said that -- it's still a great piece of history"},{"rating":"1","title":"What was NFL Films thinking?","review":"Let me start by saying I am not a Steelers fan. Unfortunately, my Cowboys are on two of these discs, and I love a chance to watch Roger, the original T.D. and Hollywood. I pray... that the Dallas Cowboys set is NOWHERE near the quality these games are. I've found multiple versions of these games on the internet that put these \\"digitally mastered\\" copies to complete shame. Super Bowl X is almost unwatchable and Super Bowl IX? Oofa... The unfortunate thing is, this was a chance to 'get it right' and the NFL blew it big. I rated it one star only because I wasn't sure if ZERO stars would register a review here. Don't waste your money. Go find the games on the internet somewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Supers 9 and 10 are poor quality, will disappoint all buyers","review":"I received my copy and attempted to watch super bowl 9 and then 10.

The 9 and 10 games are worse than any video I have ever purchased. I find it hard to believe there is not a better copy available to the NFL.I would not recommend this set for anyone.Super Bowls 13 and 14 are a bit better quality and of course Super bowl 40 is perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Super Bowl IX and X are NOT watchable.

I was walking around my front yard after getting a satellite fix and the Garman had me walking around in the middle of the lake behind me - which would have been 1/2 to 1/3 mile away. This was purchased to assist me with kayak navigating. With the kind of inaccuracy I cited, it would be very easy to stay lost. The only roads shown are the major highways, so land navigation in rural areas is impossible. The device comes with a cable that plugs into a SERIAL port. I haven't seen a serial port on a computer in five years! Not surprisingly, the default date on the device was in 2006, so that tells me the software is out of date. If the device can only be updated by connecting it to a computer with a serial port, there is not going to be any updating."},{"rating":"1","title":"GPS","review":"I returned this GPS it is hard to read, out in the sun which is where most people use a marine GPS.

Using a serial to USB converter, and some free software (Garmin software will be no help) you can get to the gps data on windows, but good luck if you're on a mac.Also, it is really hard to create new waypoints on the water. This is because if you try and create a waypoint too close to a known feature (such as a highway, intersection, or BODY OF WATER), the GPS will try and use the center of the feature (or something like that). So, to create waypoints over water, your only solution is to manually enter the lat and long (you can't use the cursor to select a point)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"It is height adjustable so it can be used next to table or if you are sitting on a couch.

It keeps my daughter safe and will last until she is three thats great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deserves more than 5 stars!","review":"This high chair is amazing. Love the two trays, when one is dirty you just lift it off and another clean one is underneath. Unlike other reviews, I don't have any issues with staining, or with the tray 'catching' on things. I have the Kasbah brown pattern, we just wipe it down with a Clorox wipe after feeding. Folds very flat, which very few folding chairs actually do. I have been using this chair for almost a year with my 100%+ percentile little girl who eats like a grown man, never had a single issue related to size or ability to clean. Would give it more stars if I could."},{"rating":"2","title":"good purchase","review":"laughed as I \\"assembled\\" chair. easiest baby item to date - 8mo.easy to figure out, stack/store and multiple adjustments. ive been using reviews to make purchases but have yet to review any...this is the first because its really worked out well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Graco Baby Kasbah High Chair Review","review":"This high chair looks nice in the house with its contemporary design. It was very easy to pull out of the box and set up. I like the top removable tray that is easy to wash and put back. The new style of straps are a pain to put on baby (although easier to take off). The primary negative for me is that the tray doesn't push in as close to the baby as I would like it too, and therefore the food that baby is learning to pick up and eat drops easily into the chair and is then unrecoverable for the baby to pick back up (as are toys). I would rather have the tray slide in further and have food and toys drop onto the tray so that baby can get them him/her self."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"We love this high chair. It suits our needs perfectly. It is incredibly slim and easy to set up. There are only two down sides; The little tray does not come off and the height is not adjustable. Still, I'd highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great chair, great looks!","review":"We started with this chair when our baby was 4 months and it was great. It leans back and the 5 point harness held her fine. Now that she sits better we just use the three point harness and we moved the chair to sit a little straighter. Its a great looking chair, fits in with our modern decor. It has great features, and we haven't had any problems with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Highchair!","review":"We ordered this highchair due to its high safety ratings on Consumer Reports. There are SO many pattern choices that the hardest part of the decision was deciding which one we liked the best! The chair has many different adjustments that can be made, which will allow us to get a great fit as our son grows. No regrets--very satisfied with our purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never buy a white high chair! No matter how \\"pretty\\"...","review":"We are borrowing this chair from grandmother. It is pretty, but the WHITE print seat padding is highly impractical! Shows stains quickly. Don't buy this color! ALSO, my 18 month old learned quickly how to remove the tray and throw it on the floor (food and all) letting us know he was \\"all done.\\" Look for one that latches more securely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine","review":"This is a fine high chair and it folds up small enough. The tray liner is pointless though as both it and the tray get dirty and have to be washed every time."},{"rating":"2","title":"great!","review":"This high chair is just what I wanted, except for one thing-the tray will fall off if pulled out too far to take your child out. (Some trays lock at the end) It's not a big deal, but I do prefer that it would lock. I love the color, it fits close to baby, it folds flat, it rolls, it's pretty great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great chair and very user friendly","review":"This is a great high chair and is very easy to set up and use daily. The tray has a removable cover which is great for cleaning!"},{"rating":"1","title":"THE Absolutely WORST and UNSAFE highchair EVER!","review":"This chair (unsafe design!) doesn't deserve any star at all!At first it wasn't bad. As my baby get older, however, she was easily able to unbuckle the so called 5 point harness. The slightest pressure can get the button undone.Long story short, my baby fell out of this awful thing and we ended up with broken collar bone. Absolute nightmare! Absolutely the worst piece of crap ever. (I normally don't use this kind of language) Save your time and money and stay away, by all means, from this very very very poor product."},{"rating":"2","title":"good product at great price","review":"there are many high chairs in the market but this one has a good combination of features for a great price.the seat covers are removable and washable. it comes with an extra tray which is very convenient,the trays are made of plastic and cleans without leaving a trace. and the best feature is it folds up and can stand on it own. it also has variable height adjustments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major design flaw","review":"Ok, so I really like the way this highchair looks but I'm returning it to Graco do to a major design flaw!! My baby keeps getting his arms stuck between the leg joint and the seat!!! He'll be eating, reach down and then he can't get his arm back up which results in a screaming unhappy baby! I've been rolling up kitchen towels and wedging them in the gap. Graco was very good about sending a prepaid label and giving me a full refund but they need to change this design asap!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just What I Expected","review":"I ordered this high chair after reading many reviews on several chairs. We have a small house so I was looking for a sturdy yet compact high chair to keep in the kitchen. This one fits the bill. My 20 lb six month old loves it! He isn't eating too much food yet but he loves sitting in it whenever we are in the kitchen! It rolls from room to room easily and it feels totally sturdy. I'm certain he will fit into it for another year or more. Some people have said that different highchairs were too small for their 2plus year old, but I don't plan on using it that long, so it's not an issue for me. My one complaint is one that I read a couple of other reviewers mention. That is that the foot rest is pretty much useless. It is small, low and too far back. I suppose if one thing could slide this would be it. So all in all a great high chair, although I have nothing to compare it to! I'm very happy with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very happy with this highchair","review":"I really like that this chair folds flat for storage. I am the grandma so it is not in use every day and it's nice to be able to put it away. It is simple to use and everything seems to work smoothly and easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Mom's Review","review":"I purchased this highchair when my son was 5 months old. It is well made,is easily adjustable, and can be put away easily. The Kasbah pattern fits into our decor and doesn't stand out in our living space. I like that the entire chair is easy to keep clean with a simple wipe-down after a messy meal. My son did not need the harness to keep him in the seat, but for younger babies, it would be helpful. From day one, he has enjoyed sitting in the chair and being at the same level as Mommy and Daddy at the table. Great chair at a decent price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Highchair!","review":"This is a great highchair. I bought it because my friends had it and liked it so much. It folds for easy transport.

When I got it together it didn't fold as compact as I needed so I ordered this graco in rittenhouse. I thought based on positive reviews id love it even though it wasn't my first choice. First thing I noticed is it is significantly heavier than the s1. The fabric is super cheap feeling. It's white and black which looks like cream and black on the photo and doesn't really make sense bc the frame is cream. It'snot made of a even slightly wipeable material. Its plan fabric which would stain horribly. It's way too short and the seat sitting area is not very deep and looks way uncomfortable. Needless to say, id rather the other take up room in my teeny tiny kitchen than put up with this garbage. If you want something better quality with a beautiful look go for the safety 1st kensington from babies r us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Safe","review":"I read many reviews on this high chair before purchasing but none prepared me for the poor design leading to an UNSAFE high chair. I can live with inconveniences like the waist strap being too low, the foot rest being too far back etc. but I can't live with safety flaws.1. When my 7 month old son sits in the chair he can reach the red buttons that collapse the seat (for storage) when he pushes the red buttons and then pulls on the front of the snack tray (which he does when he gets excited for another bite) the seat begins to fold up flat.2. My son got his arm caught between the chair and the support legs every time we put him in it. I tried to stuff towels in the gap to keep his arm from getting stuck but they didn't stay (he wanted to pull them out and chew on them)I contacted Graco and they took the highchair back and refunded my money which was helpful but I would not recommend putting your child in this high chair."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible purchase I have ever made","review":"I purchased this item through Amazon after reading the reviews. The product doesn't stand up to it's reviews. The seat cover fell apart after the first hand wash. When I called the customer service the DOTS design that I have paid extra for is unavailable. The alternative that I have ordered, which they have claimed is readily available is not shipped to me for 2 months. There is no follow up. When I called them a month later I was told that even the alternative is on back order, but it will be shipped to me in 3-4 days. Another month, a phone call and after changing to another design I finally got the replacement. Ofcourse the replacement cover doesn't match the chair now."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretty but comfy or sturdy","review":"This is a very good, modern, chabby chic-ish looking high chair but it has a tiny seat and is very wobbly.

Obviously the Graco design staff wanted a label that's easy to remove \\"peel off\\", but for some reason Graco used a cheap label and adhesive that tore off in tiny little strips. I mean I haven't even used this product yet, and I've already spent 10 minutes dealing with the problem of taking off a label.Seriously? spend the extra penny and use a better label!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great highchair","review":"We bought the Graco Contempo Dots highchair for our 6 month old daughter and we really like it.There's basically no assembly required. We just took it out of the box, read a few instructions, unfolded it, wiped it down and were good to go.We bought this chair based on high Consumer Reports ratings and other customer reviews.I understand what some of the parents said about their child's arm getting stuck. There is a rather big gap on the sides of the highchair that my baby's arm has gotten between, but it wasn't tight and came right out. I think as long as you don't leave your child unsupervised sitting in this chair then there won't be any safety issues.The tray is very easy to clean and so far I've been able to wipe the seat cushion clean. The seat cushion is machine washable if needed.We purchased this chair from Amazon using free super saver shipping and we received it within 4 business days. It was the cheapest place I found to purchase the highchair.I recommend this high chair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy and only one problem","review":"I bought this for my daughter to use for my grandson. I wanted something sturdy and easy to use and easy to clean. There are two trays which is nice because it's easy to take off and clean. I was hoping that the underneath tray would swing out or lift off to make putting the baby in easier, but it doesn't. I remember with my kids that, at some point, they will stiffen their legs on the way in or out of the seat and scrape their legs. This is the only difficulty I found with this high chair. The pattern is little boring, but that is not so important. And some may like it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"wow it ia great","review":"love extra tray works great in dishwasher.fits all age of our kids. 1/3/5 yrseasy to moveeasy to collapse and store.i will be buying another"},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy to feed!","review":"We were looking for something foldable , sleek, comfy and good enough to seat the supported sitter. We bought this when we started our 5 month old on solids - he has never complained to sit on it and he has even napped sitting on it a few times! Love my purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great chair - but a bit big","review":"I started using this chair when my son was about 4 months - as it reclines, i was able to used it for small periods of time as a recliner. Also, when I started giving him a bottle at around 6 months, I would sometimes just sit him on the chair, incline to the max and feed him on the chair. Tray is very spacious. I liked it that u can close it for storage, but truthfully, i only closed it when I had people over . The chair is efficient, but it is not particularly attractive. Now the big issue: the footprint when opened is huge! If u have a large space, this might not be an issue, but although not a deal breaker, it bothered me enough that I am now ordering a Kekaroo. I do believe this was the perfect chair from 4-7 months when my baby would stay still on recline position, but now the recline feature makes no difference and I do want a chair that will grow with him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical high chair at a good price","review":"This high chair is easy to clean and I love the additional try insert. It's very comfortable for my son and he loves sitting in it to eat his food or even just to watch me while I'm cooking in the kitchen. The only negatives about this high chair are that the padding is hard to remove to wash in the washing machine (so I just spot clean it) and the straps are hard to adjust according to height. It's doable, just not easy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"My 1 year old, 26 lbs son loves this highchair and so do we. It adjusts in so many ways your child is guaranteed to be comfortable. Goes well with my decor also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Was very disappointed by this highchair. The underside of the tray is rough and abraded my son's legs. The cloth cover gets very dirty in process of a baby eating and requires daily washings. Same with the straps. Returned ours and got the portable Fisher Price and have been much happier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Price - Good Quality","review":"I bought two of these for my 4 month old twins. I searched for months for highchairs. I did not want to spend a great deal of money, but I wanted something that would last. These seem to do the trick. Not only do I love the way they look, but it has 3 reclining positions; since my twins are still only 4 months old, I can recline them back so they are more comfortable. The tray is easily removable, but I don't forsee my kids being able to remove it themselves. They are not too bulky and do not take up too much room. Plus, when you close them, they can be stored in a pantry. The only problem I have so far is that when you remove the tray, there is a piece of plastic that is not removable that goes across their lap. This isn't a problem now, but I can forsee it being an issue when they get bigger, for getting them in and out. But, for the price, this is a great buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"My boy loves it.","review":"Should I say that the highchair met my son's expectations. Normally, he doesn't like to be seated and strapped. But when he is on this highchair, he seems to be comfortable and looking forward to feeding. I haven't tried washing/wiping the cover. Love the extra tray, easy to cleanup after each use and leave behind the first one for the baby to continue to play with his toys. The fact that it saves space and can be carried around gives another plus. I recommend this highchair for babies 6 months+ based on comfort and ease of use."},{"rating":"1","title":"No foot stool","review":"This highchair has everything...but a foot stool! How can Graco forget such an important part like this? Our kid does not like his feet hanging in the air. He has resorted to kicking his feet out and grabbing on to the edge of the table bottom part with his toes because there is no foot stool.

Out of the over 250 shots I took, I may have blown 3 and those were my fault (mostly poor composition). Every shot was superbly sharp, perfectly exposed, even if flash was used, and perfectly in focus. The only criticism that I would make and that is the reason that I am considering a digital SLR, is that it is very difficult to frame each photo perfectly using the eye level viewfinder.On the other hand, if I use the LCD, it is much more difficult to hold the camera steady, particularly in marginal light situations. Of course, this is not the fault of the specific camera, but occurs with all non SLR point and shoots.

It begins strong with \\"China Boys\\" and \\"In a Place Like This\\" and includes the smartly crafted, reggae-inflected \\"Eyes of a Stranger,\\" but it goes downhill from there. Insult is added to injury in that the group's dreadful final album Here's the World For Ya is represented by more songs (4) than any of their other records. Even fans of 80s commercial fluff (like Chicago, Foster's other clients at the time) will have a hard time swallowing the final four.This is not the best way to be introduced to the Payola$, but unless some enterprising label is going to reissue the band's albums, it's unfortunately the only way. \\"In a Place Like This\\" is almost worth the price on its own.

You have to see the way it presents color to believe it. It is not built like a 1960 nikon lens but who cares. If you break it or loose it, buy another one, they are that cheap. This has to be the greatest lens for the price ever make. The zoom range is small and it starts at 35mm (53.5 in flim days), but that is not a problem for most of us.

Unfortunately with the exception of some good one liners by Wooley, the whole thing is a noisy mess. Jimmy Durante is particularly annoying and maybe the movie could have earned a better rating with me without him. I like him alot in other movies, particularly in supporting roles with Esther Williams, but here he is just over the top. The story tries to mix too much and gets lost trying to weave the gags and storylines.

I didn't think the main character's wit was funny, but rather contrived wit that was obnoxious and boring.And the owners of the house were a couple of doormats--the wife fawning to the critic, while the husband didn't have the guts to stand up to either one.After about 45 minutes of it, I couldn't take any more and stopped the film--so I can't say this review is completely fair since I didn't watch the whole thing. But I've seen thousands of films and I can say from experience that if I don't like a film after 45 minutes, 99% of the time I won't like the rest of it.This may have been funny stuff in 1942.

Monty Wooley was the star and so aggravating and predominating that Bette Davis' brilliant performance as his secretary was shadowed beyond recall. The best part that didn't involve Bette Davis was the climax when the lady got put into the mummy case. The only other good part that I recall was the skating scene with Bette and Boyfriend.That is all I can bring myself to say about this. Watch it if you like, but I advise you to rent it first.

He must stay with them while he recuperates, and they discover that having him around isn't the honour they thought it would be as he turns their house and life upside down. Bette Davis stars as his patient assistant who falls in love with a local would-be playwright, and Ann Sheridan stars as a two-faced actress in search of a good role. The performances are all excellent. Woolley blusters and puts down everyone with great style (especially his nurse, Mary Wickes), and Davis is excellent in a straight role that helps to keep the film from becoming too much of a farce and gives it some heart.

A fast-paced, exciting read with a touch of romance, albeit feeling incomplete and a bit far-fetched; I'll probably give Coffey another try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time !","review":"I have been a reader of Jan Coffey's books for quite some time but unless she changes her subject matter this will be the last.This is such a far-fetched subject(electral implants in childrens brains)that I don't know how she came up with it.If I was you I would not purchase this book but check it out at a library.The book is long drawn out and a very boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrilling to the bone","review":"The book was excellent.

It is also a story of triumph and self-respect in the face of those hardships.\\" Those of you sitting around feeling sorry for yourself could benefit on the inside by peeking into the lives of these beautiful South African people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just received the book...","review":"Just received Power Lines and am excited to read it.

She was based in India; her grandson spent his time in Africa. Looking forward to reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ubuntu","review":"Read this book to learn about Ubuntu which is a philosophy of life that Jason Carter found to be thriving in the Swazi.

Let's hope it is not too late...we need it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as her first","review":"I was very eager to read Selah's Bed after reading Resurrecting Mingus. I did not enjoy Selah's Bed at all. I pretty much figured out why Selah was doing what she did, but the story never really grabbed me.

Save your money from this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I bought this book after reading \\"Resurrecting Mingus\\" which I enjoyed. I did not like \\"Selah's Bed\\" as it never really a caught my attention. I believe the constant moving back and forth between present and past was a disservice to the book and the reader. In addition, many questions were unanswered. The author could have talked about her husband and his feelings about his wife's knowledge of her affairs. How did the lovers feel about her? I felt there were a lot of things that were left out of this book that should have been in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully written","review":"This book was so powerful; it made you actually feel what Selah was going through.

Of course, she comes from an unstable family (absent father, promiscuous mother) and Adams keeps on hammering her melodramatic background, to make sure one understands that it explains her current flaws. True, Selah is quite dumb, but the author shouldn't treat the reader as if he's stupid too--repeating the same facts over and over.The whole book looks like it could be the basis for one of those awful made-for-TV movies; the other characters are not much better (or more interesting) than Selah and, throughout the novel, Jenoyne Adams proves she has as much subtlety as a wrecking ball--and about as much talent ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Screw","review":"I bought this screw and was surprised at how well made it was.

In brief, after loading the phone's software (WinXP), it never recognized the phone when I plugged it into the USB port. (There are two programs that run in systray.) As a result, when I opened Skype, nothing happened, even though Skype had automatically set my default audio settings to the phone.I was unable to find any help or updated drivers online. I'd thrown away the packaging so I couldn't return the phone. After a few days, I tossed the phone, too. What a freaking waste of money. The sparse docs were in the broken \\"english\\" that we see so much of in today's \\"qualityless\\" world.

It installed OK on Windows 7 64 bit, and messenger recognizes it as a sound device. It will send and receive messenger calls and the audio is really good. But if you want to actually use the phone keys to dial, answer, or hang up, forget it, the keys don't work with messenger. It won't even ring. You have to use the dial pad on the computer for all entries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good little device","review":"This VOIP phone is a good value for the money; it is exactly as described. Windows Vista recognized it instantly when plugged into a Dell Inspiron laptop (via Gigaware hub). Sound is sufficiently loud, the echo is cancelled on Skype, it rings nicely when a call comes in, and it has already survived several drops to the hardwood floor. It's easy to use compared to a headset for non-video calls."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantanstic little phone","review":"This phone works great and just as advertised. I use it when I don't want to use a lot of minutes on my cell phone such as customer service calls etc. The voice clarity is just as good as my previous VOIP with Vonage and there is no time lag or other problems that I've seen so far. Skype allows usage at no cost for toll free 8xx numbers and charges only about 2 cents/min for other calls to land lines."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap is Cheap","review":"The other reviews for the item were misleading. The instructions were for a phone of a different model. No instructions on what driver to use. Poor quality. Doesn't have full functionality... for example the button functions are unknown and you can't dial numbers from the phone just from the Skype interface.Positives: cheaper than the arm and a leg Skype charges for a handset which makes it passable for rare usage or a knock-around phone.My Opinion: Spend a few extra dollars and get a phone you wont be annoyed by or be embarrassed to show others.

I had no problem using the handset using Skype. I also had crystal clear sound using it on Google Voice, though I couldn't use the buttons for that due to a lack of a driver. Really the keys aren't much of an issue because it's probably easier to just use the program, but it's nice to be able to use the \\"end\\" button.

The sound quality is poor. The buttons don't work very well. It did not work well with the version of Skype and Skypemate that I use, which is the most current one.Although I feel that either of the other phones are worth the additional money, this is one that I sometimes use because I keep it in an unlocked desk in an office where I am often absent. It's nice not to need to bring one of the other phones with me. It's small, doesn't take up much space, and if someone stole it, I would feel that hopefully it had found a more supportive home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Calico Critters Birthday Set","review":"Wonderfully created set,as are all the Calico Critter sets I ordered for grandchildren this past Christmas.

In this case they rated Uniden at or close to the top. I don't believe AT&T was even included. Consequently I purchased the Uniden - twice! Big mistake. Both Uniden systems would disconnect in the middle of a call.

Cheap flavoring for sure, if you want flavor, go with Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard.It mixes so bad, it's almost unbearable. However, I have found that if you stir it up as good as you can, then let it SIT for about 30 minutes, it DOES eventually mix in, but it sucks waiting, and if you can't wait, you have no choice but to \\"chew\\" your protein drink.Finally, the scoop they give you is shaped like a fricken trapazoid...and makes you SPILL if you try to pour it into a sports bottle. I think they did this on purpose so you'll spill and have to buy more. Who in the world came up with that shape?

It is by far the worst tasting protein I've ever had. I've mixed it with water, skim milk, and orange juice, and it's still horrible. I have to chug it down without breathing. Which brings me to my next reason for dislike. It does not mix well. I tried mixing it in a shaker with the wire ball, a small personal hamilton beach blender, and my full sized Ninja blender. I still get clumps. Lots of them. There is nothing worse than chugging down a protein shake that tastes bad, than getting a large clump."},{"rating":"1","title":"may be good whey protein but tastes terrible","review":"I had read the good reviews so thought I would try the Now Sports Whey Protein.

Could be that it's the first vanilla protein I try, but I prefer Chocolate. Th flavor is kind of chalky...It mixes ok, you have to stir a little but it's ok. I tried it with water. I'm comparing the mixability with Body Fortress's whey protein, which mixes very easily.The good part is the protein grams you get per serving. That's one of the best things about this protein.

I have tried 6-7 different brands and always come back to NOW. In addition to being free of aspartame, sucralose and artificial ingredients, NOW brand WPI is easy to digest because it contains only cross-flow micro-filtered isolate, the best protein available. I have tried the chocolate and now the strawberry, both of which are delicious in water and milk. My one complaint about the strawberry is that it is very prone to clumping. I will try to use warmer water as one person mentioned, or find that damn shaker whisk ball, but this is the only reason it is not 5 stars.

What was left out was plot.The story made very little sense and there was almost no plot development. Points were seemingly brought up at random and then dropped. I found it to be a very frustrating read. There were just too many points left unexplored. I can usually \\"suspend disbelief\\" and enjoy a sci-fi book for what it is....fiction.

This is the first and last time, I will ever buy a book written by Lorene Cary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing","review":"This story-line was very confusing. No one character was developed, the dialogue between characters was strained. There were a lot of pertinet parts of the story that should have been expounded on, but instead were just dropped on the reader like a dead weight only to move very quickly to another topic."},{"rating":"1","title":"a disappointment","review":"When i saw the colorful images on the cover of the book, i knew i had to read Pride. Unfortunately, once i started it i realized that although the cover was bright, the content was extremely bland. the plot was interesting enough, Cary just had a difficult time making it come alive. I got close to the end, put it down for some reason and never bothered to pick it up again."},{"rating":"1","title":"LESS IS MORE","review":"While there were some interesting people in this book, I was like the reader from Ohio. I couldn't get past chapter two and haven't picked it up since.There were some interesting people in those first two chapters and some of the incites were original and funny, but I had trouble keeping up with who and what and gave up the ghost.

She is a good writer, but her storyline needs to be more fine tuned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely AWFUL!","review":"This, without a doubt, has to be one of the WORST books, if not the worst book I have EVER read! Absolutely awful pretty much sums up my feelings and from reading some of the other reviews, I feel like I'm not alone in my feelings on this book. I usually read a book in a week to two weeks but this book literally took me MONTHS to finish. It was so horrible that I could only tolerate a few pages at a time before I'd have to put it down again. It was confusing and boring and not worth my time or anyone's time for that matter.

The characters were never fully developed and the conflict between Tam and Roz was never resolved adequately. There just didn't seem to be any continuity to the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many stories....","review":"The novel might have been better with one or two fewer characters. Even though the book is written in a format which focuses on each character for a few chapters at a time, I think these women have so many ISSUES, so many stories, that it is impossible to \\"flesh them out\\" in the book. As a result, I couldn't empathize with these women, nor could I sympathize for them. I also had a problem with the believability of the characters;i.e., Arneatha, when a child is pressed into her arms at the airport, simply boards the plane with the child--instant single-motherhood; Tamara, denied tenure at a NY college, moves back to Philly, with no visible means of support; Audrey is allowed to design a program for recovering alcoholics when she has yet to recover herself"},{"rating":"1","title":"PRIDE should have made me leave this book on the shelf!","review":"For anybody who is reading, May God be with you! The ONLY reason I am giving this book two stars is because when the affair was exposed, the emotional turmoil began. That part was very interesting. After that, there was nothing to invest in because there was nothing left. The title should have been renamed, well, I can think of a few choice words to use on the cover. Believe me, PRIDE wouldn't have made the list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing","review":"I normally make every attempt to finish a book,even if I'm not feeling it.

The introductory chapter left reader trying to comprehend the character of the book. Lorene Cary should have introduced the characters individully before throwing them all together like gumbo at the wedding. Not even the added conflict betwen Roz and Tam could of saved this book. I was doomed from the begginnng.Lorene Cary failed to provide a readable plot for the masses of readers. I felt this book could never appeal to a wide array of readers. Readers in their early or mid twenties would probably not relate to the characters. I seem to be a book targeted for an older group of readers.In the future, I will surely think twice before I purchase another book by Lorene Cary."},{"rating":"2","title":"All Gone","review":"Use as described and it works great.

The tonal and dynamic range is flat, dull, and lifeless -- a shock since the music on the standard stereo CD sounds like it was recorded yesterday.Contrary to Silverline's claim, the music has NOT been remixed into \\"stunning 5.1 surround sound,\\" it has merely been electronically processed to add fake echo and fake room dynamics. The standard CD in 2-channel stereo sounds more \\"surrounding\\" than the DVD-A! Of the 50+ multichannel DVD-As and SACDs that I own, this is by far the worst sounding, and it is the only one that I regret buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pentangle's Finest....","review":"Perhaps the first Brit-Folk Supergroup, Pentangle harnessed the talents of jazz bassist and drummer Danny Thompson & Terry Cox, classical/blues guitarist John Renbourn, blues/folk guitarist Bert Jansch, and vocalsit par excellence Jacqui McShee. It was always a fairly volatile set-up with so much talent around, but at its best (as on this wonderful album) it produced music of timeless quality. The hook track for this, their biggest seller, was \\"Light Flight\\", as haunting and enchanting a melody as you could wish to hear, and which had received a lot of exposure in Britain as the signature tune to a popular TV drama (\\"Take Three Girls\\"). Other highlights here are the heartbreaking \\"Once I had a Sweetheart\\", Jansch's wry \\"Springtime Promises\\", the tour de force \\"Hunting Song\\" and the other-worldly (literally) \\"Lake-Wyke Dirge\\". The quality of musicianship is superb throughout. Pentangles's finest album, and one of the finest folk albums of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterly Blend of Styles","review":"A seamless blend of folk, rock, and jazz, Pentangle's stunning instrumentalists manage to make the old a new and beautiful thing. Jaqui McShee has one of the most beautiful voices in popular music, John Renbourn and Bert Jansch are incredible guitarists and they work brilliantly together on this album performing some of the most melodic (remember melody?) music in pop, without ever being sappy."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's All The Fuss About The Sound?","review":"I really can't imagine what all the fuss is about the sound, as cited by other reviewers. I'm quite impressed considering this a twenty-five year plus live recording. What exactly are they expecting?Now onto the material...This recording captures Pentangle at the height of their creativity. They more than any other group of their day managed to seamlessly blend traditional English folk music, progressive jazz and rock. Working in a genere that decades later became known as \\"world music\\", Pentangle truly blazed a new path. Groups such as Faiport Convention, Genesis, Jethro Tull and even Led Zeplin owe a huge debt to their extraordinary musicianship and songwriting. Now if we could only talk them into a reunion tour. How great would that be?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Album: 2/5; songs: 3/5","review":"What's the point of buying this album if there are so many Santana best of albums out there?

These shoes fit the bill. I had spent a couple hours at the mall shoe shopping, and 80% of the shoes pinched my feet between the tongue and the toes or dug into my heel. The pair I bought had to be returned after a day of walking because they developed a problem in the heel. After wearing these Rockports for a couple days almost nonstop, they have none of those problems. I was very nervous at first about buying shoes online because of the hassle of returning them, but it's tough to go wrong with this pair of Rockports. The only thing I would improve is making the insert a little more cushioned, but it's not a big deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite shoes","review":"These are my husbands favorite shoes for work. He is on his feet much of the day, and these shoes are on the dressier side and are also very comfortable.

Thank heavens Rockport carries traditional styles in many colors--just one reason the company has so many loyal customers. These shoes are well-made, comfortable and look nice. Everything you could want in a shoe.UPDATE: Two months after buying these shoes, the rubber sole on one shoe (in toe area) separated from the leather. We returned them to Rockport, and they are replacing them at no charge. The whole process took several weeks. Rockport makes a determination whether to replace--that takes about a week, and shipping out takes about another week. We were disappointed the shoe split, but we also appreciate a company that stands behind its product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great shoe","review":"I had a pair of Rockports years ago and loved them. I'm glad to see the quality and comfort is still there. When I first got the shoe, I didn't think I was going to like it because it was a little lighter in color than I thought, and the toe is a little more square than I am used to.

They are very plain looking and the sole does not feel that soft on your feet. They look like they would be comfortable, but my old dress shoes with leather soles are much more comfortable.

Being a frugal guy I try to never spend more than about $50 on a pair of shoes for work. However I was also looking for something comfortable and durable, which will bend and flex with my foot rather than just being stiff. These shoes fit the bill perfectly at a price I could handle. I tried them on in a store first to see how they'd fit and then ordered from amazon where they were about $25 cheaper (hitting my $50 limit). I have a 9.5 very average (D-width) foot and I took a size 9 D in these. I've been wearing them a little over a month and they are very comfortable and aren't scuffing up too quickly.

Not a shoe problem, just my oversight for not noticing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"This record is/was a MAJOR disappointment. It's far too late in the 80's-revival game to release an album full of childish, cliche hooks and ideas. It's also a disappointment because The Bravery have talent and a really good guitar player. Almost every song on here sounds the same, and each revolve around very simple, obvious melodies. It just feels too... packaged. There are some standout tracks, like \\"Honest Mistake\\", \\"Tyrant\\", \\"Out of Line\\", and \\"Unconditional\\". Other than that, each track just oozes with mediocrity. If vocalist Sam Endicott learns to shake his Robert Smith/Martin Gore impersonations, and the band tries to write \\"original\\" music, then we might have a good album on our hands... this, however, is not it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than The Killers","review":"Brandon Flowers is already on the record at NME for bashing The Bravery - he says they're nothing but pale imitators of his band, The Killers. He's bashed The Stills, too, so I have no faith that he's motivated by anything more than publicity-hunger. Listening to this album for the first time, I have to agree with comparisons to Robert Smith and early Bono. Unlike The Killers, though, this album continues to be catchy after the first 3 or 4 tracks. Yes, some of the songs do start to sound quite similar to others (and Track 7 is a bald-faced Strokes rip-off, though enjoyable nonetheless), but the I think repeated listening will have these tracks growing on me regardless. The best tracks are An Honest Mistake, No Brakes, Unconditional, and The Ring Song. I also really like Tyrant and Swollen Summer. I'll also say that there isn't anything on here that I dislike, which is something I can't say for The Killers. Grow up, Brandon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blatant Killers rip-off","review":"First off, An Honest Mistake is unfortunately the best song on this CD. Sometimes you buy a CD, and the single is just a harbinger of things to come. Not the case with The Bravery. The Ring Song is something a 10 year old could probably write in...well....10 minutes. Likewise with several other songs on this CD as well. Their whole image makeover from ska to new wave for the sole purpose of commercial success is nauseating at best, unconscionable at worst.

They try to emulate The Killers in every aspect by using synthesisers and emulting the voice of Brandon Flowers. This CD has only one good song and it's the first title on the CD : An Honest Mistake. The rest is pure ****. The songs become very repetitive and they are really, really not catchy or substantial. I will give them some points for using different sound arrangements or instruments on their CD, but that's about it. The songs and the CD are not worth your time or your money believe me.The Bravery are a poor attempt to capitalise on the fury that is new age rock. They do not deserve a second CD, that's how bad their first is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Catchy is catchy is catchy","review":"These are awesome upbeat songs, regardless of how they were made or which influences were drawn from.The drums are exceptional.The guitars are awesome.The synths are awesome.They lyrics and melodies are excellent to sing and hum along to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb","review":"The CD presents old school pop in a new and instrumental way with excellent vocals, a wide range of variety in creativity, and an energy unmatched which sheds pure joy every time I listen to the music."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointing","review":"well most of what i'd want to say has already been said so i'll get to the point.. you either love this, think it all sounds the same and a cheap 80's rip off, or hate this and all that the 80 ectro had to offer.... i guess i'd fall into the cheap 80's rip off catagory... an honest mistake was at least a glimse of what the cd could of done but instead made a cd full of sound a like songs never crossing too far into a differnt style...to compare them to the killers which mostly everyone does, this cd is but a quarter of the worth that hot fuss was.. if you like all that is depeche mode and want more? buy the bravery's weak attept at glory. if you just like the killers and not much else of this style of music.. you can go without them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"Trying to look like the clash trying to sound like joy division and the smiths. nothing new about this band, you want some fresh, new london punk sounds listen to the libertines."},{"rating":"1","title":"a huge mistake","review":"This what happens when you screw around with pro-tools and forget fix the mistakes. The guitar solo at the end of \\"Fearless\\" is so bad and phoned in, it's unbelievable. The keyboard playing is a joke throughout the whole CD, the guitar playing is brutally awful and lackluster, and the bass player sounds like he's playing two big rubber bands. Plus, if it's not the too many momentum-killing changes, then it's the lack of originality. No punch or intensity to be found on the whole damn disc. Oh, and let's not forget the singer, who sounds like he's singing through a tin can. Total Bull."},{"rating":"1","title":"give me a break","review":"Normally, I am very open to listening to new music -especially scenster/indie-hop - and when, months ago now, I'd heard about the Bravery I was intrigued. I turned on the radio here in San Francisco to the best indie station on the planet and kept my ears open. I remember hearing a song and thinking, \\"wow, the Strokes' new song is amazingly good.\\" Then, when the announcer stated that the song was in fact performed by The Bravery, I was horrified.Simply stated: how are these guys NOT the Strokes? Sorry, but they sound exactly like them... but not as good. Lyrically, they are not as original and the lead singer does not have the same passion or enthusiasm in his voice as the lead singer for the Strokes.However, lucky for the Bravery, people are actually buying that they are a unique and catchy band. What a joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Get Franz Ferdinand","review":"I'm not going to tell you they should be in the 80's or that theyre posers or anything like that. Youve already heard that. Heres all im gonna say. If you even almost like the way they sound, just get the franz ferdinand cd instead. Trust me on this one. Everything from the vocals to the general music is like franz ferdinand but with less talent. So theyr you go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the hype","review":"I bought this because I liked \\"An Honest Mistake,\\" and my local radio station recommended it. I was disappointed. It really just isn't a very good album. As William Merrill said, an \\"overall lack of distinguishable songwriting.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"80's Revival Bands: Cream of The Crop...","review":"I think perhaps the finest tribute I can offer The Bravery is this: their CD hasn't left my player since I bought it. I must be going on 6 or 7 consecutive listens now. Very rare for me.How to describe The Bravery's sound? At various places in the CD I hear New Order, The Cure, Duran Duran and early U2 (Oh yeah - and The Strokes, of course.) This disc actually takes me back to the 80's when I listen to it - even more so than recent releases by The Cure, Duran Duran etc..Strong memorable melodies, repeat listens rewarded.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Juicy Sound Sensations to Pop your Eardrums and Speakers!","review":"The Bravery is the best example of Next-Era-Post-80's sound machine I have heard in years coupled with a focus on clever guitar work. Vocalist Sam Endicott is faintly reminiscent, mimicking gravely keys like Robert Smith, drawn out notes borrowed from David Sylvian and Steve Strange. The marriage of synthesizer, guitar and rhythms is unparalled, and makes for a distinctive niche that Bravery has carved out exclusively for themselves. This first CD, down to every song is BRILLIANT and should carry a disclaimer when listening and driving-I not only blew my ears out (and speakers) but nearly crashed my car rocking out. If you were ever a fan of 80's synthro-dance-rock, with legends such as Visage, Japan, TransX, Ultravox and you love Fischerspooner and Bloc Party, then The Bravery will pop your eardrums with juicy sound sensations, over and over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Killers","review":"COmparing this trash outfit to the Killers is blasphemy. And to go as far as calling the The Strokes and The Killers \\"lesser bands\\" makes shame fall upon all those who listen to music and can sort originality from the average carbon copy crap. Do yourself a favor folks, buy \\"Hot Fuss\\" and spare yourself the agony of The Bravery's ripoff sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh come on!","review":"Here's the deal guys and gals. Let's be honest, if you have bought this cd then your wheels have been turning for some time now. You want the real info on the brave? then tune in because here it is. I agree, Cure...uh yeah... Strokes... uhh yeah,...Killers...uhhh yeah... dash of intepol? Blueprint! This CD is a state side release that lacks the mystique of import releases. The debut of the Bravery's self titled ablum proves that following in the footprints of other succesfull 80ish revival bands pays off! I don't know what your looking for when you snap on this disc but there is one thing you have to admit... it's fun! if your bummed that it isn't 'more original' or it doesn't 'sound unique' then it's your own fault! you paid attention to it in the 1st place because it sounds like everything else you enjoy. Take it for what it's worth, judge the book by its cover and dig this CD because it's familiar and a blast! ipso facto, vi-sa vi or whatever!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"*sigh*","review":"well, when i first heard the bravery, i was surprised at how catchy their song \\"unconditional\\" was. and then i heard a few others, such as \\"an honest mistake\\" and \\"no brakes.\\" so i excited to get my hands on this cd when it came out. unfortunately, it's not as good as i had anticipated.first of all, every song sounds the same to me. the first listen through was just enough for me. i couldn't get myself to listen to it again, only if i wanted to listen to the singles. it had no power over me. the lyrics and music are not up to par as some of the newer bands, especially The Killers, (which, by the way, has one of the most original and best sounds, but this reveiw isn't about The Killers, it's about the bravery) Franz Ferdinand, etc. anyways, all in all, this cd is good if you only listen to it once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stop, drop and listen. They're on fire","review":"My brother first introduced me to The Bravery when he played \\"Honest Mistake\\" on his computer. From there on I was hooked on the music. I would just like to point out, that 80's synth pop would have not existed without the help of these three bands from the 70's: Tangerine Dream, and Kraftwerk. Also we cannot forget composer Brian Eno.The Bravery add on to the 80's synth revival of the '00's by adding on to where 80's bands like Altered Images, and New Order left off. they are brillant, and you will be hearing a lot from them in years to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Honest Mistake is the only great song...","review":"Don't buy this CD because you like Honest Mistake, because none of the other tracks come close to living up to it. A lot of the other tracks seem like they're not even from the same band. Instead of the slow determined deep voice used to sing Honest Mistake, most of the other songs have a high-pitched annoying voice.The best songs are the first four tracks. Everything after that sucks. They do that to confuse people, because when you listen to a CD and after four tracks the songs are still pretty good, you think the CD is pretty good. Then when the songs get worse you just think you haven't been paying attention. Also since you'll want to listen to Honest Mistake a lot, you'll hear the songs right after more often, which means less listening to the bad tracks. In the end, it boils down to the fact that there are four good songs on this CD and that's it.I'd reccomend getting the first four tracks individually rather than buying the whole CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Above average Post Punk","review":"Ok, we all hate labels, I know, but for the sake of giving you the quick down-and-dirty, I have to say these folks play straight up post-punk, in the same vein as say The Veils, Echo and the Bunnymen, or The Chameleons UK. Unlike another reviewer profiled here, I may be thick as a brick, but I do not hear the Depeche Mode or New Order influence, sorry. Instead, I would describe this band as warmly poppy without the sugar-syrup trappings, musically great guitar hooks and complete with the requisite angst-ridden lyrics. Sure, they're introspectively gloomy, but they manage to side-step the bleakness of the aforementioned synth pop greats (New Order). Finally, of all The Bravery releases, this is their best LP, and you should get it, if only to snag the masterpiece \\"An Honest Mistake,\\" which should by all means go down as a classic. Overall, this is a great record."},{"rating":"1","title":"Matchbox 20 does Robert Smith?","review":"I'm all for this post-punk revival, but anyone who strives that hard to sound like Robert Smith shouldn't be writing songs like Matchbox 20. I think the Bravery mark the end of this great Eighties trend - or at least its nadir. Which means they'll probably go platinum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzzzz","review":"oh look, another new trendy disco beat \\"lets bring the 80s back\\" band.

However, the further I got in the book the more disappointing the story line itself became.

Amazon can just delete it at any time","review":"Why would anyone buy a Kindle book from Amazon when Amazon has made it VERY clear from their recent '1984' and 'Animal Farm' debacle that they reserve the right to completely delete your purchase at any time? Correct me if I'm wrong, but the point of buying something is to make it YOURS, so that you can do with it whatever you please, not to borrow it for a brief period of time until the person who loaned it to you feels like arbitrarily taking it back. What a terrible idea! Down with Kindle, and down with Amazon!It is my hope that by posting these comments, Amazon will come under pressure to reveal its Digital Restriction Management policy, as well as how its DRM software works. Furthermore, I hope they will discontinue their policy of remotely deleting and/or crippling books that have been purchased. This is America, Amazon.

While I wasn't overwhelmed by it, I did find it to be an entertaining read.The novel's plot is interesting and engaging, and it's obvious that Finder has done his homework ... he seems to have thought through a lot of the potential pitfalls and plot holes. I'm not in the tech industry, but I found much of what he described to be plausible.The problem with the novel is with the characterization. I wish Finder had devoted more of his attention to who his characters were and what made them that way, and how best to show us those characters. If this were a film--and it would make a fun film!--the burden of characterization would fall on the actors. As it is, it just falls. It's the difference between telling and showing. Showing is just plain more effective.That said, I liked the novel well enough to read another by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing end","review":"I read this free Kindle download and loved the writing style and engrossing story. I was feeling so lucky that a free download was so good, until I reached the end. The surprise ending did not feel legitimate; the finely drawn characters turned out to be shams, and we are not sure whether the main character learns anything. Very dissatisfying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite enjoyable!","review":"This book really kept me interested. I was definitely caught off guard by the ending. I would read more by Joseph Finder!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Story, Bad Writing","review":"The premise and \\"story\\" of this novel were great, but the writing is so amatuerish it is amazing it got published.Can there be any more 4-letter words in this thing? I'm not a prude, but these words should be used like salt - just enough to season, too much and its unbearable. The characters seem to suffer from Turrets.Also, the writing is full of cliches \\"the room was spinning\\", \\"his/her eyes were moist\\", \\"stomach was in knots\\". And everthing was like in-a-movie. The car \\"shined like in a movie\\", \\"Ah Mr Bond...\\"The ending had a good twist, but the writing made it hard to give it above 1 Star. If it becomes a movie, I hope they get a good script writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was looking forward to this book as it was billed as a corporate thriller. It was horribly written, almost like a 5th grader is trying to pass off as a adult. The premise is sort of intriguing but in the hands of this author was stultifyingly boring. It's a shame that he couldn't put together a decent read with this premise."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Grisham of the corporate world","review":"I've never heard of Joseph Finder but was intrigued by the reviews. The book is a quintessential thriller and understandably is being made into a movie. The writing is excellent, and plot is fascinating. The easiest way to describe Finder is think John Grisham in corporate life."},{"rating":"1","title":"An enjoyable read if you leave reason at the door.","review":"A young man with little ambition goes from low level loser to the corporate penthouse in a matter of weeks. Although well written, the tale is too implausible for a higher rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Descriptive writing?","review":"I had high hopes for this book, but I, too, was very disappointed. I did manage to struggle through til the end, although I did begin to \\"skim\\" especially through all the room, office, people, etc descriptions....Oh my GOSH!! I liked the overall story line, but was extremely disappointed in the writing -- very amateur. Could have easily been condensed into a not so 'wordy' book and been just as effective. I also agree that dropping the F-bomb and other foul or degrading language (ta-ta's? are you kidding me?) only degraded the book further. Sorry, but I certainly would not recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not like the main character (Adam)","review":"First you think he's a slacker. Then you think he's an idiot. Then at the end he turns into a self-righteous snob. What.. Everyone can play the game, except for you, Adam? Ahhh... your feelings got hurt.. poor baby.I just did not like the main character, and that turned me off of this book. For a very similar story (but with a likable main character) I would suggest The Associate, by John Grisham."},{"rating":"1","title":"Duped","review":"All the five-star reviews convinced me to try this one, but I was very let down. I found the book too shallow to enjoy. The writing kept jabbing me with its cliches and tight imagery, and I got bored. After finishing, I felt like I'd spent the evening watching sitcoms or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I was looking forward to reading this thriller about corporate espionage. Despite a good story idea, however, Finder's execution fell short of my expectations. First, the plot is thoroughly implausible. At far too many points, the protagonist's choices simply make no sense. Second, after a long, drawn-out, almost tedious build-up, the book ends unsatisfactorily, leaving too many loose ends. It is as if Finder couldn't figure out how to wrap things up and just decided not to bother. Third, the characters were under-developed and entirely forgettable. It is difficult to like or relate to any of them, including the protagonist. Finally, the writing is pedestrian, lacking the richness and vigor that might have made a marginal book a pleasure to read.In sum, though I forced myself to hang in there all the way to the end, I wish I had spent my time reading something else. I've given the book 2 stars, but I would have rated it 1-1/2 stars if that were an option."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Inspiration to Aspiring Authors","review":"This story goes from one implausible event to another, leading the remarkably unsympathetic protagonist in a juvenile and predictable rags-to-riches/zero-to-hero story. Along the way the reader is brought in to a world of supposedly high-tech corporate culture about which the author apparently has even more ignorance than he has contempt. The characters are shallow, the plot is unengaging, and the first-person narrative makes reading it like living inside the head of a very dull person.If drivel like this can get published and so well reviewed, it should give confidence to every aspiring writer out there, no matter how bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"The need for sleep is the only reason I put this book down...","review":"This book literally kept me awake at nights. It's so engrossing and exciting that I just couldn't put it down--I literally just passed out reading it each night and woke up the next morning starting it again. Luckily I was on vacation when I began it. I haven't felt this way about a book in a long time and I'm just so excited to have found a great new author to add to my favorites!"},{"rating":"2","title":"4 stars","review":"Paranoia by Joseph Finder is very plot driven, and I agree with oso diablo that the writing style itself was lacking. It was truthfully hard to creep through the first 20 chapters. And, there were points, being a computer geek myself, where I was screaming, \\"You don't need an effing keylogger, if you have physical access to the computer.\\"But by the end, I was jumping out of my seat. Thinking, I want to read more. I completely love Adam Cassidy and hope to see the character again someday."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"I just spent the day reading most of this book and regret it. I wanted a real gripping thriller and this seemed like it was going to be just that, but it got caught up in what I found to be boring character banter and transparent plot maneuvers. I hate not to finish a book so I kept reading thinking I'd get through the weaker parts, but I finally gave up. The book didn't have what it takes to hold me in the fiction, instead I kept finding myself snickering at the writing and attitude, which wasn't exactly what I had in mind for a good read. Try John Grisham, Brad Meltzer or the old realiable Elmore Leonard instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible writing","review":"From the second i picked up this book and read the first page that was jam packed with clichés i was disgusted. However, since i was on vacation and had nothing to do I forced myself to read the novel. I was extremely annoyed by the writing which was terrible and just about dropped the f bomb every other sentence. The writing was not sophisticated in the least. The ending was interesting and I think that the plot of this story was ok. Moreover, the word vomit that appeared on the page was difficult to stomach."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"This is a book I could not put down. There is a lot of intrigue and suspense, and Finder has done a remarkable job of keeping the story-line realistic. Finder does a great job of character development, but avoids any self-absorbed long descriptions that take away from an exciting plot. This book was well-researched, and anyone looking for an exciting, fast-paced, smart, and suspense-filled book should pick this one up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great storytelling kept me entertained","review":"I'm normally leery when it comes to a new author that I've never read before but a friend recommended this book and because it was free for the Kindle I said \\"why not\\". The book was a real page turner, brilliantly written and kept me entertained for as long as I read it. There were times when I felt like I was the actual character and had to put it down because I fear that I was going to get in trouble (fictionally of course). I would have given this book 5 stars if it wasn't for the ending. The ending left me thinking that there was something more after \\"get in the car\\", almost like the book wasn't really finished. Besides that it was a great read and I'd recommend this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reads like a first draft","review":"Paranoia reads like a first draft -- lacks polish and development, character, richness of setting. The result is a bland walk through the life of a jaded protagonist. There is fodder for a good tale here, though in this packaged it's severely underdeveloped. Like other reviewers, I found myself skimming faster and faster as I moved through the book, very disappointed in the overall experience.Normally, I'd simply stop reading, and wouldn't give much time to writing in about books I don't enjoy. In this case, there appears to be a more systemic problem: The notion of the free download for the Kindle is suspect. That this book has been propelled to the top of the downloads list naturally is bunk, and further illustrates for me that the best sellers list is likely contaminated with publisher kickbacks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes the Patterson Boys Look Like Hemingway","review":"This is a 4-star plot burdened by 1-star writing.

Wait for the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost me at \\"ta-tas\\"","review":"I'm not kidding. I was already bored by this book when he described a woman's breasts as \\"ta-tas\\". I groaned inwardly, put it down and haven't looked back. Decent idea for a book but written so badly he makes James Patterson look like John Updike. Boring passages about times gone by, could have cared less about the dad. Not worth the money.

I really enjoyed the light-handed writing style and the fast-paced story (even if there were some implausible situations). It was suspenseful, and I couldn't wait to get to the next chapter.You can tell the author is well-informed on a lot of subjects, and he uses creativity and intelligence, rather than excessive violence, sex, and bad language, to develop the characters and move the plot along.If you're a \\"cubicle farm\\" resident in a big corporation, this book is especially enjoyable!Thanks to Mr. Finder and Kindle for the enjoyable gift.

I wasn't expecting brilliant literature out of a crime novel, but I thought for the first several pages that the author was starting the book in farce mode, making fun of the genre, and I was laughing along with him (or so I thought) at how absurdly poor the writing was, cliches, cheap voice, hollow characters, etc. But then I realized it was actually the book. Whoa. Kind of made my skin crawl. Then I continued in pure fascination as the monstrosity unfolded. I actually got worried about myself wondering if I was indulging some type of masochistic behavior so I stopped. Was it just me?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another One From The Master","review":"This book is so full of cliches, that if removed, the novel would look shotgun blasted. The characters are the usual boring crew of stereotypes, the plot the stock formulaic manipulation with a wet fuse of an ending. The humor, if we can call it that, is mostly scatological (i.e. the \\"get the K-Y jelly\\" variety). Dialogue is straight out of comic books (i.e. \\"That's not a threat, it's a promise.\\") The book is sure to be a winner and transformed into another Hollywood borefest.

The dialogue is something you'd see on \\"Gossip Girl\\" or \\"90210.\\" The only reason I finished it was to see what happens to the moronic main character.The plot, corporate espionage, is ok, but not the way Mr. Finder handled it.

I like to listen to audiobooks when I'm doing housekeeping or other chores around the house, and I have to say this audiobook made me want to invent some more chores for myself so I could keep listening. :) It grabbed me right from the start, and kept my interest all the way to the end. The author is great at keeping the suspense going, and he managed a satisfying - and unexpected - ending to the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"So glad I found Finder","review":"In two words, excellent thriller. This book was so good that I immediately went to read two of his earlier thrillers, Extraordinary Powers and High Crimes-they were also quite good.

One day he gets the bright idea to hack into the company's computer system to pay for a retirement party for a friend of his who works on the loading docks. It's a great party, but he gets caught. He is given the choice of going to prison or going to work for his boss's competitor and providing him with valuable corporate secrets. Adam chooses to become a spy. The level of interest never wanes. This is a fast-paced, action-filled story. Adam Cassidy is a strong and likable character and carries the story well. With books like this, as I near the end, a conflict occurs. I want to slow down and make the book last awhile longer, but I'm eager to read faster to discover how the story resolves. I wasn't successful at going slow. This book is better than a hot fudge sundae and it's impossible to make it last. Be prepared for an unusual ending. A very good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best novels I have read in a long time!","review":"I resented anything which interrupted my reading this excellent book. The story line is unique, captivating and keeps you turning the pages way passed your bedtime. The only criticsm I can offer is that I hated to see the book come to an end.

I've done time as a CEO and this book has some great nitty-gritty on the whole corporate jungle. I love all of the coniving and backstabbing this book has to offer.I don't like how Finder is labeled as a \\"Grisham of the corporate world.\\" I like Grisham and his law novels, but I feel like his books fall into the same structure too often. Finder keeps you on edge for most of the novel. While I have gotten another title of his under my belt, I am excited to read more.All the above being said, if you like this novel, you should check out Grisham's works. One of my favorite's is The Partner. You might also really enjoy the new corporate dark comedy, Manhook. A former exec of Apple wrote it, and it's full of just as many twists, turns, and corporate b*$%!rds as a work of Finder's. Happy reading!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An-noid!!","review":"Two dimensional characters, Swiss cheese sized holes in the story line and was there a plot!!???

Then I realized the paid off hacks who had written them. The story is standard (think The Firm in the computer industry without any real excitement). If you cannot predict the \\"BIG PLOT TWIST\\" you must not read a lot. The author thinks he is funny but is not. He writes like a juvenile. You'll care not an ounce for the characters. And what's with the 'my old man is cranky, dying and does not love me \\" sub-plot - how manty times have we been there?. Too much filler, too little excitement, too little originality. A real disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tennessee reader","review":"Very disappointing. Way to technical for my taste.

I refuse to part with my copy. It's a great insight into the world of high-tech corporate greed and manipulation and Joseph Finder has put it all together in this action thriller. It's been a long time since I've given up my much needed sleep to keep the bedisde light on in order to finish a book, but Paranoia made me do just that. I was sure I had the ending all figured out but was thrown with such a curve that I sat there just going \\"Wow\\". I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Come On","review":"I was mislead by all the 5-star ratings into buying this book. After reading it, all I can assume is that the author has more friends than talent. A thriller is a thriller, and I don't expect great literature, but I do hope for reasonably competent writing. I expect characters that aren't cliches, a plot that hasn't been done over and over, dialogue that has some zip and doesn't stoop to bathroom humor. This book is like too many of hollywood's recent movies--the same boring stuff. I can not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thin is In","review":"Although the sales certainly haven't lived up to the hype, I thought I'd try this one anyway because of the many 5-star reviews here on Amazon, which I've always found very helpful in the past. BIG mistake! This book is anorexic - where is the content? where is the joy of the written word? where is the interest, creativity, heart? Honestly - where is the author? I couldn't keep my mind in the story for wondering at the thinness of the craft and the blatantly formulaic plot and characters.It's one thing to want an easy, entertaining read for a plane flight. But there's more to a third reading of \\"Skymall\\" than there is to this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"For ppl who read more...mature novels i guess.","review":"This was an amazing book...I LOVED it. I actually bought it for my older sisters birthday but ended up reading it myself. It's for 12-13 year olds, probably really mature for their age. Younger readers will probably find it boring-and a little inappropriate. Ummm...how about this: if you've read Dan Brown novels and liked them, you can read this book.

Nothing fancy, just a couple of pages should be folded."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete and utter trash!","review":"I downloaded the book because of all the positive reviews. However, I couldn't even get through the first chapter with all the bad language.

I hadn't predicted the ending, so that made it even better. I look forward to more books from Mr. Finder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"The other reviewers who gave this book one and two starts had it right. Adam is not believable at all. Once he crosses over to the other company and gets a great apt to live in with a great view, he suddenly turns into someone with all kinds of insight into other people. The characters are one-dimensional and cliched and it's WAY too wordy. The author threw a little bit of everything in there - corporate espionage, poor kid makes it big, sex, humor, sick parent,cranky old man, washed up inventors, secrets, lies, etc etc etc.... too much.The ending was so bad that it made me angry. I invested a fair amount of time reading this book on my iPod touch and when I read the ending, I couldn't believe it. I'm wondering if there was more that it didn't download!! The ending was one of the worst I've read ---ever.I'm sorry to those who love the book. I don't get why you do, but then, you probably don't get why I don't love it, either!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only If","review":"If you like to read the same basic thriller that's been published so many times before, if you enjoy generic obvious humor, if you want nothing fresh or out of the ordinary, if you believe in supporting things that have been designed only to make money--this might be for you.

She is innocent, but as the saying goes, she \\"was not born yesterday.Great Romantic Read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"I was a little concerned about Hope's character- I don't usually like heroines that like to fade off in the background.

In \\"Success is a Journey\\", Jeffrey Mayer gives you practical advise that you can put to work right away. A lot of the advice is familiar: set goals, keep a prioritized task list, maintain a good network of contacts. However, the book shows you how to do these things very easily, without having to adopt a cumbersome process. A lot of the advice just shows you easy ways to improve on the things you are probably already doing. I just finished the book, but already have put to use at least 5-6 of the suggestions which are already having a positive impact on my productivity.

They are long and irrelevant to the main story and at a certain point makes you stop caring about the story altogether. The main premise is interesting...it's about Lois and Clark's marriage being on the rocks. Superman tries his best to accomodate to her feelings or at least what he perceives to be her feelings. While this story can be told in a limited number of issues, DC comics opts to spread it over other mini-stories that are much less interesting.

Overall these songs are mellower than those found on other releases by the band. Do not let that scare you away, there is a great deal of passion displayed through these four songs. This may be a good starting point for those who are not familiar with Pendragon. Pendragon's somewhat simplified and melodic mix of mid period Genesis (late 70's early 80's), early Marillion (Fish era) and Pink Floyd (Late 70's early 80's) is well displayed here. This Ep is worth it just to hear the wondeful \\"Sister Bluebird\\" which is one of my favorite songs by the band. Fans of the so called \\"neoprogressive rock\\" sound, i.e. IQ, Pallas, Marillion, Arena, Jadis, etc. should enjoy Pendragon.

This plot device though is not as funny as one could imagine though, at least not in the long run.Simon looks again a little too self complacent and his dialogues with the handsome Inspector Chase are a lot less sparkling than they could have been. Even the sexual tension between him and the same inspector as well as that with Giles appear dimmer than they could have been.A fun read, but less than expected, not to mention the annoying inconsistencies scattered here and there, such as a statement about Giles not being aware of his beauty followed by right the opposite one after no more than two pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I enjoy Charlaine Harris's Southern Vampire Mystery series so I picked up this book.

I had my HP Deskjet for years, while this one only works for... 6 months only. And what people are saying about the ink price is true: you can buy a whole other printer by buying 2 ink cartridges.

There are refill kits available, but they are difficult to use.I would recommend that you go with a Canon inkjet for the lowest total cost of ownership."},{"rating":"1","title":"Printer doesn't work!","review":"I bought this printer, brought it home and plugged it in but after two days and several emails to customer support, it still isn't printing. The printer carriage slams against the side of the printer everytime I try to print something and then the printer stops. I'm very unsatisfied with Lexmark. It has taken 2 days to get a return email and they don't even have an 800 customer support line. Call waiting times are listed as greater than 45 minutes so there must be a lot of people with problems!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth my time","review":"I was given this printer - New In Box, etc. so I can't complain about buying it. But there is no way I'd buy one myself.1) The print quality - at any level - is noticably worse than other printers I have access to.2) The cost of cartridges is stupidly high3) The paper feed mechanism is hit-and-miss after only 1000 sheets4) Now, after 6 months, it won't print. Period. It advances the paper and moves the heads around, but nothing hits the page. And, yes, these are brand new Lexmark cartridges. A second set (I assumed the first set of new ones was bad - got a second set from a different source. Different lot numbers)5) The only thing that keeps this from being a single star review is the scanner. The scanner - while not up to snuff when compared to my dedicated HP scanner, is absolutely suitable for document scanning - either for digital records or scanning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Impressed","review":"I have only used HP printers until now. But this printer was too good to be true. [poor] quality and it works with my Mac OS X?!? You bet. its everything they said... mostly. i did do my skeptical test of print speed and printed 24 pages in about 2 minutes and 40 seconds. some of them were mostly blank. so its not quite what they said, but if you are in that big of a hurry, see a counselor about time management. i really like this printer and am impressed with the photo quality print outs, great scanning and i haven't done much with the copying. Give it a shot, if you no like, you no keep... happy printing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"if you want a FUN, funk band with major talent","review":"My friend took me to see starcandy a few months ago and it was awesome! Totally fun get-out-on-the-dance-floor music! I bought the CD for a friend of mine who was having a party, because it's the kind of music almost everyone will enjoy. The female vocalist is amazing... she makes this band stand out from others I've seen. If you like Prince, you will love them! If you get a chance to see them live, I definitely recommend. When I can't get out to see them, the CD pretty much stays in my stereo...it's great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much story-telling, too little musical analysis","review":"The biggest flaw of this book, aside from the inclusion of works that don't sound musical at all to this regressive classical music lover, is most of the essays are heavy on background information and very light on musical analysis. The problem with this approach is, first, if you cross-reference what Steinberg writes in the mini-biographies with something like Wikipedia, you'll find lots of disagreements over \\"facts\\" about composers' lives and musical developments and also about each piece's specific development, and second, all that background info doesn't help one understand the music better. I wish Steinberg had included more musical analysis, even if that's less than accessible to the non-specialist, and less \\"chatty\\" talk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird","review":"Bizarre omissions -- too may masters of the concerto ignored. Overblown writing -- does not hit the \\"sweet spot\\" between the technical and the dramatic. In all, I found it useless. Easier to just \\"Google\\" something I am interested in. In sum, I deleted it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of Eric Schiller's \\"Big Book of Combinations.\\"","review":"Although it is hard to imagine a totally worthless book on chess combinations, this book comes very close. The author gives no solutions to the combinations, only the first move of each. Space supposedly does not permit the author to give full solutions, but space never stopped other authors of similar books. M. K. Blokh's \\"The Art of Combination\\" has more combinations, complete solutions and a lower price than Schiller's book, as can be said for nearly every other book on chess combinations.The author also fails to categorize the openings by theme; thus the novice student won't learn anything about thematic positions. Some of the key moves are incorrect as well, so there is very little to recommend this book other than its mildly interesting discussion of chess-playing computers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good value!","review":"Little can be added to the insightful review below. The book seems to have been an exercise in computer problem-solving that someone (incorrectly) thought would make a good book. In addition to the book cited by the author below, I recommend Fred Reinfeld's 1001 Brilliant Ways to Checkmate (but read Renaud & Kahn's The Art of the Checkmate first!), 1001 Winning Chess Sacrifices and Combinations (also Reinfeld's), Lazlo Polgar's Chess, and DuMont's The Basis of Combination in Chess. The Renaud & Kahn, Reinfeld, and DuMont books are inexpensive and offer a far greater value than The Big Book of Combinations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incomplete, But Far From Worthless","review":"This book is a good collection for study. You cannot rely on the key move solutions provided as some are simply wrong and all are provided as one key move without principal variations. If you have a modern computer chess program you will still benefit from solving the problems if you check your solution with your own computer. In fairness to the author, he recomends exactly this approach to working with the book. I was aware of the incomplete solutions as well as the fact that the computer progarm used in the book preparation was primative by modern standards before I made my purchase, therefore I was not disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Apricots!","review":"These are really delicious apricots for a great price. If you're allergic to sulphur dioxide or just want natural foods, you'll be very happy with these!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Covered in white powdery fuzz, no expiration date","review":"The apricots were shipped with, what looked like, specs of white powder all over them, that in a few days times turned to white fuzzy mold. Clearly these apricots were sitting in the back of a warehouse somewhere, for months (possibly longer). Amazon was great in offering an exchange. I hope my replacements will be mold-free. If so, I will alter my rating. But considering how much money I've shelled out for these, they shouldn't arrive in the horrific condition that they did.Further warning: the bags don't have any expiration dates listed, so there's no way of knowing how old they are, or when they expire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product is not dried properly and can rapidly mold","review":"These apricots are of high quality, however they seem to be packaged too moist, and rapidly develop a white mold. The spooky part is, the mold looks like sugar, and some folks, especially kids, might mistake it for a normal condition. A couple of other things are odd: There is no expiration date on the package, and each bag has a hole in the bottom, looking as if it has been punctured by a needle. After a month or so in storage, all 8 of my remaining bags were in the same decomposing condition.Please see attached pictures under product information, images section."},{"rating":"2","title":"When Your Back's Against the Wall","review":"Montana horse breeder McKinnon Quinn is in need of a horse trainer. Casey Westmoreland is the man, or in this case the woman, for the job. The attraction was indisputable and the chemistry was off the charts. So what's the problem then? Stubborn McKinnon feels that a life of bachelorhood is his destiny. Casey, on the other hand, feels differently. Will McKinnon be able to resist seduction, Westmoreland style?There's nothing more I can say that hasn't already been said about Brenda. The fact that this is book number 45 speaks for itself. Fans of the Westmoreland family will not be disappointed. Anxiously waiting on Spencer's Forbidden Passion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Casey Westmoreland knows about seduction","review":"Another Westmoreland woman who gets her man. Much like the book that kicked off the Westmoreland series, we find that it's not only the Westmoreland men who get what they want. Casey wanted a job, but found McKinnon Quinn simply irresistable.However, he was trying to fight his feelings for the beautiful Casey. When their romance develops, it's steamy.As usual, Brenda Jackson has given us a book that is a great read. Casey and McKinnon have some serious issues and I love the fact that this couple helps each other grow.You go Ms. Jackson!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Been Waiting.","review":"I have been waiting for McKinnon Quinn since he was introduced in the Durango Affair and I was not disappointed (although I knew I wouldn't be). Mrs Jackson does it as only she can. The chemistry between Casey and McKinnon was undeniable. Great story!! Can't wait for the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rent This One From Your Library","review":"First off, Ms. Jackson should request a new editor at Harlequin. There were so many typos and consistancy problems in this story, it didn't make any sense and most of them were at the very beginning of the book. One minute the heroine was off the horse, two pages later she was back in the saddle.Second thing, this book should have been titled Seduction: Cliche Style. Of all of the things the author could have thought of to keep the heroine and hero apart she had to come up with one of the most obscure reasons, which only a soap opera writer could have thought of.If you must read this title rent it from the library."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Go -o-o Girl!!!","review":"This is Brenda Jackson's continuing saga about the Westmoreland clan.This time Casey Westmoreland is paired with her cousin Durango's friend, McKinnon Quinn.

To find out what that sacrifice is, you must read the story.Ms. Jackson continues to inform the readers with updates of the Westmoreland family. Also, as I am sure many other readers are doing, I am looking forward to Ms. Jackson continuing this story -- perhaps with what happens with Casey's brothers -- who knows, maybe Clint's story is next?Good writing Ms. Jackson, we love you."},{"rating":"2","title":"It another great one!!!!!","review":"This book was great.

I don't know how many more there are to write but hope we hear about Casey's brothers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sliced and Diced Aquinas","review":"This is an unfortunate example of the sort of thing which academics produce and then force undergraduates to wade through. The author has found all the similar passages in Aquinas' many works and has collected them together in snippets varying from a paragraph to two to three pages in length. This results in great repetition, and the beauty of the sweeping logical development which is presumably present in the original, is lost.A word of warning to anyone who would approach Aquinas: read your Aristotle first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not well designed as an introduction to Acquinas.","review":"This book suffered from three weaknesses, the first of which may be idiosyncratic. 1. A \\"reader,\\" I presumed, would be an introduction to Acquinas, one I could read without attending a class. Not so. This book assumed a lot of familiarity with Acquinas's terminology and intellectual heritage. 2. The book is organized by topics, with brief excerpts from Thomas's works yanked out of context to fit the editor's topic selection. A sequential selection from Thomas's principal writings would have better preserved the integrity of the works and allowed the reader better to follow Thomas's reasoning. 3. Finally, the editor needed an editor. Her writing is cumbersome. She seems to have forgotten how to write a simple declarative sentence.I find Moses Maimonides no more approachable than Thomas Acquinas, but Isadore Twersky's \\"A Maimonides Reader\\" is far more approachable than Mary Clark's Acquinas reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not even one bad song...","review":"Don't you love when you get a CD and you can listen all the way through?

The Chicks latest cd is AWESOME! They have returned to their bluegrass roots on many of the songs and the results are teriffic. The entire cd is great and just what the doctor ordered. The songs \\"Long Time Gone\\" and \\"Travelling Soldier\\" alone would be worth the price of a cd, but there is much more to offer. This is great stuff and all I can say is, girls, please don't make us wait so long for the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Home\\" is exactly where this cd takes you...","review":"It doesn't matter where you are from, this cd evokes images and emotions that you maybe thought were gone for good. This is an excellent cd full of amazing songs, instrumentation, and vocals. It is definitely one of the best cd's that I've heard in a long time. The Dixie Chicks write and play great music and they never fail to pick some of the best songs around to cover. I just slid the cd in this morning without even looking at the song titles so I could just experience the cd. I was thrilled to hear songs from Patty Griffin, Radney Foster, Bruce Robison, and Stevie Nicks. Wow. I picked up \\"Wide Open Spaces\\" a few years back solely based on the fact that there were songs from Maria McKee and JD Souther, I had never heard of the Dixie Chicks. I'm a huge and permanent fan. So glad they have stuck to playing music that they love and we love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD!","review":"This is a really cool cd. I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes music. I have the other cds which are \\"Fly\\" and \\"Wide Open Spaces\\". I had been waiting for this cd for a long time and when I got it, I wasn't disapointed. I especially liked the songs \\"Travelin' Soldier\\", \\"Long Time Gone\\", and \\"Landslide\\". If you liked \\"Landslide\\" when Fleetwood Mac sang it, then you'll like it here also. It's an interesting twist on a great song. Try the cd, you won't be disapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Chicks CD","review":"I have all the Dixie Chicks CDs, and this one is my favorite.

I think it is one of their best to date."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dixie Chicks Best Album (so far...)","review":"Been waiting way too long for this treat. The best Dixie Chicks album yet. Fine instrumental work from Martie, Emily, Lloyd Maines, Adam Steffie (Guitar), Bryan Sutton (Mando) and Byron House (Bass) with Natalie's beautiful yet powerful vocal's and the tightest \\"Chicks\\" harmonies yet. Special treats are Emmylou Harris vocals on \\"Godspeed\\" and Chris Thile (Nickel Creek) playing mando on \\"A Home\\", \\"Lil' Jack Slade\\" (great solo) and \\"More Love\\". Recorded in the heart of Texas music, Austin.Buy this One!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Showcase of Talent","review":"This album truly depicts why we love the chicks so much, because of their talent. Without the distractions of percussion instruments, the chicks really showcase their talents in this album. I love the chicks two previous releases, but i was blown away by this one. Just when i thought it could not get better, it did. This CD is a must own for all music lovers. Probably the best Country/Bluegrass CD in at at least a decade."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music for everyone","review":"Okay, I'm not a country fan. However, I listened to this CD, and I was stunned! I didn't think that country music could possibly sound so wonderful and flawless. Their taste of old-time country and danceable beats give their tracks that unique flavor. Even if you're anti-country, I'd recommend giving \\"Home\\" a try. You may not become a bigger country fan(genre-wise), but you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!!","review":"High energy bluegrass inflected music (and also some hauntingly beautiful slower numbers). If you liked any of their previous albums you will love this! It's a pleasure to hear real honest Country music rather than the WT poprock which currently passes for country on so much of the radio nowdays. Buy it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"talented Chicks back up style with even more substance","review":"Here is why I love the Dixie Chicks: they actually have talent, and it's most seen in their latest cd, Home. I truly believe Emily and Martie are two of the most talented instrumentalists out there, and Natalie's voice brings you in and doesn't let go. Yes, this cd is more bluegrass that WOS or Fly, but to me that's a good thing. If only more artists had the guts to go acoustic and really show their talent, instead of using technology to cover up the lack thereof.I concur that some of the songs could have been shortened a bit (eg. \\"A Home\\"), but overall they've done it just right. Everytime I listen to \\"Top of the World\\" it just takes my breath away. And \\"Landslide\\" of course is just wonderful, equally as good as the Stevie Nicks version.This cd has become a staple for my car stereo and I know it's going to be there for a LONG time, and definitely not a long time gone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not perfect, but a pleasant album to listen to","review":"I decided to give this one a try (I've never owned one of the Dixie Chicks albums before)and found it to be all right. Some of the songs seemed more country or bluegrass than others but most were well done. I also noticed that one or more of the group members wrote many of the songs.I found #2 Landslide to be well done. An interesting redo of Stevie Nicks song, it works quite well which most covers fail to do.#3 Travelin' Soldier was oe of the best on the CD, very sad song. #12 Top of the World had a very different sort of ending musically, lots of instruments playing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely FABULOUS!!","review":"This CD is a must have for Dixie Chick fans. Lots of upbeat tempos and soothing melodies. Very good CD for popping in and getting some work done or just sitting back and relaxing...Definately worth the money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"They can't all be winners","review":"I am a huge fan of their first two CDs, but 'Home' is a major disappointment. 'Wide Open Spaces' and 'Fly' both had four to five *great* songs. Only 'Long Time Gone' and the instrumental 'Lil' Jack Slade' on this CD are even remotely close. Musically the girls are as great as ever, but their choice of material in this case is execrable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not great","review":"It's a good album, but a little bit slow and not really full of ideas, some songs can easily become boring, but nevertheless the voices and the harmony are wonderful, especially on Landslide. I only wished they would make their songs a little bit faster or with more energy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected, Chicks!","review":"Recently I've been really getting into country music. As a 15-year-old girl from outside of Philly who listens to Mariah Carey, Ashanti, DMX, Nelly, and Britney Spears, I thought it'd be a good idea to expand my musical horizons. After buying and LOVING 'Breathe' and 'Cry' from Faith Hill, and Shania's 'Up!', I hurried to buy 'Home' from the Dixie Chicks. However, I was terribly disappointed. I guess I'd say it's just too bluegrass for me...I really like the rockish sounds of Faith and Shania. Aside from \\"Long Time Gone\\", \\"Landslide\\", and \\"Travelin' Soldier\\", 'Home' has little else to offer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their Best Yet.","review":"This CD flows from one great song to another.. Patty Griffins songs \\"Truth No 2\\" and \\"Top of the World\\" are my favorites on this CD I hope the popularity of this CD gets her albums \\" 1000 kisses, Flaming Red and Living with ghosts\\" some recognition. If you like the dixie chicks you will like Patty's albums. Landslide written by Stevie Nicks is a excellent rendition. Overall this CD is a good combination of great musicians, vocalist and great songwriting.

Sort of a \\"high lonesome\\" sound to it. \\"Landslide\\" is getting a lot of buzz, but I personally found \\"More Love\\" a more interesting song. And for the obligatory Chick-rocking, ain't-gonna-hear-it-on-the-radio-but-I-love-it song, \\"White Trash Wedding\\" is worth the price of the album all by itself.

Not a weak track to be found although some are better than others. For me the stand out tracks are: \\"Landslide\\", \\"Traveling Soldier\\", \\"A Home\\", \\"More Love\\", and \\"Top Of The World\\". These girls are incredible. Their first album, \\"Wide Open Spaces\\" I always liked better than \\"Fly\\". This album is more simple, less pop sounding than those two. Being a huge Stevie Nicks fan, I was curious to hear their take on Stevie's classic \\"Landslide\\" and they do it beautifully. But for me the best track is \\"Traveling Soldier\\". The album is just killer, no filler! Heavy on the vocals, banjo and mandolin. Great great stuff!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The CHICKS bring it Home.....","review":"Lately, country radio is leaning toward mostly pop-oriented country. Not bluegrass-oriented country. I have always enjoyed things with more of a down-home sound. If you enjoy that too thenthis album is for you. Better songs on this album are almost all of them. The only song that bores me on this album is \\"GodSpeed\\".Everything else is very unique but similar sounding in its own way."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dixie Chicks Great New Album!!","review":"Home - This is a great new album from the much loved Dixie Chicks! Wide Open Spaces is still my favorite of their 3 albums. But this is still a really good album. Travelin' Soldier made me cry when I first heard it - wonderful story. I love Long Time Gone because they mention my home State of Indiana!! White Trash Wedding makes me think of Goodbye Earl - it reflects the sense of humor and fun The Dixie Chicks have with their songs!! And Lil' Jack Slade is a great bluegrass piece - makes you dance, even if you're in a seat!! Those are just some of the songs I'm enjoying on \\"Home\\". So yeah, I recommend this album, the Dixie Chicks rock and even though I'm not a huge country fan, I love the sound they produce!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Follow-Up to \\"Fly\\"!","review":"The new Dixie Chicks album takes a different take on country music this time around. Appropriately titled \\"Home\\", this time the sound is more earthy, & traditional, with a definite bluegrass influence heard throughout. Natalie Maines vocals are as fluid as ever, and the vocal harmonies have never sounded better. The production as mentioned, is very \\"warm\\" and old-school sounding -- a perfect fit for the material presented. The opener, the title track is an uptempo tune that will immediately put fears to rest over the new material measuring up to the last release. And the Stevie Nicks cover (track #2) is very well done. My only criticism of the album is that they could have put maybe one more uptempo track. (Of the 12 presented, only 4 are mid-to-uptempo) But this is fairly minor. Long time fans will not be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing Real Music","review":"In a world of over produced, tin can sounding music, Dixie Chicks have raised the bar in contemporary country music or for any other type of music for that matter. Most music on the radio literally makes me sick at my stomach. I can't take all of the [bad] music that is being made right now. Dixie Chicks' Home sounds raw and organic; not so polished. It's music to my ears! Every song is great without a clunker in sight. On the heels of such greats as O' Brother...they have made a record that would even appeal to bluegrass fans but doesn't alienate their core audience. I give this album 5+ stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not their best","review":"I am not a fan of country music but I love the Dixie Chicks and 'Wide Open Spaces' and 'Fly' are two of my all-time favorite CD's and this one is good but not as good. The CD has a lot more slow and traditionally country music. I liked alot of the songs like, \\"Long time gone\\", \\"Landslide\\", and \\"Tortured, Tangled Hearts\\" but it doesn't have the same feel as their previous CD's. I was surprised to hear them do 'Landslide' though, they did an awesome job on the remake and I bet Stevie Nicks is proud. If you are a fan of the Dixie Chicks then this will not disapppoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome album","review":"The best Chicks album yet - although the all acoustic songs may not appeal to all D.C. fans.

He simply can't write English -- and also has the annoying habit of peppering each short paragraph with one, may be two one-liners. The situations are also constantly unrealistic, for instance, the protagonist's ex-lover, a beautiful lawyer (yes, it's that kind of novel) who practices both corporate anti-trust law AND criminal defense of pederasts. Uhh, sorry, not believable.

You can bend it any why you like. Very convenient."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I own a HD radio (Radiosophy). I live in a high rise apartment and I have problems in recieving both analog and HD signals. I thought C.Crane FM reflect antenna will improve reception. Manufacturers say that it improves reception 213% more then regular dipole antenna. Thats wrong. It didnt improve much. In five of my favorite FM HD stations, I get good reception for one station. With this antenna I got two. I still dont get other three. More over this antenna does not look firm as it was shown in pictures. It is nothing but a wire. They say it is flexible and we can adjust in what ever shape we want. But it doesn't stay in the shape we make it. I have to stick it with tape. It is big and does not look good.

The quality is fine.My need for a better antenna was in a challenging setting on the Hood Canal west of Seattle. The Reflect gets the job done--barely. I have read other reviews which state this antenna works no better than a cheap dipole, and based on my experience, I believe that's true. If your application is like mine, where the best position for the antenna is laid out carefully on the floor, then this antenna SHOULD survive being run over by a vacuum cleaner much better than a cheap dipole, but I doubt your reception will be any better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't improve my signal at all","review":"I purchased this antenna to improve my signal for a Sony HD FM radio I recently purchased. In particular, I was having troubles \\"locking in\\" a certain radio station here in Minneapolis using the standard antenna that came with my Sony radio. This C. Crane antenna did not help at all. I tried multiple configurations (horizontal, vertical, circles, half circles, etc., etc.). Actually, it provided WORSE reception (based on the signal bars on my radio) compared to the standard/free antenna that came with the radio. Further, its large size makes it challenging to hide. Seems other have had luck with this antenna... but certainly didn't seem to help in my case."},{"rating":"2","title":"good improvement, but not monumental","review":"I'm in the city, so I already get a lot of stations - I wanted them even cleaner and more potent through my Sangean hd1 radio tuner. By adding replacing the antenna that came with the unit with the Crane, I got more oomph in the bass (and it was still tight, without spreading out) and more fullness and musicality in the treble. Sounds like a lot of flowery talk, but it did improve the sound. Was it a night and day change? No - with the exception of small chamber ensembles played on our classical station - WOW, better than a cd and about as good as nice vinyl. Did I expect to improve my 8 grand system phenominally or to a point that I couldn't live without it with a 30$ atenna, no - but there was an improvement.In the end, it works, no huge change, and I guess that some people could see similar or better improvements for relatively cheap by upgrading their interconnect wires. It did make a better sound and I'm keeping them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money!","review":"This thing is a complete JOKE! I bought it to boost the reception of my CCradio Plus weather band reception on the recommendation of a support tech at CC Crane. To my surprise, the reception actually got WORSE when this thing was clipped to the whip antenna than without it. I tried moving it around in every conceivable position and shape I could think of and it never improved the signal strength or the audio quality at all. As I said, it actually made both worse!At least for my application, I would suggest you save your money.

The bad guys are ordinary people, living their lives, dealing with problems. They spend a great deal of time whining and complaining.

A perfect example is the mention that OC-4 is currently the highest level which is completely incorrect. The latest OC level is 192. And it can't possibly be something that was overlooked or created since the book was released since the OC-48 and 192 was out way before 1996!

More serious, however, are the few mistakes I found as to the content of the book. If you pay attention to the material, you will notice them. This book is otherwise very well written and since these kinds of mistakes seem to be the theme of most MCSE study guides, I did not want to penalize the author for them.

Fortunately, when I turn off the printer and re-start the computer, then every thing seems ok.The second problem is that something happened to my MS IE 6, I can now no longer have the Home page I want and invariably while surfing I just get a blank page.

The print quality and scan quality are quite good for what you pay. However, I work for a small office and we have roughly 50 of these machines in the office. We've had them about a year and a half now, and are already considering replacing them. More than half of the machines no longer have the ability to scan, the drivers get kind of hairy when trying to print from Internet Explorer, and the color cartridges need replaced every few months whether you use them or not, you can't use the printer without them.

This book basically recycles the Inside-the-Beltway right wing party line--one part Kemp, one part Bennett, one part Heritage Foundation, one part Cato Insititute and one part neo-conservative. The sad thing is that the party line of Limbaugh and Company hasn't changed in almost twenty years. When Buchanan offered a variation on the party line, Limbaugh and Company went nuts. Though the Left went off the deep end long ago, the current leadership on the Right(and Limbaugh considers himself to be one of the Right's leaders) is stagnant, adrift in a world where they are hardly relevant.

Rush emphasizes the fact that the essence of contemporary liberalism is increasing dependence upon government in exchange for votes. Rush exposes the liberals' attacks on the middle class for not being compassionate enough, for equating upward mobility with greed, and for associating spiritual and moral values with intolerance. Rush also quotes George Washington and James Madison to point out the Judeo-Christian roots of our Constitution and our society, something all but lost on liberal judges. We learn of the past doom and gloom predictions of the environmentalists, which I personally well remember, none of which have come true--not even close. Rush also challenges us to live up to our potential, and recounts his own setbacks in life (such as being fired six times, and being broke twice). As a result, Rush' views are based on real life."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was not what I expected...It was good!","review":"I read Rush's book on a lark, not expecting much (never having listened to him on the radio and having formed my opinion of him based on other peoples reports) but actually reading his book changed my opinion. It was not what I expected to find. It was well written, insightful and very very funny. Most attacks on this book seem to be based on a dislike for the opinions expressed within. For those who will not read with an open mind, and who initially disagree with his views, they will inevitably dislike this book, because it will make them question what they believe.

It's not very feminine though (except for the cut), and could easily pass as a unisex model."},{"rating":"2","title":"Runs slightly large, but very nice!","review":"Seems as though this product runs a little large. But I like to wear things on the larger side in the winter. I bought a Large and I usually wear large sweaters (I'm about a size 10 or 12 depending on the item). And this was definitely roomy. If you you want this more fitten, I would definitely say buy a medium. But I'm assuming it will shrink a bit, so I am very happy with the size.

If it were considerably cheaper it would be attractive for really low-budget amateurs. At the $150 price point, the performance shortcomings do not justify the cost.I bought this lens because bottom dollar was my #1 priority, and this was a mistake. Canon's faster/stronger/more robust sister lens is (at most) $100 more expensive and the results are vastly superior.One particularly disturbing aspect of this cheap-feeling plastic lens is the fact that the forward tube, when extended at 105mm, wiggles back and forth noticeably - the mechanical tolerances on this device are horrible. I also found that it is very easy to get dust and dirt into this lens (probably also due to the bad tolerances), so don't try to use it in a dirty environment."},{"rating":"1","title":"No reason to buy this lens","review":"There's absolutely no reason to buy this lens when you can instead get the Canon EF 28-105 f/3.5-4.5. It's a faster lens with signiicantly better image and build quality, and is only about $50 more than this cheap plastic/slower version."},{"rating":"1","title":"spend a bit more and buy the 3.5-4.5","review":"For $100 more, buy the 28-105mm 3.5-4.5 version. results are far better.

Poor contrast, poor light, and especially has lack of sharpness in photos. At first I thought something was wrong with my technique, but then realized it was the lens. It also takes forever to focus in low light. Go with the other reviewer...spend an extra $50.00 and get the 3.5 version of 28-105"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not horrible... but close...","review":"I have to agree with other reviewers.

This lens works great, quiet enough focus and covers a good range at a great price. However, I hope you like your pictures a little soft. All my pictures are a little soft with this lens. It is worth a little more money to get a better lens. If you are just a student or taking a photography class and don't really need super sharp pictures this may be great for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful lens","review":"I bought EOS 20D and took this lens as well as my camera was without a lens. Most of the pictures shot with this lens are pretty blury. Even some of them when the flash was enabled were strange. Other times I managed to get a good picture or two. All in all, I am quite unhappy with this lens. Avoid it at all cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT a movie for the kids","review":"Parents please be warned... This movie in no way should be rated PG. We sat down to watch this with our kids and shame on us for trusting the PG rating. There was almost nonstop swearing, an attempted rape scene, and frontal nudity during the rape scene. It was at this point we turned it off.We were looking for a nice horse themed movie and this was not it. This was a gift that immediately went into the trash. If you are looking for a family-themed movie, pass this one by."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Drama, Good Depiction of 3-Day Eventing","review":"Melissa Gilbert made her movie debut in this National Velvet-styled story of a determined girl and her jumping horse. Gilbert is a tough on the outside / soft on the inside teenage orphan who trains a worthless cowpony, transforming him into a classy 3-Day Eventer. With the help of her drunken mentor (Richard Farnsworth, the penultimate cowboy) they train the ghostly gray horse by moonlight, and dazzle everyone by daylight when the horse and his rider make it to the top show ranks. There are lots of sudsy subplots, but it just adds to the fun. I loved this movie the first time I saw it, and my horsy friends and I all saw it more than once. Not quite a classic, Sylvester is still a great one for horse lovers and definitely worth a spot in your DVD library.Staci Layne Wilson"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed, should not be rate PG!!!!","review":"I bought this movie for my 2 horse loving daughters. While the story line is a good classic horse story- wild rodeo type horse becomes 3 day event champion, the rest of it is terrible. The language is horrible and should not be rated PG. Also there is a pretty graphic scene where one the stable hands tries to rape Charlie ( Melissa Gilbert). I am guessing that PG rating were different when this movie was made in the 80's, but I have never seen a PG movie quite like this. If you are looking for a wholesome family horse story, this is NOT your movie.

Sorry, but that's the notorious habit of too many 'indie' artists. This group is decent, musically, but there is little distinct originality about them at all. There are numerous artists that would be much better choices for this genre; Renaissance, Steeleye Span, Pentangle, and Fairport Convention come to mind instantly, which are clearly Magellaen's heroes. Simply, they sound like a neighborhood band who didn't sell their CD's very well even at live gigs. Worst of all is their friggin' name. There's a conflict with other bands using that name, and to get around it they changed the spelling, slightly, because they knew the other bands existed. Revolting.

It is hard to believe that the writer of the Fairy Godmother books could produce such an emotionally overwhelming book of the horrors of the Vietnam war.

Had I known beforehand what the book was about, I would never have read it. I was sick of the Vietnam war ages ago when it happened.

Over the years, I have listened to hundreds of recorded books during my daily commute, and I have always believed that The Healer's War would make a terrific listen. It does.I was fortunate to have Ms. Scarborough as a teacher for a writing course I took many years ago. A side benefit was that I became interested in her work and read several of her books.

Contrary to another reviewer, it took me only about five minutes to discover this game is a (poor) translation of a game from Europe. Looking at the names of the people connected with it, I would guess it was made somewhere in Scandanavia. There's SOME humor value in the comically bad translations of the TV shows you will be producing, they really make no sense at all. However, the programmers made no effort to lip sync the animation and the soundtrack. The installation does not always refer to the program by the same name -- which I always take as a warning sign of sloppy programming. In the game itself, many of the pop-up message boxes appear on top of one another, obscuring important information. There are other bugs, and translation errors which made the game difficult to play, and quite tedious. I can't believe this game actually made it out of beta testing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid","review":"This game is not only bad, but its packaging is also highly misleading.

Instead, she ends up becoming a stripper and starts dating one of the customers of the strip club. She also meets a neighbor, who was a former university poetry professor, and who now is quite crazy. The movie was too disjointed and full of pointless characters (what is the purpose of the neighbor?!). The script was weak, the dialogue did not make sense and neither did the plot sequence. The plot did not present an opportunity for the characters to grow and somehow they did!

The beat is one of the best I've ever heard, I think it was produced by Alchemist, and the lyrics shows why he can boast that he's Focused Dailey.

Although the \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\" soundtrack lacks the sheer splendor of Korsakov's works it presents fully the raw energy and emotion, with rousing choruses and thematic variations that tie the tracks together, much like the Easter Overture. The only minus I have is that the soundtrack is a touch repetitive in places and I would subtract a half star for that.I loved the movie, I loved the soundtrack, I am sure you will too, it is a great companion to the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great soundtrack.","review":"This has to be one of the better movie soundtracks out there. All of the songs really complement the movie and generate the atmosphere of pirates and tall ships in the caribbean. I would highly recommend the soundtrack. I have had to buy this soundtrack 4 times because people barrow it and don't return it because it is so good."},{"rating":"2","title":"A TEENAGER'S REVIEW","review":"Very, very good soundtrack. I love all the songs from the movie. If I turn the music on, and close my eyes, I really feel like I am being transported to Jack Sparrow's side, aboard the Black Pearl, lol.The CD is short (as many other reviewers have said) but I think it does do the film the credit it is due, and the track lengths are just right - not too long, as I think, unless the piece was truly FANTASTIC, then it would become boring.Can't wait till there is a soundtrack for the PotC 2 movie, Dead Man's Chest - that will be fab as well. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"An incredible soundtrack","review":"The music that Klaus Badelt has created for this movie is as amazing as the movie itself. He manages to capture the mystery, romance, suspense, and humor into a moving, flowing score. His use of meter and dynamics create an emotionally intense musical atmosphere, and while the order of the songs may be a little off, the music itself is enough to bring to mind the best scenes. This is a definite must have for any fan of instrumental music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great soundtrack for a great movie","review":"The score for the Pirates of the Caribbean is nothing short of fantastic during the film itself. When you bring the soundtrack home, shivers will run down your spine. The amount of detail put into each track really shines through as you can hear even the quietest instruments you may have missed earlier come to life.I am a big fan of such scores as Rudy and The Lord of the Rings, but I think this one outshines any other. A must buy for movie scores and anyone who enjoyed the movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loud and Fun","review":"I myself always buy the soundtracks to films that I see because the score accentuates it so much more. This soundtrack is wonderful. It's loud, eerie, and so much more. You can picture the scenes and the emotions from the film, making you almost apart of the film. Klaus Badelt does a wonderful job creating imagery of piracy, swordfights, and most of all fun with every note. It's wonderful to listen to on a long drive, going for a run, or just sitting around. Highly recommended, even if you didn't enjoy the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"PIRATES IS AWESOME","review":"Not only is the movie the best so is the soundtrack.....I love them both....I would really recommend you go see the movie and buy the soundtrack....if you don't you are truly missing out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Holy Crap","review":"This soundtrack is awsome.

Recommended buy for any Pirates fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible but.........","review":"WHAT THE HECK HAPPENED TO THE MUSIC IN JACK'S HANGING!?!?! WHOEVER EDITED THIS SOUNDTRACK REALLY MISSED IT!!! I MEAN THAT MUSIC OUT OF ALL OF THEM, MADE MY HAIR STAND UP AND FEEL ALL PRICKLY!!!!!!Really, the music jumps from the underwater march(Pirates walking underwater to attack the Dauntless), to the moment when Will(Orlando Bloom)and Elizabeth(Keira Knightley)kiss. Also, the music is in the wrong order, for example, Track number 13 plays Barbossa's death and the pirates surrender, Will and Elizabeth talk, brits cheer etc. Immediately after that it jumps to the underwater march!!!!!!!! I mean, come on!!!!!!Then, Tr. 9. plays the part when Jack Sparrow(Johnny Depp) and Will first fight Barbossa(Geffory Rush)(in the cave) Then the next song immediatly jumps to when the Interceptor blows up, and Will climps up on the ship and negotiates with Barbossa. The editors REALLY needed more help!!! Adios amigos"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Music","review":"If you are debating on which one to buy...think no further. You have found your answer. This is a wonderful CD which really takes you into the movie itself. You replay the entire fantastic movie in your head as you are drawn into the the lively music. This CD wins hands down to anyother soundtrack in the market. I am a huge fan of Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl the acual movie. So if you have not seen that yet, you must do so immediatly!!!!! NO EXCUSES! The best money you will ever spend. So by all means get this CD become part of the epic motion picture!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Just a really great sound track. I love the movie and the background music as well. My husband and I are using some of the tracks to set our honeymoon video too. Very compelling score. Enjoy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Even better the second time around!","review":"Some reviewers have complained that this is esentially the Gladiator soundtrack on the high seas, and I would have to agree. However, in my opinion, the soundtrack was Gladiator's only good point. In fact, it was far too good for that overrated dog of a movie. In the case of Pirates, however, I felt that the music enhanced what was already a very entertaining movie. The tension created by the very powerful music was amazing. And let's not forget, Hans Zimmer \\"borrowed\\" rather liberally from Gustav Holst (listen to \\"The Planets\\") to create his masterpiece for Gladiator. I ran out and bought this CD the day I saw the movie (sorry Amazon, I couldn't wait!) and then went to see the movie again. This score is probably too similar to other works to be nominated for the Best Score Oscar, but I doubt that any of the upcoming movies (except The Return of the King, of course) will have scores this powerful and entertaining, not to mention appropriate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Fun Fun","review":"This score would best be described as a powerful musical romp. The movie was outstanding (Grammy award for Depp anyone??) and the score surely does it justice.It this score similar to a number of other action scores out there? - yes. Is it a touch cliché a times? -maybe. Is it a whole lot of fun? -Absolutely. This music captures so well the movie that it represents, but is a whole heck of a lot of fun as a standalone as well (I heard the score before seeing the movie).I suspect we'll be hearing parts of this score (especially tracks 2, 5, & 15) used in upcoming movie trailers for some time to come. I would recommend this CD without reservation to anyone who has seen the movie and wants to relive some of the best moments without waiting for the DVD (or seeing it over and over at the theatre) or to anyone who enjoys fun, loud, energetic orchestral music (but I would highly recommend seing the movie as well one or two (or ten) times)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cool.","review":"This CD is so cool. There are 15 songs on the CD. My favorite songs are number 2,3,5,7,4,9. The CD lasts under an hour about 50 minutes of music. If you saw Pirates of the Caribbean and liked the music then you will love the CD. If you are thinking about buying the CD you should its really good and worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"Its a decent soundtrack, it has a lot of high-action orchestral music, but its shorter than i expected"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Album of the Year","review":"When you pop in this cd in your stereo, you're transported right into the movie. The music surronds you and its like you're there with Jack, Will, and Elizabeth fighting the pirates. Its...I'm at a loss for words. Just simply amazing and I think this soundtrack deserves a best movie score from the academy, or at least a nomination."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"The movies great and the soundtrack is great!My first impression of the cd was \\"wow! Five stars and more!\\" Even though it is a short cd it is worth the money! The only bad thing about the cd is that some tunes are reapeated in more than one song. But overall the cd is totally worth all the money in the world! I know i am happy with my purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite soundtrack!","review":"This is my favorite soundtrack that I have ever bought, and I still listen to it all the time. I have read reviews where people complained about the repetative nature of the music, but I disagree that this is a negative feature. As a musician, I am fascinated by the subtle ways the main theme is changed throughout the sountrack such as changing tempos, beat patterns, and styles, to create an entirely new effect. I recommend this soundtrack to anyone who loved the movie!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT!!!!","review":"Very well put together. Hans Zimmer is a GENIUS! This soundtrack from start to finish takes you on an adventure that you could sense even if your eyes were closed while you listened to it. Each track sets its own mood and was very appropriately placed in the movie itself. I'd recommend this to anybody."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zimmer influence","review":"If you have listened to any of Hans Zimmer's work, this sounds quite like it.Listen to Barbarian Horde from Gladiator (about the middle of the track on to the end), and then listen to He's a Pirate. Almost identical themes used.I'm not complaining, as there usually isn't too much of a good thing.All in all, a decent soundtrack, something you feel like a pirate with and it makes you want to go out and swashbuckle something..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pirates of the Carribean","review":"I love watching the movie more for the music score than the acting. This is a great soundtrack. Listening to it brings the different scenes to mind. My only complaint is that some of the tracks are short for a soundtrack recording. The last track is the best one but it's only a minute and a half long. Before you know it, you've listened to the entire CD and it's over. You're left wishing it lasted a little longer. But it's still great CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Soundtrack","review":"This is one of the greatest soundtracks that I have heard in quite some time. They have a good selection of items from the movie, not leaving much out. The only 2 things i have against the soundtrack is that it is disorganized and that it doesnt contain as much music as it could have (Contains about 43 minutes). But it is still worth picking up if you enjoyed the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"mag-freakin-nificent","review":"I just watched POTC again this weekend and was truly astounded by the music as much as the movie. I can't recall an original score being so perfectly mated to a movie.For those of you thinking about buying the soundtrack you may notice that some reviewers mention there are some pieces that are left out, don't worry, buy the CD and you will find it quickly becomes one of your favorites.There are also reviewers who mention that \\"the professionals\\" rated the soundtrack very low. Think about how many times \\"the professionals\\" rated a movie, or album highly only to see it bomb, or the number of times \\"the professionals\\" panned a movie, or album only to see it become a success. My point is: if you like good music, ignore \\"the professionals\\". You will not be sorry. Even if you have never seen this movie you will enjoy the soundtrack, the music on it is good enough to stand on it's own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"I recently purchased Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl Soundtrack and was absolutely entranced by the music in it. Each song brought me further into a world of curses and secrets. I did find the layout of the songs to be slightly confusing, but I was pleased with it none the less. Klaus Baudelt truly captured the magic of pirates. I have always loved instrumentals, and I found this to be a classic. By purchasing this soundtrack, you are throwing yourself into a world where pirate ship flags wave in a mist of shadows. Bravo!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's make a list","review":"I'm going to make a list of all of the soundtracks that Klaus Badelt blatantly ripped off of with Pirates. If I forgot any, notify me and I'll add it:First off, the most obvious:Gladiator - this one is at the top because the main theme is almost an exact copy of the one from Gladiator.The Rock - same as above.Drop ZoneNow, the less obvious:Crimson TideShrekBlack Hawk DownAny more? Please tell meAlan Silvestri was much more qualified for the job than this theif. But now that I mention it, he wasn't the ONLY ONE involved in this now was he? NO! Just about every Media Ventures student was involved in this massive load of crap (the inserts read like a yearbook), including Zimmer himself, who HAPPENS to have written Gladiator and alot of the Rock! What happened to ORIGINALITY?! Do I smell another James \\"Self-Ripoff\\" Horner? Time will tell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh please...this is a film score?","review":"First of all...this score was definitely not just overproduced by Hans Zimmer...it was practically WRITTEN by him. As one other reviewer already pointed out, some of the music is almost exactly the same as the battle music in gladiator...same style, orchestration, and feel. (that music incidentally was almost completely \\"borrowed\\" from Gustav Holst's 'Mars'from 'The Planets') Badelt has managed to create a catchy theme and has occasional moments of brooding, atmospheric music...but not a very impressive effort overall. Much of the music isn't even performed by live musicians but rather by synthesizers. Nearly all of the percussion is done on a computer, as are some of the brass instruments. I find this very dissapointing coming from someone who is the student of a well recognized film composer who ought to respect the music enough to let it be played by PEOPLE, not machines."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dynamic!","review":"This is a great musical work! Brings back the memory of the film. A great cd to wake up to. Highly recommend this to everyone. This one should win awards!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"What can you say about this CD! It's just fantastic. While watching the film in cinema I was sure that I will buy the CD, although in cinema it is normally difficult to focus on the music. But it is just great. No other wors possible. My advice to you all: If you like good instrumental filmmusic it is definatley the right dicussion to buy. If you have watched the movie or if not. You will love it. Sometimes with only action and drama but all the time full uf emotions.I cannot stop listen to the CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous music, but where's the rest of it???","review":"I love this soundtrack! It brings to vividly to mind the excitement and fun of this movie, but what happened to the rest of it? I've seen POTC several times and have made a point of listening to the score throughout the movie, and much to my disappointment, the soundtrack has been heavily edited. I don't think that there are any significant pieces that were omitted, but each track itself has been shortened. Considering the poularity of this movie, I was surprised that it took them a full two weeks to release the soundtrack, and then I had to go to 4 different stores to find it. Perhaps Disney underestimated the demand for a soudntrack and hastily put one together, butchering the music in the process. Let's hope that there will be another full-length version coming to stores soon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun to listen to","review":"I bought both CD's for my son...He loves PoC...movies, music and toys. He is 5 years old. He listens to the music and can tell you the part of the story it comes from. Its' loaded in the car and much nicer to listen to than the usual kid music. The CD's are different and engaging enough so you don't feel like you bought the same thing twice. With each album you will have favorites. My son does, I do... we like them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense, but pleasurable!","review":"The music is not for the light hearted. There are two basic themes throughout the disc. This is made for careful listening as the softs are very quiet, and the louds get very loud! And the very nature of the music lends itself to action. So if you enjoy a piece with often recurring themes and intensity through 85% of the work, you will like this. I HAD to buy it because the theme kept knocking around in my head and had to be satisfied! My whole family likes it very much, but my wife can't take the intensity for more than 20 minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I love the pirates movies and now having the soundtrack is amazing! No scratches, it wasn't even opened. Thank YOU!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective recording","review":"While the music is enjoyable. The CD itself is defective. The sound during loud passages is very distorted. It sounds as if the recording level was set too high. I listened to the same parts on the DVD and the music was much clearer. The soundtrack should be remastered and re-released (after the current soundtrack is recalled)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pirates","review":"Certain songs make you think you are really there with the crew. I would highly recommend this. If you like the movie you will like the soundtrack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor and cheap","review":"The Music is nothing but cheap synths-based Sh**... A great orchestral Score would have done the movie even better. There is only one good Theme heard in the score, dominated by the fiddles at the beginning and end of the score. It is a shame they did not let Alan SIlvestri do the job...But Jerry Bruckheimer does not know anything about good film music... anyway, if you watch the movie, just try not to pay too much attention to its music"},{"rating":"1","title":"It wasn't bad....but it wasn't great either","review":"I know a lot of people will hate me for saying, I think this movie wasn't entertaining, wasn't funny, kept going on and on, and Orlando Bloom scared the crap out of me! He seemed more appealing in the Lord of the Rings series.(Which I highly recomend seeing, if you havn't)Its not like I hate this movie....but it just wasn't as good as I thought it would be. It seemed, to me, another one of those adventure shows that had practically no twists, a mooshy love story, a bunch of cheap action, unbelievable special effects, and a happy ending......oh brother...The only thing that I truly enjoyed about Pirates of the Carribean was Johnny Depp. Now he was awsome! He alone earned my extra star! I know alot of fans will hate me, but I had to lower the ratings for this movie....it just blowed. ^..^"},{"rating":"2","title":"a disappointed mom","review":"I bought this cd because it was requested by my daughter's orchestra director.

Great for us armchair orchestra conductors. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent, but short","review":"Having loved the film through and through, I decided to get the soundtrack as background adventuring music for my D&D players. It's decent enough for that and has all of the good and memorable bits. That's the good news. But it's only 43 minutes -- none of the 15 tracks (which are mixed together well enough) are over 4:45, with only one reaching that exhausting length. Surely they could have gone over a couple of the major refrains a couple of more times with all of the blank disc that was left over... Additionally, many of the tracks sound muddied (they weren't joking about the score being \\"overproduced\\" in many places), occasionally jagged (shifts in the middles of tracks) and due to the surprisingly strong quality of the mix-to-flow, you won't be wanting to listen to these tracks shuffled in with anything else. But as a CD, it's a good CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"good score","review":"this is a good score-- it works well with the film on literal and abstract levels.there's a lot of mickey-mousing, but to be expected. quite the european feel-- a waltzing ship to be sure.klaus is developing a voice, with a little help from dear hans, but i still wonder what the silvestri score was like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Score","review":"This is one amazing masterpiece.

I know from reading the reviews that most people complain about the length of this CD,and yes, I will admit that the songs are on the slightly short side, but if you enjoy the music, just place the CD player on Repeat All! When I get a CD, I look at the actual music, not the length or the cover. So if you just sit back in a quiet room, close your eyes and relax to this CD, and enjoy the music that's there, I promise you will not be dissapionted. If you like dramatic, almost sad music, numbers 1, 7, and 13 are for you. If you like excitng, fast paced songs, listen to numbers 1, 2, 4, 5, 7,14, and 15 first.

The impact is guaranteed.Personally I liked \\"Dead Man's Chest\\" (composed by Hans Zimmer) a little bit better comparing to \\"The Curse of The Black Pearl\\" (composed by Klaus Badelt).We can argue about this statement, but I am sure we all agree that we would love to hear these performances alive.Anyhow, I encourage you to get \\"Dead Man's Chest\\" too, and the soundtrack of \\"The Last Samurai\\" (composed by Hans Zimmer).Miklos"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pirates of the Carribean/Black Pearl","review":"Every time I hear this I am unfortunatly reminded how insignificant and untalented I am!

In other words, the books are fiction but the marketing device to get us to read them was a lie, pure and simple. So that's how these writings by Laura Albert should be understood--not as a stand-alone works of fiction but as a marketing tool to fool the public into buying them. If the hoax of JT Leroy shouldn't matter in regard to the books than why, I wonder, was it used in the first place?"},{"rating":"1","title":"With my hand on my heart it's not the best","review":"Hype and praise breed expectation.

There's nothing in this book that Dennis Cooper and others haven't done better. Even as a Copper pastiche it still falls way short of the mark.As for Laura Albert, this kind of writing/hoax seems to be a typical American phenomenon: girls, who can't get over the fact that they weren't born as boys. They invest a lot of energy to \\"re-invent\\" themselves as young males (who never really become adult men) and at the same time reduce their envy by putting boys down (just like in the case of \\"Anthony Godby Johnson\\"). Make them suffer all kinds of abuse, turn them into some weak and miserable beings so that you don't have to envy them anymore (it's therefore only logical that Jeremiah has to wear girl's clothes) - that's it, there's nothing more to say actually.

But, that would have been during my single days or during the years of marriage that I thought were happy and stable. However, after having my world turned upside down by infidelity this movie just serves as a disturbing reminder of the weak emotional nature of so many people who lack the discipline to be true to the fidelity they vowed on the alter. Now I have to wonder if total reconsiliation is really possible or if people predisposed to this behavior are destined to seek happiness outside of marriage at any cost. I was starting to believe that couples who survive infidelity can have stonger, happier relationships than they ever experienced with each other before the affair but this movie casts doubt on the cheaters - can they ever really be content with their spouses? It's a sad reflection on the human condition. Yes, bitter sweet indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"An adulteress couple involved in a superficial relationship","review":"The fine acting aside, I really hate the subject matter of this film. It primarily involves itself with the superficial adulteress yearly affair of a rather selfish man and woman. What it fails to adequately address is the moral and physiological implications of \\"cheating\\" and how it not only affects the spouses of the people having the affair, but the cheaters themselves. As you begin to justify something as potentially devastating as infidelity, what other moral values might you be able to \\"overlook\\" in order to get something that make you \\"feel\\" good?Although this movie has its moments, I just can't get past the glorification it gives to adultery, to enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet More Abberant Human Behaviour Glorified By Hollywood!","review":"It seems to me like somehow Hollywood manages to glorify nearly every Abberant Human Condition such as Alcoholism (Barfly, Cocktail), Drug Abuse (Blow) and a host of other subjects.

I thought it was a very accessible book on the topic of schizophrenia in terms of language and length for high school students.I have talked to several of the students who were assigned this book and all seemed to think that the book did a good job explaining one person's story with schizophrenia without boring them with a lot of psychological/medical terminology.I will recommend this book to students who come to my library wanting to learn about schizophrenia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put this one down!","review":"This writer allowed me to enter his world!

It may be a fun game for some but I found the game to be challenging even at the slowest speed. For me to really think about a stock this should have been a game which should have been turn based as opposed to real time. You essentially have 60 seconds to make a decision about something before the market closes for the day.

The storage compartment door falls open and has room for nothing more than a small bib. The straps come loose and are very diffucult to adjust and clean. Food gets stuck in the crevices and the chair does not come apart so you can clean it(reminds me of the Prima Papa Highchair which also has too many crevices for food to get stuck in). The tray was tight against my son's stomach at 1 year old and he is a little fella. The hooks to detach the tray from the seat are made of soft plastic so they bend and break...the tray also gets stained easily from spaghetti sauce and fruit...very porous, cheap plastic. It is heavy and cumbersome, has no shoulder strap and I would never take it out of the house. The only good thing about this seat is that the tray is useful if you turn it upside down on the floor and put snacks on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clasps are not secure.","review":"I liked the way the seat folds, and it is easy to travel with, however the tray locking clasps are very weak.

We tried it at their home and at a restaurant and we absolutely love it! In fact, we will be purchasing a second one for our house. It's nice not to have to worry about how stable, clean or safe the high chairs at a restaurant will be and the storage area is perfect for a spoon, a bib and a couple of burp clothes (or wet wipes).A comment on the other reviews... Someone mentioned that the straps loosen. We noticed this as well and to correct the problem you have to pull the retracted straps out COMPLETELY every time you use the chair. If you leave any part retracted, there is room to loosen. Also, it takes a bit of practice to figure out how to get the tray to go on and stay on (both with the child in the seat and when it's folded) so try it before the seat is needed to avoid frustration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for every day use! \\"Tray\\" is a big waste!","review":"I have been using this booster seat for a while now and it is nothing but a pain to me. the tray that came with it went in the closet the first day we bought the booster seat and we have never used it. (My slender son would not fit in the seat with the tray attached.) For a while, the seat worked well. I guess it still \\"works\\" well, but it is the most pain in the rear thing to clean. There are way too many cracks and crevases to possibly keep it clean. And the retractable belts are a great idea, but in my opinion are just a breeding ground for bacteria and other things from the impossibility to keep it clean.If you were to use this as an occasional on-the-go seat, I would probably recommend it, but don't buy this seat if you plan on using it daily as your primary booster seat!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Tray Doesn't Stay!","review":"I think the seat is convenient because it folds up for travel, but it's not very sturdy and I don't like it because my son had no problem popping the tray off, and food went flying everywhere.I gave it a second chance and the same thing happened.

The only thing that is not practical, is the way the tray on the chair is so low, it almost rests on top of my childs legs. She's a little string bean as it is. I don't know how well it would work for a bigger child. Plus, then the food has more room to fall. But, if you're buying this just for a seat, to travel with, this is perfect.I love the way it folds.I love the easy clean up.It has a small storage area, for bibs and spoons.The straps are nice and comfy.It has a neat mechanism to wind the straps tight around the chair, with just the turn of a little crank.I recommend this chair to my friends.

I am a bit leery of restaurant highchairs for many reasons. I found that this seat was a bit stiff to fold, and the tray was difficult to lock on in both the upright AND folded position. Not handy if you are all hungry and in a hurry. Also, if only booths are available to sit in, the tray would not be an option, and the height of the seat is would not adjust high enough for her to reach. I returned this seat, and borrowed my friend's table-lock type high chair instead.

It is just about impossible to clean completely without taking it apart and that is also just about impossible without breaking it.3. The tray only has one position which was qhite snug on both of my kids and they are average size.Benefits:1. I love the ratcheting belts so you don't have to drag them or tie them up.2. I also love the design of the seat buckles. My 2 year old can fasten herself in but can't get herself out. That's perfect.3. I do like how it all folds up and is compact.

I recommended this seat to all of my friends and family who are new mothers, as it is easy to install, lightweight, and even has a built-in carrying handle. The only drawback is that the tray is not adjustable, so larger babies may grow out of it quicker; my daughter's growing belly won't fit behind the tray before long. We've used this seat at restaurants, parties, etc., in all types of chairs, including Windsor and a high-back stool!

I chose this instead of a regular high chair because it was cheaper, and I liked the idea. It did fit well to the chair though. I was able to tighten it so it did not move at all. It was just very uncomfortable for my 10month old. She kept ending up sliding down, I was constantly having to straigten her. Thank goodness, I kept the box. I took it back and spend [$$] more and bought the highchair I originally wanted. If you like the idea of the booster chair, spent the extra money to get the nicer one."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!","review":"We bought this chair to use instead of a highchair when visiting relatives and we HATE it! Our son is 18 months old and constantly pulls the tray off, spilling his food all over the place. The few times he hasn't been able to get the tray off the first time his little fingers have gotten caught in between the seat and the tray, giving him a pinch! Certainly the person who designed this chair did not give into the fact that kids can do things that adults can't. I have a difficult time getting the tray to grab on in the back. Fortunately, if the tray isn't on properly it sits crooked in front of him! If I could return this chair I would in a second."},{"rating":"1","title":"Safety NOT 1st","review":"I needed a compact booster seat for traveling. I purchased this one and was very disappointed with it. First of all, I feel the straps are very unsafe. The 2 straps which should come from the back of the seat, actually come from the bottom so it secures the child very low which allows them to lean over the sides. The tray is difficult to put on, in both positions. And my daughter is an average sized 7 month old and will not be able to fit in the seat with the tray on for much longer. The only redeeming quality is that the straps retract into the seat so that they are not hanging out while being transported. (Not quite a trade-off for my child's safety.) Needless to say, I will be returning this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for babies","review":"I bought this because it looked more compact for going out and was cheeper.

Spend the extra money first!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Straps come loose","review":"I'm not in love with this chair. When traveling, the tray won't stay attached to the bottom, like it is supposed to (a minor, but irritating problem when you're trying to tote a lot of gear.) More importantly, I can't get the straps to stay taut around the chair; they're always loose after my daugter eats a meal in the chair, which allows her to rock back and forth in it and bang her head against the chair back. Finally, it's a pain to clean up with all its nooks and crevices. I wouldn't recommend this chair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Safety my a$$","review":"I purchased this chair at Christmas time for my daughter. I wish I would have considered other similar ones out there. THREE months later my daughter can pull the tray.

Its hard to believe that a company with safety in its name would promote a poor seat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap, Fragile, Not Recommended.","review":"The fold and go booster was our initial attempt in the art of portable boosters. We had fallen in love with a different brand that our friends had, so we ran out and got this thing. Mistake.Plus side: will hold a child upright while being fed.Minus side: straps do not detach easily for cleaning. Tray is not fully adjustable. Bottom feet prone to collapse. Chair falls apart.Seriously, we were taking it apart to wash it, and the cheap plastic buttons holding the back on broke. This is the second portable we had to scrap. There is still a lot of engineering that needs to be done on this model."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for travel and on the go","review":"I have not found another seat that packs up as easily as this one. It is so easy to take on the go and set up quickly. We keep ours in the car trunk for that reason.I did buy another one for home use. This one has a lower back support and our son is tall. Also, like others said, the tray is not adjustable and doesn't leave much room for his big belly."},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughter loves it!","review":"We began to use this when my daughter turned 11 months old. We had a horrible highchair and she was too small for it, so we switched to the booster. She sits up so nice and tall in it.

It's very portable too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great options but my 13 month old is too big for it!","review":"I originally purchased this at Babies R Us without my daughter. I loved the retractable belts and that it folds up for travel. I was very excited to start using it at home. My daughter was going to sit at the table like a big girl! I however was disappointed that with the tray on, my daughter's belly was squished. My daughter is a little big for her age with a nice healthy round baby belly, but the box said up to 4 years old and she is no where near that size. WIthout the tray she fits nicely, but we really wanted a booster with a tray.My suggestion would be to read the reviews online and then take your child with you to the store. When I returned this booster, I put my daughter in the other boosters to see which one would work best. Good advidce for any baby purchases! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed!","review":"We purchased this chair for our 14-month old son with the intent of using it mainly for travelling and eating out. The handle for the chair is very small making it difficult to carry it along with a toddler. The seat is cumbersome to unfold and the tray...bad design! The tray goes on pretty easily but you need a structural engineer to remove it! The straps that attach the seat to the chair are retractable but only when you turn a crank on the underside of the chair that makes a very, very loud noise (less than ideal when you are out at a restaurant!). We had high hopes that this chair would work for us and were very disappointed when we tried using it. We have since bought The First Years On-The- Go booster that self-inflates and LOVE IT!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this seat","review":"I bought this seat for my 12 month old son. He loves it and so do I. The seat folds up very compactly and it's nice that the straps wind up into the unit to keep it neat and easier to carry. Friends have put their younger, smaller children into this seat and they don't slip down the way they have in other boosters. I haven't had any problems with the legs not staying in place as someone else mentioned - as a matter of fact, the first few times I had to put some muscle into popping them back down again. Overall, a very good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsafe and uncomfortable product","review":"I have been quite displeased with this seat. I feel that it is unsafe because my daughter can easily fall over while in this seat if she rocks or reaches for an object. The strap that is supposed to secure it to a chair loosens if she moves at all! Therefore, we have only been able to use it on the floor. It is uncomfortable for her because it does not recline. This makes it hard for her to tilt her head back to drink. I would not recommend this product at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I didn't purchase this item","review":"I just bought this as an extra to remain at Grandma's house. Well, my 1 year old 21 lb daughter can hardly fit between the tray and the seat. The tray only has 1 position and it is so snug against her stomach, with just a light shirt on, that she can't use it comfortable.If your child is super skinny this is probably a better bet for you. The straps did seem to hold my daughter in safely, but the non-adjustable tray just made this booster impossible for us to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tray broke 2nd time used!","review":"I bought this booster seat without checking the reviews like I normally do, and what a dissaster! The tray broke (locking clip on left side broke off) and now my 1 year old can easily pop off the tray with one kick of his leg. The tray itself is not adjustable so as he gets bigger he will outgrow it. The booster is not as compact as I thought, so I don't really know how much better of a traveling seat it is than others. So next time....I will check the reviews first! Lesson learned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Concept, Doesn't Deliver","review":"I was very excited to find this product on the shelf. I love the idea of pulling out a second highchair but being able to store it away. The putting away task is a rather difficult chore, to say the least. The retractable straps stopped retracting correctly after the 4th or 5th use. All the folding mechanisms refuse to remain in a locked position, and the storage compartment on ours will not stay closed. I would not recommend this product if your child is more than a year and a half old . . . my 2 year old barely fits with the tray attached (does not offer adjustable positioning), it really works best as a booster seat at a table for us . . . Good luck using this product, I am glad to see it has worked out better for others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for traveling on over night trips!","review":"I bought this chair because it's compact and doesn't take up much space when you travel. I keep it in my SUV at all times because I never know when I might need it. When we travel overnight somewhere, it comes in very handy. There is a compartment built in for bib storage. It is easy to clean after use. The only drawbacks I have about the chair is that the yellow table part doesn't stay fastened when you fold it up after use and also, if you're dining alone with your baby it is difficult to set up with one hand. Otherwise, this is a great purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"STILL LOVE THIS CHAIR AFTER 2 YEARS","review":"WE PURCHASED THIS BOOSTER SEAT FOR USE AT OUR FAMILY DINING TABLE.

IF YOU WANT TO \\"SCOOT\\" YOUR CHILD UP TO THE TABLE TO EAT LIKE THE \\"BIG\\" PEOPLE YOU'D BE WISE TO PURCHASE THE SAFETY FIRST SEAT BECAUSE OTHER SEATS HAVE ARM RESTS THAT ARE TOO HIGH TO FIT UNDERNEATH MANY TABLES. ALSO, THE PERMANENT SEAT FEATURE IS NICE - THE FIRST YEARS SEAT IS ADJUSTABLE AND IT ALWAYS COMES OUT OF ITS BRACKETS AND FALLS DOWN! THE SAFETY FIRST CHAIR IS THE BEST.

Problem is this one is the pits!It doesn't fit many chairs (square back)Cleaning is a nightmare! - The straps are underneath where the child sits and all the food gets dropped. I constantly trying to dig the gunk out of where the straps go through the bottom.Nothing like smooshed banana...yeeeuck.The storage tray never stays closed when carrying it around.If I were to do it again I would get another Fisher Price -Healthy Care Booster (the first one I bought). I don't need to hassle of cleaning this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"During the holidays we traveled a lot. Also while in work my daughter is at my parents house, it is a small house, so I didn't want to have to leave a highchair there. So I thought this would be a great thing to feed her on. What a pain. The tray doesn't stay on, so while you're trying to feed the baby you also have to try & keep the tray on. I gave up and stopped using it, it's not worth the hassle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fold N Go Booster","review":"I just purchased this product and was so excited that this booster was so compact and would be easy to transport. However, when I set the product up, I wasn't very impressed. The whole design just looked too small...especially the tray. My son, who is only 11 months old, looked so uncomfortable when I put him into the booster to try it out. The tray isn't adjustable and it was firmly pressed into his tummy. Needless to say, I just purchased this product today and will be returning it tomorrow. The booster states that it is useful up to 4 years of age. My son hasn't even turned 1 and he already doesn't fit into this product. So unless your infant/toddler is very tiny, I wouldn't recommend this booster at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great chair!","review":"What a great chair. I can see that you could do without a large higchair and get away with just this - and it is really portable.It folds up well and is quick to set up. I like that it attaches in two places to your chair. There is a handy compartment in the seat back that you can put spare bibs etc. It doesn't recline, so a baby that is not sitting by herself would not be well supported. If you are buying a booster instead of a highchair, I would go with one of the more expensive reclining models.I gave it only four stars because it does not seem like it will last long. My daughter is 9 months and average weight and the tray fits a little snug. But she loves to sit at the 'big table' with the rest of the family. All in all, a great purchase for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great features, good price, serves the purpose","review":"We bought this chair when our daughter was 6 months old (now 1 year) and it has served the purpose - it's really great for travel (though does take up alot of room in the luggage), and lightweight. We have used it in all types of restaurants, at friends homes, while abroad and it is SECURE and our baby has always seemed comfortable. We share a nanny and the other baby at our house eats in it almost daily without a problem or complaint. I have to disagree with the previous writer about the legs; they DO lock in place if you push them up after opening (you'll hear a snap). I agree about the straps being too long. My biggest complaint is of the size (not very compact even when folded) and the difficulty in snapping in the tray. Now that our baby is older I would go for the trayless model that is also light weight for traveling purposes. Even so, this was a great purchase and continues to be put to great use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Design needs to improve","review":"Purchased this for my 23 month old daughter and do not like it because the tray is not adjustable so the food falls on my daughter's lap and inside the seat (tray doesn't sit close enough), the tray surface is way too small so stuff is easily knocked off, and the door to the storage compartment on seat back will not stay latched and keeps coming open. I do like the retractable straps, but that's about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget the tray. Good compact booster","review":"I needed a portable chair that I could leave in the car when I want to use it at Grandma's or at a resturant. It suited my main need. It is compact and folds into a small profile. But the tray is a complete waste of time. My 16 month son easily ripped it off. I like the retractable straps and height extensions. Be warned, you need to pull the strap all the way out and tighten by pulling the straps from the buckle."},{"rating":"1","title":"This seat is BIG TROUBLE","review":"Like many of the reviewers, I was excited about the features of this seat. The adjustable height and retractable straps sounded great, BUT once we put it into use, we realized that it was too good to be true. The tray is too small, too tight, and difficult to put on/take off. The retractable straps on ours do not stay tight around the chair anymore (after maybe 5 uses). We think it's annoying and dangerous! I'd recommend ANY other booster seat because I really can't imagine one being any worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tray can be removed by child. MESS!","review":"At first glance, this appears to be the ideal booster seat. It does fold up easily and the interior of the chair is easy to clean after each meal. HOWEVER, be forewarned. If you don't mind cleaning up food that has been sent flying through the air by your clever little one, then this is the chair for you. Our daughter figured out how to send the tray and it's contents sailing through the air when she decided she was finished eating. I would recommend the older safety first model which had a better locking mechanism. But they are rare and hard to find. Don't try customer service, they will not take the chair back, and refused to believe that there was a problem. As you can see from several other reviewers, there is a problem with this product. Good luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time with this one","review":"I bought this booster seat 2 times and it is cheaply made and the tray broke off twice. the fisher price on the go is the way to go!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not safe and difficult to use!","review":"I found the tray on this booster very difficult to get off. You have to push it in first and then up, and I nearly hit the baby in the face when pushing it in because it can't be done easily. After only a couple uses, one of the latches that secures the tray to the chair broke off. I returned it immediately and bought the Fisher Price Healthy Care Booster, which I absolutely love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Happy","review":"I was really excited to purchase this booster seat, since we had been lugging around our sons regular sized highchair every place we went. The retractable straps were the biggest selling point for us on this seat, unfortunately they tangled up after the first time we used it making it impossible to use a second time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch out for the folding back--it can pinch little fingers!","review":"I originally purchased this fold n go booster because I liked how compact it was... However, when I got home and set it up, two things happened that I didn't like. 1. the storage compartment flap kept coming down, not a huge deal, but a little annoying--the latch mechanism could be better. 2. My little 9 month old son is quite the investigator-- he was looking at his new chair and the back folded down and caught his little fingers-- I don't think it hurt him, but it sure gave him a good scare- it is Something that I do not want to happen again, and completly unacceptable. I immediatly folded the booster up, put it in the box and returned it to toys r'us. I got the fisher price model instead--for $5.00 more, it is sooo much better. Firstly it is slightly more compact, and secondly there is no way little fingers can get caught, the seat back can only be folded down by mommy's and daddy's..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the $$","review":"I have a high chair at my house but my 6 month old spends a long at grandma's house. I didn't want to spend too much money for another highchair so I thought this would work perfect, not expensive and I would be able to take it anywhere. Sorry to say that is not so. This product could not hold my baby from falling over to the sides and it would slide off the chair. But I guess you get what you pay for. I would not recommend this product unless you have a baby that can sit very still and not move an inch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea that needs some work.","review":"A portable, collapsible chair would be a great thing to have if only it worked. Our four-month-old cannot sit in the chair while the tray is in place. It's just too tight a squeeze the way it's been designed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Not Work for Me","review":"I did not like this chair. I opted for this booster chair because of it's price and I liked the idea. Boy did I get what I paid for. Nothing but pieces of plastic. Although, it did attach securey to the chair. No worries about her falling out. But my 9 month old daughter kept slumping down, I was continuously having to straighten her. It looked very uncomfortable. I finally gave up and took it back. I bought the high chair I originally wanted. If you like the idea for the booster chair, pay the extra money to get something of better quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"This seat is awesome!","review":"We all love this seat. I have a 17 month old in the 97 percentile for weight and height and she fits in this fine. I have to say that we don't use the tray at all because we just scoot her up to the table and she fits in just fine. I never had a problem cleaning it and we use it wherever we go - visiting friends, travelling, at the restaurants that don't have high chairs (yes, there are a few out there)....And it's inexpensive too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as clever as you think!","review":"Okay -- it has some great features, which is why I bought it in the first place, but after just a few times out, we discovered this seat is NOT all that it's cracked up to be! Yes, it folds easily and compactly. And yes, the retractable straps are a huge improvement over the dangling straps of other seats. BUT the tray IS too tight as a few other reviewers have mentioned and cannot be adjusted. And, as I just found out -- the seat (under which all kinds of smelly spills get trapped) cannot be opened, nor the straps (which get really gross over time) removed for cleaning -- a MUST for all children's feeding accessories! Any seat that cannot be virtually hosed down is simply not worth the cost. Safety1st makes a better booster seat than this in its older, more generic models -- go for one of those instead! I threw mine out when it began to smell!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great For Away-From-Home Feedings","review":"My mother-in-law bought this booster seat when we came to visit with our 9 month old and it worked great. I especially liked that it had a tray. Plus, it was easy to fold up and carry. We took it back home with us and have used it when we have been over at friends' houses for dinner. There is no way it would replace the high chair at home, but it is great and priced right for when you need to feed away from home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good chair, the tray stinks though!","review":"Overall we really like this chair and it comes in handy. One thing I hate is the way the tray comes on and off. It's really easy to get the tray on but the way you have to remove it is impossible if the kid is in the seat. In trying to get it off without crushing my daughters chest I broke off one of the tabs. Now it doesn't fold for travel as well as it should. We still leave it in the trunk and use it when we go out, but if I had to buy another one I probably wouldn't buy this one again or recommend it to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to use","review":"I found that it was difficult for my five month old to sit up in this chair without falling over. The storage unit was very small, too small for anything but a bib. My mom used it one day and broke the hook that holds the tray on."},{"rating":"1","title":"MIL bought this for her house.","review":"It seems flimsy to me...I loved the old wooden highchair she had from dh and his brother, but she said it must not be comfortable, because they didn't want to stay in it - it now lives at MY folks and ds loves it.Anyway, this plastic seat can't be easily moved from one room to another - it straps onto a regular dining chair. Ds can't climb up onto it, as there is no footrest like his wooden chairs have. It also doesn't fit under her dining table very well. It ends up being too short for ds to have a good view of the table. MIL loves it because it's new, but I don't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy and frustrating.","review":"I thought I'd love it because it folds up small and has all these neat little features. But the one thing that just didn't sit right with me was its flimsiness!The tray is at best a thin piece of plastic. It's also hard to put on and take off the seat. Furthermore, you can't adjust its position on the booster.The lid for the so-called compartment in the back hardly stays in place, and pops off with the slightest jiggle, making it impossible to store anything in it.The wind-up straps don't really lock in place -- the straps can easily slip loose while fastened on the chair, making it very dangerous for the child.The only remarkable feature that it has is that it folds up smaller than any of the other booster seats with trays that I've seen on the market. But because it's so flimsy and frustrating to use, we returned it as soon as I took it out of the box."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mistake to purchase","review":"I bought this seat for my 11 month old daughter yesterday and returned it this morning. The tray is too small and the seat can't be taken apart to be cleaned. Both are important features to me. After trying several in the store, something I should have done in the first palce, I chose the Safety First seat with the swing out tray. The tray had 2 adjustments and fit around my daughter nicely. The seat can be taken apart to be cleaned, as well as the straps. I paid the same amount for my new seat as I did for the fold n go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for small spaces/needs modification for chubby baby","review":"This is a nice, compact seat that we use as baby's main feeding seat at home and away. The only problem was that the tray top attached and pressed on her chubby little legs. A slight modification was made by easily cutting away the edge that was pressing against her, and now it's perfect. I know the manufacturer would frown at this, but it works just fine with the modification. Also, the one I have has a plastic compartment on the back that pops open whenever I put anything in it. Bad design, but not really a necessay thing. I think the new one has a mesh bag instead. Good idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"Don't bother with this one....Hard to cleanTray is tight, small and falls offBack compartment is too small for anything but a tiny bib and the door falls open constantly anyway.It slides and has no grippers or suction to grab a chair.It is clumsy to travel with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Taking this chair back..............","review":"I am taking this chair back because the tray is awful. The tray falls off and is not at all secure. The Fisher Price one is much better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"good idea, not durable","review":"I never even got my child into this seat - the chair back would not lock into place. The plastic notches that are supposed to hold this area securely are very cheap and seem like they would wear with use. I am returning this and trying a different product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Useful Item","review":"We keep our booster in the car. It has become one of the most helpful items! When we go to restaurants, I don't have to worry about the cleanliness of public boosters. I use ours. It is also nice, because it fits in booths, so I have been able to put our child in the seat next to me. It's nice to have when traveling too, since it practically serves as a high chair. All I have to do is strap it to a seat, and our child can eat at table, or use the tray, for her to feed herself! I must say, I really enjoy this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Disappointed","review":"My husband and I bought this booster seat because it seemed covenient for home and travel. However, in testing it out, we found many flaws. Our oldest son is almost two and is too big for it already (even though it says ages 6mos to 4yrs), especially with the tray on. The straps that secure the booster seat onto the chair do not lock in place. After a while of my son moving around in the seat, the straps became loose and the seat was falling off the chair. We were very unhappy with this product and will be returning it for the 4 in 1 seat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gets nasty really quickly","review":"At first we were really happy with this seat. We never used the tray as we just pushed our baby up to the table and we never messed with the retractable straps or storage compartment. Then our baby got sick and vomited while in the seat, as babies frequently do. Now, because the seat doesn't come apart we have a disgusting pool of vomit inside the seat that cannot be cleaned. When we turned the dial to retract the straps in a futile effort to take the thing apart, it actually drips vomit out of the dial! The company told us there was no way to take the seat apart and clean it out. We are disgusted and will buy a new seat this weekend.Buy this seat only if you are very sure your child will never spit up, become sick, or otherwise get food all over the seat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for my child!","review":"On the recommendation of friends, I purchased this booster seat for my son. Our high chair is just a little to big for him, so I thought this might be a good alternative. I am so glad I have the receipt because it is going right back. I tried it for the first time last night. My six month old son was repeatedly able to pop the tray off! I also didn't feel comfortable with the folding legs - they just seem too wobbly. I would feel much better if they locked into place. I wish I had gone to BabiesRUs and tried out the seat before I bought it - something I highly recommend all parents do!"},{"rating":"2","title":"nice to have","review":"I purchased this instead of a highchair for my 6 month old, we didn't really start to use it till he was 8 1/2 months old.We are limited on space for a highchair and I thought this would be nice and he can sit near the table.I do like it, easy to set up to use on a chair, easy to clean, the tray it large enough, and my little one likes it.Its nice that it can travel nice, but I use my floppy seat for travel. But I like that this can grow with my baby and I don't have to worry about the space the highchair would take up.Don't use the tiny storage in the back, so I just put the intructions in there for future use."},{"rating":"1","title":"His Monkey Wife","review":"Quirky books always get my attention, and this one had lots of promise. However, the victorian language was so stilted and verbose it was hard to appreciate the story. I kept plowing through it, hoping to get to the quirky, fun part of the story, and it never came! The story begins with a charming premise: The pet chimp is jealous of the simpering fiancee. The chimp's machinations to foil the fiancee are amusing at first. Then, it is as if the author got tired of being clever and merely wrote to get the story finished. The story goes beyond quirky and into the truly bizarre. I was disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unfortunate bad news","review":"Perhaps the construction quality has changed over the last 18 months.

No evengrinding in either mill (one holds salt, the other pepper) without lots of fussing with the screw nob at the top to adjust the opening. Some peppercorns come out broken in half, while others are appropriately \\"ground\\". Peppercorns get caught in the grinding mechanism. In the case of the salt mill, again uneven grinding. It may be because the sea salt I have in there seems a bit more moist than bone dry. My chief complaint is that when you use the mill, you need to adjust the screw on top with every movement, thus, you get what I mentioned...the case of the uneven grind!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pain to fill","review":"This grinder is a nightmare to fill. When you take the top off the grinder body has a spring that forces the bottom out so the salt or pepper falls all over the floor.. you have to try to hold in the grinder at the bottom with one finger while trying to pour with the other hand..

I get bored easily, so that really helped me stay motivated . First dance is easy, you can do it even if you've never tried bellydancing before. First dance is 7 combinations. The second dance is a drum solo and it's 12 combinations. It's more challenging for me even though I've taken bellydance classes before.

I have always had an affinity for this father-daughter team specially the daughter's endearing screech. There are some good numbers here like \\"Heaven's Just A Sin Away\\", that make one smile a put a bounce in your step. I thought their versions of \\"Makin' Believe\\" and \\"Leavin' On A Jet Plane\\" were superb. Some numbers, like \\"I don't do like that anymore\\" are flat and sound like fillers.All said, this is a very good CD that I listen to when I am in a mood for some genuine country night club music.

The writing, though refreshingly evangelistic at times, seems to be geared toward young gamers and the like. -- a Mac user since 1990."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless Mac promotion","review":"I've been using mac PC's since the 80's and found they generally are worth the limited software and 60% extra cost as a Windows computers. That being said, the last thing I want is a magazine that ignores problems with the Mac. If you can't admit there's a problem, you can't print the solution. Instead, the magazine is nothing more than a forum for advertisers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long wait, no CD. Waste of time and money.","review":"Waited five months before I got my first issue. I should have canceled it but I honestly forgot about it for a while.Then I realized this Amazon subscription does not come with a CD!That is the whole point of me ordering MacLife - to get the CD with all the extra goodies.Thank you Amazon and Future Inc. You really know how to treat us great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks focus...","review":"Unless you own all of the products currently popular (by Apple) it is complete waste of time. I DO own (2) iMac's, (1) Macbook Pro, (2) iPods...but...still failed to gain anything of value after reading two issues. It was in fact, boring...The majority of the articles were advertisements for \\"extras\\" for iPads, iPhones, etc...etc... Very little useful information for computer users."},{"rating":"1","title":"MacLife","review":"Possibly a good magazine for geeks but not for this amateur. Way too technical for me.

Buying from Amazon saved me $5 per year compared to what the best offer from the Publishers offer..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five stars for MacAddict ...","review":"If you are a Macintosh user you deserve to live. But if you buy this magazine without the disc you deserve to have a PC...oh no, how I could, I wrote those two letters together. Well, don't misunderstand me, this is THE MAGAZINE for mac users, but without the the disc it's just like this: Mom, may I watch the t.v.? -Oh yes, honey, you can watch it, just don't turn it on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring. Much of the same. Articles outdated.","review":"This magazine was purchased on a gold box last time it was offered (before today 4/8). I got it and it is an OK magazine but has many of the same articles and many times they just seem irrelevant by the time they finally hit the shelves. I won't buy again even for a few bucks a year...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vulgar language, high school writing, should be iPhone Life","review":"I was looking for objective reviews of Mac products, specially computer software and hardware because it is limited to a few pages of most technology magazines. The writers are not objective, half of each issue is devoted to the iPhone, and the writing is only slightly better than that of my high school students. The use of profanity as well as poor analysis reveals this to be a very unprofessional magazine. I'll not be renewing my subscription."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless Magazine","review":"Mac Life magazine is useless -- as a new Mac user I thought it might be helpful in learning about Macs, but during my year's subscription I read maybe 2 helpful articles. The bulk of the Magazine for more than half of the year has been about iPhone and apps. Not being interested in either, I found little in the magazine that was worth reading. Sure, some of the many ads are interesting, but I don't need to pay money to read them!I will not be renewing my subscription and have been very disappointed in this magazine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Much To It","review":"I've been getting this magazine and a couple of others for years now, how disappointing this one is with the lack of stories, informationd something useful.

Previously, I had no friends who could tell me why Macs are better over PC. But one friend came along and pulled me out of the dungeon of PC/W-XP and the world is suddenly brighter with sunshine.Maclife is like a great treasure box of mac knowledge.You will learn just about everything there is to know about Mac (other than getting yourself certified.)I like both MacLife and Macworld magazine, they are both great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great magazine, but needs to lose the attitude","review":"I've been reading Mac Live for years since they were Mac Addict and continue to enjoy the detailed and applicable reviews. They have shed much of their smarmy attitude, but some remains.If you are looking for honest, unbiased product reviews and great tips for your macintosh, this is an outstaning magazine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad articles","review":"Just not the kind of reporting I expected. Search online and you will get better information for less."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never got a single issue of my subscription","review":"I did not use Amazon to subscribe to MacLife, as far as I can remember there was an offer on Version Tracker in February 2007. Nevertheless, I have not seen a single issue of the publication. I contacted their customer service a couple of times and finally asked for a refund but did not receive it either.Subscribe at your own peril."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Time, SAve Money, Save Your Sanity, SKIP THIS!!!!","review":"I love my Mac. I have had a Mac since college, since the first \\"Wild Eeep\\" was available. But unless you are a real EggHead, I find that this and the \\"other\\" Mac Mag is just too much Mac Mush. Honestly, what I do is go to Amazon.com's electronics section (...) and peruse the information there about products. I don't have to fight my way through a bunch of cyber-jargon or EggHead lingo. And I don't have to fight for three months to get the renewal taken off my credit card."},{"rating":"1","title":"No item to review!","review":"I would like to write a review, but I have yet to receive the item ..... MacLife ... that was ordered August 5th 2007. When and/or if I receive it, I will be happy to make my review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cringeworthy","review":"Where Macworld is bad, Addict is dreadful. It is dumbed down to the level of Teen Beat, and the \\"reviews\\" don't deserve the name. The extent to which it drools over Apple is embarassing, leaving no pretence of independence. Like its competitor, it exploits the crummy support that typifies the computer industry, so we get articles about the \\"secrets\\" of such and such product. A \\"secret\\" in the computer industry is a feature or defect that has not been properly documented by the manufacturer. This should be blasted, not applauded. But Addict is happy to exploit readers by selling them the information they should have gotten when they purchased the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"haven't received subscription yet","review":"How do am I supposed to rate this? I haven't received this subscription yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reviews are too old.","review":"I was going to subscribe to this magazine and came to these reviews to find out what folks thought before I entered my subscription.The newest review of this magazine I found was July of 2008. This is 2010 and I have been told that the Mac Life magazine has changed to mostly ads.Yet, there are no new reviews. So, no subscription from me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Subscriptions are not Amazons strength. Order one, and wait, and wait.","review":"Second one I've purchased. I should have remembered. Amazon is a great place to purchase many items. And, I love being a customer. But, Magazines are not a good fit. Be prepared to wait two months for your first issue.And, also, be prepared to not get all the issues. I'm hoping that I'm the only one who has this problem. Cause Amazon is great, and so it MacLife."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great addition to your Mac-filled Life","review":"MacLife is a great magazine for people who love their Mac's and want to get the most out of them. Whether its in product recommendations or in stories, the magazine is well worth the subscription price."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Better Choice","review":"All the above is accurate, but choose \\"BBC Best of the War Years\\". All the same pieces, plus many more. Please note all the BBB Big Band CD's have the same pieces, they differ only in how many pieces you get when purchase the specific CD. \\"BBC Best of the War Years\\" offers the most pieces."},{"rating":"2","title":"Word differences","review":"This is the only book from Longman I would have ever considered buying. I love it and I have recommended it to all of my students and most have purchased it and they also find it useful. This useful little book shows you the differences between words. For example. hotel, motel, inn, etc. Only buy the English version of this book. There is a Chinese version available but the translations are terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not get it to work","review":"I tried to replace my old Swingline tiny tot 50 stapler because I could not find refill staples for it. So I tried this Slim Portable Stapler. I have always bought Swingline because they were always the best. My old Swingline staplers have lasted for years and still staple smoothly. Anyway, I took this new Swingline Portable out of the package, filled it with staples and simply could not get it to work. I tried sliding the button which was difficult to slide, and still could not get it to work. I returned it. I luckily and happily found refills for my old Swingline tiny tot 50 stapler here on Amazon and could not be happier. Why doesn't Swingline bring back that Tiny Tot 50 stapler it is great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work properly. Great concept and great design but it didn't function.","review":"doesn't work. Great design great concept but functionality is very low. Returned it to Amazon and purchased a smaller regular design stapler."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective","review":"Cheap stapler: the metal piece that pushes the staple into the paper, was bent out of place, which was making it defective. I tried to bend it into its proper place but it just broke. Waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Item","review":"This works really well. I never have to staple more than a few pages. I've actually been using it as my primary stapler, since my real stapler got lost during a recent move. One tip is that the \\"button\\" on the top needs to be in the more central position in order for it to work. I just keep it in this position (it doesn't close) but it's easier than forcing the button up/down each time I need to use it."},{"rating":"1","title":"a piece of trash I got","review":"It looks very fancy, but can not do its job at all. Feel like spending money on a trash. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Product","review":"It is the worst product I ever bought from Amazon. Till now I have bought so many products but this one is so cheap quality. Definitely not worth the price. I definitely don't recommend to anyone. The button to open and close is so stiff that even after putting some lubricant I was not able to move it front and back. You can get better product from ebay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken","review":"Item did not work immediately after opening package. Jammed repeatedly.Wasn't worth repacking and sending back so I threw it away.Great idea but poor execution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap.","review":"I bought this product because of the good reviews. Well, I got mine and hate it. It is a good idea, but is poorly made and doesn't work well. Sometimes it doesn't work at all. I would pay a few extra bucks and get a more quality product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"The only positive feature about this stapler is its slim profile. Other than that, it's pure junk. It only staples about half the time. The part that pushes the staples down does not match up well at all with the staples. After only about 10 uses the flimsy metal parts inside are starting to bend, so I'm sure it won't last long. You have to push down very hard to get the staples to penetrate even 3 pieces of paper, let alone the 12 claimed by the manufacturer, so it feels like it will quite literally fall to pieces in your hand at any given use. Yet another waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheep construction","review":"Used it couple of times to staple not more than 2 papers then it fell apart. See picture titeled went apart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality brand name, inferior product","review":"Don't let the fact that this is a Swingline fool you. While the design has potential, this stapler is not-user friendly. The button that you must slide to get it in position moves VERY hard. Maybe a strong hand could do it, but should a mini-stapler really require athletic muscular strength? I do love the carabiner clip so it doesn't get lost in my briefcase. But it would have been a better use of my money to go buy 5 or 6 dollar-store staplers and then just throw them away."},{"rating":"2","title":"exactly what i needed","review":"this stapler is perfect to keep in a binder, and works great so far. I have had a few comments from some people i work with saying it looks like to much of a hassle, but it doesn't seem that way at all to me. you just pop the middle open and pull the switch back, to get it into function mode, and when finished just do the reverse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stablemates Size","review":"The product description does not state that this set is Stablemates size. I could have guessed by looking at the product dimensions, but it didn't occur to me. The set itself is fine as long as you know what you are receiving."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lois/Clark Season3","review":"I always thought this series depicting Superman and Lois Lane was the best version even topping Christopher Reeve in the Superman movie series. It is totally believable how Clark/Superman and Lois Lane fall in love but yet keep everything in perspective. It was just a great television series and for the most part, very clean for all audiences. I can't wait for the final season to come out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lois & Clark (Season 3) DVDs from Warner Bros.","review":"Very, very nice!!This presentation of a light, entertaining, and off-the-charts charming little show is stylishly done. The menus enabling navigation around material on the DVDs are simple and easy to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great to see the show on dvd","review":"As usual the episodes are just as fun as we remembered when they aired. I just truly wish that the production company would work hard to put together more Special Features and Commentaries with those that were involved. That is my only beef."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fresh Look at an Always Classic Tale","review":"This is another great installment in the Lois & Clark Adventure. Its so fun to watch them work together and finally fall in love. Its full of twists and turns that make you frustrated with anticipation. You will be begging for them to hurry up and get together.We see a deeper more personal side of Superman that other TV series or movies lack. We get a glimps into the true character of a hero and his human traits.The special effects in the season are much better than the previous. It comes across as a sci-fi fantasy, but deep down its a romantic comedy full of action and suspense.It takes the struggles that we all face in life dealing with our own careers, ambitions, values and search for true love. It goes to show that it doesnt matter what happens, the heart will always find its way back."},{"rating":"2","title":"This 'superman\\" is the best of all past and present","review":"I like it overall, Dean Cain is by far the best in the role as compared to all who played Superman.

In addition to the episodes themselves, the box set includes several interesting special features. I would definitely recommend this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The second best season","review":"The second best season of Lois & Clark better than the first and second only to the second season. The tempest episode was a classic. A well written show for the enitre family."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent chapter book","review":"Betsy Duffey consistently delivers terrific children's books. The writing is varied and readable, and there are humor, pathos and realistic problems for early elementary readers. This installment in the series about Cody Michaels is no exception. The plot concerns Cody's trepidations at starting in a new school. He quickly decides that being plain ol' Cody isn't enough to impress his new classmates, so he develops a more interesting persona -- Super Cody! -- who hails from Alaska, is a championship roller skater, and has a pet emu and a dad who is really a secret agent! As you might guess, the truth eventually comes out in a disastrous (but funny) way, and Cody ultimately reveals himself as himself to some new friends. Great story, well told, and an excellent read-aloud book or chapter book for older elementary age children."},{"rating":"2","title":"For my dad","review":"My dad got this from me as a gift. He loved it because it is his favorite and it was hard to find. He was very surprised."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent visuals, but missing useful information","review":"Pros: this guidebook has lots of pictures and gives lots of information region by region, detailed cut-outs of major historical buildings. I also found the pictures in the survival guide section useful, where they describe the various Swiss dishes and food/drink products.Cons: no information on how to get to different places by train (e.g. from Interlaken to Schilthorn or Jungfraujoch). I understand the guide cannot list train numbers and times, but at least it could have described how to, for example, get from Luzern to Mt. Titlis by train. Train travel is a big part of the Switzerland experience so this seems like a big omission. There's also not much information on hiking, even though this is a very popular country with hikers. An overview map of hiking trails would have been useful. However, there are other guides that cover hiking so this is a minor omission by comparison."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good singer trashed","review":"This CD is the worst quality product possible. Often a song's ending is sudden stopped before the music ends. At times, a song is suddenly terminated by a extremly brief audience response. Furthermore, several songs sound like they were done by a Faron Young imitator.The CD appears to have been done in someone's home and the music does not represent Faron Young performances. My old scratch 45s sound better.Selling product of this quality could give Amazon a bad name."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than one star, how about a moon?","review":"Awful. Shortened songs, no original songs, no notes, nothing. I would have been better served to roll down my car window and pitch out 10 bucks. Don't bother on this one. Read the review at the bottom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely the worst","review":"Not only is the production quality extremely poor as other reviewers have noted, but, if you are a Faron Young fan like me you'll be traumatized!! These recordings were obviously made when he was WELL past his prime. His voice has none of the resonance or range it once did. A big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor customer support","review":"Without purchasing an additional licence this unit only supports 8 computers. When I purchased the upgrade (which cost almost as much as the unit) it did not install correctly. Support was unable to resolve the problem and level 2 support never calls back although they reply to my emails by promising to do so. More trouble than it is worth. Other routers don't have this 8 node limit. I'll not buy netgear again."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a joke, didn't even work right","review":"As a devoted user of Netgear cards and switches I am utterly disappointed in this product. My work purchased this item to use as our router for our new DSL line not knowing that there is a hidden trap and broken features. Only 8 computers can access the internet through this router until you pay even more for additional licenses. Additionally, the redirection of incoming traffic based on port numbers just refuses to work.

Also has site logging. Unit seems relatively quiet for its class. Great for protecting a family with young/teen kids from less desirable web material - but note that ongoing updates of 'bad' web sites requires an optional subscription. Has been running constantly for several weeks, no problems encountered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Firewall","review":"I'm a network engineer who has been working with PCs since the mid '80s. This is a good router and a flawless firewall. It's easy to setup and usually runs like a top. A hardware based firewall will ALWAYS outperform a software solution like Zone Alarm, which is your only option if you buy a standard DSL/Cable router like Linksys.With the release of firmware version 6.2.2 the FR314 now offers STEALTH mode, which means that not only will outsiders be blocked from connecting with your computer, they won't even know it exists. TCP/IP packets sent by hackers to probe for open ports will be eaten up by this firewall as if it were a black hole. You couldn't ask for anything better. This firewall (particularly with the updated firmware) is worth every single penny.Netgear still needs to improve their customer and technical support services...While frustrating, it shouldn't prevent you from buying this firewall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gotchas","review":"Be careful this router does not support PPTP connections with Microsoft Windows NT and 2000.

There are a couple of good leads for dropshippers via the net, but most are just trying to get you to send them money for information on their product. Most of the ads for dropshippers require a \\"snail mail\\" response with of course a fee for a catalog request. Overall this \\"39 page flyer\\" is not worth the money.

I still have, in mint condition, my original copy of the Mercury 45rpm single of \\"Kiss-A-Me Baby\\", along with more than 60 other Narvel singles, LP's and CD's. If you are familiar with only two or three Narvel hits and would like to hear more, then DO NOT buy this. Bear Family has two Narvel compilations in which to invest your money that will give you the true Narvel Felts. If you like the Bear Family original recordings then still more original Narvel is available from Amazon.com. Re-records are never the best way to listen to the body of work of any performer.

The only reason I would not give it five stars is that it loses the global context that is really essential to the war. Fowler covers not only the crucial Indian involvement but the sheer hopelessness of a French Victory. He clearly lays out how the war unfolded and what each side had to gain. He shows how the British reorganize their systems in America and bring about an eventual victory. The British victory is put in the context of what it means for the American Revolution a little over a decade away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken box","review":"I was disappointed when I opened the package to find that the box was broken all on the bottom.

The first song starts off a mood of a depressive floating state of mind and introduces some nice crunchy guitars to add spice at the right times. This is for fans of Goth, Rock, Pink Floyd (you can hear a heavy Pink Floyd influence throughout Visionaire, only make it a little heavier and doomy). \\"Fragmented\\" and \\"Conquest\\" are heavier songs to snap you away from the moodiness for a while until James comes along and transforms your mind state with his excellent writing and structuring skills.

Its copier is also excellent and faxes are great. The only few problems i have with it is the feeder scanner... most of the time it gets sucked in sideways or crooked and it comes out printer at an angle, most of the time it only feeds it at a tiny angle, and very rarly it has trouble sucking the paper in, but thats not to much a problem you just tap the paper into the feeder. Overall i would reccomend this printer its a great size for what it does if you have small desk space, the ink cartiges can be a bit pricy compared to just regular printers, but the cartages last a very long time if you just using it for office use, and very little photos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paper Feeder Jams ...","review":"I bought this printer for work about 8 months ago, mainly for the fax machine, and I would NOT recommend it (and I can't say I wasn't warned, either); the feeder part doesn't take the paper very well ... no matter how carefully you put it in... and I mean with ALL different qualities of paper, too. It ends up wrinkling the paper and then you definitely can't feed it in. I am a very patient person, but this fax machine has raised my blood pressure more times than I can describe!

I can not copy without getting an extra black line on my copies that runs from top to bottom, and the origional I am coping from does not have this mysterious line on it. I can not send or receive faxes, I can not scan, I can not align my print cartridges, and after three tries I can not try again. I didn't know until I read through reviews from other unhappy consumers that if you have windows XP, like I do, that you get nothing but problems with this printer. Everytime I have consulted the book that came with the printer, what I am having trouble with is never in the book. What happened to the troubleshooter section? Next time I am in the market for a printer, it definately will not be a HP product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works great for one year!","review":"I used this machine to copy and fax.

I also played the PS2 version quite a bit and the gameplay and overall quality of the product is much better on the PS2 version. I quickly cut my losses and sold the PS3 version for about $8.

I owned a PS2 and owned the Madden 07 title for that console, (5 stars by the way) but this has been most disappointing of all experiences.Madden and the usual announcers are not there. Instead you get some crazy guy that sounds like a radio announcer. The game play is totally different, the franchise mode has lost over half of the cool functions of the game. Oh, did I mention that it has the same title as the PS2 version, but doesn't even come close to the quality of game play? The only thing that gives the game any credit is the graphics, and they look as if someone slapped it together in the 720 format hoping that the increase in definition would make up for the shortcomings.

This makes franchise mode almost unplayable.2) There is no way to edit player ratings3) There are no formation-specific substitutions4) The announcer is a generic radio voice -- no Madden!!

It's super fun to play and has great graphics, etc. I bought a PS3 and of couse the first game I grabbed was Madden '07. What a complete dissapointment. I expected something great and what I got was a step back. This doesn't even deserve the Madden name on it. Talk about throwing a game together too fast just to get it out...that's exactly what happened here. I suspect that Madden '08 on PS3 will be much, much better because this one is pathetic. The designers should be embarassed. However, this is pretty much par for the course with the PS3 games I've bought. Thank goodness I bought the PS3 for the blu-ray as well because the gaming is not what I expected by any means."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont buy this game","review":"What a waste of money.

Traditional Madden users had grown accustomed to a certain type of gameplay and this version is definitely much different. It is shockingly similiar to the Xbox 360 version. So, if you own the PS2 version os Madden 07, my suggestion would be to wait until the next year's release of Madden because this one was definitely a rush job and not worth your money.

The core of the game is good, because it's the old one. However, the new interface is awkward, the trade routes don't work as well anymore (Especially in Multiplayer), and crashing is always right around the corner.Yet again, this is an excellent example of a product not tested enough before it hit the shelves. However, what makes this case of lackluster testing really offensive is that there was a base game built approximately 6 years ago. The game did not change that much, so how can you take a working old game, totally screw it up and then release it as a working product? Save your money, or better yet, build an old DOS system and find the old game, and play that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coulda, woulda, shoulda.","review":"Here's another game that has a wonderful story line and great potential, but doesn't live up to it's promise.

Want to know how to do something -- then try trial and error (and hope you can remember), 'cause that's all there is. Finally, bugs. Lot's of 'em. And commands that don't work. And commands that, I think, should be there, but aren't. There is a patch, but you can't tell if it has been applied (no version number appears at start-up). And on my machine at least, the game was worse after I ran the patch. All this is a shame, because this COULD have been a outstanding game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste the money","review":"The premise for the game is as good as it is familiar.

There is no overarching thesis, no trendy sociological analysis. In this book, Dr. Gates is more concerned with how diverse the day to day experiences are in the African-American community and what can be learned from individuals' personal stories, struggles and thoughts. He removes himself from the limelight and allows those he interviews to have center stage. This book is very human and very real. In an academic culture that likes broad, over-generalized theories, this book is a challenge to bring our thoughts back to the individuals who really struggle with societal problems and what life looks like outside the academic bubble.

Start with\\"Cordelia's Honor\\" and then read all the Miles books. My husband just did (after my burst of laughter during the news one nite) and now I have him hooked on the Honor Harrington series."},{"rating":"2","title":"'A Comedy of Biology and Manners' indeed!","review":"The allusions to previous episodes in the life of Miles make the story richer (as in when the Vicerene drags out a certain old couch), but it has all the hallmarks of a classic, self contained \\"Miles\\" story. All of the old gut-wrenching changes in altitude and attitude - and a deft handling of character and life that I am just now (after 10 books and mumble-many years) beginning to appreciate.Miles finds his road to maturity rocky. . . dosen't everyone? But with an assured happy ending, it *still* took me by surprise at the way it all worked out with logic, self-consistency, and characters that ring true. If you don't know what you're missing, think back to the last novel that made your heart ache for the fictional characters as much as it does for real ones in your own life. I cannot stress this enough - READ THESE BOOKS."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best in the series","review":"As usual, the critical voices are few and far between. And their criticisms lack substance. One negative reviewer obviously did not even read this book, basing her review entirely on the cover and her own antipathy towards short men and popular culture.In this volume, Bujold treads new ground with Miles. This book is about relationships, not space battles. Again, widget-lovers should go elsewhere. Based on the negative review that I read I hazard that pretentious blowhards should stay away as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funniest SF Novel I've Ever Read","review":"I've been an avid reader for 50+ years, and in all that time I can remember laughing out loud only 3 or 4 times while reading a book. The dinner party scene in Vorkosigan House had me in stitches, and earned me some strange looks from my wife. Along with other reviewers, however, I would caution you that for maximum enjoyment of this book you should really work your way through the entire series. Afer reading Komarr I anxiously awaited this sequel - I wasn't disappointed, and I eagerly look forward to her next installment. Lois is an outstanding writer, and over the years it has been a joy to watch her growth. Her handling of dialog and character, while very good in her early works have steadily improved with every book published."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book to date by SF's best series writer","review":"A joy. Easily the most finely plotted book she's written, and also the funniest: bringing characters from the dozen-odd previous books in the series together to deeply satisfying effect. Bujold fans will have seen this one coming a long way off - the book where Miles finally sorts his love life out, yes! - and will have high expectations. Bujold exceeds them. Love, politics, high drama... and, of course, butter bugs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only one complaint!!","review":"Well, I love the book, read it four or five times already butI've only got one complaint....too many typos that just jar me forsome reason. Little things, but still jarring to my trained eye. I suppose that's the price you pay for getting a first edition, let's hope they fix them in the later printings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly, the title is accurate","review":"Simply puts, its a comedy not a Miles adventure. Miles is there with his usual flair, and most of what he does aproximates the quality of the previous books. But everything that goes on around Miles, and there is a lot of it, is a bad joke. Whenever I would get interested in Miles' amorous complications, some off the wall plot would jump up, like butter bugs or sex change operations. I hope Bujold doesn't write any more Miles Vorkosigan comedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT buy this if you want action, kidnapping, or battles.","review":"The book is a collection of love stories about Miles, Gregor, and the Koudelka sisters. The typical action sequences in other Bujold books do not start here until page 338 in the 405 page hardcover edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aptly chosen title","review":"Picks up steam after a somewhat slow start, then you can't stop. I was a bit concerned about the \\"romance\\" bit, but this is no sappy tearjerker. (Miles Vorkisogan and Ekaterin Vorsoisson have their feet too close to the ground for that.) Perhaps the most humorous of the series: the scene where Viceroy and -reine Vorkosigan return to the mansion to find [no, I won't give this away] is pure slapstick, as is a scene where Ivan meets a former (voluptuous female) lover who returns after a gender change operation. And there are enough other sub-plots to keep you entertained. If you own part or all of Bujold's books, you'll certainly want to buy this one. For a first read, I would rather recommend \\"Cordelia's honor\\" (a joint reissue of the first two books) or the awesome \\"Mirror Dance\\". Yet I can't bring myself to give out less than five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent story!","review":"I really enjoyed A Civil Campaign! A funny, moving story. I thought the beginning was a little slow -- in fact, when I read the preview chapters, I was prepared for a disappointing read. (A personal peeve of mine is people who write reviews when they haven't read the whole book!) But when I read the whole book, it all came together into a great story. Amazon provided great service in getting me this book before it was available in any of my local bookstores. One of her best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"A Comedy Tonight\\"","review":"The frothy (and sometimes laugh-out-loud funny) \\"A Civil Campaign\\" is the next to last (so far) in the saga of Miles Vorkosigan. If \\"Komarr,\\" the previous novel in the series, was the darkest, \\"A Civil Campaign\\" is the lightest. The author bills it as \\"A Comedy of Biology and Manners,\\" and that's precisely what it is. Call it a \\"space operetta,\\" if you like.Ms. Bujold centers this take around Miles's pursuit of the hand of Ekaterin, widowed at the end of \\"Komarr,\\" which really should be read before you tackle this one. And there are subplots inivolving Miles's clone brother Mark, designer goody-producing insects, and much intrigue concerning the various members of the Council of Counts, among them Count Dono, who--err, no. Best not to spoil the fun. Suffice it to say that all ends well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, this book prooves you can have your cake and eat it too","review":"Some readers might have noticed, as I have, that this and the previous book (Komar) are less about Military SF action. I for one applaud the maturing of the characters - not in the least because this year Miles and I are the same age..... I really enjoyed the wit and approach in this book and am really looking forward to maybe a few spinoffs (Please!) focussing on secondary charaters - Ivan's new social conscience has me very curious! I must say though that chapter nine was that most difficult for me to get through - I started to cramp from laughing so hard! Also, thank you to Baen Books for making the first ten chapters available in draft form, I look forward to similar appetizers with future volumes. I recommend any of Ms Bujold's SF and Fantasy, whithout qualification."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marriage and Butter Bugs, Oh My!","review":"Miles has his lady on Barrayar at last, but it requires a covert agent to court her -- it's a good thing Miles had thirteen years in covert ops (or is that oops?).

Read it and find out. You won't be disappointed. My word on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"First bad book in the series","review":"I really liked this series until this book. This book should be titled Sex changes and Miles acts emotionally like a women\\". In all fairness, this is a common issue I have with most female authors, but usually there is enough action & adventure that it does not bother me much. I would guess that many women feel the same way about how male authors portray females in their books. Hope the next book in this series is better or it will be the last one for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Miles we love you anyway","review":"Despite the cataclismic changes in his life over the past few years, Miles is still, well, Miles. Miles as a politician is the best thing to ever happen to Barrayar. It's heartbreaking to watch the boy work to gain the affection of a woman he loves for the first time in his life. All this talk of weddings makes me think of guest lists... (Uh, Taura, Elli, Elena, Baz-can he even come back to barrayar?, Tung) Taura at least, seems to have a surefire chance of showing up somehow. Ekaterin is exactly what Miles needs. A keeper. This is by far the best Vorkosigan book I've read, but I think the drain incident could have used a little more illustration, but oh well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read that ties up many loose ends","review":"Like many people, I have read all 9 Vorkosigan books, and was waiting for this one. And like many others, I hope no newcomer reads this one first. If you don't know the Vorkosigan's already, this is not the place to start.This book shows Miles at his most mature and immature both/ While it is not as action packed as the others, it does show a lot of \\"mind action\\" - a comedy of manners and biology truly. We finally get to see everyone grow up, and get on with their lives. I can't wait to see what's next!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A FABULOUS READ","review":"This was the first book that i read in the Miles Vorkosigan series. I know, I should have started with the first. However, it doesn't matter. It's a fabulous book. You could read it all by itself without the other prequels. But... I didn't do that. AS soon as I read this one, I went out and got Cordelia's Honor, The Warrior's Apprentice, and Vorkosigan's game. And read them. Is there more Miles to come? I hope so, and it is totally greedy of me, but I hope for a VERY long time.A Civil Campaign is hilarious, I especially loved everything about the butter bugs. All the characters and their interactions are wonderful. The political scene is a romp. And Ivan's ex-lover's sex change and his reaction to it are...let me just say humorous would be an understatement. I am happy to say everything is carried off with a flourish and the story has an happy ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Space Opera at it's very Best!","review":"This book was absoultely great! I've already read it twice, within less then a week. For those of you who have never read anything from Bujold, you are missing out on one the BEST SF writers in the world. She creates characters that you just love to read about, storylines that keep you guessing and always craving for more and more. This book is very good as a stand alone book, but I would recommend reading her other stories in her universe. Perhaps starting with Cordelia's Honor. You can also check out some of her sample chapters (of this book and some earlier works) at her publisher's web page (which I'm not sure I'm allowed to say, but will anyway), Baen.com."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing book.

Instead of the edge-of-your-seat excitement of Komarr or the introspection of Memory, A Civil Campaign starts out sounding like a Gilbert and Sullivan farce. Much to my surprise (and delight), however, once LMB finished making my sides hurt from laughing, she settled down into a delightful adventure and a lovely satire. Who would have thought the Countess still had that old couch sitting around...Readers will appreciate the touches LMB has added to the characters of Gregor and Nikki; they both start actually doing things, instead of being mere reasons for others to act. Mark's role is a bit disappointing, though, and lacking in depth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Cd with a great sound","review":"I first heard his cover of \\"House of the Rising Sun\\" on a blues station and loved it!

They cover all of the sub-genres of Rock, and Metal, and even some of the Emo-style poopy (not a fan, can ya tell?). They do have some cheesy articles, like how to dress like so-and-so, but I do like the page that showcases a musician and shows a few tattoos and talks about them. Vinny Paul (pantera, damageplan, etc..) and Cristina Scabbia (Lacuna Coil) both have thier \\"advice\\" columns. I have been turned on to new bands through Revolver, since 90% of what I like is not regular radio airplay (oh how I want sirius).

This series is by far the best bang for your buck as they aren't as expensive as the baby einstein and in my opinion they are just as good if not better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review was needed.","review":"+1 star for being made out of solid stock metal.+1 star for grinding decent amount of pepper.-1 star for very small peppercorn space.-1 star for cheesy stamped tin holders- a sneeze will knock them over.-1 star for the money i spent and not being happy.there's better products out there..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks good, that's about it","review":"I just got these, the pepper one was defective so I am sending them back for a replacement only because I got 25 bucks off 125 deal on the kitchen and baths, otherwise I would have just taken a refund.

The previous deck didn't have any noise. Could be spark plugs or wires but suspect due to very cheap construction this unit is sensitive to noise on the 12vdc. Installed a large cap across the 12v and this helped a little, may have to get better noise filter.If you remove media the unit doesn't seem to remember which track was playing, so it starts over at the beginning of the usb drive or sd card - frustrating.The radio tuner is odd, it's like old fashioned manual tuning, works but seems almost like it would have been easier just to make it like every other deck on the market, unless it's supposed to be nostalgic.So yeah it works but not without several flaws, I'd not do it again - I'd put the $40 sum bucks toward a better unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"Total piece of garbage.

I think that she has one of the most amazing voices, and I loved her in the title song.As for everything else...Honestly, Colm Wilkinson cannot sing. His voice is just too weak for the role. Like one of the reviewers before me said, he's no Michael Crawford, not even Gerard Butler. Maybe I should hear him sing in Les Miserables to appreciate his voice.As for Byron Nease, he's okay, but I've easily heard better.In all, the album's okay, but there are many better recordings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Impressive...","review":"To be honest, I am not a huge fan of Colm Wilkinson. I don't think he uses very good technique with his singing. He was good in Les Mis, but he is definitely no Phantom. I felt as if he was doing some serious over actiing (I felt the same way with Byron Nease, who played Raoul). I felt as if Colm Wilkinson was chewing on every word and he wasn't singing through his phrases. And even though Gerard Butler isn't the best singer in the world, I seriously think he played a better Phantom than Colm.I thought Rebecca Caine was a great Christine. In fact I think she was the only good thing in the entire album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing compared to Crawford and Brightman.","review":"if you can stand Colm Wilkenson's voice, then you might enjoy this.

He doesn't understand what is happening with Erik."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Canadian Version of My Hit UK Musical!","review":"I'm Andrew Lloyd Webber.This Canadian version of my hit musical from the UK is now in Canada!This contains songs from the UK version,such as The Phantom of the Opera,All I Ask of Ya,Think of Me,and Music of the Night.But there's more!This version contains new songs,such as The Phantom's Lair,and Bravo Monsieur.Hopefully soon this hit musical from the UK will come to places such as North and South America,Africa,Europe,Belgium,Argentina,Austrailia,Chile,Spain,Cuba,Brazil,Italy,Germany and almost every other place on Earth!So, if you liked the UK version,then you'll wanna get the Canadian version!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but not good enough","review":"I expected more of this album. Wilkinson after all is one of the great Valjeans. On the good side, the music is update and thrillingly conducted. And Rebecca Caine makes a believable Christine whose fear of the Phantom is palpable. Her voice is stronger than Brightmans. But Wilkinson makes a Valjean pretending to be the Phantom. And his way of singing is wrong for the role. He also comes over as brutal and nasty, no wonder the girl was afraid. The sexual element that makes the Phantom so appealing and magnetic on the London cast is completely missing, and instead this is sadistic and cruel. I wouldn't have come to love the musical if this had been the original CD of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Butchered Phantom of the Opera","review":"Colm Wilkinson simply murdured \\"Phantom\\". That is what he did. His relatively nice tenor was completely destroyed, too, by his HIDEOUS overacting! Ridiculous!Rebecca Caine was a pretty-voiced Christine, although she didn't sound nearly young enough.Byron Neese was a fair Raoul, although not very sweet sounding.The orchestrations were good, the music was, well, Andrew Lloyd Webber, a masterpiece that speaks for itself. It would have been brilliant, if not for the awful leads. I strongly reccomend the Original Cast Recording before you go out and buy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as the original, but still worth the purchase.","review":"Although this soundtrack has its many good points, the original is much better. Michael Crawford is better suited as the Phantom than Colm Wilkinson is. I'm not trying to discourage anyone from buying the Canadian cast (I own it myself.) Like I said, it has its many good points. For example, Colm can really make the Phantom's rage shine through. This is best seen in \\"Insolent boy, this slave of fashion/Basking in your glory./Ignorant fool....\\" and Colm also gets me every time when he says \\"You will curse the day you did not do / All that the Phantom asked of you!!!\\" Another advantage of this recording is you get to hear more of the \\"Hannibal\\" scene. All in all, the original with Michael Crawford is better, but serious \\"Phantom\\" fans must own this one too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Phantom Recording Available!","review":"I can not see how anyone could ever call Wilkinson's Phantom wimpy... When compared to Crawford's emotionless, soft, and ALWAYS sweet voice, Colm comes in HIGH above him! Colm has the most powerful Phantom voice I have EVER heard, and he gets MUCH scarier than Crawford EVER has, when the role calls for it. The FINAL LAIR SCENE in this recording is the best available ANYWHERE. Caine's Christine is also the BEST I have EVER heard! She comes in HIGH above Brightman, with a voice that is less on vibratto and movement, and more on quality, tone, and pureness. Byron Nease as Raoul is comanding, but I do prefer Stever Barton over him... GREAT RECORDING!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It could have been much better.","review":"The lyrics are more up to date than the Original Cast Recording, and Rebecca is quite good. Unfortunately, they picked one of the lesser Phantoms. Colm was trained in rock music, he doesn't get the angelic feel to him that Michael Crawford has. His rendition of Music of the Night is too stacatto-like. I would buy the Original London Recording, or save your money and buy every Les Miserables CD that you can afford that Colm is on. Michael Crawford IS the Phantom- Colm Wilkinson is Jean Valjean."},{"rating":"1","title":"the london orginal cast is much better","review":"i like sarah and michael crawford more. they have a sweeter voice than caine and colm. Ms caine doesn't suit the role of christine. Her voice and skills are too old!!!which contradict christine's role as a young chorus girl. Sarah has done a much better job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Choice","review":"To be honest, ALW made a mistake by casting Colm as the Phantom. He shouldn't have done because whenever I listen this album, I keep thinking that this is the sequel to Les Miserables and that the spirit of Valjean came to posess the Phantom! It's a good thing that I didn't buy this album but personally Colm is my no. 1 Valjean!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Measure Up","review":"Simply put, Michael Crawford is a god. Good old Colm can't measure up. Without even knowing the lyrics or the musical itself, you could tell the pain the Phantom was going through just through Crawford's voice. Colm sings with no or forced emotion, while Crawford's voice flows majestically and soulfully over the notes and the words.Sara Brightman's pure soprano is angelic, as opposed to the other Christine's vibrating train wreck.That and the words were changed for this CD...I'm sorry...this is a disappointment. Buy the original, people!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth time or money, in simple terms, DON'T BUY IT!","review":"I just tried the sample clip of AOM, and that hurt my ears. I am in no way shape or form insulting Mr. Wilkinson, but he just can not sing the part of the Phantom, the way that Michael Crawford can. I am comparing Mr. Wilkinson with Michael Crawford because Michael was the one that they all must follow and try to do just as good. Michael was the one that Andrew chose for the role and that is way Michael is the best. Oh, did I mention, do not buy this recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"phantom","review":"a great cd.....any phanton fan would love it.

It includes some scenes not included in the OLC, but takes out a few since it is only a single CD. Colm Wilkinson plays the Phantom, and his sweeping notes are incredibly different from Michael Crawford's nasally tones. I like them both as the role, though. Rebbeca Caine is not as strong vocally as Sarah Brightman, but she isn't a pain to listen to, fortunately. (So much I can say about those stupid POTO studio recordings...) Most Phantom fans don't like the character of Raoul, but on this recording he is WAY too boring to listen to. I hope they come out with a Mexico City recording soon, since I have heard the actors are really good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good version","review":"Good version for this remarkable musical of all times.Much better is the original London cast but for a true fan, the Canadian version is something to have in a Phantom collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Valjean Yes, Phantom No!","review":"Though the musical arrangement is tighter than the OLC version, the vocals suffer terribly. The contrast is pretty jarring. Colm's voice is much too earthy and breathy. Michael Crawford's ethereal voice and flowing singing makes the Phantom sound much more like an \\"angel.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great... but okay.","review":"It's not a bad recording. Although, I find that there is alot of odd emphasis on certain words/phrases/etc. Some parts are too slow, others are too fast. Also, Colm Wilkinson is not a very good Phantom. Actually, he is often very difficult to listen to. However, he's rather good during The Music of the Night. Anyway, I would recommend instead The Original London Cast, or Das Phantom der Oper (original German recording)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs work","review":"I was given this CD as a gift.

It's hard to believe that women can suffer so much abuse, and men can continue to dish it out, and men don't have to face the consequences, and women's suffering isn't acknowledged. This is graphic stuff, and it sure isn't sex and violence for entertainment.Another striking element is how utterly reasonable the authors' presence is, as they painstakingly take us through these criminal offences.

I was worried about the world's thinnest sole on it but its really flexible and I don't see it falling apart anytime soon.

The window cuts off part of \\"Tare\\" on the left, and \\"G\\" / \\"Oz\\" on the right. The window is also smaller than the height of the digits and cuts off the top and bottom of the digits. You have to position your head at just the right angle to read the display, then when you put the (supplied) bowl on the scale, you find you are looking through the plastic bowl to read the scale. It is not as pictured. I've designed electronic equipment for 40 years, and this is amazingly bad.The curved window also reflects a lot of room light, and the display contrast is poor. You can read the scale, but I found it frustrating. I gave it away and bought an Ultraship for only $12 more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of garbage.","review":"The display is unreadable. It's almost impossible to tell if you're measuring grams or ounces. And when you're weighing pounds and ounces this scale only displays ounces. Not pounds and ounces. 1lb. 8oz. reads as 24oz.

The New Earth series, Millenium, Gemworld, Dark Matters, and now the latest the Mirror Universe duology Dark Passions. This book is filled with many of beloved characters, but with a charming dark twist. Politics is the game of the day and the characters shine with all the double dealing going on behind the scenes. Intendant Kira shines as much in the novel as she did when Nana Visitor brought her to life on Deep Space Nine. The story telling is tight, the characters believable, and my only complaint is that these two books should have been one novel, much like the SwordHunt duology should have been. Looking forward to book two!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Female Power!","review":"I loved it! We all adore Seven of Nine with her strong Borg identity but it is an even greater pleasure to read about her alternate character as an agent of the Cardassian Obsidian Order.

Susan Wright is the next in line to write a very good novel about this merciless realm. It will certainly appeal to all readers who go for a little more \\"adult\\" adventures of our well known Star Trek characters. I am sure Susan had great fun in writing this story about the Mirror Universe and its wicked women who go boldly were no man has gone before! A Best-Seller!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Star Trek with a twist","review":"Book 1 of two based on the Mirror Universe as established on Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, this book and it's companion title are a very entertaining read. Set before the crossover episodes on the series, it's the story of the struggle for power within the Alliance. The story opens with Obsidian Order operative Annika Hanson on assignment to assassinate Duras. Let the political intrige, corruption and betrayal begin!The story grabs you from the start and holds you enthralled. The characters are not just the ones you would expect to see in the Mirror Universe, such as Intendent Kira, Regent Worf and Sisko. Characters from TNG and VOY populate the story as well. Bottom line-fun for any trek fan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality tape, not seller's fault","review":"The quality of this VHS tape is so bad, it must be at least a 5th generation copy.

I've heard that her stories are comparable to Robin Schoen in eroticism and suspense. The sex was very plentiful and steamy. The characters of Diandra and Justin were well conceived and developed. The plot, altough a bit contrived, was suspenseful and kept my attention, but the ending was hurried. Ms. Devine spent over 270 pages developing the story to have the mystery unraveled in under 10 pages. Also, the fact that Justin and Diandra would find love in the mist of such contention and mistrust is unbelievable. Despite the quick and unsatisfying ending, I recommend the book. Ms. Devine's sexual imagery is outstanding and the story was capitivating. If your looking for a book that will leave you dreaming for some bridal cream this is it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was something different","review":"A great and intriguing read, and should be classified as \\"romance/suspense.\\" The characters are well drawn, the language clean and less florid than that of most Romance novels. I found the plot twisty and unusual and a surprise right to the end. To readers who like their stories sweet, I say, beware! This is not sweet in the least - Desire Me Only is hard edged, gritty, and very, very erotic. After reading it, I turned to Ms. Devine's earlier novels and was disappointed. Though her earlier novels are well written, the plots and characters are typical. In this story, the heroine is older, mature, and sure of herself - a refreshing change from the more insipid ingenues that populate many such novels. This is a break away book for the author in style and content. I encourage her to continue in this direction and eagerly await the next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the reviews said","review":"After reading the mixed reviews here I checked this one out of the library first, but ran out and bought my own as soon as I finished it. It was much better than I expected from comments from some reviewers. Yes, the two main characters cannot stand each other - which is what makes it so intriguing that they can't keep their hands off one another in private. I think their mutual dislike in public starts off as genuine but quickly becomes mostly a facade, as they don't want to admit that they misjudged one another. By the end, they are very romantic and that makes love scenes that had been merely erotic into ones that are more sensual and loving. Give this book a chance, you may be as pleasantly surprised as I was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitious Plot","review":"This was the first book by this author that I have read. I am not likely to read another. There were very erotic sex scenes, although the characters didn't really seem to connect emotionally. None of the characters seemed well developed and the story dragged and repeated itself a number of times.Perhaps books in this branch of the romance genre focus more on the erotic images rather than on a well written plot and interesting characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Desire Me Only by Thea Devine","review":"This is one of the best books I have read in a while. Thea is right up there with Susan Johnson, Virginia Henley, Bertrice Small and Brenda Joyce. I think her exploration into the supernatural was very good and convincing. My boyfriend even read it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone stop me from buying another Thea Devine book","review":"I really like erotic romance novels - but this one was a total waste. It's not even good junk reading. I found myself just flipping through it to get to the sex and that wasn't good either. The story was way wierd, strange, ridiculous whatever. Then the ending -- how could two people fall in love after all of that nonsense with the grey ghost, divining board, planchette, etc? I didn't like it at all. I would have to be hard pressed to buy another one of Devine's books. She won't be getting another cent from me until her stories improve."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's okay if you're looking for a little junk reading.","review":"This book was too predictable. One of the main characters, Justin, is a jerk. You instantly dislike him and the development of his character is immature. The only thing that saves this book is its suspense towards the end. I was disappointed until a little more than halfway through, in fact, I almost gave up on it. But if you want a little erotica, go for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Desire Me Only","review":"I am a fan of Thea Devine, however this book did not draw me into the story as many do.

But this movie is just straight up boring! There's no way to describe it really, the plot goes nowhere and centers on unfunny experiences. The grandpa character is a character, meaning he's just too unreal to make you believe he could be an actual real life grandpa. Don't let the trailer fool you."},{"rating":"1","title":"A rather thin tea.","review":"This movie does have moments of charm but mostly it can be annoying. The pacing and plot seem to be a nod to Ozu, while the quirkiness seems to be a nod to early Miike, I suspect. Regardless, the character development is poor at best, the continuity is non-existent at times and the acting only so-so. At least 45 minutes too long. Snappier pacing, tighter plot and fewer characters could have earned this another star, at least. Not knowing what to leave on the cutting room floor kills another movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"artsy with thin plot","review":"The blurb about this film leads you to believe it is a comedy. It records snippets of experiences by various members of a rural japanese family but has very sketchy plot development. it is artsy, so if you want to see an artsy japanese film with a beautiful country setting and not much story, then this is it. but this is not a traditional comedy, don't expect to laugh out loud. i just want to alert a prospective buyer on what to expect."},{"rating":"2","title":"My floor mat","review":"It looks great in my den.

The fundamentals of fitment and physics as concerns bicycling are discussed first. The methods of manufacture are covered, followed by in depth, step by step procedures. For me, this resulted in several good reads, and a completed bicycle frame"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic book ...","review":"This book is extremely clear, and always geared to the beginner. The author covers all aspects of frame design and construction, with very clear photos and step by step instructions.When I first read this book, I found myself getting more and more excited ... I've wanted to build bike frames for a long time, and this book makes it possible.About the only criticism I can think of is the discussion of fork rake in the design section. It's a little bit limited, and relies on a chart instead of giving the full equation for neutral or agressive stearing. I think that is because of the date the book was published ... more is understood about that subject now. (See the Paterek Framebuilder's Manual). Also, in the painting section, he recommends lacquer paint because it can be hand-rubbed and is forgiving of errors. That type of paint is no longer available.But all in all, I give it an enthusiastic 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helped me Pass","review":"Found this item to be a great product!

The only things I was aware then in the opening there was a diesel instead of a steam locomotive. The opening to all the 3rd and 4th season are very dusty and they used a film from 1957. The ending of each episode are correct to 1955-56. Each episode is sharp, though there are spots of irregular color saturation. The packaging is just as good as the previous 2 . The bonus clips, Special Effects and the COLOR ERA are very imformative.I can't wait for 5 and 6."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"There can be nothing better than Superman in color. As the other reviewers write, the third and fourth seasons did become a \\"kiddie\\" show. But just to see George Reeves fly in color and the better special effects is worth it.

OK, maybe some of these \\"adventures\\" of the Man of Steel are fairly silly, and by now even the most rabid fan must be annoyed by Lois, Perry and Jimmy's inability to recognize Clark Kent's real identity, but the flying sequences are even better this time around.

The carrot I then tried was more shredded than sliced. Forget tomatoes -- do not try tomatoes, period! Unless you want tomato juice and there are easier ways to get tomato juice. This mandoline will definitely slice potatoes and cucumbers although the slices tend to be uneven, but perhaps I wasn't applying even pressure.

I first tried to slice up some tomatoes and to my utter disappointment all I got was a smashed tomato. I tried running it down to the blade quickly and slowly in different motions with a couple tomatoes and got the same result. The fruit (yes a tomato is a fruit) stuck at the blades and smashed up between the inside wall of the holder and the blades and just turned into a mess. So I thought perhaps I needed something harder and tougher. I tried an onion and had only slightly better results. It took a lot of work, but the first part of the onion did chop; the backside however came out in shreds. Suffice it to say, I cleaned the mandoline off, put it back in the box, and shipped it right back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I purchased this mandoline from another merchant and have been unsatisfied with it. I've been searching for a replacement off and on ever since and finally looked at what Amazon has to offer. I saw the mandoline I already owned and read the reviews and have to agree with most of the other 1-star reviews. The blades seem dull and do not slice well. If I apply more pressure to force the food through the blade I often lose the thickness adjustment and the slices are too thick. I usually end up using my chef's knife and the mandoline stays in the drawer. I should probably put it in the yard sale box or donate it to Goodwill. All-in-all, not one of my better purchases."},{"rating":"1","title":"barely functional","review":"I was excited when I first got this as I assumed it would make the process of Julianning vegetables. I was wrong. It barely cuts anything harder than a zucchini (and I had serious problems with that), let alone things like carrots or onions. It has spent that last year or so collecting dust in a corner as I've find it significantly faster to just use a paring knife and slice my vegetables the old fashioned way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Opps - Slicer","review":"Cons: Because of poor quality, the price. Plastic casting burs left over from manufacturing make inserting the blades very difficult; along with sloppy tolerances cause the rubber feet to fall out often. Light weight, not enough mass in the pusher handle/knob, or the base unit. (it's all hollow plastic)Pros: Lots of cutting blades in a nice little translucent snap lid box. Unit folds up for storage.I'm very unhappy with this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works fine","review":"I use this piece about once a month for light to medium duty veggie slicing and have had it for about 12 months. I'm a chef and use much more expensive stainless steel mandolins at work. For my home, this has worked fine and I believe it will work for many years to come. It doesn't feel as stable as heavy models but slices and dices with the best of them. I rarely use the holder, just be really really careful. I have julienned my finger at work before!"},{"rating":"1","title":"useless","review":"this mandoline isn't sharp enough to cut much of anything. it makes mush out of most things (tomatoes, etc). don't waste your money on this one, spend the extra money to get something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awkward to use and hard to slice","review":"The mandoline looks nice witht the stainless steel, however, it's not usable. Unless you have large hands, the food holder is hard to grasp which made it unusable to me. The horizontal placing of the food blade made it difficult to cut anything hard like carrots. You would need to exert more pressure than using a knife. I tried to use it several times thinking maybe I am not using it right. After using it several times on different vegetables, I have concluded that it's easier to just use the knife. The only thing that it can cut better than a knife are paper thin slices of cucumber. Otherwise it would be safer and quicker to cut with a knife.It's a waste of money unless you want to cut something that has the firmness of a cucumber without being too firm or soft."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm Dancing in the Kitchen, too","review":"For anyone liking an Irish/Folk/Toe-tapping album, Kate can have you dancing and smiling.

He was wrong. It's taken HOURS to figure out that it's the game not our operating system, not our joystick, not our fault. MacSoft tech line people were very nice, but since there are 6,000 titles they help on, they couldn't get to the root of our problem which is we couldn't get the joystick configured to work (We also couldn't get all the keypad buttons to work.) It may be the video card - the box does say 16 mb hardware accelerator and the IMAC we own only has 8 mb, and there is NO WAY to update it. (I called Apple) So we'd have to buy a new computer. I think not. The simulator does look great. We wish we could play it. But we'll find something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frustration!","review":"I have been a Fly fan since the very beginning and FlyII promised so much that I pre-ordered in July and waited in keen expectation until early October. When I tried the simulator and saw the awful jerking and lack of control - the world fell in!This must be a brilliant simulator - an advance on Fly2k with great scenery and more planes, including 'copters. BUT and it's a big BUT for some - if you are using an iMac with a processor speed of less than 500 Mhz, you are in for a frustrating time. You have to have an accelerator with at least 16Mb and the built-in in the 400 iMacs is usually only 8MB. I know no way of getting 16Mb other than buying a new Mac. So caveat emptor!It says all this on the box, but I don't see it in the system requirements from the developers. And although I have e-mailed for help, no one has replied so far. Very, very sad indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ending an era in style","review":"The last of an unbroken line of great prog albums. PFM have recently resurrected themselves quite respectably on Ulysse, but fans of their classic 70s stuff may have missed this underrated gem, the last facet in the end-of-the-70s triptych that also included Chocolate Kings and Jetlag. Passpartu is more commercial, to be sure, but the emphasis is still very much on prog ideas, given the fluid musicianship and Lanzetti's gorgeous Gabrielesque vocals. The title track, \\"Svita la Vita,\\" and the opening and closing numbers wouldn't be out of place on Jetlag, and the production is immaculate. No epics or even ferocious jams -- no \\"Traveler\\" or \\"Chocolate Kings,\\" in other words -- but a brace of subtle yet never simple songs that continue their prog tradition while bettering the kind of pop that would come on later albums like Miss Baker. Give a listen to \\"Su Una Mosca E Sui Dolci\\" and you'll be convinced."},{"rating":"2","title":"A departure for PFM - - Very uplifting","review":"These songs are very catchy. \\"Svita la vita\\" bounces along with such grace and the vocal line is simply brilliant.

While there are plenty of errors to be annoyed by (everything from incorrect solutions to syntax errors in the mathematics), my main qualm with the book comes from the poorly motivated text. While the underlying structure is suitable, the overall exposition is crap. The text reads like lecture notes, and I don't think it is quite up to the standard of a textbook. The exercises also need some work; there should be more exercises that are more interesting. As a mathematics major I am not all too impressed with it, but a student of an applied science may like it more. Although in this form I don't think it is suitable for any audience.If you want to learn Vector Calculus, I would suggest the multivariable/vector analysis sections of Stewart's Calculus text.

This is one of many problems that Sony's latest expansion (and recent server mergers) brings - such as a breakdown in the broker system, class-breaking bugs, etc. On top of this, SOE has once again made sweeping changes to game mechanics, leaving one to wonder exactly what market SOE is trying to target and whether they even know that themselves.

I even put tape over the speaker and it's still kinda loud (this is coming from someone who is hearing impaired). I don't mind the noise but it does get a little old at times hehehe.. I didn't give it 5 stars because it is such a loud toy, even though it has a on/off switch for the volume. What fun is a toy without the noise for the kids?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hardy toy that is louder than expected","review":"My 2 y/o toddler son loves this toy and play with it often. The bulldozer plays music, makes a few sounds and says \\"Caterpillar Power\\" pretty loud. I will make sure to move this toy to son's room so that it is not in area where I will be with my newborn. Other than the noise, this is a fun toy for him to play with in/outside."},{"rating":"1","title":"From Lake Geneva to the Montreal station?","review":"Well, what should I say? I guess this record has just 'historical' value, because it contains the earliest versions of WEG the boys had done with Bobby O. The original mix is interesting, obviously, as well as the acid house mix. But the James Brown mix and Montreal mixes seems to me as total crap and just a few people would be able to listen this CD from start to end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pet Shop Boys - Montreal mixes - 7 total by XYZ Records","review":"A couple mixes (the Monreal ones) are okay. The cd was recorded VERY badly. The volume level of each song is dramatically different and needs to be adjusted for each song you listen to. There is also a distinct muted quality - songs sound muffled and lack any warmth, fullness or richness. Bobby O was involved in these mixes (He really knows what he's doing and is responcible for lots of great stuff)so I think that the majority of the problem is not the mixes themselves but with quality control of XYZ records. Re-released stuff like this by small companies with unknown audio recording equipment can be a crap shoot but its often the only way to obtain these mixes. Just getting a bad cd is very very unusual and since a cd is an exact copy I'd be leery of ordering. I did turn them into mp3s and was able to dramatically improve their sound and level out the volume. You could do this or save money - get a used copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep expectations low","review":"This is just a warning. This is not the actual original single for West End Girls and it is not even released by Pet Shop Boys record label. Although the mixes are decent for their time, their novelty soon wears thin. The sound quality is shotty, as other reviewers have noted. I consider myself to be a true fan of PSB and try to collect as much as I can get my hands on. But this release comes off as unauthentic and weak. A \\"MUST HAVE\\" for only those that are TRULY die-hard fans of PSB.Fyi: If you are a fan of the song itself, a very decent remix by SASHA was officially released as a B-side track on the single for \\"I wouldn't normally do this kind of thing.\\" This same mix is later included on the limited edition of POPART, the collected singles of the Pet Shop Boys that was released last year. This latter has a better sound quality simply because it was released over a decade later.I would sooner recommend these CD's than the one you are currently looking at."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock Hudson/Doris Day","review":"Always an unbeatable duo for light comedy.

It's unavoidable. Sadly, what Skeet Ulrich is to Johnny Depp, Blood On The Wall are to Sonic Youth.Too bad. They get off to a good start with \\"Stoner Jam,\\" which has a \\"grey fall day in the East Village\\" vibe. The problem is, nothing else really distinguishes itself.The majority of songs are just short, fast and loud. You can get away with that if you're The Ramones, and pack loads of hooks and melodies on top of all the #$@$-kicking guitars and drums. But there's nothing here to pull you in. It's just \\"hi, bye\\" and that's it.\\"Awesomer\\" is around the same length as a bad TV sitcom. And about as much fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hype + Misleading reviews= bad purchase.","review":"It's becoming quite bothersome to me when I purchase records that I hear so many good things about, but fail to deliver. I've heard nothing but good things about both the BOTW records so I purchased them. I can't convey how mediocre these albums are. It's straight-up hipster music made by hipsters...for hipsters. No depth to the songs what so ever. They're probably not junkies but they try very hard to sound like them and the music would probably sound good if I was shooting smack. But I'm not. It's one thing to rip off your elders and influences,thats fine. But at least write good songs if you're going to do that. The vocals, especially the male vocals, are so abarasive I find myself just changing the song it's so unbearable. There are a few decent songs, mostly the ones sung by the sister. I wish there were more honest reviews out there. This is not groundbreaking...its not even melodic or remotley interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, boring, boring","review":"I forced myself to read to page 250 and then skimmed the rest of the book to find out how it ended. This book just did not keep my interest. Every time I felt something would finally develop between Cal and Maddie something else would happen that would prevent it. After a while I realized I just didn't care if they got together or not. It seemed like the same boring lines were used over, and over and over again. The ending was so predictable, I was happy I skimmed the book because I think I would have thrown it across the room if I had read the whole book with the lame ending. I don't understand the rave reviews. The romance is hot and cold for the first 250 pages, and does not really firmly develop until almost the end. To me this whole book was just constant, constant, constant conflict within the family. That is not my idea of a good romance novel. This is my first and last Sherryl Woods book."},{"rating":"1","title":"sweet but boring and predictable","review":"cute and sweet but boring and predictable.

Sherryl Woods is one of those authors that make you smile and simply enjoy her books. Her Southern, small-town charm draw the reader into her story and have them pulling for the strong heroine and her family. This book was no exception. The story was something we hear of every day ??? divorce and mayhem in a family. But throughout the story line you know that those who do good will always come out on top.

Having lived in this valley back in the 1950's I am also confused about where he is taking us with all this rambling and location information. Why is there no map included.

In one instance, he refers to a Geiger counter measuring ultraviolet radiation!At the end of the book, he completely misrepresents a case where someone found an ordinary blown-glass skull as being one of the rare crystal skulls found in various places in the world, even though everyone who had seen it realized it was ordinary glass. He later had to issue an embarrassing retraction.This book would be zero stars if that was an option."},{"rating":"2","title":"Close Encounters: the movie or the valley?","review":"After reading this book and seeing the movie Close Encounters, again, I see several similarities between the two. The cattle mutilations and the black helicopters are only some of the bizarre and extremely interesting things that Mr. O'Brien points out. Is our government doing something unbelievable in Southern Colorado? Is it possible, with the proximity of some of America's most secretive mountain bases that we are being lead down some path of doom? There are still some questions I have regarding some facts in The Mysterious Valley, but other than that it's a good read. Personally, I'd love to see another book or an updated version of it.

The invoice in the package listed a hat! Guess they use different nouns in California. At least they were courteous when I called and sent a prepaid mailing label. When the item was returned they now say the hat is backordered. I haven't seen this kind of incompetence from a vendor in a while. Since I can't get the item locally, I'll have to wait a while or just cancel the whole thing.

That was a mistake; those first two days were mediocre. Fortunately I found a copy of Let's Go Israel while in Israel. This book saved my vacation. Not only was it an enjoyable read (particularly the history) Let's Go Israel offered countless great ideas for things to do.

A ready Australian chippiness pervades this anthropological work that seems to present Cook, Banks et al. as insensitive British blunderers impinging disastrously upon the noble savages they meet upon their voyages. An impressive knowledge of the cultures encountered on the voyages is offset by a surprising degree of ignorance about naval procedures coupled with jarring first person interventions and social speculation more appropriate to a Mills & Boon novelette. Throughout, judgements (of which there are many) are presented from the perspective of a 21st century anthropologist. Poor Cook he really should have more of a \\"New Labour\\" man - inclusiveness, social diversity, racial awareness should have been his watchwords. But then, endowed with such sensitivity, would he have ever have left Ushant on his port bow?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Reading this book more difficult than Cook's voyages","review":"If you can speed read Shakespeare (DeVere) or king's english then you may consider submitting yourself to the tedious, convoluted and tortuous language that was a torture to me.Had Samuel Clemmens authored the accumulated details or the products of the author's research the comprehension would have been easier, yet still wanting the omission of trivial and boring details."},{"rating":"1","title":"Captain Cook Oppresses The Noble Savage","review":"I was hoping for a detailed description of the voyages, such as life aboard ship, weather conditions, British maritime customs, etc. Instead, you get a shallow analysis of the sociological implications of culture clash between the brutal British and the angelic natives, with much political correctness and rank speculation thrown in.Howard Zinn's style of revisionist history is alive and well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Danger plot give-away: Cook bad, natives good","review":"Perhaps the title should have been a hint - Simply \\"Cook\\", no Captain.

This is the first book about the great Captain Cook, an unassuming hero and superachiever, that I have ever found just too boring to finish. The axe grinding is just too much. For heaven's sake, if you've never read anything about Captain Cook, don't make this the first.

If you are not familiar with the series, Dave Mirra BMX games have tight controls,huge levels and creative tasks to complete. BMX XXX is not as good as Dave Mirra, but mirrors alot of it's traits. The controls are not as tight but they are not shot. The graphics are about the same as is the size of the levels. The tasks you have to complete are actually better in this game because they add funny,crude funny but funny, tasks that you will want to complete just to see the reactions of the characters in the game.

They do not have sulphured preservative.Since Mangos are sweet already, why do they even bother. The following is my theory. I think this importer gets the mangos un-ripened since they are shipped so far. They then load them up with sugar to disguise this. The result is dried mango which is nearly white in color and has very little mango taste to it. It basically tastes like you're eating a chewy piece of crystalized sugar.Not what I was looking for. Oh, and Amazon does not allow returns on this product.

The headphones are fine and so is the car adapter and the Screen wiper thing. The case is bulky and the play-thru holder for the DS doesnt fit it quite right making it difficult to push the buttons while the system is in the case.The only parts of the set that fully worked as advertised were the headphones, the car adapter, the screen cleaner (just a cloth attached to a bag), and (sort of) the case.If those are worth the price to you, then go for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great deal","review":"I accidentally bought this for my 10-year-old son who wanted headphones for his Nintendo DS Lite but I can't complain.The car charger for the Nintendo DS doesn't fit the DS Lite but the headphones alone are worth it.

His bones are discovered in the present with a noose next to the body, and Louis Kincaid feels a special bond between the boy and himself, since they are both black. Many years ago many blacks in Mississippi were treated as slaves and being hung. Louis really wants to discover who hung and killed this innocent young man. Unfortunately, everyone in the town doesn't want to talk to him. Secrets are everywhere around there. A few more people die along the way. The conclusion wasn't very good also.

The plot is scattershot and Superman spends his time making lame one-liners. There is a contrived sub-plot with Clark Kent being demoted and neither his boss or his wife will tell him about it. The soap opera BS of Lana Lang's pining for Clark and questioning of Lois Kent's commitment to her husband was pathetically weak. And there was the inexplicable fight sequence mixed in with that sub-plot that had nothing to do with anything. What was that all about? Zero stars for writing and 4 for art.

This is the only one I felt the need to unload, because I knew I would NEVER feel the urge to hear it again. Phillips was looking for some pop success, but like many prog-rock musicians in the early 80s, he figured that the way to pop from his lofty sphere was to dummy down, and ended up with something that's condescending to pop fans, off-putting to prog-rock fans, and boring to both. The songs just aren't very good. To hear Phillips at his best, look for \\"Wise After the Event\\", with \\"Sides\\" and \\"The Geese and the Ghost\\" as fallbacks if you can't find it.(1=poor 2=mediocre 3=pretty good 4=very good 5=phenomenal)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but all of about 17 minutes.

It is written in a fairly comprihensive style and centres upon the impacts that technology has had upon c20 music. A facinating read. Highly recommended for broad insights into the intentions of most electronic composers. I was rather happy to see a brief section on DJ Olive actually - this shows that Homles does not merely wish to stick to mentioning composers that the masses often only know by name. Splendid stuff.

Better results with Kale, however even that did not keep as long as when I used the traditional spinner and stored the produce in the spinner while refrigerated.

But unlike many classic vintage SF, this book just doesn't measure up today. The book contains a huge number of 'adventures', but around halfway in the book, after the 357th miraculous escape/victory I just didn't care any more. There was no tension or excitement.

Gilman's first and only detective novel spoofs the genre as it deconstructs the murder of a pernicious attorney who has been shot,stabbed,bludgeoned, strangled, and poisoned! The feisty husband-and-wife detective team that solves the murder presents a model of true partnership, while the unfolding details of the case offer poignant evidence of the injustice that poor and powerless women can suffer at the hands of a brutal man. Gilman weaves a case for women's freedom and empowerment into a mystery rich in twists and turns, colorful characters, red herrings, suspense, and wry humor.\\"There you have it, a lost classic from Charlotte Perkins Gilman.

Talk about loaded. Bertolucci's trademark brew of sex and politics is as full-on as ever, but the real subject of the movie is how do you get your chops back once you've lost your way as an artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Potent drama, indeed!","review":"Bernardo Bertolucci after having shaken the world with his Last Tango in Paris, presents us with a raw emotional and affective picture involves a weak son confronted with the highly successful nature mother, a renowned opera singer, happily married until a tragedy occurs. A heart attack ended the life of her husband. From the desolate state of solitude, both are enclosed within their emotional shells. But the son seeks refuge in drugs and not to lose it, has made a determination. But there is still a secret from the past to unravel.Bertolucci unleashes his feverish love of Opera Itaiana and complete this existential framework with some pieces magnificently assembled into this terrible and distressing dramatis personae.Jill Claybough (April 30, 1944 - November 5, 2010) was always one of my favorite actresses in her generation.

Let's face it they patterned themselves after the Allman Brothers. It was the 70's and people had a longer attention span back then. Lacking the commericial success that producers, studios, and record companies wanted, they too had to enter into the pop/country genre. Although, I like most of the songs on this one. Especially Virgina (which isn't one of their more notable songs). The title track and Fire On The Mountain are also good selections. Walkin' and Talkin' (A Texas swing-styled song)and Bob Away My Blues, Is a good honky-tonk selection. I don't care for Keeps Me From All Wrong. Bound and Determined sounds a lot like the Allman Brothers...I like this one. Can't You See (live) and It Takes Time (live) are very good songs. This CD shows that the MTB were destined for greatness!

Each story that I have read I have liked. The only series that I have read to go along with this book is King's Darktower Series so I do not think I have the right to be judgemental on the other authors but the Little Sisters of Eluria was a good story which explained the Gunslinger, Roland a bit further. Also, I did like Orson Card's The Grinning Man because of its quaint humor and how Alvin Maker deals with the problems he sees, if the rest of the books are like that, I would not mind reading them.

The best, however, is the one by Tad Williams. It is worth the price of the book by itself. Some dislike TW and claim he is boring, longwinded, and other complaints. Others enjoy his work because he is not afraid to deal with Big Issues such as religion, the meaning of life, etc. His characters are so true to life because, like all of us, they are motivated in ways that even they cannot see. In the end, when you finally see what was really going on, you will be as saddened as the hero.

Of the eleven short stories, only LeGuin's story truly deserves the subtitle with its beautiful language and sense of magic. Pratchett and Jordan shows solid handiwork; Pratchett giving insights in witchcraft, headology and the personality of Esmeralda Weatherwax and Jordan with a well-paced prequel to his Wheel of Time books.Of the rest, only Martin's story is decent. While it's well-written and original it is totally lacking any feeling of fantasy. The rest either lack fantasy feeling (Feist, McCaffrey, Silverberg), are cliched (King, McCaffrey), simply badly written (Feist) or manage to roll all the bad points of every other story into a big heap whose only virtue is showing everything that can be done wrong with epic fantasy (Goodkind).I never managed to finish the stories by Card or Williams."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its about time someone put together a book like this","review":"Finally someone put together a book with most of my favorite authors. Tor has really put out great fantasy authors which has kept me picking up books by new talent all the time. I'm never disappointed by any of them. Ones such as Wizard's First Rule. This book is great not just for fans of the authors within, but for people not yet familiar with them. It allows new readers to get a glimpse of what they have to offer.

I didn't love this author so further purchases will depend on price but I liked this enough to definately consider them.I really liked the fact that this is more of a real life romance than often found out there, but without the lovers falling into bed on the second date, then trying to figure out whether they love or hate each other. What I didn't love was that the author's reasons for keeping them from falling in love weren't very valid. In this day and age, having a dream and feeling guilty/unloveable (Mona) and having an imperfect family member/'difficult' job (Joe) don't hold up very well. They just came across as too \\"thought\\" about, not natural.It was a good book overall, I just wouldn't pay a lot for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching...","review":"This tale of a wounded author who wanders the globe to gather material for his books and keep from facing his family and it's broken past is a tender, heartwarming read. Though he sets out to be a handyman for a desperate young entreprenuer, Joe Michaels gets more than he bargained for from determined Mona and her dream of the Footstep of Heaven Bookstore and Coffeshop. Dealing with her own secrets and determined to succeed with her business, Mona's fierce independence and great need suck Joe right in to what quickly turns into a mystery with him as the first suspect. Watching Mona and Joe drop the walls of their hearts and learn to trust and forgive--and fall in love--is as scrumptious as one of Mona's strawberry muffins. Treat yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Love","review":"This was a really good book by Susan May Warren. I don't often read Christian Romance novels or romance novels for that matter, but I am glad I did. Mona the main character, sets out to accomplish her dream on the shores of Lake Superior in Deep Haven, Minnesota. She is a very independent character and reminded me a lot of myself. Mona's prayers are answered but she has a difficult time, like most people, of seeing the blessings right in front of her eyes. This book had a mystery to figure out. Why were things always turning against Mona? Who was behind it? I enjoyed this book very much and was delighted to see it was the first in a series. You should read this first book in the Deep Haven Series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational, Heartlifting, A True Gift","review":"This story hits every angle of what is real and what needs to feed the heart.

I read a little thing about the author and she did seem preeeeetty Christian, so I just hoped it wouldn't translate into her novel. It had scripture almost first thing and I overlooked it, still hoping it wouldn't be obviously Christian. I only made it in like 4 chapters before I quit reading it and deleted it off my Kindle. It gets so overbearingly Christian, it's aggravating. And it's not like I'm super against anything Christian, it was just too much. Instead of a quote here or there or something subtle like that, she would make the character go into a big long inner monologue about how God told them to go here and do this and that...just way too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"not into Hyper-Christian romance.","review":"Yawn.

I am not deeply religious but also am not at all opposed to reading books with a religious persuasion. However, this book focused on god to the point of annoyance. Even though I find the story somewhat interesting, about a third of the way through, the slow pace and constant mention of god was almost too much of a turnoff to continue. I will probably finish the book but not anytime soon.I absolutely commend the author for releasing the first book in this series for free and allowing readers the choice about whether to purchase the rest of the series or not. If you're looking for a romance specifically with a religious bent, this book may be for you. However, unless you're prepared for a book centered on faith, my recommendation is pass."},{"rating":"2","title":"happily ever after","review":"omgz so cute. dis story is so romantic. if only everyone could fall in love as easily.... love makes the world go round. but i totally loved dis book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ummmm..

The story was just a story, nothing spectacular... but I did WANT to finish it. I couldn't handle all the religious connotation throughout the book. Bible quote after bible quote. Who wants to read a love story and be reminded about God at the same time? I'll stick with an author that wants to write a true love story, not one that feels the need to share all of her religious values and beliefs with me. Maybe if she dumped the religion piece she might not need to offer the book for free to get new readers...."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little too cute!","review":"I picked up this book expecting great things but found the premise totally unbelievable and it bugged me right to the end.

It's like she tried to draw a lesson from everything instead of focusing on the main story line. When she started quoting long passages of scripture page after page after page, I just lost interest in the story. In the future if you want to hold my interest, give me the story and show me through the character's actions about their chosen path and how God helps them to arrive at their answers.

I have read Christian romanace before but it seemed like the author just threw in random bible quotes whenever it suited her where as other novels I have read were more subtle and were better about blending the relationship between man and God in the text. Overall, the flow of the book just did not go well for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable and rather far-fetched","review":"I actually think this novel would have made more sense had the characters *not* met in the silly parking lot scene. From the way about half the book was written it was though the author was trying to make it feel very suspenseful (references to \\"his secret\\" and having to leave soon) but that was just ridiculous as we already knew who he was. The \\"bad guy\\" was also overly done (rather than hints about his identity, there were pretty much neon arrows pointing to him so no surprise when he was revealed). And while both characters professed to be Christians, it didn't seem to be a genuine part of their lives, and the verses thrown randomly into the dialogue felt very artificial."},{"rating":"2","title":"Third Times a Charm","review":"Julia Kelly is running for her life with daughter Robin in tow. carson thinks he will never love again after the death of his wife.

Her trademark fast-paced action, intense love scenes & witty repartee are definitely missing--so much so that I wondered if LH even wrote this! Perhaps because of all the forewarnings, I found the much-dreaded \\"All That Glitters\\" & \\"Independent Wife\\" better than this one. Unfortunately, I had no such warnings about this book, so I really ended up very disappointed with it. (Hate's too strong an emotion to feel for this story bec.

Dione is a weak, bitter person who focuses on things that happened more than 12 years ago. Blake is self-centered and manipulative. Honestly, I didn't care if they got together. I liked Blake's sister and her husband better, but I wouldn't want to read a book about them either.Usually I have a hard time putting a Linda Howard book down, but I just wanted to finish this and get it over with.

Maybe I can use it as an arm sling in the event something happens to my freaking arm as well. Don't believe the hype people. If it sounds like a miracle. Its not! Every doctor would stock it!

The bad news is that neither Kaplan's or the Princeton Review's book comes with very many examples. It seems that 200 is a very small amount. Each lesson only comes with 20 examples which, while very well explained, are too few to actually master the concepts. There should at least be an option for doing more math.

I have been out of college for a while and bought this book just to refresh myself on mathematical concepts. I've always had a very strong grasp on mathematics and just needed to glance over some concepts. I found the book good at explaining many concepts, but the reason I felt compelled to write a review is because there are numerous critical errors in the book. For example, in laying out a basic rule for students to memorize, the book mistakenly writes that an Odd X Odd = Even. There are also several instances where the answer provided does not match the answer's explanation. But an even bigger mistake in the book is where the author provides an incorrect answer and explains why it is correct. It was the wrong answer!

The story centers on Seven's battle with Kira which makes her focus on discovering her true self. With the exception of Troi, Worf, and Torres, most other characters are only touched on. Kira is evil personified. Worf is only a puppet, not a true Klingon. Troi has a complex personality, but definitely not the caring Troi we know. Seven is also complex as the central character.Once you leave the \\"real\\" Star Trek Universe behind, the story is entertaining, but it is very dark.

I just hope this author doesn't take his/herself too seriously, 'cause the average reader's not likely to. The stories in Nocturnal Vacations left me feeling angry -- angry that I wasted the time sifting through them, hoping to find originality, but finding it to be as pale as the main character's skin.

The pace is too slow and the story drags on for about halfway through the book. There are some repetitions of some points and stuff. The other half was almost okay, and the ending isn't all that bad, but if you like fast paced stories and some good detective stuff and all that, this one's not for you. You could find better ways to spend your money. On the other hand, if you want to think deeply about human relations and friendship all that soul stuff, maybe you'd want to read this. There's some stuff in this that I find somewhat disturbing.

Put your 7 bucks towards the movie and save yourself a long, agonizing read, that is, unless you like those formula plots.

Yup, the two churches there really exist and there is a park along Lake Erie. The attitudes of the inhabitants of Lake City generally resemble those of the people of Bay, only more extreme. The Slavic angle in the book was also surprisingly true to life. The court room scenes were gripping. One complaint is that the book got really creepy and icky when it come to the crime in question and what Sam did to the girl. I also liked the way the relationship between Sam and Tony was shown. There are many paths in life and we are the sum of those choices as shown what each made of what life have given them."},{"rating":"1","title":"silent witness","review":"reading 500 pages of this book was a waste of time, just go to the last two chapters and get it over with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. Perfect is Mr. Boring","review":"I could only get through 150 pages of this insufferable main character.

He's a hard-working working-class guy who is brilliant, a star athlete (in TWO sports), gorgeous, and dating the prettiest, richest girl in school, who has saved her virginity just for him. He has a rough patch (to say the least) but we already know that he ends up as a famous lawyer with a gorgeous movie-star wife. Oh, for Pete's sake!What's more, Patterson likens Tony's persecution to that suffered by Jews (via his lawyer [!]) and blacks (via his football teammate [!]). It was all too much.

I must admit,I had a different villian picked out but by thesame token, was not surprised. In fact, I thoughtthe ending amounted to literary slight-of-hand...should have known better but was fooled anyway!I'd advise first time Patterson readers to startwith one of his earlier books (especially \\"Degreeof Guilt\\")but long time Patterson fans will want toread this mostly because I suspect it's not the lastwe'll see of Tony Lord (in addition to \\"PrivateScreening\\")"},{"rating":"2","title":"Patterson at his best!!!","review":"This was one great read!!I even had to buy it on tape for my husband who does his reading that way, since he spends so much time in the car.

However what bothers me about the book is the \\"suspension of disbelief\\" element...the book purports to be realistic - Patterson is a great writer...no doubt about it, but why would Lord return to his hometown after 28 years to defend this guy (who is now an assistant principal) who was actually pretty much a loser in high school...also: what was their relationship over the years? Do we know? And what's up with Sue? Why would she stay with the guy? Wasn't she upset with him? Fighting with him?

I hated filling it in the field.All that aside, these are GREAT stoves. They are hot burning and do the best job. Almost like having your home-stove with you. I recommend that you get the case to pack it in (which adds some weight), but make sure you pack it upright as much as possible.

Rocky, Angel, Dennis ... all of them consistently helped offer up a series that had few peers. Even today, almost 30 years on, Rockford Season 6 delivers DVD therapy for those of us who watched TV back then - it reminds us why we loved it. Watch some episodes of 80s glitz cop drama Miami Vice (if you dare) and (1974's) The Night Stalker (not remotely scary when you're a grown up and these days, even my kids laughed at it). Those shows seemed great at the time - but they've dated badly. Then watch Rockford and you'll discover that great television is timeless. I've bought all six series and I've enjoyed every set.

In total I only finished reading about half the stories; I ended up skipping the rest after a few pages.The main problem with the stories is that although they are (sometimes) fairly interesting, they all suffer from poor editing and below-average writing quality. The plots, although filled with interesting technological gadgets, are poorly executed and often have nothing to do with military conflict.For example, the story \\"Ranger\\" has a unique premise: a squad of US operatives are using non-lethal weapons to send a message to a third-world despot. However, I got about a third into it, was turned off by the amateurish writing style and skipped to the end.Honesttly, this book is a complete waste of time and money.

Well I found out that it was Barlowgirl and I was like... I love that song, but do I want to buy the whole album. I was very hesitant because it's an all girl band, young teenagers were liking it and I just felt like an odd man out. Well I bought it, and I enjoyed it alot.

The topics are well-ordered and have a logical progression, but almost all of the explanatory matter is missing. It is extremely difficult to get a conceptual understanding of fluid dynamics by looking at page after page of variable manipulation. In addition, the index is so incomplete as to be useless; most of the terms one would look up are not listed, or point only to the page where it was cursorily defined.That said, this book can be salvaged for a class by a professor who is skilled at conveying concepts (rather than just equations.) I also suspect this book would be useful as a reference for those who have already learned the fundamental material. However, I recommend that the novice look elsewhere for a satisfactory introduction to fluid mechanics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Concise and well-structured","review":"Denn's book manages to address the key fluid mechanics topics of relevance to chemical engineering, such as microscopic balances, lubrication approx., dimensional analysis, & creeping flow.

I continued to read the book with the hope that it would get better. It didn't! The story continues about Dinah's polygamous marriage to Joseph Smith then latter to Brigham Young. The story takes a very harsh view on Emma Smith, with her pushing Dinah down the stairs at one point which leads to Dinah's miscarriage of the prophet's son.

Therefore, minimizing these irritating factors can have a beneficial effect, but they will never make this disease 'go away'. How I wish they would! But you don't have to buy a book to know that overall health will improve psoriasis--it is an auto-immune disease, after all. In my experience, stress is the key culprit--and vitamins won't lower your stress level.

How Richards interprets Boyd's concepts to a business format is far and away more meaningful than anything I have ever read.

For the serious business types, generals, corporals, martial artists and the common person alike, Richards' crossing over of Boyd's concepts makes them much more attainable and usable in even mundane day to day life.

The answer is yes, sometimes and perhaps more often than you think.

All of Marc's most recent hits are on here. This is easily a $50 value. The non-Spanish speaking world is just finding out what the Latin world has known for a decade. Marc's voice is legendary, a man gifted with a fine vocal instrument and the prefect mix of interpretation and emotion that makes him stand out above the rest. The last singer to come out of New York with this level of talent would be Streisand. And this is no exaggeration. If you like great world-class singers, I guarantee you'll love it, even if you are a non-Latino like me. When 'Preciosa' came out, I realized in a second that it was an instant classic, and a wonderful gift to the people of Puerto Rico as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"NY/PR Music","review":"Excellent, quality latin music with a NY flavor. Some of the tracks can't be labeled as contemporary or classic(possibly standard). The CD reaches a peak with track # 14, Preciosa, which begins melodically with great lyrical content then, after about 3 minutes, explodes with emotion & power."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much Too Abbreviated","review":"We had been enjoying Beethoven's Wig, Volumes 1 & 2, and so when I saw Volume 3, I ordered it for my son. While volumes 1 & 2 were clever, funny, & some songs even educational, we found that volume 3 lacked in those regards. It seemed that many of the songs are less than a minute in length. Not enough time to really get a developed musical theme in your mind. We did only hear it once, so we may find more about it that we like in the future, but it didn't leave us wanting to hear it again like the first 2 volumes."},{"rating":"2","title":"We love it!","review":"Great for kids and moms also! I have a 4 yr old and 7 yr old and we have listened to this many times.I would not choose this exclusively to teach classical music and such - our kids first listened to a lot of classical music and opera before adding this for fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Live up to the Others","review":"This CD is only worth listening to if you've already grown tired of volumes 1,2, and 4.

They make great gifts and a wonderful way to introduce children (and their parents) to classical music."},{"rating":"1","title":"My least favorite Beethoven's wig CD","review":"I was not pleased with the selections on this CD. The tunes are obscure and the lyrics are uninteresting on several of the tracks. There are 3 or 4 pretty good tracks, I do not use the others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!!","review":"After LOVING the first CD and then being VERY disappointed with the second, I was convinced to buy this third CD by the reviews. DO NOT BE FOOLED!! This CD is terrible!! Many of these *songs* are only seconds long!! After listening, you and your child will have no more knowledge of the songs and the composer than you did before you started. That's what was so special about the first CD and what has been sorely lacking in its followers. I'm sending the fourth one back without even opening it. The first CD was an absolute miracle--after that--words fail to describe how bad they are."},{"rating":"2","title":"My least favorite","review":"We have all four Beethoven's Wig CDs and this one is my least favorite.

This book will help you learn 30 new rules to make you a better best friend.The mystery to this story is that 2 girls absolutely hate each other but later in the story they become friends.Now the question to you is why did they hate each othere and how did they become friends?I do not want to spoil the ending,so read the book if you want to know what happend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what the Coleman Road Trip Grill needed for the big tank","review":"I purchased this hose and adapter for myColeman Road Trip Pro Grill SS, so that I could hook it to 20-gallon propane tanks. I had read that the attachment could be tricky, so my mechanically adept husband did the work of putting it together. He said the only thing he found tricky about it was the thread reversal; instead of the usual \\"righty tighty, lefty loosie\\" (right to tighten, left to loosen), he found that it was right to loosen and left to tighten. Otherwise, it is perfect for using the 20-gallon propane tank with the Coleman Road Trip grill. (The grill is portable, so is set up to only take the small camping-type propane tanks. One will need this hose and adapter for larger propane tanks.) The materials are durable heavy-duty, including the hose, which is long enough, as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nicely made","review":"Does what it is supposed to do. Well packaged.

If anyone knows of a sturdier and higher quality replacement, please leave your comment to this post."},{"rating":"2","title":"Expensive","review":"The product works fine, but it is very expensive and doesn't come with the Coleman grill. I didn't realize the hose to the tank was not a \\"lefty-loosey\\" and ended up cranking it with a wrench too tight. When I realized what was going on, I already ruined the hose and had to replace it. I bought an aftermarket hose at a hardware store and it didn't work properly. There is an connection in the Coleman hose that allows the gas to flow properly. I know Coleman gets more money because they have a proprietary hose, but it is a shame they charge over $25 for something that costs $6 everywhere else. I will mark this new hose with a tag that says \\"NOT lefty-loosey\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess mine was defective. It didn't work.","review":"I guess mine was defective. It didn't work. I tried connecting then unconnecting. Tried a different lp cylinder. It just didn't work with the grill (Cuisinart cgg200).In fairness it does say on the box to use only with Coleman products however it doesn't say that in the description. I can't see how it would work exclusively with coleman products or how it didn't work at all seeing as how it seems like a relatively straight forward piece of hardware. Anywho, it went back to amazonland for a refund. I ran to the local hardware store and they had a hose that works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coleman Propane Hose and Adapter","review":"I recently purchased the Paul Jr. Special Edition Coleman Roadtrip Grill. Rather than use the small portable propane canisters that Coleman sells, I wanted to get a hose and adapter to attach to a 20 lb propane tank. Despite the description of the product saying that it's designed to fit Coleman Roadtrip Grills, it was not able to attach to mine! So if you have the Paul Jr., don't get this product! The vendor I bought it from, GearStuff, was great about the return. I emailed them to explain the problem. After getting a return authorization number, I sent it back and Amazon/GearStuff not only refunded the cost of the product but the shipping, too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It just doesn't work!","review":"I ordered the Coleman High-Pressure Propane Hose and Adapter for my new Coleman Gas grill. I then went to a local Lowe's and purchased a large full tank of gas (Rhino, a standard brand), as I was going to leave the grill on my deck and not take it anywhere. I asked my nephew to connect the gas, as he does LOTS of grilling at his home. There is no way the end that connects to the tank of gas fits the gas cannister. It will NOT attach, and therefore I had to send my nephew back to Lowe's to get the small cannisters of gas so we could continue with our cookout. I'm going to send this thing back. It says it attaches to all types of gas cannisters, so I have no clue as to why it would not hook onto the Rhino tank. I'm upset!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not fit!!!! Yes, it does!","review":"OMG!!!The end that goes to the 15/20lb tank has to be tightened COUNTER CLOCKWISE!!!Good thing I read that one guy's review about that.Yes, it fits great. Hope this helps someone frustrated like I was."},{"rating":"2","title":"easy to use","review":"It is very easy to connect a coleman road trip grill with is hose to my 20-lb tank. Work as a charm. The shipping was fairly fast. The only complain is now amazon started to charge tax in my state. That sucks. Otherwise, it is a good hose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Connects perfect to a grill and a 20lb propane tank","review":"Bought this for my portableWeber 386002 Q 100 Portable Propane Gas Grill; works perfectly with 20lb propane tanks.Works like a charm, but CAUTION: If you plan on disconnecting the 20lb tank with the hose, you may receive some propane blow off. THIS IS OK! It is just the build up within the 5 foot hose.HOW TO RESOLVE THIS ISSUE:Towards (or at) the end of cooking, close the propane nossel to off while keeping the grill turned on high. This will burn off all the leftover propane in the line. I usually turn it off within 3 minutes left of cooking as to not waste it; sometimes it'll continue burning, slower and slower, for 5 minutes after."},{"rating":"2","title":"pricey, but essential","review":"Want to use a tank larger than a pound? Then you need this!It's a quality part, and will pay for itself after the second 20# tank of propane!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Get this hose if you have low flame or low heat...","review":"Most newer propane tanks have a safety put in to reduce the outgoing gas flow if it senses the gas is flowing out too quickly. The result is a reduced gas flow to the grill. This hose is a high pressure hose which works with portable grills and 20 lb. tanks that should not initiate the safety. If you still have problems, the way to reset the safety is to disconect the hose from the tank with the tank turned off, then reconnect everything and turn on the valve very slowly so the gas will fill the line and build up enough pressure to keep the safety from turning on. Then once the line is filled with gas you can open it up more if needed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"I purchased this to go with my Coleman Roadtrip grill. I should have tried it before I went camping Memorial Day weekend. The needle valve in the end that connects to the regulator was so far down inside the fitting that the stem on the regulator would not push it in, thus having to resort back to expensive 1lb. throw aways for the weekend. Very dissapointing for a Coleman product. Amazon was fantastic with the return."},{"rating":"2","title":"connects 20# tanks to portable burners","review":"This hose connects to the burners (or in my case the Weber Performer charcoal grill).One end has the right kind of threads to take the place of a disposable propane tank, like you'd use for a camp stove.The other end has a Left-hand thread that goes into the 20# propane tanks you'd use for a gas grill. Watch out for the backwards threads. Works great so far.6 Feet is plenty long for what I'm doing.My only gripe is that the price for these is higher than I'd expect for a hose with no valves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every penny","review":"I bought this to use on a table-top grill that takes disposeable propane bottles.

Granted electronica comes in all shapes and sizes, and there is usually a genre to suit everyone...so I guess this is just one of those albums pack full of tracks that I don't like and others do.To be the devil's advocate though...this album lacks any artistic flare. No rhythm, very little tempo flux, and a complete abscence of harmonics and melody.

The movie opens with Brown (played by Daniel Day-Lewis) being honored at a cerebral palsy dinner, and then reverts to flashbacks as his life story unfolds. The film traces his life from childhood - his large family (caring mother, doltish father), kid friends, girls.He then meets a nurse (Fiona Shaw) who helps him greatly and with whom he falls in love. She marries another, however, and he hits the bottle. But at the dinner he meets Mary (Ruth McCabe) and they hit it off. The text of Brown's autobiography has been very well scripted - it contains just the right combination of sentimentality and realism. Never does the movie resort to self-pity, and Brown comes across as one determined, tough cookie. One of the bonus features is a biographical look at the real Christy Brown. Very inspirational and definitely worth a watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"The acting is amazing by Daniel Day Lewis, the setting is the Ireland I know and the story was realistic and inspiring.","review":"One can hardly believe that Daniel Day Lewis does not suffer from cerebral palsy when viewing this film. The crushing poverty of Ireland under which his mother had to raise her family, put up with her husband's drinking, care for a special needs child and retain her faith in his mental capacity when no one else could see it, makes a person feel realize what real grit is.

The kids were adorable as well. The author could have cut out a 1/4 of the book, though, but pulling out all the extra jargon of each character looking 'inside themself'. It seemed 50% of the dialogue was a character thinking and talking to themself. The story about Cole and his father seemed out of place and realizations hit him at weird times, like when he was in the tent and Kate was kidnapped. Is that a time to really take out your anger on your dad leaving you 20-some yrs ago? If you skim these dialogues, which I started doing, you will find the story interesting and leave you wanting to know more about this new family unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do I bother with these books?","review":"I don't quite know why I do this to myself. Maybe it is just the long commute. I knew within a few pages that this book was going to be one of those that you roll your eyes at the characters and even more at the author. There was very little intelligence in this book. The author practices one of my pet peves, which is to repeat information so many times (and each time it is repeated it sounds like she forgot she already told us this information) that you want to gag on the words. The author's manner of making the characters rationalize to themselves for a few pages at a time several times gets old the first time around. I have always hated when an author makes her characters contradict themselves and do stupid things for the sake of having a daring rescue, etc. I did actually read the whole book, and if this is any indication of Cheryl Anne Porters talent, I definitely will not be reading any more of her work.

Since 4 buck a gallon gas we are taking the kids in the smaller car more often than the minivan. It will not stay on the \\"hump\\" between the seats and you are asking for trouble to put it there full of liquid. However, the kids use it between them, on the actual seat and that works ok as long as they are reasonably careful. The cup holder parts are adjustable which helps to hold the cup upright, as long as they are not giant. Since the holder itself is not very heavy, a large tall drink tends to tip it over.

This book delves into the attitudes, actions, and twisted conscience of what appears to be a likely scenario playing out frequently in corporate America.Bob Kellegrew is a practicing attorney. That makes the story credible and informative from a legal and insider's view. I began to read the book as I read historical fiction, both as entertainment and as education. I learned much about executive suite reality by reading this work of fiction.I recommend the book to those who like a good whodunit and to those who are seeking a glimpse into the life of a top floor executive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lost sleep ...","review":"I really enjoyed reading No Good Deed Goes Unpunished. This story provided me with a new and absorbing look at corporate law and the types of issues that may face a corporate officer and General Counsel.

My daughter is now 19 months old and this blanket has become her lovie. She sleeps with it every day and night and sucks on it. It still looks great despite being washed at least once a week (sometimes several times a week)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A letdown","review":"Aviation enthusiasts will attest there is a massive hole in literature concerning the Iraq-Iran air war. This book does not help fill this gap. Whole sections are simply lifted from other works, for example, Paul Gillchrist's \\"Tomcat!\\" A supposed cornerstone of this volume is the chapter concerning the Iranian use of F-14 aircraft. Tom Cooper unashamedly plagerizes Gillchrist's volume for much of this chapter. He does not offer citations and whole sections are copied word for word. There are also very few citations in the other chapters, and aviation literature purists will recognize the published sources for much of what is written uncited."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye opening","review":"For my husband and I this book is a master piece.

It is much better than most of the later Simmons. He is upbeat but not silly and anoying.It does not do really difficult moves and steps because it is just exercise, so it makes me not feel so uncoordinated as wth the dance videos. You also do not need other equipment to do it. The pace moves VERY fast. I had been working out for 4 or 5 months when I got my copy. It definitely stepped up my exercise level a notch.

I spent a large amount of time trying to peel the mess from the stone. NO luck. I left with the bench marred and looking as tough someone intentionally vandelized it with orange wax.

I was under the impression that this was some new hi-tech material that is sticky but does not get dirty... It's just basically silly putty... Firmer, yes.... stronger, probably, easier to clean? Maybe... But it's basically just strong silly putty. Would you stick silly putty to a tree and expect it to come back off in any reasonable condition? No... Maybe I'm missing some magic here... I haven't actually stuck it to a tree yet, but I have stuck it to my wall and it already has lots of hair and stuff in it.In short, this is not the miracle gecko-foot material or whatever... it's just basically silly putty.

Don't get it, you'll save yourself $25. The viscoelastic material breaks out and comes out easily. In addition, it is NOT as flexible as shown on the ads. The grip is good on flat surfaces. No question about that. But as soon as there are some angles or rougher surfaces, I am always so scared it will drop to the ground with my camera that I actually no longer use it.

Then I tried to stick it to another doorway post. It fell off. Luckily, I never even got to attach my small camera to it...

I purchased this toy for my daughter on her birthday. Within 2 minutes of riding we had to change the fuse. Two minutes later the fuse blew again. Maybe this is why they include two spare fuses. I've read elsewhere it has to do with pushing the Vespa manually at the same time of activating the go/reverse handle. I don't know if this is true but either way it's frustrating and annoying. Also my daughter is 30+ pounds and 31+ inches and although she still fits, it's quite small. She really enjoyed the ride down the hallway. Too bad it didn't work past that.

The original playing time of this performance is about 150 minutes like that of Maximova and Vasiliev(VAI), but Kultur cut out about 40 minutes worth out of the film. The Bolshoi Ballet performed the whole of the work, and all of it was filmed without any part of it being cut out. Anyone who ever saw the whole of this very performance like on TV could see what I'm saying. I suspect why Kultur cut out 40 minutes is because they didn't want to make dual layered DVD(DVD-9) which can contain more than 120 minutes(up to 240 minutes). They just put in 108 minute performance in a single layered DVD(DVD-5) which can contain up to 120 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I ordered","review":"The item pictured is not the item I received.

I've greatly enjoyed Busiek's work on Astro City, and I feel he reaches an even higher level with this masterpiece. Immonen is the perfect illustrator for this work, deftly capturing the range of mood and expression as the story progresses.This is not your typical superhero book, so fair warning to readers seeking a run-of-the-mill Superman story. But if you are willing to try something different, in the hands of a writer artist team that deeply respect the Superman mythos, you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Superman story ever!!","review":"What can I say about this story that hasn't been said a million times before? I'm a fan more of Superman's neighbor in Gotham City, but I LOVE this book. It really captures the heart and soul of Clark Kent and his family and friends. You learn to care for this guy and his supporting cast. You learn to love him, and when the series ends, you feel like you've lost a best friend. Kurt Busiek and Stuart Immonen have created a masterpiece for the ages. It really made me think how Superman would act and what he would do if he were real. He wouldn't knock around supervillans (they wouldn't exist): he would be more of a world-wide savior. And, if you think about it, that's what Big Blue really is.I high recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comic Books Don't Get Anymore \\"Super\\" Than This","review":"Yes, it is an \\"Elseworlds\\"-type story set in an alternate universe (a non-superpowered \\"real world\\" like our own...). And yes, it doesn't star the \\"Man of Steel\\" that we're all familiar with, but another boy named Clark Kent. After reading the re-imagining of Superman's origin in Mark Waid's \\"Birthright,\\" I was expecting a similar \\"Superboy\\"-type story here. Not the case, though--what we have is simply the best Superman tale ever told. This is Superman's equivalent to \\"The Dark Knight Returns.\\" The artwork is amazing, and the story itself is at turns exciting, sad, and wonderful. One of the top ten comic books ever produced, in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sony Model KDL-46VE5 Reviews","review":"Last week, I purchased the Sony televsion model KDL-46EV5 and paid \\"big bucks\\" for it at a local Howard's appliances and big screen superstore. It was defective right out of the box. Two of the HDMI ports don't work. Sony Corp. helped me set up a service call with their repair technician and he identified a problem with the main board. He suggested replacing the board. Since this is a brand new unit purchased a couple of days ago, I asked for replacement of the TV. Howard's would not replace the television. Sony Corp. was not of any help. These people at Howards are unprofessional and would not honor their own policy of exchanging the defective unit within the first 30 days. I purchased a brand new TV and not a \\"Refurbished\\" TV and therefore I would not settle to repair a TV that I just purchased.I would not buy any Sony products and will never visit Howard's appliances chain stores in Southern California."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book over all types of wind instruments!","review":"This is one of the best books that I have ever seen written on this subject. It was this book that got me really hooked on the possibilities that exist within the woodwind section. I particularly enjoy some of the time spent on the more obscure members (e.g. sarrusophone). The only thing that one may say it lacks is a more comprehensive section on the saxophone which is grouped as an exotic form of the clarinet. All in all this is a great book and a must have for all musicians."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful \\"conversation starter\\" for moms and daughters","review":"I bought and read this book when it was first published. I used it to begin discussions with my two daughters about the importance of developing an inner life versus obsessing about one's appearance. It proved a very valuable tool in that regard. I just ran across the book again on my bookshelf. My daughters are in their early 20's now and their values are firmly in place. But they, and I, and the next generation of women, are continually hounded by a media which won't \\"give up\\" trying to convince us that we need improving. This beauty-obsessive attitude promotes self-criticism and self-doubt and inadequacy. Wake up, women of America. Take back your power. Stop believing the insidious lies that the media giants are using against us, just so that they can get us to spend our hard-earned money to line their pockets!"},{"rating":"2","title":"thoughtful meditations on the state of our perceptions","review":"I've had this book on my bookshelf for a couple of years, but I've never picked it up. I think I was put off by the title, which is really inadequate to the contents. But I finally did, and found it to be quite thoughtful and insightful.No book can be powerful enough to address the pains of body dysmorphic disorder and eating disorders (whether under- or overeating). That has to be done in real life, with the help of a caring professional. But if you are dealing with serious problems such as these, or with less disturbed but still painful obsessions and with constant self-criticism, this book is a good source of reminders for how to shift your attention toward the positive.The author's own journey is quite apparent throughout the book, at times directly through her words, but often less directly through her insight. It's an act of love to turn that journey into a gift for others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite Pocket Guide","review":"Our family just returned from our dream vacation in Oahu and this book has everything to do with it!

The writing is highly effective and reader-friendly. We followed the book's travel plan faithfully - from Waikiki beach sunset to Pearl Harbor; from North shore Polynesian HA cultural night to East shore Hanauma snorkeling; from Dole pineapple plantation to Bishop's Museum; from Volcano eruption Show to Diamond Head hike...

It purposefully has thought-provoking exercises throughout. This text was used in my English grammar class. It was lent to me so that I didn't have to buy it new (lots of expense on texts at the beginning of semesters)- but I couldn't find anyone willing to sell theirs(here)-they all wanted to keep their copy.

I question their morality because they do not subject their techniques to independent, outside investigation to measure their success rates. Attempts at performing this research have indicated extremely low to null success rates. Asking people to subject themselves to Cohen's or others' programs is an extremely, extremely harsh thing to do with no understanding of how successful it will be.

If I could've given it 0 out of 5 stars, I would have. This book did make me laugh, though, so I guess it had some value in that sense. The expectations Cohen is setting on homosexuals goes far beyond what anyone should have to endure and far beyond what God wants from anybody. I pity those who actually take this book to heart. God's Word can be interpreted in so many ways...who is to say Cohen's version of what he thinks is the truth is correct? It's just ridiculous to expect someone to change their *natural way of being*, the person who they truly are. If you want to read this book, please search out God's Word for yourself, and you will discover what He truly says about being homosexual.

For starters, The American Psychological Association removed homosexuality from the DSM in the 1970s. This means that real doctors (not Laura Schlessinger, who is NOT a psychiartrist, psychologist or medical doctor)determined that homosexuality is NOT a disease or medical condition.

This is the most degrading, insulting and humiliating book I've ever heard or read. The whole concept that homosexuality is the result of environment is completely absurd. And to have Dr. Laura, a woman hostile to the gay scene, is just adding to the hate this book projects. You could easily replace \\"gay\\" with \\"jew\\" or \\"black\\" and it would IMMEDIATELY be completely inflammatory. Not a recommended read. No one can change who you are but you. And, thank you....I'm happy with who and what I am and don't need someone telling me that I'm \\"damaged goods\\". This just adds to the prejudice.

The underlying assumtion that Gay and Lesbian people are sick or disordered to begin with is incorrect. Given that this book was researched on the basis of this false premise should lead any educated reader to question the authors motives. It is not simply a question of having a difference of opinion. Cohen is mis-informed about homosexulity. The book was written because the author cannot accept human nature, starting with his own. Perhaps he should return to school and study the contributions of the Gay and Lesbian community today and throughout history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is the truth for one person the truth for all people?","review":"I don't see how Cohen's therapy program should be taken as a model for lots of people?

There are so many more Christians than gays, that it would seem he is focusing on the wrong group.So many people have been decieved by propaganda into believing that Christianity is good and that it is a healthy lifestyle, when clearly it is not. When will Cohen apply his efforts into bringing people out of Christianity? It is not inborn--Christians can change and will if they are led to understand the moral wrongness of their choices and the psychological damage it inflicts on themselves and others.The thoughts and techniques in this book could be helpful to so many other people, but Cohen's inability to see the large picture prevents it from having the widespread impact that it could have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless--except as a propoganda piece","review":"For amusement I read \\"Dr.\\" Laura's book.

The book is very detailed and gives the reader a thorough and detailed overview of what can contribute to same sex attraction and what the stages one would work through for their healing.

I did not choose to be gay, and I do not care that I am gay, or if anyone cares that I am for that matter. Secondly, we do not need \\"cured\\" and we are sick of these \\"doctors\\" or \\"ex-gay;s\\" saying all that crap about how they were cured and saved. I am sick of haring it.

It appears that they feel threatened by the truth that ex-gays have been healed from the bondage of homosexuality. I encourage anyone who is living the lifestyle/behavior who may at one time or another questioned why? to read this book. Believe me if you do decide to make the initiative to start the healing process your friends in the gay community will not be supportive at least that was my experience.

The idea that one can and/or should change one's sexual orientation in order to be \\"normal\\" is dangerous, bizarre, and certainly a reckless position for anyone who calls themself a mental health professional to take.

I am happy to say, it was a purchase well made. Ladies of the Grand Tour is an interesting look into the minds and hearts of European Women living during a tulmultuous times. Mr. Dolan deftly weaves contrasting views on society (ex: Burke and Wollstonecraft sound off opposing opinions about my idol, Marie Antoinette) making for a well-balanced read.Though I have never been a huge fan of the unctuous Wollstonecraft, I found her quotes in this book illuminating and thought-provoking.Christopher Hibbert published a wonderful book titled THE GRAND TOUR which reads like an 18th Century Tour Book of several of the finest cities in Europe. As fantastic as that book is, it does not deliver the human drama, the emotions of the female travelers, that Dolan's masterpiece offers.Bravo!Leah Marie Brown,Author of Willing Captive"},{"rating":"2","title":"Question?","review":"I have read and fell in love with the characters from the first Deep Haven book and before I was to buy the second I was wondering if the characters from the first were somehow put into this book as well because of Mona's coffee shop/bookstore being in town?

Anne, the main character seems like an unstable, mean, racist and bitter person. She is not a likable character at all. The book alludes to an event that made her this way but, there weren't enough redeeming qualities in her to make me have sympathy. For the first half of the book she \\"loses it\\" every time Noah is around, I just kept thinking \\"What is wrong with her?!\\". It's frustrating reading about how attracted they are to each other when she is flying off the handle every time they come in contact. I couldn't believe the relationship.

Not only is it well written and strongly supported by other authors, it gets right to the point - our culture is destructive. His best line in the book I think was when he said (paraphased): how can we possibly love ourselves if we destroy our home. As sad and shocking as this book is, I suggest it to everyone! Our president and presidents to come, should be forced to read it, as well as other world leaders and corportion owners and boards.

It follows a format of linking one chain of thought (or sometimes just a link) to the next. This style allows me to see how Derrick Jensen thinks (which does occasionally become personal) and provides a more entertaining (many times laughable) read. Although the entire book is engaging, it's a bit lengthy and I would only rate a life/paradigm changing book five stars. Some parts of the book made me want to get up and go change the world, and other parts made me want to cry (which I think I eventually did) and most parts I read in upsetting disbelief (i.e. the Native American condition).

Hell being the world that surrounds us, but you will feel, and hopefully be a better person after reading this book. It is beyond relevant today more than ever, as our leaders everywhere become more corrupt and take advantage of us in everyway possible.You will never view the words \\"Hate\\" and \\"Power\\" the same way after reading this book, and unless you are shallow and think that Paris Hilton is great, or if you are a power hungry leader that preys on the everyday person, you will find this book startingly refreshing and totally, completely life changing."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST FISH SEASONING/RUB!","review":"I first discovered this seasoning back in 2006.

It actually works quite well and keeps me out. I think the key is to ensure that there is no background noise (difficult with kids around!).

Someone else wrote this and I too got trapped by it - the nutrition listing on this site is wrong. Do not buy this product based on the nutrition label. It is not a high protein, low carb bar as it only has 12 g of protein (not 19 as stated on this website) and it has 25 g of carbs (not 6 as stated on the website). And the as someone also wrote, has more sugar than the website says."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slightly better than before...","review":"Apparently these have changed slightly from the earlier South Beach Chocolate Meal-replacement bars. The chocolate is more melty/less waxy, and they taste very slightly salty (don't have an old box to compare sodium but that's how they taste). Overall, a small improvement in taste, but in the field of low-glycemic meal-replacement bars, these are still the best thing going."},{"rating":"2","title":"great meal replacement bar","review":"I know I'm not supposed to eat while I'm driving, but sometimes I have one of these to replace the meal I am going to miss.

Plus I am allergic to sunflower seeds/oil found in some bars but happily not in these!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading Product Information","review":"Before I ordered the protein bars I read the product description provided by Amazon. It was extremely misleading. It stated that the protein content was 19 grams; the calorie content was over 200. I ordered the product because of the large amount of protein and the fact that the calories were greater than 200. When I received the product the protein content was only 12 grams and the calories were less than 200. I had to mail the product back at my own expense for a misleading ingredient list that wasn't my fault. I am really annoyed and will not purchase such items again through Amazon since they do not monitor the product information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"Just check the nutrition facts on the side of the box (Chocolate Peanut Butter)The 9th ingredient is fractionated palm kernel oil.Just Google this and see how unhealthy this is.

The book was small enough to fit into my travel bag and had a great fold out map of Athens in the back that we used frequently on our outtings.

Does the editorial reviewer actually listen to Miss Andrews singing Christmas carols for GRIT?! He sounds like one of those folks who simply can't accept that vocal beauty and clarity are perfectly appropriate and preferrable in many musical genres--including musicals, which now seem to be full of people who can belt out a tune, but can't actually sing it with any sensitivity.

My daughter and I often play games alone but sometimes Dad joins so it seemed perfect. I wanted something a step down from Chess. Since you don't capture anyone either to move across the board or to win not much happens. Basically each person moves across the board risk free. Whoever gets all their pieces to the other side first wins. Perhaps this seems more challenging once 3-4 players are involved but still there is never a consequence for placing your piece in a vulnerable place.

IT WAS HORRIBLE!!!!!!! It would read like 96.3 as normal temp for my little one! When I bought a new Infrared one (much easier and faster for $40-WORTH IT!!!!)

In the evening it measured him 100.8, but he seemed even more hot than before so I ended up taking my temperature - 99.9 and took it one more time 99.3. Well I was not sick so that did not make sence. So I took my old mercury thermometer and it measured him at 104.3.

It'd be great if it actually worked. Instead, however, it consistently gives the EXACT SAME (incorrect) TEMP for multiple people, and we were waiting the two minutes between using. I thought it didn't seem correct for my daughter (98.9), so I tried it on myself, then my husband.

From the first use, following the directions carefully, I found that I always have a fever, as do all my family members, and so do my patients.

My wife has always sworn that it reads low. The reviews that highlight the variability in results are somewhat correct in our experience. I just took my temp, for example, and got 97.8, 97.3, 97.8, 97.2 in the span of less than a minute for the same spot on my forehead. Still, in the age of technology we are all probably over sensitive to accuracy. Does +/- one degree make that much of a difference? We also have an ear thermometer which is the same kind used by the doctor's office when we bring the kids in and we experience the same variability with that. We have had the most consistent results with oral electronic thermometers, which are more difficult and time consuming to use but seem to be more reliable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"Cute book!

After the first album you could see the potential in these guys but I didnt expect them to completely blow me away like they did with this album. Every single song on here is great, not a weak link. The opener \\"the same mistakes\\" starts off the album on a very strong foot and never lets down until the end of the 10 minute final track. The sheer violence in some of the song structures (music box for example) is remarkable, and the whole album shows a depth that is rarely found in music today as well as a lush sonic soundscape throughout the album. I cant reccomend this enough. 5 stars out of 5"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kick Up the Fire slowly douses","review":"Those expecting the familar guitar-barrages of their debut might be in for a letdown. 'Kick Up the Fire & Let the Flames Break Loose' seems to be a watered-down version of 'See This Through And Leave'. There's more of the Pink Floydian electronic-tweaks and less of the tornado-like guitar-attacks, steering away from the elements which made their debut appealling. I compare the drop-off, erm transition, to the Beta Band's debut/EP to 'Hot Shots 2' opting for a softer, minimalistic, electronic-based sound. The backing rhythm continues pump-out clockwork beats, interesting experimental twists, along with an overall cinematic vibe. But after 'See This Through And Leave' one expects more guitar flashes than silent gaps, which makes me appreciate their debut even more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the fire? Where are the flames? This fizzled.","review":"I saw the band life and was anxious to hear their album. I was very dissappointed. There are many unnecessarily long segments with keyboards pointlessly puttering along. The songs are occassionally catchy but that feeling is invariably squashed by awkward stops and starts. The performances lack any passion or grit. They intrigued live; I hope they go back to the studio drawing board."},{"rating":"1","title":"rated \\"5\\" for music, rated \\"-4\\" for packaging","review":"Although the partially colourised front photo -- showing mastermind Brian Wilson as Santa -- is a curiosity, this is simply another \\"special market\\" rip-off of the same material found in the ULTIMATE CHRISTMAS and/or CHRISTMAS WITH THE BEACH BOYS packages.

The film makes no clear case for any side, the hippies want to tear down the United States by bringing blood to the streets and the establishment wants to set these hippies free in the desert to be hunted down by members of the national guard and local police, but not before pointlessly lecturing the hippies as they are tied and gagged before the council.Watching this film made me wonder if Punishment Park was the inspiration for Stephen King's The Running Man."},{"rating":"2","title":"A History of Spain in One Week","review":"How many books have you picked up and finished in one week? (Okey, so I am a slow reader). My wife and I are planning a trip to Spain so I decided to bone up on my Spanish history. I hit upon this book and loved it. The book dispels a lot of the myths in Spanish history such as the Black Legend perpetrated by England.This is one of the better books on history I have read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The story of Spain: Dramatic History of Europe's most fascinating country","review":"This book is very informative, giving an insight into how Spain became the country we all know and love. From the Romans and the Moors to the Civil war and onwards to today it's a most interesting and detailed account of life on theIberian peninsula. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge anti-Catholic bias","review":"One of the most incredibly anti-Catholic books I have encountered. Anything related to religious history of Spain was mocked and ridiculed by the author. The Jesuits were bad. Way too many priests and nuns in the country and \\"not contributing economically\\" to Spain. Franco's huge cross memorial was an abomination. The author is clearly a \\"progressive\\" with an axe to grind with Catholicism as it permeated the book. Read the Cambridge Concise History of Spain instead. The tone is neutral and makes an attempt to discuss both sides of issues and explain complex event without knee-jerk anti-Catholic reactions, like Williams."},{"rating":"1","title":"move on to another choice","review":"The one and only review within this book claims that Williams' work is the \\"best introduction to Spain's history\\". I would stipulate that this is not the case. It is indeed difficult to transcribe a nation's history from the Romans to the present. However it has been done by other authors in a much more succinct manner than Williams. The author's writing is labored and the book does not deal with any of Spain's history in nearly enough detail. The books publishers (Spanish) also make me question William's easy treatment of the inquisition and conquest of the Americas. This book in my opinion will not make one interested in finding out more about Spanish history. Stay with a more established author, such as Carr and preferably choose a book from each major period of a nations history. Three thousand years cannot be done justice in 250 pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is Europe's most fascinating country!","review":"I picked this book up because I'm going to Spain for 10 days and I wanted background. What a page-turner. All those people hovering around the perifery of my historical knowlege are examined and put into perspective in the history of Spain: Cervantes, Goya, Velezquez, the Holy Grail, Sephardic Jews, Muslims, the Alhambra, Catherine of Aragon,the Altamira Cave, the Roman aqueducts, Napoleon and his brother Joseph (King of Spain, ever so briefly),the Basques,Hadrian again, and on and on. A scholarly synthesis of Spain's history wonderfully written immensely readable and hard to put down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go for Carr's \\"Spain: A History\\" Instead","review":"This book is a cursory view of Spain's history. It is very easy to read, but I was a little put off when I found a historical inaccuracy in the very first Chapter. Williams suggests that the ancient Iberians \\"probably\\" crossed from North Africa, when the most accurate and current research (analyzing the metallurgical, agricultural, and linguistic customs of the Iberians) points conclusively to the fact that the Iberians had immigrated from the EAST VIA THE DANUBE VALLEY IN EUROPE. I admire Williams' love of Spain, a country that I adore as well; regardless, historical anomalies get on my nerves. I recommend Raymond Carr's book, Spain: A History instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly fantasy DO NOT BOTHER","review":"This book is a shocking fabrication of the authors fantasy. Sweeping statements presented as fact. Enourmous errors of history. A very badly written paper, giving no explanation of the sources of information. Huge chunks of fabricated ideas and story, the authors opinion of circumstance is vastly personal and reveals what I can only discribe as an ignorant inward looking racist american, with no true grip on the affairs of spain! How did this book get published? \\"Golden Era Books\\" clearly is not a seat of academic acclaim. I am genuinely shocked. This book reads more like a tabloid newspaper scandal than a factual history of Spain.

I will definately do the shoping with this delar again."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap charger","review":"This is a low quality made charger, but will do the job. I have only used it a few times so far and no problem. It's difficult to insert it to the lighter as the springs that hold the contacts are rough-- typical type of cheap materials."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Fizz\\" is cool!","review":"Paul Toth's \\"Fizz\\" is a fast-paced, tightly-plotted tale from the perspectine of Ray Pulaski, the epitome of urban displacement. Toth's nimble prose walks a fine line between the comic and tragic as Ray wavers between reality and fantasy, and the situations in which Ray finds himself are inventive and compelling. The scene in which Ray inadvertently becomes the local gigolo is hilarious!\\"Fizz\\" will grab hold of you - you will want to read this book in one sitting."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fast, wild ride","review":"Although Paul Toth's novel \\"Fizz\\" is fairly short, it is jam-packed with quirky, well-drawn characters, and vivid and entertaining plot episodes. Toth wastes no words in \\"Fizz\\", and the reader can be propelled through the book's roller-coater plot in a single, entertaining sitting, although it is just as well savoured in small bites. \\"Fizz\\" is fun, thought-provoking, and provides a uniquely skewed take on the modern urban world."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Turn Off","review":"Don't let the editoral review or other reviews fool you. This book is not worth your time. The illustrations attempt to represent real people part of the time, but not always. Much of the genitalia is exaggerated, wrinkled, and very displeasing to the eye. The pictures are actually a huge turn off. My partner and I flipped through this book and found that most of the positions they suggest aren't that creative and the few news ones are only meant for acrobats, I'm sorry but not everyone's bodies can bend in the ways this book wants you to. Additionally, this book isn't very long, only 134 pages and quite a few of those are illustrations depicting artwork in ancient temples and paintings that do not include descriptions. Don't waste your money here, spend your $... on something else!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please save your money!!!!!!!!!!","review":"*******DON'T BUY THIS BOOK*******I bought this book thinking it would stimulate my thinking of new sextual positions. Instead what I got was a book filled with bad animated cartoon drawings. The first 35 pages had some artist drawings of sextual positions. But only 3 positions I would not have thought of myself. The rest of the book is mostly a history lesson of sextual positions."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very pleasing","review":"There are some interesting positions, but some are not for humans.

The opener \\"Eight Miles High\\" is vintage Hunter aided by a rumbling rhythm workout w/Reed & Cooper bass vet Prakish John (coolest bass-cat ever!). Jim Gordon provides some startling drum fills as well. Play it loud! Things get experimental w/a variety of styles sampled, and \\"Sail On Sailor\\" soars w/some angelic siren vocals featuring future Rough Trade singer Carol Pope.

The NPR music guy was talking about some noteworthy young artists/bands in the Pacific Northwest, and when he played The Gossip, my ears instantly perked up. In his description of their sound, he mostly talked about Ditto's pipes, and that's the way it should be. Sure, Brace's guitar work is catchy and Hannah's drumming is adept enough--but let's face it, punk ain't the most demanding genre when it comes to instrumentation. It's all about style, verve, attitude, and Beth's got all that plus a whole lot of soul. Her Arkansas roots come out in her sexy delivery that's equal parts blues and grrl punch. I would've liked to hear a few more upbeat songs on this disc--it gets a bit slow towards the end--but Ditto knocks every other singer in this genre flat on their ass, so I'll give 'er a break if she likes to break into soulful crooning every once in a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"The whole package","review":"Awesome sound out of just drums and a guitar; blows White Stripes away, in my humble opinion. Vocals are full and powerful. I have to keep reminding myself the band has only 3 members (no overdubs). Look forward to hearing more of their stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique","review":"This album is the equivalent of what you'd get if you took Janis Joplin & locked her in a recording studio w/ a punk rock guitarist and a dance studio drummer. Excellent. I'll save my 5th star for now because that only goes to albums that withstand the test of time, but definitely a great effort and an enjoyable result."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst product I have ever purchased","review":"I ordered 2 packages of these Gauze rolls to wrap my husband's injured leg and have never been more disappointed in a product. The rolls are thread bare and fell apart as I tried to wrap the gauze around his leg it folded up onto itself to make a thin rope or fell apart. The only good thing was that my husband and I got a good laugh at what a horribly made product this is. If you are thinking of purchasing this go to the clearance bin at Walmart and find some old, weak, cheap thread and wrap it around your injury, you'll get the same result."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Knife","review":"This is a great knife for the cost. The knife can be sharpened, and has a good grip on the handle. It slices with ease. The handle is really damn cute, it has little pictures of a pig, cow, and chicken. It's described to be a meat knife, but I use it for everything. It cuts fruits and vegetables really well. I highly recommend this knife to anyone who is on a budget and is try to get decent equipment for their kitchen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap","review":"I was expecting a lot more from this knife but this is one case of \\"you get what you pay for\\". I dont recommend this knife because the feel is cheap. Pay a little more and get a nice knife to chop or cut. I cook a lot so I need something that is comfortable for my hands and this is not it.Try the Rachel Ray Furi East/West Knife. More expensive but worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"No complaints","review":"This knife lived up to my expectations. Not a problem. So happy with it that I got the veggie knife too, although one could use this for everything. About the sharpness; has kept up well. You really shouldn't use this knife, or any you are interested in keeping sharp, on a glass cutting board which may have caused the problem described by another reviewer. And cutting through bones is best with a cleaver. But when used appropriately i have no doubt this knife will perform as well as it has been."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty and excellent in pink","review":"What a fun knife but so functional. This is my favorite knife for tomatoes. I can slice them paper thin or thick and chopping is a breeze. I would recomend this knife to everyone!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Psychics and surrealism","review":"Legal Drug is excellent. I read a bit of ch. 1 via scanlations, but it gets SO good. The mysteries build in a way that keeps my interest piqued and keeps me turning pages to satisfy my need to know more... more about the characters, their powers, their situations, etc.The story and characters have absolutely nothing to do with drugs... unless you count the fact that the two main characters work at a drugstore-- as in a Rite Aid/Revco/CVS type of convenience store/pharmacy.The main characters have all been drawn together because they have psychic abilities. The psychic pharmacist employs his two stock boys to use their talents to find obscure stuff as side-jobs for bonus pay. These jobs are strange and surreal, but oddly compelling.As far as shonen-ai or yaoi goes-- absolutely Nothing happens between the two main characters in vol. 1 but... let's just say the situation is ripe for it. ;] I'll definately be buying the rest of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as great as expected, but still worth it.","review":"If your thinking Legal Drug is packed with hot yaoi action, then your wrong. In fact, it seems to just tease you with hinted yaoi-references, and it might dissapoint some readers. However. If we look at the true quality of the manga, you'll find the usual CLAMP amazingness. (For lack of a better word.) The (mainly male) characters are definetely errr... drawn well. You know what I mean, chicks will enjoy it. The plot isn't too complicated, it mostly involves little missions within each volume. The missions are all quite strange and very interesting to follow... for example, flying fish. Back to the loose story... there is some *slight* suspense thrown in about the character's past- but I suppose you'd have to feel for the characters to be intrigued by the mystery...Overall, I think most will agree this manga is average for CLAMP, and overall a \\"Good\\" manga."},{"rating":"2","title":"Imported greatness","review":"Slade gained more popularity in the States with the song Run Runaway.

This is a must see, especially if you're a history buff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than the movie!","review":"This book provided the most basic story line for a made-for-TV movie, which I saw several times. I noticed the novel listed at the end of the credits, so I ordered it from Amazon. Am I glad I did! The book is not only so much better than the film, but one of the best 'disaster' novels I have ever read. The almost clinical presentation of the disaster facts interspersed with small character stories was an interesting writing technique. The bottom line is I found it so interesting that I read it in two days, staying up almost all night, the day it arrived. Also, found I slowed my usual reading speed to catch all the descriptions - re-reading some to imagine the experiences in the areas of London that I know well. I have already lent it to friends who are also disaster aficionados. I realize that I will probably have to buy a second - or third - copy for my library!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boredom Rules OK?","review":"Holy smokes..what sort of a guy can write a book like this?

Children can learn a great deal from the wonderfully nuanced characters and plot, and adults can enjoy an engaging and whimsical story that winds as much as the underground press tunnels featured in these pages.I'd say that this is easily among, if not the best, children's graphic novels ever created."},{"rating":"2","title":"Made me smile.","review":"Renier has uniquely created characters and a world that co-exsist with each other beautifully. With an imagination that spans close to the creative-geniuses of our time, Aaron has accomplished an amazing peice of art and literary bliss. The feeling you'l get from this book is warm and fuzzy. Spriral-Bound makes you wish you could still go on those amazing childhood adventures your heart still longs for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrist is uncomfortable while using this knife.","review":"I really wanted to like this knife. I read all of the reviews and I loved the design, but it's uncomfortable to use. My wrist felt sore after using it for less than a minute, cutting an apple into quarters. Yes, I know it's a fish knife, but cutting an apple shouldn't have put that much pressure on my wrist. I guess I can save it for cutting tofu or fish, or continue using it as an ornament. It's not an ideal \\"all purpose\\" knife."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent starter book for teaching English","review":"I have been using this book in multiple English classes for the last six months. Based on my experience, it is a competent beginner's text. I suggest the author update it and correct the typos.

It is very easy to master basic English vocabulary and grammar when it is presented in this interesting manner."},{"rating":"1","title":"the emperor is wearing no clothes!","review":"I've heard so much hype about the soulful sounds of this awesome group that I went and bought both of their albums. Imagine my surprise when I finally heard this. These guys are like a wedding band! Rachael has a decent voice, but Tina Turner she is NOT! It probably doesn't help that my record collection includes many of the songs they are covering here so I am abundantly aware of the fact that these versions don't stack up. If you want to hear REAL soul music check out the \\"Pow City\\", \\"The Get It\\" and \\"Downtown Soulsville\\" comps on Crypt. If hearing super soulful female singers is your bag check out \\"Men Are Like Street Cars\\" double CD on MCA - you'll get 46 tracks that make the Detroit Cobras sound like the white bar band they are."},{"rating":"1","title":"The only reason there is a star is because I had to answer question # 2 in order to write a review.

Early JAMAICAN music is totally killer and as an avid fan of SKA/ROCK STEADY and EARLY REGGAE, I can attest to the fact that anyone who dismisses the early stuff is a total SNOB and has no real love for JAMAICAN MUSIC. Even BOB MARLEY started out with SKA and I'm into that period more than the 70's POT-SMOKIN' drenched period.

It classifies the different types of roses that can be grown well, how to plant them, prune them, maintain them, select them and where to buy them. If non-hardy hybrid teas are your choice, it has excellent pictures giving the step-by-step method of tipping roses for winter protection. Roses hardy for the north are all listed - the old garden roses up to the newly hybridized Canadian hardy roses. Anyone wanting to grow roses in the north needs this excellent reference!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Growing Roses in Cold Climates","review":"Excellent book to have for any rose lover.

I've also purchased two tips for my iPod and two different iGo chargers... same story, all fail right after 6 months. The build quality is poor and it appears that these simply are not designed for continual use. I recommend choosing another product line. iGo is marketing cheap parts perhaps with the understanding that you're changing your electronic device often enough to warrant new tips and/or charging sets.

This is a thoroughly delightful volume (and teachable), full of fascinating facts and details, and very informal without for a moment ceasing to be informative. The first part exposes any number of myths, misunderstandings, and patent inaccuracies that characterize the realm of popular fiction (let us be honest, the books that you and I read). The second part, meant to illustrate the general theses advanced in part one, is actually an independent discussion of \\"nobrow\\" literature. By the way, even as I share the preceding reviewers' enthusiasm, I must profess especial liking for the discussion of the three \\"nobrow\\" masterpieces in part two, especially Raymond Chandler. Can somebody set up a website for discussion of \\"nobrow\\" literature?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A delightful read","review":"I bought this book before Christmas and enjoyed it thoroughly. It deals with the question of how pulp fiction is dismissed by the literary world as being unworthy of being called literature. Swirski argues very convincingly that some \\"lobrow\\" genre fiction is indeed worthy of a closer look, and uses several novels as examples to make his case. I really enjoyed reading his arguments as he built his case throughout the book, because they were so clear and each one built on the previous one.The writing is accessible and absorbing even though written by an academic, and would be great for both fans of fine genre fiction as well as for use in university courses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up-to-date!","review":"This book is from 2001 so it is definitely not up-to-date.

I purchased these seat covers for my 2006 hummer h3, the fasteners are flimsy and don't allow for a snug fit as advertised and shown in the picture. Essentially, because the elastic chords on the front of the seat cover aren't long enough, there's no way to fastened them to the center tab that slips btwn the backrest and seat cushion. Unless you can fasten the center tab to the front chords, there's no way to get the snug custom fit as shown in the picture. Even if I were to take my seats out of my car, I couldn't get the snug fit shown in the picture. Now I'll have to ship this item back at my cost, what a bummer.

Robert Beverly Hale was considered one of the past century's greatest instructors of drawing and artistic anatomy. This book shows why he is held in such high regard.

A master teacher discussing master drawings - it doesn't get any better than that!Remember, the old masters themselves used to copy master drawings when they were students learning how to draw. Follow their example. This book also has a wonderful section on artistic anatomy. Anatomy is very important, and can't be stressed enough.

I imagine that if I want to sit down for hours designing my own game, then this product would allow me to do that, but I was expecting to be able to do far more 'right out of the box' than I actually can do.Make sure you understand what you are getting before you buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy TRS2006 from Merscom","review":"The Merscom TRS2006 that Amazon is selling have a faulty serial number. Amazon should cancel the sales of this product. Without this you will not be able to install any pack addon. Merscom has a very slow and poor support. They gave me a replacement serial that was already being used by somebody else at Planet Auran.Instead buy the Auran version. However, even being old as it is, I prefer much more Microsoft Train Simulator, because of the addons available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy a ticket for this train (sim)","review":"I looked at the screenshots for this game and read some of the reviews at different sites about this title and decided to buy it. There we're alot of positive reviews, and the graphics looked pretty nice.This is where the title has shortcomings. The biggest gripe about the game is the graphic lag and sound quality. I have a decent machine which surpasses the req's and I get alot of lag. Worse yet, the sound is unbalanced, VERY LOUD at times, then gets quiet. At times the horn sound does not work.A good number of the routes are either a short tutorial or a demo/trial version. The routes that are full do not compare to the length and quality of the routes in Microsoft Train Sim.I liked the game for awhile, but I soon got annoyed with the lag and horrible sound issues. Not a good buy if you want to really see what running trains are like. Buy Microsoft Train Sim. Much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good book to determine the academic reputation of a school","review":"I think that this book is good for assessing the academic reputation of a school. It is highly correlated with the National Research Councils report on graduate schools. This is good because, for universities with graduate schools,and this includes all schools except liberal arts schools, their reputation is reflected in the quality of their Phd programs. Compared to the US News Report survey, it is a more accurate assessment of faculty quality. The US News survey includes reputation in its survey, but the method that they use is highly inaccurate(surveying deans of admission), so the reputation score is extremely biased and since it counts for 25 % of the score creates an unusable report. The only downside to the Gourman report is that it does not weigh student factors as heavily as it should."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst rankings ever released","review":"This book provides a bunch of tables without any disclosure of the system behind the rankings.

This book is a series of short erotic adventures all taking place at an apartment building populated exclusively by shemales (even the janitor is one). At the end all of the characters come together (not literally) for a game of bingo played in a way I've never seen before. Once that's done, the reader is treated to a gallery of assorted shemales.All the women(?) are attractive, and hardly a page goes by without some kind of sexual activity going on. My only complaint is that only a couple of them are well-hung."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sexy","review":"These ladies no how to have fun all day long...

The girls are all very pretty, but they all have male equipment. They are basically just guys who look like pretty girls-- they don't even have any female anatomy blow the waist.The artwork is poor-- either the artist was unskilled or he was lazy. It is also all in black and white. The comic consists of one scene after another of shemales with various-sized breasts and penises engaged in intimate naughtiness. There are LOTS of climax shots-- nearly every panel. In some of the panels, the \\"girls\\" are just standing around and squirting. Every page of this comic has a distinct \\"gooeyness.\\"I'd describe the plot, but really there isn't one.

Take my advice, don't read it. Not that it is inaccurate, (my knowledge of biblical prophecy is limited to the Left Behind Series) it just happens to be extremely boring. There is very little dialog between extremely undeveloped characters and the introduction of new characters continued through the 32nd chapter. (There are a total of 33 chapters in the book.) It reads more like a futuristic history book than captivating fiction.I read a lot of Christian Fiction and there are too many GREAT books out there to be reading books you wished you hadn't. Read the Left Behind Series instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"missed opportunity","review":"This is actually an excellent record, lying somewhere on a line between Iron Butterfly's Metamorphosis and Edgar Winter Group's We Only Come Out At Night. In other words it's an intelligent, varied, well-played, melodic example of 70's rock. But it sounds like it was remastered off a cassette tape. I have a fairly high end sound system and have really enjoyed the much improved upgrades many CDs have been receiving recently, but this sounds like it was done on the cheap by someone with no ear for music. I also have a CD of Poco's Cantamos, another '70s favourite, on the Wounded Bird label. It sounds terrible too, so I assume the label is at fault. Plus there are no liner notes and no extra tracks. My old, worn vinyl copies of both of these albums sound better than the CDs. If audio quality is a concern I suggest you avoid these CDs and look out for the vinyl."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ramasham Recording","review":"I e-mailed the label a couple years ago and asked them to release this LP on CD.

I seen them live in the 70's and they were good. This could have been something real big but the sound production is real bad.

I hope another label can do this LP better someday soon and I too have wondered what happen to April Lawton."},{"rating":"1","title":"an embarrasment","review":"I remember when this came out and as a guitar player myself, I was highly intrigued with the names involved on this project. My initial impression of April Lawton was to hang up my guitar and forget the whole thing (she is/was a damn good guitar player). Afterwords I realized that this album is quite an embarrasment.

Josemaria reaches to root of what troubles us spiritually, and challenges us to conform our life to God's plan for our life. He also teaches us that every little thing we do in our life -- work, sport, leisure -- can be done well for the greater glory of God, and offered as prayer.This presented an important spiritual awakening for me, since before reading this book I tended to compartmentalize my prayer life. What is also unique about this book is that the insights are broken down into short sentences. The longest insight is no more than two paragraphs. Thus this book can be carried around with ease, and meditated upon during a spare minute or two during the day.I don't know any Catholic who has read this book and not become more fervent in their faith."},{"rating":"1","title":"Y Cambalache?","review":"Entré a este web site buscando la grabación del tango Cambalache cantado por Edmundo Rivero, pero no he podido encontrarla por ningún lado.

Half of the fun is Cordola's obvious pleasure playing his guitars and the other half is the fantastic production quality. The wide range of musical styles (in the general soup of heavy metal) appeals to my eclectic taste. I don't listen to other heavy metal, it just annoys me, but Lanny's style I enjoy. Every note seems to have a purpose rather than just to be noisy.The short riffs are fun and mind opening to what a musical genius can do without synthesizers. The \\"Marriage of Figaro\\" cover is definitely the showpiece here."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book that will make you stop in your tracks.","review":"Rape of the wild by Andree Collard and Joyce Contrucci is a haunting book.

I couldn't believe that they actaully made this DVD in Las Vegas ... what is with that .. They rolling stones taled Vooodoo Lounge in Miami and Gloria Estefan her concert in Las Vegas .... gimme abreak ....The audience was great but certianly subdued and that of course reflected on the concert ...

So, I switched to these lighter scented ones and still got a migraine/sinus headache which lasts pretty much all day until I take lots of Sudafed and put ice on my face. However, the product is very easy to ease, cleans the floor perfectly and leaves no sticky residue. They are shiny and clean and do smell good. So, if you are not sensitive they are great.

I only caught a few episodes on HBO but I was riveted the whole time. I was sad when i couldn't see them anymore so when i saw the DVD in the store today I instantly bought it. I proceeded home and watched all 9 episodes. These aren't just stories you can watch once and never want to see again either. I plan on watching again tomorrow as well. I never wanted the stories to end. Alas you must make do with only the 9 episodes they ever made.John Hurt is absolutely riveting as the Storyteller. The stories are deeply moving and the sets are a rich playground for your mind too frolic in. You WILL NOT regret buying this DVD.

John Hurt is fantastic as the storyteller and his cute yet cynical dog provides a bit of comic relief to break the tension in the darkest parts. Yes, there are dark parts and some scary looking (and acting) \\"fantasy\\" creatures so this is not a series for the real wee ones to watch alone though it is great for elementary age and up to view with the family. I watched the four Greek myths in a separate set and they were equally well done with a different but also wonderful storyteller (Michael Gambon). Part of the magic of the series is the way the storyteller (and his dog) always remain a part of the tales and as a result the viewer gets the true feeling of being told a story by the fire instead of just watching a bunch of actors and puppets on the television screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still good for nostalgia","review":"I got this series of short stories because my kids watched it when they were small, and they loved it. The special effects aren't as fantastic as they are now with CGI, but Henson as always, picked stories based on what they could teach young children--the Aesop of the 20th century. The stories presented are still charming, quaint and teach valuable lessons. There's no question they will enchant another generation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Super Bad","review":"The manufacturer squeezed the entire collection into one disk.

Jim Henson takes old world fairy tales from various countries and brings them to life. Much of the show is as surreal as many of the movies which followed.

Truly a treat for those who were children then and those who are now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic - Fun for the Whole Family","review":"This two disc collection is a classic that everyone will enjoy. The greek myths were not as enjoyable as the original storyteller, but only because there were 4 stories compared to the original which has 8.

I would recommend this collection or just the original \\"The Storyteller\\" to anyone who loves Jim Henson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jim Henson's Greatest Legacy","review":"This dvd features some of Jim Henson's final work before his untimely passing. It Features not muppets or a giant yellow bird, but it showcases remarkable stories with even more remarkable pupatry. My favorite story on this dvd is a haunting tale about a soldier that makes something out of nothing, and pays for his own cleaver scheming. In this tale the soldier uses a magic sack to capture and imprison death, who is I might say one of the most haunting puppets I have ever seen. It has these wide and piercing eyes that well, I saw this first when I was about 10 I believe and I have never forgotten that gaze. You would do well to add this to your collection, expecially if you are a fan of the dark crystal or a fan of fantastic storytelling for that matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Storyteller Collection","review":"Wonderful!

I listen to this CD all the time, it's one of my favorite CDs to play in my car. It's different from the norm and alot of people seem to judge the group before they even give them a chance. I think they could have come up with a better name for the group, but don't let that stop you from giving this album a chance. If you open up your mind to something different you might just like it. I personally found it refreshing to finally hear some decent sounding music. My favorite songs on the album are Chills, Lust, Like that Girl, Juke Joint, and Cruise Control. Valure also does her thing with the vocals. Don't write House of Fatty Koo off before you even give it a chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fatty Who?!?!?!?!","review":"Wow I can't really believe that people actually like this sorry excuse for a cd. I remember listening to it on the BET website when it first came out and I was really trying to figure out what the heck I was listening to. There might have been like 1 or 2 songs that were remotely listenable. This has got to be one of the worst cds that I have heard in quite some time. Way too many different sounds, way too many singers, and horribly over produced. I liked them singing on the show way better than on this album. This album will flop for sure.....and in months (not even years) people will be like Fatty Who?!?!?!?!...lol, I think they already are."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"HOUSE OF DISSAPOINTMENT\\"","review":"OMG this CD SUUUUUUUCKS!!!! the only songs i like are:*Bounce*Chilsthats it. the rest of the tracks sucks.

I ADVISE YOU TO BURN THE CD"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Debut","review":"I really didn't know what to expect with a name like Fatty Koo but I watched the show one night when nothing else was on tv and I was pleasantly suprised. They were working on the song \\"Chills\\" and I completely fell in love with it. I also saw the video for bounce and said to myself, if it is on sale, I'll buy it. I found it at Best Buy for $7.99 so I went ahead and bought it. It was a lot better than I expected. There were a lot of upbeat songs which is refreshing. Here is my take on the cd.1. Shake 3.5/52. Bounce 4/53. Fatty Koo 3/54. Chills 55. Like that Girl 4/56. Lust 4/57. Princess in Disguise 4/58. H.O.F.K. 3/59. Cruise Control 5/510. G'on Girl 3.5/511. Tight 4/512. Juke Joint 4/513.

THE AMAZING POWER BALLAD \\"CHILLS\\" IS A SHOWSTOPPER FEATURING INCREDIBLE LEAD VOCALS FROM VALURE & JOSH, YOU CAN ACTUALLY HEAR EACH GROUP MEMBER IN THE PHENOMENAL BACKGROUND ARRANGEMENT. \\"LUST' & \\"PRINCESS IN DISGUISE\\" ARE ENJOYABLE. ANOTHER STANDOUT IS THE WHIMSICAL & MELODIC \\"CRUISE CONTROL\\" WHICH FEATURES A SEXY CELLO BLENDED INTO THE GROUP'S SMOOTH VOCALS.

THIS IS A DAMN GOOD DEBUT, AND IT IS JUST THE BEGINNING."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something Fresh n New","review":"I must say that I really wanted to support this group after I watched there episodes of struggles on BET. I purchased the cd the other day on sale, so i figured either way good or bad I could afford to lose 10.00. I was familiar with \\"Bounce\\" so I kinda knew what to expect. As I let the cd play I can across the song entitled \\"Chills\\". Best song on the cd.

If you can find one at your local Verizon store, the cost will likely be a lot less. Mine was zero. Yes, it is really waterproof, drop proof, and dust proof (I just wash it off). If you drive a Jeep, this phone is a perfect match. The only complaint I have is battery life. I do seem to have to charge it nearly daily if it is in frequent use.

I've had it since it first came out, and it hasn't got so much as a scratch. You can read all about its specs, but this is the toughest, most dependable phone I've ever had. It's a really high quality item, and when it gets dirty, I just wash it off in the sink. The battery consistently lasts at least 3 days between charges, it has a good camera with lots of storage space, and the greatest thing is that the camera flash becomes a very good flashlight, which has come in handy so many times I lost count. I used to despise cell phones but had to have them.

The plot of this book is how Sees Behind Trees helps the village elder Gray Fire find the mystirious land of water. I myself think that this book is good on some points, but i'd say it's preety boring. The characters actually seem like there really alive, and Dorris made some really good similes and metaphors which go well with the story. What is actually very boring is that the book's storyline goes at a snails pace. Dorris spends to much time in the village, finally leaving when there are four chapters left in the book. The only really intresting chapter in my opinoion is chapter eight. And at the end of the book in chapter nine, Dorris seems to end the book extremly abroubtly in chapter nine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sees Behind Trees, a confusing story","review":"Sees Behind Trees by Michael Dorris is a strange book and can get confusing at times. It is about a Native American boy named Walnut, who becomes a man, and recieves a man name, Sees Behind Trees. This is because he has a special talent. He goes on a journey becuase of his unique talent. This journey helps him become strong and brave. I have mixed feelings about this book. It was not the best because it didn't really have a plot.

This book goes over board on poetry so if you're a poet you should read this book. In this book Sees Behind can \\"see behind trees\\". He uses his other senses more so he could help others who rely just on their sight. I can't tell you any more about the book, for it would give the plot away. This a bad book because people die and there is poetry and the two don't go together. If you do like poetry, and peoole dying, get this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT O.K. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Sees Behind Trees(SBT) is a story about a Native American 13 year old boy who evidently can not see very well.

It actually turns out the real assignment is to see with your ears.SBT finds out he has this power and uses it to find lost things.He then has to take on the biggest task of his life.I didn't think it was a good book, infact I'd rather watch reruns of Barney 6 hours strait."},{"rating":"1","title":"How much I hated this book","review":"Walnut is a nearsighted Native American boy. One day the test to become a man arrives. Walnut proves he can see with his ears and gets the name \\"Sees Behind Trees.\\" Then the village elder, Gray Fire, chooses him to find the mystical land of water where Gray Fire thought he left heart and literary lost his toes. This book is filled with descriptive writing but not a very good storyline and I think half of this book is unneeded. But if you like Michael Dorris than I might recommend it. And I recommend reading \\"Sees Behind Trees\\" first because once you read \\"Morning Girl\\" you won't want to read anything by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sees Behind Trees book review","review":"In 1996, Sees Behind trees was published by Hyperion. This book was written by Michael Dorris, and is fiction. It is a good book about a boy who becomes a man named, Sees Behind Trees and a friend, Gray Fire, who go on a journey and on the way they encounter misfortune. In the end it is very sad. This book is written from Sees Behind Trees point of veiw. This book has many similes and metaphors and it is very discriptive. I would recommend this book to fourth and fifth graders. If you like to read a lot I might pick another book because this book is only 104 pages long. If you don't like to read as much I would read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sees Behind Trees","review":"In 1996 Michael Dorris wrote the horrible book Sees Behind Trees. It was published by Hyperion.The main characters in this book are Sees Behind Trees, Checha, Karna, Petew,and Gray Fire. The book is about an ll-year-old boy named Sees Behind Trees. He can see with his ears and hear with eyes. This book is also about him going to find the land of water with Gray Fire. He is nearsighted and he got his name from the test that all boys his age must do.

Dorris overused similies and metephors. It's about an indian boy who can hjardly see.This story takes place in california when the white men hadn't come yet. Nobody is realkly telling the story. THe main character is a near sighted indian kid whos kinda psychic.The mood of this book is depressed and annoying.the plot is completely pointless he finds this place loses his elder freind and walks home.'the storie is boring i personetely didn't like this book what so ever The story is not engaging i swear i almost died of bordom readind it.if the auther had a point i'd have no idea what it was. i would only recomend this book to an indian kid really into his culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please help me!","review":"Does Sees Behind Trees Really find the place Gray Fire wanted to find?!!

This one, published in 1996 by Hyperion, is called Sees Behind Trees, and is about a young Native American boy (who is just becoming a man in the beginning of the book), living somewhere in either the Great Plains or New England. If you like a book with LOTS of poetry, a lot of description, with a dialogue thrown in, then you MIGHT, like this book. The book is basically like many children's stories, except this one slightly overuses the classic plot of \\"the main character finally accomplishes something and then something bad happens\\". After the main character, Sees Behind Trees, becomes a man, he is asked to go on a long and \\"perilous\\" road to a \\"magical\\" and \\"beautiful\\" place, only to lose his friend there.

I don't really recommend this book because it is depressing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seeing Without Eyes","review":"In 1996 Michael Dorris wrote a pretty good book called, Sees Behind Trees. It goes slowly and doesn't have much excitement until the end. It is about a boy who can't see fully and uses his ears to find objects that his friends want him to find. His talent is to not see and to find things every time he wants to. He is also trying to get his name which shows his tribe that he is a man.If you think that you would like to read this book I will warn you that it goeas really slow and the chapters are really long.I think that this book was OK but I wouldn't read it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cropped HDTV","review":"The only real point of getting this TV is for HD through the HDMI input.

We had 2 hours of very light, almost mist-like rain. All 4 corners leaked and when I entered the tent, water was coming straight through the walls and running to the floor-I honestly have never seen such a poor product and we are disappointed that Coleman quality has sunk so low.

Sure it carried the 'crystals' theme, and a chocobo here and there, but the story, characters, and plot development were bland. The animation quality needed some work; characters were not very deep and plot was paper-thin. Simply put, it was too short to develop any character associations or plot development that I found crucial in many other anime titles. Terrible, absolutely terrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's not that bad","review":"I got Final Fanasy for Christmas, and I only asked for it because it was anime. But once i got it, i truthfully enjoyed it. Though somem aren't satisfied with the whole idea of it. Though I don't consider the animation completely like anime, it has a good storyline. There are four crystals, and there are four people who are trying to overcome an evil force stealing all of the crystals to cause an end.

No, I'm not kidding about that.They can't even decide if the main character's name is Prettz or Pritz (it's spelled both ways in the prologue to each \\"episode\\").Last but not least, they take a creature that's part plucked chicken and part Jell-o mold and try to pass it off as a Chocobo.Do not watch this movie.

The plot, although mediocre, was certainly lost on all the really bad cheesy parts. If you want to buy this because you think it's like the original FF series on Video Games, don't waste your time. I found this series very humorous, though, but only because it was really cheaply done.

If you like movies with foul language, lots of violence, blood, and gore then DO NOT buy this movie. I myself like movies that have this, but also like everything else. This movie is mainly like the end of the world theme until a bunch of people become chosen by destiny to save the world that they live in. The movie has a lot of jokes, but it is mainly action.

I did!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have for Any Final Fantasy Game Fan!!!","review":"I was laughing, cheering, and crying (from laughing so hard). I was very pleased that this story follows very closely to the game plots; it's that same style that flows though every Final Fantasy game, those favorite characters that you both became frustrated with and had fun with. This anime has it all: the summoning heroine, so pivitol to the success of the adventure; the easily tempered, yet laid back hero, secretely in love with our heroine; the bumbling brute in unrequited love; the enemy turned ally who's only looking out for number one; riddles, magic, and spooks; and reaching to another world to vanquish the foe and return peace to the entire earth. Oh, yeah! And featherless gold chocobos to save the day!The only thing wrong I see with this series is that it's so short. But that may only seem that way to me because I'm used to 40-70 hour playing times!

This commentary on the Gospel of Mark draws upon various strands of Christian theology, as well as the wisdom of other world religions. Whereas \\"Be Here Now,\\" published in 1971, drew us on a journey to the East and its contemplative wisdom, \\"The Lost Spiritual World\\" helps us to complete the circle, as many of us return to our cradle faiths, but liberated and enriched by what we have learned from other traditions.

The first book about Christopher Snow provides the background for the suddenly appearing mad monkeys, lunatic priests and rabid policemen. \\"Seize the Night\\" gives Christopher Snow's world a new and more terrifying twist that rivals any of Koontz's previous novels.

It moved along at a really quick pace that kept the pages turning.I really admire Dean Koontz's talent at creating an entertaining thriller that isn't drawn out for seven hundred pages. Some authors can't seem to resist doing that these days. I also like it that, even in the darkest parts of his stories, there's always some emergence of humor, which translates as hope.Great book!

It's got a sci fi twist for sure, but the cool thing about this book is that it's written in REAL TIME, which further enhances the scare factor because you feel like you're with it minute to minute. As far as the 'one liners' go, that's part of the guy's character and I wouldn't even really say that they're 'one liners'.

Racing against time to save a child and a beloved pooch, all the moronic banter between Snow and his socially misfit friends is an insult to the intelligence to any reader. My suspicion is Koontz did not write this book himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"If this book sucked more, I could have vaccuummed my house","review":"Although I also missed the first of this series of books, starting here with the second, I have no desire to go back and read the first, nor will I knowingly buy the next. I spent longer wading thought the first 260 or so pages than the time elapsed within them. It has interesting details, some unexpected twists (but you're expecting them, after all, it's D. Koons), and very good dialogue - where there is dialogue. The plot seems to have been patched together hastily, and although many pieces come together at the end, the story as a whole seems to be like a patchwork quilt with a few pieces missing - overall it'll work, but if you examine it, you'll see how fragile it is. I was sorely disappointed, as I enjoy Koons' ability to create new stories with different plots & characters. His skills were not used to thier full potential in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"CD's scratched beyond repair","review":"I love listening to books on CD while walking,biking etc. This is the first time I've purchased used ones. They are full of scratches which can't be cleaned,buffed or polished off. Thinking my CD player may be causing the problem, I bought a new one. CD's are trash, expensive trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly stupid","review":"This book reads like Dean Koontz stayed up late watching cliched, cheesy made-for-TV movies then wrote a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much description, book went nowhere.","review":"I love suspense novels, this one was so hard to finish because it was so descriptive it was both confusing and idled the plot to a point that I was uninterested anymore. The conversation did not flow in this book either. I found myself skimming through half of the book as it was due to the intensity of descriptions. Too many things that are off plot, and you still are not even sure of who kidnapped the kids at the end. Bad book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take time between part one and seizing part two...","review":"I absolutely fell head over heals for Orson in Fear Nothing, and, I really like Chris, Sasha, and Bobby, too. So I made a bee-line for part two - Seize the Night.Once again Dean's heroes are complete - funny, thoughtful, and ready to go the distance for each other no matter how scary it is. The problem is, if you are listening to these books on disc/tape... Dean does way tooooooo much catching you up on the history from Fear Nothing. More than once I fast forwarded and more than once I growled, \\"What about Orson!?\\". No worries though, it all turns out as it should and is a great story... I want more!As always the imagery and Dean's ability to pull you to the edge of your seat are extraordinary, and the reader (Keith Szarabajka), though at first may not \\"sound\\" right, is perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Solid Read! When Does the Third Book Come Out?","review":"This novel was a very suspenseful, thought-provoking read. I had thought that \\"Fear Nothing\\" borrowed a bit too much from Koontz's previous novel, \\"Midnight,\\" but this book shows, that he's trying to concoct a \\"super-trilogy\\" with elements from his own \\"Midnight,\\" \\"Lightning,\\" \\"Phantoms,\\" and \\"Intensity\\" (and a bit from Wells's \\"The Island of Dr. Moreau,\\" as well.) A tour de force all rolled up into one! I was very impressed by Koontz's style and creativity with this novel. A good ending too, but I am dying to read the conclusion. There are still so many questions left unanswered. I don't think any reader will be disappointed with this novel, its interesting to say the least. It may help, however, to read \\"Fear Nothing\\" to get a better understanding of the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good story gets better","review":"I agree that the story is told better in the second book. In the first book, I liked the idea, but thought the execution just never got pulled off. The idea of animals being made smarter, humans being made more animalistic and what effects that would have on our world are fascinating. But the first book had long boring stretches for me that made it hard to read and push through.The second book flows much better. We finally get to explore more of the mysterious Wyvern. And I agree there is plenty more there to explore! We still have not seen the active lab there! So I also say bring on book three!My only real gripe was the \\"do over\\". I would have had the \\"do over\\" erased later in the car scene, instead of only frightening us with it. The paradox fixing itself.Loved the sideways world. I think the time travel added a lot to the second story.Good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!","review":"Sieze the Night, second installment in the Moonlight Bay series, is a great read and I enjoyed it very much. The story centers on the search for more answers to the mysteries of what is going on in the town of Moonlight Bay and how Christopher Snow and his family fit into the mysteries. Koontz has crafted another page turner here!! The characters are well crafted and are easily likeable. The action is well paced and my interest was held throughout the book. The writing is great and I love the symbolism that the author imparts."},{"rating":"1","title":"BLEAK !","review":"I should have walked right past this chaos. I used to think Dean Koontz could deliver some masterful suspense and horror. Maybe he could, hopefully he can again, but this book was very disappointing. The plot could have been done so much better, the characters where nobodies, the action was mundane, and the surfer language was just to much."}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},x={class:"card-container"},N=["disabled"],H={key:0},M={key:1};function W(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=y("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",x,[(a(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",M,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",H,"See more"))],8,N)):b("",!0)])}const B=d(C,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-5b3bd266"]]),P=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/45.md","filePath":"glossary/45.md"}'),R={name:"glossary/45.md"},j=Object.assign(R,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(B)]))}});export{P as __pageData,j as default};
