I would have rather enjoyed my time with the Twilight series... and I suffered through the Twilight books so I could have a leg upon which to stand when I said they were AWFUL. I don't suppose many educated people enjoy Terry Goodkind... they seem like fantasy for the illiterate or juvenile."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Emperor Has No Clothes!","review":"This book was awful. It was not a deep dissertation on the human spirit, or complex human conditions, or anything else. It was 100 pages of Richard chasing a chicken-monster, 50 pages of recap from previous books and about 250 pages of Kahlan pouting and whining. Oh, and Richard finding out he has yet another woman who thinks she's married to him, something that occurs in each book and has become a source of great merriment among Goodkind's former fans. What started off with some promise in Wizard's First Rule has fizzled into a boring, endless, pointless episodic melodrama which even the author admits has no plan for a conclusion. Stop the Madness! We've all made Terry Goodkind very rich, and this is how he rewards us? I'm insulted."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites...NO DOUBT!","review":"I must say that this series is one of the best...and I have read all the greats. There is one thing that I tresure about these wonderful books is the fact that each and every one has some sort of moral-lesson...or deeper meaning. Something that the average person can do to improve their way of life. I must admit that Richard and Kahlan's heart-jerking struggles usually bring me to tears more often than not. That alone is something of acheievement...If you can make a \\"manly-man\\"...like myself...cry... Well, you have done something. =) This is also an excellent book to make a \\"fantasy skeptic\\" read...more oftern than not, they will come begging to borrow the next in the series. It can be a wonderful tool for gloating. =) Nevertheless, this series is in a class by itself. Yes,...it has simularities to Jordan, but who cares...IT A MASTERPIECE!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Long live Terry Goodkind.","review":"Mr. Goodkind is the best author I have run across these past few years. No other author has had me so excited about and waiting so impatiently for his next book. I have, and will continue to collect his books in hard back. His books have a consistant quality that we have all come to expect of his work. He has had me on the brink of tears and laughing hysterically with the story twists and turns. I never know what to expect. The concepts are useful (the Wizard's rules) and I have often quoted his work. And I will do so again. In reference to a negative personality. All I can say is....Wizard's First Rule, People are stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"forgetable","review":"the pages not spent re-hashing the previous books were used to repeat actions done by the characters in them"},{"rating":"1","title":"A 'little' story lost and in search of an end...","review":"Terry Goodkind takes a major detour into the realms of parochial politics and loses his way. In 'Soul of Fire', Goodkind attempts to recreate something of the charm of earlier instalments, but fails because he does not have a story to tell. The plot evaporates about half way through and he spends most of the second half desperately seeking an end, which unfortunately does not come soon enough. I was left bewildered by the sudden conclusion. Is it really so necessary to link this story to the sequel in such an obvious and clumsy manner? Does this book carry the taint of 'contractual obligation'?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have been shorter","review":"This book was not up to the very high standard of the first 4. The setting of Anderith (spelling? ) and the characters was very drawn out. I am starting to get a bit frustrated with the inability of the key players to communicate, and there are days to travel across the countryside, but none to talk.The basic plot is good, but I would like to see Richard growing into his role more. After all the padding in the middle, the climax was very swift.I hope Volume 6 come back up to his previous very high standard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, no more!","review":"Goodkind has quite an imagination if he can imagine something worse than this. Will these people never die? It's hard to find plots so obvious and characters so wooden in B movies, much less in a book of this length. Here we have a failed attempt to explain away all the inconsistencies of the earlier books, and again, the characters are conveniently either omnipotent or fragile. Make them go away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terry is running out of gas","review":"His first and second book were GREAT but they have gone down hill from there.

The majority of this book focuses upon new, uninteresting characters three quarters of the time causing me to feel as if this book were a chore instead of pleasure reading. The uninteresting characters in the novel receive an abrupt end which gives me the sense of frustration after trudging through 500 pages about them. If you want a series which is still interesting at book 8...read Robert Jordan."},{"rating":"1","title":"I accidentally skipped over this book and went right to Faith of the Fallen...","review":"I purchased books 4-6 as a set. I read Temple of the Winds then mistakenly read Faith of the Fallen next. It's funny - aside from a couple minor references, you can skip Soul of the Fire without missing a beat.In any event, I read the plot overview for SOTF. Richard's and Kahlan's marriage released some ancient curse/spell? Are you kidding me? I'm giving the book one star just for having such a contrived storyline."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointment too Kind","review":"After reading through the incredible first in the series, the Wizards First Rule, I quickly ordered all succeeding books including this one. Incredible also describes the way the author has progressively erradicated all elements of the first one which made it so successful to culminate in this last series, whose description as \\"page turner\\" merely refers to skipping through 50 pages of dull text at a time consisting primarily of meaningless dialogue. One could do better by reading the first 50 and last 50 pages without the disappointment and tediousness of wrestling with all 600+ pages. Alas, I will still have to buy the next one, if only for a reduced 50 pages of good reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"When you think Terry Goodkind has hit rock bottom....","review":"Somebody throws him a shovel. A really heavy-duty one. I always finish my series. Always. I read Wizard's First Rule and I thought it was pretty good, despite the blatant copying of Robert Jordan. The second book was mediocre, but I always excuse the second book in a series... after all, Star Wars was good, The Empire Strikes Back was not as good, but Return of the Jedi was fantastic.Terry, quit while you can still get a profit. I will never read another one of your books because they are so disgusting. Frankly, age-old \\"commies-are-bad\\" rhetoric died with the Cold War.Soul of the Fire was the most poorly written, pornographic, disgusting and idiotic piece of literature that I have ever read. A five-year old could write better. In the words of the Simpsons, I could puke in a fountain pen and mail it to the monkey house and get better writing.Hope this constructive criticism helps, Mr. G. ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book ends the series for me","review":"This series seems to have lost it's edge, almost as if TG forgot where he was in his own series. The characters are becoming more and inept as each book comes along. The most powerful wizard in the history of this world TG has built, is not able to light a fire.Khalan, his wife, argues every decision he makes for 10 pages, only to end up agreeing with him. This happens several times per book. His is the supposed King of the land, yet no one listens to his commands for the most part.I believe this series had the chance to be up there with Dragon Lance, The Belgariad, and The wheel of time. Yet, the books lag on after the 3rd. I find myself skimming chapters just to get past the retelling of the previous books. The characters never progress in their abilities.I will not continue this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad enough to stop reading the series?","review":"No other characters have been added in such a long, dry way. How do you stay away from the three main charters for chapters at a time? Our typical characters are not acting like themselves. There is no passion, no intrigue. It is stagnant and I find myself flipping page after page trying to find something worthwhile about it. Am ready to put the book down altogether and either archive them in kindle or try moving to the next book if the next book starts off as bad, I will be done.This book is almost like someone else wrote it.Thoroughly disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle Edition is Missing Content?","review":"I just purchased this last night & discovered some problems. If you go to the Copyright page (location 45 according to Kindle), at the bottom, there is a section that says: \\"eForward to the electronic edition copyright 2011 by Terry Goodkind c/o Revel Studios, Inc.\\" In my copy, there is no eForward by Terry Goodkind, nor is the entry from Kolo's Journal (which appears in the print version of the book before the beginning of chapter 1, which I borrowed from my local library) included in the eBook.EDIT: I have sent eMails explaining the problem to Mr. Goodkind's people & they so far have not answered. The only thing I can get from Amazon is that they will look into the matter. I am not the only fan of this series to notice this missing content. I am still waiting for the issue to be fixed."},{"rating":"1","title":"First book of the series I had to force myself to get through.","review":"I've invested so much time and energy into these characters to have half of this book filled with the intricacies of another lands political system. The characters of this other land take up so much time and I found them uninteresting and just plain lame. I loved the parts with Richard and Kahlan but the reason I gave this one star is because I felt as I was being punished for liking them. A really great chapter followed by 4 or 6 chapters of drab story that might of well of been another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much worse then the first four, WHAT HAPPENED?","review":"Soul of the Fire was an incredibly plodding and slow book. It doesn't start out necessarily badly, but once it starts with all the Fitch nonsense, you wonder \\"Why is this in the story?\\" The first four, WFR, SOT, BOTF, and TOTW were good and well written. This one was a large step down. If you are going to read it, get it in paperback, it's not worth the money for the hardcover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho Hum.","review":"This series grabbed me and hooked me good right from the start. That being said, wow! What a let down. I will continue to read this series but I really think the next book needs to pick it up a bit.In 'Soul of the Fire' we spend time getting to know new characters which could have been great.TG really can bring characters into the story in a masterful way. You want to cheer for them. The problem in this book is that all of them are basically discarded like they were never important anyway. So I end up wondering why did we spend half the book on things that didn't matter anyway. Maybe I am missing the point that these are examples of the futility of the Ander people in general or something but I was left wanting more.I started reading the series because of the magic involved. This book had little to none and I was disappointed.Right now I feel very much like TG is getting lessons from Robert Jordan.Ho, hum."},{"rating":"1","title":"1st book awesome in every details-this book is the reverse","review":"first book i read with intrigue, slowly turning the pages to fully absorbs the storyline that came into life in my mind.

I was about two thirds of the way finished with it when I realized that absolutely nothing had happened. Being part of a good series makes the book worth reading. It is not worth buying the hardcover edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good addition to series, but not the best of the series","review":"I love this series, but I was somewhat disappointed by this latest installment. I am eager for the next in the series and will buy it immediately upon release. Terry left the climax to almost the very last few pages, and seemed to summarily wrap it up. I had to re-read the last part of the book several times to truely understand what was implied for resolution. I find most of Terry's work very gratifying in the detail of atonement, this ending was rushed. I still give it a 4 star due to the rest of the series, but alone this book would not merit this rating. I do actively recommend the series, and can't wait for the next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better luck next time","review":"I am a great fan of this series, unfortunately I didn't like this book as much as the others. I would have like a better developement on Richard with is new found powers. When I finished his previous book, I thought that in the next, he is going to find Zedd and will be able to control his power now, that's gonna be cool. Nope, they found Zedd, talk to him for a day (nothing relevant) and then they're off walking...for about a month or so. Why don't they invent car or something, it seems to me that they are doing a lot of walking lately. We do have a wonderful introduction to the Haken and Ander people...I DON'T CARE! I didn't buy this book for a story on someone who's getting a disease by a prostitute of all this. If your like me though, you won't listen to what I say and your gonna by this book, and the one after simply because your a fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the heck happened?","review":"Goodkind really screwed up. The end was really, really rushed. It seemed like he was getting bored and so decided to skip a whole bunch of important stuff. Fitch and Beata were useless and served no point in the story. All the political manuevering just distracted from the real story- the Chimes. I did not care about the Minister of Culture- I want to know about the chimes! Zedd kinda was gone, but the scene where he vanished was superb. The whole end was stupid. Richard \\"quits\\". Stupid. Is he ending it here? Cara couldn't stop two boys? Stupid. All the sexual content? Stupid, unnecessary. It was also boring. It left too many loose ends... Read some Jordan and enjoy an excellent fantasy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unspectacular installation in an excellent series","review":"I was very disappointed by this novel. The first and second books were great, in fact some of the finest fantasy that I have read. The next two books were mediocre; and, to put it mildly, the current one is a disaster. It is incredibly boring!! The plot is lame and very linear, whatever happened to that good old \\"ten different sub-plots running along in parallel\\" formula? It worked so well in the beginning! I would not even recommend this novel to die-hard Richard fans because it is such a letdown =("},{"rating":"1","title":"Terry's tired","review":"It's clear that the passion Terry Goodkind had in the first few books of the series has dissipated. The fun stuff, the clever stuff, is gone, replaced by the rantings of a sour disposition. It's really sad when an author doesn't know when to stop. It's time to bring the series to a head--go after Jagang--and then see if there is anything left to write. This book was boring and it took the story completely off course."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goodkind took two years to write this?!","review":"I must say that the Sword of Truth series is one of the best I have read. However, Soul of the Fire was just horrible; over half of the book was devoted to a developing a new group of characters who were boring and really had no effect on the ongoing storyline and it felt like he just threw in the returning characters to say it was a Sword of Truth book. My opinion, read the first four, skip this one (just find someone to tell you a Cliff's Notes version) and wait patiently for the next."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't recommend you purchase this disappointment.","review":"The series seems to be getting darker and darker in tone. The main characters have become petty and lacking in the spark present in varying degrees in the four previous volumes of the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Downward Spiral?","review":"I can tell you that I was looking forward to the latest enstallement in the Sword of Truth series in the hopes that it would be better than the last two, but SoF actually turned out to be worse. The series itself has been on a downward spiral. The characters that were introduced were of no importance in the end, and the storyline itself had \\"manufactured\\" written all over it. If you truly like the series, you should read it, but I strongly recommend that you wait for the paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"The Soul of Fire was a major disappointment. The returning characters had absoultely no new development. More pages were devoted to new characters who ended up to have no significance. Kahlan was nothing more than a nagging and jealous wife. Hardly any pages were from Richard's perspective. I kept hoping it would get better as I read along but it didn't. Even the end was a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"The magic is fading","review":"While Richard battles to restore magic to the world of life, Goodkind battles to restore magic to his writing. I am not entirely sorry I started the series -- yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating Satire","review":"As a recent fan of Terry Goodkind, I was pleasantly surprised by the book. Although it is a little slow at the beginning, has little magic, and focuses on new characters, it is well worth reading. In fact, in my opinion, this book is not the standard fantasy novel, it is rather a cutting political satire. It tells of a corrupt leader who cannot control his sexual urges, his wife who uses him to gain her own power, and the people who blindly believe whatever he says, seeing his sexual indiscretions as symbolic of his true power. Whether you agree or not, it doesn't take much thought to figure out to whom he is referring. But rather than hurting the book, it ultimately serves to develop the main characters. Read it and weep!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A page-turner, NOT!","review":"I had to remind myself to keep pressing through this book. I was not challenged at all by this book. It is words on paper. I like the series, but what was this? The whole book was invalidated by the next in the series. Goodkind spends an entire book building up a civilization and several new characters then abandons the whole group by the end of the story.What was the point?The book picks up at the end.I found this story bland, uneventful, and dissapointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"When I pick up a fantasy book, I really expect to read fantasy. This book had almost no magic or fantasy involved. If I wanted a political thiller, I would have picked up that type of book. In addition, it seemed that this book was completely independent of the first 4 and the 6th. I was extremely disappointed and regret the time I spent on it when I could have read something more suitable to the fantasy area."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it","review":"I have read bad reviews for this book but I truly enjoyed it once it got going it rolled around real quick cant wait to start the next one"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't stand on it's own.","review":"Soul of the Fire the 5'th in a great series is a bit of a let down. The chracters have become too emotional. Richard would work better as a darker character with a bit more of a sence of humor instead, we get him crying all the time. Of course we don't put up with much of this because the main characters are hadly in the book. Instead we get chapter after boring chapter on new lifeless , dull characters who end up being irrelevent. I felt all most cheated by this book. It doesn't answer any of the questions we have from the last book and takes us into all these new people we'll never see again. It's only worth reading in hopes that the next one will be better and since the last one was so well done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Few refreshing moments don't compensate for repetition","review":"It took me three months to read this book. It was a trial getting past the sappy first two chapters after that things picked up. As is the authors trademark we had the pointless rape-du-jour that does nothing to advance the plot, we have a few grimly detailed mugings to round out the bit-o-ultraviolence too. The method by which Richard bansihes the chimes comes completely out of left field. Not enough of the favorite secondary characters like the Mud People, Mord Sith bondage babes or even smelly old Gratch. The final ending left openings for another book naturally but was tied up too neatly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seemed like Mr. Goodkind himself is tired of this series.","review":"I was very impressed with the previous Sword of Truth Books, I loved the conflict between Kahlan and Richard and the conflicts within themselves. The ideas were new and the storyline complex enough to leave me pondering. However, Soul of the Fire (where did this title come from?) was a major disappointment. Chicken monsters? CHICKEN MONSTERS??? Where were our heroes? We spent a goodly time learning about corrupt politics in Anderith while we followed the antics of an unintelligent slave boy who has no character and regularly engages in gratitous violence. I felt that the book ended without any closure...Richard was never told that his soul belonged to the chimes and Zedd never found out about Du'Chaillu, Richards 'other' wife.

In fact, he is my one of the three most loved author. Now that it's said, I will talk about the four books in the series. The first book, \\"Wizard's First Rule,\\" was awesome. The book excellently evolved the characters into someone quite real. The plots were incredible, too. There was also the love aspects. The second book is great. This time, there was more of the love aspects. Richard loved Khalan and Khalan loved Richard. Less actions. The third book, more love aspects. \\"Lesser\\" actions. Boring. Fourth book, almost no action and too much love aspects. SUPER BORING! So, you see what I am saying. If you want something about love, Mr. Goodkind, make it a complicated love.

And this was the first book in the series where I could actually pull myself away from it easily and have thoughts of throwing it out the window without finishing it.My advice: read it if you want to know what is going on but skip the parts about politics and Fitch and Beata and all that crap. Try to borrow it from someone so you don't have to buy it cause it isn't worth it. I guess half of it was alright but overall and compared to the others in the series I didn't like the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anderith too much of it","review":"I loved the first four novels. I could not put them down. However with this fifth installement, you have 300 pages of the lives of anderith people. They're not important and they disappear in the 6th novel. There was no need to write so much of their story while the only peopple we care about are nathan, richard, kahlan, zedd, anne, verna and all the magical creatures we met through the first novels. The chimes were a great idea but there was not enough magic in this book.One advice you can fastword on all the chapters concerning Anderith. They add no value to the book. If you do that, you will definitely enjoy the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What an awful pile of dung !","review":"I liked the first four books. They were definately gory at times and certainly frustrating but at least they held my attention. The new characters are completely unsympathetic and boring. I can't stand how the old characters never seem to learn from their mistakes. It's like a bad episode of Three's Company. You know the one about the misunderstanding ... TG spends three books convincing us that Kahlin is an intelligent, capable, strong woman who really has her sh-t together and then she is replaced with Lucy Ricardo. I almost crawled out of my skin with the whole Marlin business in the begining of book 4 and don't even get me started about the whole \\"Chicken that is not a chicken\\" bit. I actually put the book down (something I never do) and I may never finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Series Takes a Side Road to Hell","review":"The Wizard's first and only rule should be that fantasy fiction series cannot be longer than 5 books. The leaders of the \\"Fantasy Fiction Writers Guild\\" should pass a resolution to this effect. If you have read Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time mess, or just about any other writer including Goodkind that has tried to take his/her series beyond 5 books you know that it is like a train going off the end of a broken bridge into a deep gorge.Goodkind has obviously run out of story, so he takes this book down a side road to the psychotic world of Anderith. A whole bunch of self-serving useless characters are introduced, examined in depth, and then killed off to add absolutely nothing to the story line.At least Goodkind keeps to his theme of rape and torture of innocent women. I was beginning to think he might be loosing his touch, but the good leaders of Anderith have redeemed him.A hard read at best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Next!","review":"Outstanding book and storyline, but definately a different flavor than the other four. The bad reviews are from the same people who complain when their favorite musical group \\"changes\\" (Such a nasty word). What could have brought on the coveted 5-star? Epic battles, Goodkind has a way of making you feel like your in the middle of them. The emperor has been hovering on the backburner for too long. These two armies need to scrap a little more often. Repeatedly stealing the prize before he shows up just isn't the same. So bring on number six and quickly please."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goodkind needs a break","review":"This had to be the worst book I've read since Ann Rice's Feast of All Saints. The new characters we're introduced to are dislikeable from the beginning and godown hill from there. So glad they all die, though a description of Jagang putting the new Sovereign to death in book 6 would have been welcomed. I liked the ending though (partially because the pain of reading this bad book would soon be over), and partially because I like Dalton's revenge. My advice if you must read this drivel, read the last 100 pages, it will still make sense and you won't have suffered through the rest of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I have read all of the Sword of Truth series, and eagerly awaited the 5th book. Now I wish I hadn't read it at all. If you take the first two chapters, the last two chapters, and summarize the rest into a paragraph, you'd have a short but decent book. Goodkind totally ignores pressing situations from the last 4 books, and spins off on a wild, and boring tangent about flat, and unimaginative subplots which never tie together in the end. I loved the first four books, but I wish I had skipped number five and went straight to six!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Soul of Fire","review":"To bad Goodkind couldn't come up with hardly any new material.We are stuck reading 90 percent of the book as the characters rethink,or dwell on what the reader read in the first four books of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ill thought remarks","review":"I looked over a few reviews and was satisfied with most of your remarks, however those of you determined to down play this book becouse it did not fit your standards should crawl back into your petty little holes. I happen to agree that i was a little disapointed myself but truth be told i took the time to look at the big picture. Mr. Goodkind has given me many hours of \\"on the edge of my seat entertainment\\" and the few things i have learned is he is unpredictable and never without purpose. Quote me when i say that in the future you will find this book was a necisary edition and you will not be able to take back your ill thought remarks."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book","review":"the 5th book in Terry Goodkinds series is not bad, it is interesting but there was some parts I was a little tierd of like Richard not heeding the advise of his friends and doing what he thinks is best,when most of the people and friends he meets clearly have more experiance then him. Most of what he does he thinks is better but in the long run cause more problems for him and it doesn't work out the way he thinks and makes it worse. by the end of this book Richard's ideas and plans almost cost Kahlan her life. the one thing I did like was how he, Kahlan,and Cara handled things without thier magic. all in all not a bad book.

I can never imagine how Goodkind comes up with books like that! I have read every single book in the series countless times. Even my friend, who hates all that fantasy stuff is hooked on Goodkind's books. HOW DOES HE DO IT???!!! For all you Jordan fans out there, I read the first chapter of Jordan's \\"Wheel of Time\\" I can honestly say that it was rather dull, BUT you can never judge a book by its first chapter. From all the reviews I've read, I'm sure that Jordan's books are pretty interesting.

But it sure seemed like nothing much happened in The Path of Daggers. Barely a mention of Mat Cauthan(sp?)... and it didn't seem like much progress made. I am not an author, and have no idea what it is like to be an author, but it seemed to me like it *couldn't* have taken a year to write that book (daggers).I *really* like Goodkind's books thus far as well. I also like broccoli, and carrots, but I wouldn't compare one to the other."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent \\"fantasy\\" series","review":"I have read many of the reviews of both Jordan and Goodkind, and I find one thing funny. Most of the people writing these reviews act like they are professionals who review for a living. They nitpick little nuances all over the place, or try to draw deep, soul-searching conclusions to each of these novels. Instead, they should enjoy them for what they are...fantasy. The purpose of fantasy is to allow a person to leave the everyday, humdrum of their life and go to a different plateau in their mind. It is pure entertainment similar to Star Wars, Indiana Jones, and so forth. Stop analyzing these works to death and just enjoy them for the fun and deviation from life's norms that they bring."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst book in the series","review":"I have to say I have been stedily getting more dissapointed in this series. I had hoped he would wrap it up in 3-4 books, but like 'the eye of time' series it is dragging on and on and on. Very little progress really seems to have been made by the end of this book and I doubt I'll be buying more in this series. All in all a dissapointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work. Either should the author... anymore.","review":"The first thing you notice is the seemingly gradeschool-esque tone of the book. The first half of the book is essentially, \\"See Richard run\\", \\"See Kahlan jump\\", \\"Oooh, spooky chickens\\". And how poor the transition between feelings... \\"And so, Zedd cried!.. Then he was happy!.. now mystified,, alas, he cries again..\\" Gime a break. The book rambles endlessly on, seemingly with no true regard for the existing storyline. What a terrible book..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who wrote this book?","review":"Richard gave up. A whole book where Richard doesn't fight. We here about a bunch of people who die in the end for 350 pages of the 500 page book. But hey now that Kahlan lost her baby boy I guess they can have another child without fear of it being like that, even if it is a boy it's not the one shota had the bad dreams about.I didn't like this one it was to much about stratigy. I liked it when there was action and now the only reason I put up with it is cause I want to know what happens to Richard and Kahlan. Richard GAVE UP. Does he even read his own books??? I read a review for the fourth book, I don't know if it was really him but it was here in amazon and it said author review and in it he said something along the lines of people who didn't like his book being dumb, and that the temple was his best book. I disagree and so do most the people who reviewed it. Don't take offense like that just fix it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A most excellent suspense and even hearbreaking book","review":"Wizard's First Rule is one of my favorite books and someone who likes fantasy or wizards or that kind of stuff this is definitely a must. Although I must admit that I did not really enjoy buying the books which most of them are 10.00 bucks each this one was definitely worth it. I have read all of them but Soul of the Fire and if it does not involve Chase or Rachel (who I think should become an important character)I think I will scream.

I really liked the first one. The second one was a little bit childish, but I could live with it. The third was great! The 4th book was bad, slow and boring.This book amplified and expanded on all that was wrong with the 4th book.Half the book is about new characters who die at the end in very lame and anti-clamic ways. It makes you say, \\"what the %&* did these people have to do with the story at all?\\"Really you could read a one page summary of the book and you would get all you need out of it and then you could move on to something better, in fact I don't think I have read a worse book. Skip this one if you want to read the series, very likely it will make you abandon the whole series if you read it anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sword of Truth series","review":"The series seemed to go on forever and after a while I became bored. The books are well written adult fantasy, but I think it could have been ended before the last three books."},{"rating":"1","title":"I had to stop reading","review":"After reading about 150 pages of this book, I just had to quit. Terry Goodkind seems to have fallen into the same trap that has snared writers like Robert Jordan. He seems to have decided to keep the series opened ended and just kick out as many Sword of Truth novels as he can. The focused story that was present in Goodkind's earilier works is no longer there. This book is just something to bridge the way to books six, seven, and eight. The writing itself is not bad, but much like the Wheel of Time series, the Sword of Truth series is picking up a lot of dead weight. We see an ever multiplying cast of characters and the story itself just gets bigger and no end is in sight. I will waste no more time on this series. I like stories that have an ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Richard Rahl, Kahlan, Zedd and friends..","review":"I was given Wizards First Rule as a present a few months ago, and was excited beyond belief that the series had continued...all the way to 5 books already. This was great...I finally finished the last in the series...which has kept me awake very late at night. The books are all excellent. In this last book, without ruining it for everyone, I just didn't like the ending, with what Richard did...I expected a better ending...I can't wait until the next book comes out...hope that the last book (whenever that is), has an enormous and smashing ending...Thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Interesting Addition.","review":"Firstly, I would like to say how much I admire Goodkind for writing a book that is vastly different - in terms of character action - from previous instalments of the Sword of Truth. Admitedly, characters which had endeared the reader to them in previous books are not present. How can the introduction of new (though short-lived) characters be a detrimental thing? Rather, they serve to show Goodkinds depth of understanding in terms of human emotion and cognizance. Whilst other writers are curtailed by acts of mindless violence, Goodkind has shown that he is not under any such restrictions.This book shifts away - to some extent - from what Goodkind previously wrote but is, for all of that, a masterpiece still, dealing with the most profound of subjects and exploring the diverse facets of humanity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Family Guy Chicken got nothing on Me","review":"OMG, OMG, this is incredible writing, OMG:\\"Hissing, hackles lifting, the chicken's head rose. Kahlan pulled back. Its claws digging into stiff dead flesh, the chicken slowly turned to face her. It cocked its head, making its comb flop, its wattles sway. \\"Shoo,\\" Kahlan heard herself whisper. There wasn't enough light, and besides, the side of its beak was covered with gore, so she couldn't tell if it had the dark spot, But she didn't need to see it. \\"Dear spirits, help me,\\" she prayed under her breath. The bird let out a slow chicken cackle. It sounded like a chicken, but in her heart she knew it wasn't. In that instant, she completely understood the concept of a chicken that was not a chicken. This looked like a chicken, like most of the Mud People's chickens. But this was no chicken. This was evil manifest.\\"I kid you not, I've not seen such a diabolically evil chicken since Family Guy. kudos to Goodkind"},{"rating":"1","title":"Meandering babble","review":"I've thoroughly enjoyed this series but this, the 5th in the series, was a mess for me.

The main characters being cut off from either one another or thier power is the plot line of each of these books after the first. I found myself skipping through this book in a way that reminded me of why I stopped reading Stephen King. Goodkind keeps making references to the first books and explaining them as if any of us would start reading a fantasy novel at the 5th book. I know my fantasy brothers well enough to know that it's book one or nothing.....anything else would leave you confused. Kahlan is starting to get so tetchy that I'm begining to wish she actually did get her head cut off.(see I know I don't have to explain that sentence, because if your reading this review I know you've probably already read the book I'm refering to) I'm giving book six a chance anyway and if I'm still dissapointed then I'm through with Goodkind..."},{"rating":"1","title":"This isnt the end to the series is it?","review":"TSOF was a good read, but its nothing compared to hi other books, this book was kind of dull, but im sure his next book will rock, the order are in the midlands, zedd will teach richard, hopefully the next book will be nothing but blood and magic :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"As Good as the Prior Books","review":"Soul of Fire keeps with Goodkind's style and skill.

I may (or maybe not :-) wait for the paperback next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was a mojor dissapointment for readers.","review":"I think the first two books of the series were the best. I thought Blood of the fold was O.K...and Temple of the Winds was not too bad. But this book was terrible. The book had no action in it. I found myself flipping ahead as I read through the pages looking for an intersting part to read but never found one. And what confuses me is that the Series name is named after an object that only appears once throughout the whole novel. This was a major dissapointment indeed. I surely hope Goodkind is not running out of ideas because I think he is one of the most talented fantasy writers I know about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hopefully, this series has breathed its last...","review":"Clearly Goodkind feels he has run out of Robert Jordan's material to re-write. The first 4 books in the Sword of Truth series lacked any original thoughts or ideas, but it would be difficult to blame the convoluted and messy plot in Soul of the Fire on anyone but Goodkind. My suggestion is that he use the Sword of Truth to hack apart any further notes or manuscripts dealing with this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book in the series","review":"The book started slow, ended abruptly, I skipped most of it. Jordan's latest book is much better than Terry's one. And Jordan's latest book was mediocre. What's happening to major fantasy writers, are they getting too big for their own good, no editors? Terry I used to love reading your books, almost as much as Jordans, now I will buy paperback. This was one of the worst books I ever read, and I have read plenty of fantasy, from Jordan, to Eddings, to Salvator, to Terry Brooks etc. This book was about a killer chicken, how laughable, and characters who had nothing to do with the story! Three chimes indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to the standard set by previous books","review":"I was disappointed in the Soul of the Fire. I very much enjoyed the first two books in this series (Wizard's First Rule and Stone of Tears), which were characterized by imagination, interesting plots, and attention to detail. The second two books, while very entertaining, seemed hurried and lacked the depth and level of detail that I found appealing in the first two books.Unfortunately, the Soul of the Fire continues this downward tend. The book seems hurried and superficial. Aside from an amusing (though obvious) parallel with recent political scandals and trendy notions, this book just goes through the motions. The ending is particularly dissatisfying, arriving at a momentous change of attitude with insufficient provocation.In summary, fans would be interested, but I would not recommend the book to first time readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Guy MUST be paid by the word","review":"An amazing display of filling up the page with obtuse and obvious statements, combined with hyperbole, only to be repeated again and again and again. \\"The Mud People had much in common with them...\\" and 2 seconds later... they shared the same values...\\" and then \\"they were very similar in their dedication to protecting their people..\\" and nauseatingly detailed description of things that lend nothing to furthering the plot or character development. Clearly someone just going through the motions for a paycheck. Characters so thin ...Sorry if that sounds impolite or overly critical. Only because I am stuck in traffic and currently have nothing better to listen to (although silence is a close second) was I able to finish this disaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book stinks","review":"This book, even with the progressively worse 3rd and 4th books, was very disapointing. The plot diverts early in the book, and at the end it seems like Richard is exactly where he was at the beginning. I was looking forward to events hinted at in Temple of the Winds, and they didn't happen. Also, I feel the events have disapointing effects on future books about the Midlands. If you have to read it,(book 6 is really good), get it from a library, don't waste money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible!","review":"The first novel, Wizards first rule, was an awsome book packed with everything anyone could ask for in a book. As i read on throughout the series...well it seemed the books kept preaching and sometimes goodkind would explain things that went on for pages at a time. And Richards abilities just started to seem a little too much. He seemed to gain a whole lot of abilities like the whole additive subtractive magic a little too fast. I just have plain stopped reading the books it might sound strange but i have lost interest in them. Its the same plot over and over and over. It really let me down."},{"rating":"1","title":"LCD fantasy","review":"The number of 'reviews' on this page, and the slavering commentary, is really quite hilarious--but it is a mirth spiked with sorrow. Terry GoodKind is LCD fantasy: lowest-common-denominator clap-trap drivel that insults the intelligence but certainly appeals to those that like to read large books (\\"Wow! 800 pages!\\") that in 'truth' do little to challenge the cranium. The SOT world has shallow depth, stolen creativity, and virtually no insight into the complexities of relationships or the historic and mythological details that make up a good world. I would say that the characters come straight from a comic book or sitcom, but I've seen/read far better on puply pages and the 'eternal society screen.' And to those thousands of Goodkind fans reading this, unfurrow that brow and ungrit those teeth: this is just a viewpoint, no more, no less.

Then you remember that you WANT to finish reading because you HAVE to know how the prophecies are fulfilled.

The paragraphs are poorly written and do little to expand on what the author is actually trying to convey.The problems in the exercise set are inane and tedious with little relation to the examples given in the opening for each sub-chapter.Seriously if this is the book you are learning from drop the class or get a supplementary book to help out. Also do not even try to mark with pen or highlight in this book it shows right through the pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Unhelpful book","review":"This book does not explain itself.

Even in the student solution guide, the answers make large leaps between steps.I'll be quite happy to resell this book at the end of the semester as any college algebra book + Gelfand & Saul's Trigonometry will help you far, far more than Cohen's book ever will."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Text, all around","review":"I learned pre-calculus from this textbook, and now I've been with a youth math program that uses the book for 3 years. This pre-calc book is excellent and is the first book that was of actual use to myself when learning new material.The examples in the text are clear and helpful, which makes a world of difference with the material. The problems are also well-designed and there are several different types of problems in this book.Although the price is high and the book is fairly heavy, it is worth it. If you are taking a pre-calc class and this is the required book, rejoice. If you are taking a pre-calc class and it is not and you have problems with pre-calc material, consider getting a 3rd edition of this book (3rd, not 4th, edition -- save on money)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Textbook","review":"To be honest, I am very frustrated with this book. My biggest complaint about it is that the examples that are worked out (not explained mind you) often times have no connection to the homework problems. In fact the homework problems are always much more difficult, so the textbook doesn't prepare you for what you need to know. It is beyond me how the author thinks we can solve the homework problems, if he fails to show how they are approached in the first place. This author has no business writing textbooks and I haven't a clue why my college went with the book in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced piece of junk","review":"I was a bit hesitant to buy this and justly so. I've never received a product that was in such bad condition that I had to send it back. The two side panels were completely cracked, the wood was horribly warped and the pegs to put it together with the glue were too small for the holes. I just can't believe that this is going for $100. It is totally not worth it. I could build something myself for way less money with way more quality. Speaking of quality, the manufacturer could use some quality control."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much more attractive than the usual pet steps","review":"This looks so much better than the regular steps you see. Assembly was very easy--I must complain that the included glue was unuseable (dried out), but I was able to assemble using my own glue. The dowels seemed a little too large for the holes, and I was unable to get the steps completely flush with the risers due to this. But I consider that a minimal problem, as the assembled steps look fine and are as sturdy as they need to be. So I give it 4 stars. It looks so much better in my home than some cheapy carpeted steps. The finish is quite nice. I'm no expert in furniture assembly, and it took me about 10-15 minutes to put this together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget it....

This is a very complex game, and knowing a few basic tips/tricks can be immensely helpful. Most of the tricks I've learned came from extensive playing (it's easy to get [pulled] into this game) and message boards online - Yahoo groups, civfanatics, etc.If you have money to burn and want a comprehensive instruction manual buy this book.

Completely oblivious to personal danger, & most, in their thirst for victory, having a callous disregard for the lives & general well-being of their soldiers.

Mariah Carey is truly talentet, both at singing and writing. I think Jenny is a bomb ready to explode and in a few years she will be long gone. Im sorry but I really think so. The ballads is a joke. :-("},{"rating":"1","title":"Sappy collection of pop lovesongs....BORING!!","review":"I was SO disappointed by this cd. I love the song \\"Jenny from the Block\\"...fun, hip, danceable. I hoped there would be lots of that style....but there isn't.

However, the rest of the album is just [weak]. Are we in second grade? She just lacks the depth and singing ability for her to be doing those type of songs. \\"Dear Ben\\"...Please! It's just ridiculous how much she wants publicity with her now 3rd hubby-to-be. \\"I'm glad\\" also lacks the flow and just her voice makes it even worse. \\"Still\\" could've been a good song, but again, her voice makes it seem to be missing it. Her previous albums were good, but this one just makes it clear that Jennifer doesn't know how to sing, however, nobody has told her so because she is trying to. Ballads are just not her type, she should leave those to Whitney, Celine, and Mariah. She should stick to more RnB and Hip Hop songs. Sorry JLO, but you really hit the ultimate low with this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice....","review":"J.Lo is the best of her.... but This... I refuse myself to say about this album....

Not only is this the worst album out there but it's actually selling. Here we have a 32 year old woman who thinks she's really talented however her fan's average age is about 10. And now she has grown a lot more as an artist and explored new kind of music. Ballads. She doesn't have the voice for it. She has annoying voice. Even when she speaks she annoyes me. Please JLO do yourself a favour and be a fulltime actress becaue if you make such terrible music you will loose good roles. She is getting much worse acting roles now then before. And please stop acting like you're Liz Taylor. Please she regrets it so you should read her biography.

Most of the songs sound the same, and discuss her relationship with Ben.However the biggest let down for the album is j-lo's voice. in the past, her voice was well produced and it's weakness was well hidden, however on this album, her voice seems to be stripped and put bare into the mix. this ruins what would otherwise be acceptable songs, such as 'still' 'loving you' 'i'm glad'.YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED- get Mariah's 'charmbracelet' or Christina's 'Stripped' instead for some real quality music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please stop supporting this madness!!!J- Low gotta go!!!","review":"Her liberal use of the n- word should be enough to get her banned from mainstream pop...

Is Jennifer Lopez really THAT hated?Personally, I enjoy this CD very much! The singles (\\"Jenny From the Block,\\" \\"All I Have\\") are catchy and fun to sing along with, and the rest of the CD is good, too.Sure, there are a lot of ballads on this CD, but that's not a bad thing. Jennifer's voice really shines on \\"You Belong To Me,\\" and \\"Baby I Love You.\\"The BEST song on the CD that you may not have heard is \\"The One.\\" It's a ballad, but not TOO slow, it's relatable, and Jennifer's voice sounds nice.Overall, I think \\"This Is Me...

I am seriously not happy that I bought this album.There is a carly simon track that I really like on here, You Belong To Me, that song is about the only one I can stand.Jennifer next time you do an album make it good, don't forget that you don't have a good voice and maybe you should just stick to dance music..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not allowed to rate it 0","review":"you would think that having different writers on your album/back up singers (with better voices than the actual singer)singing most of the chorus'/ a good prodecer/ some of the best rappers on your albumn it would be a good albumn. But with THIS IS ME THEN that is NOT the case.Its a load of s#!t. she really cant sing but thinks she can. shes too overated coz shes pretty (no doubt) and seems to be in the way of the people who can really sing. i would recommend charmbracelet by mariah,love and war by jerzee monet or amerie's new one. REAL MUSIC REAL VOICES!unfortunatly she doesnt take the music seriously. she cannot be called a diva if she cant sing, do her own back up vocals, sing her own chorus; ect.

I'm Glad - Average stuff 3/54. The One - Okay, the beat was good, lyrics poor 3.5/55. Dear Ben - Nice and soft, gentle beat 4.5/56. All I Have - Nice duet with LL Cool J - 5/57. Jenny From The Block - Pretty good 4/58. Again - Very, very nice, instrumentals superb 5/59. You Belong To Me - Nice faster beat 4/510. I've Been Thinkin' - Okay, nothing special 3.5/511.

This cd will make many music fans remember Paula Abdul and think, \\"Hey she wasn't as bad as I thought.\\" People thought JLo could be the next Madonna, but to me she's not even good enough to be the next Paula Abdul.

I think her use of \\"Very Special\\" in the song is shameful.Instead of venturing out for a new sound like this in the future, the future Mrs. Ben Affleck should just stick with what works.

It is different to J.Lo's first two CDs but what's wrong with different. This is my favourite of J.Lo's CDs. I still love songs from the other albums but this album is actually quite good. The songs are a good mix of soul and r+b. All I Have, I'm Glad, and Jenny From The Block are brilliant songs. Still, Loving You, and Baby I Love U are also brilliant songs.

I think she is a talented singer, dancer, and actress. Now that I said that, I HATE this album. I love \\"Jenny\\", but all the other songs are so obviously about her trying to convince the world that she loves Ben. Well, I am happy for her, but I don't want to hear 10 songs about it. One would be plenty. The whole album is a love song to Ben and how he has changed her life- blah...blah...blah...I am all for love and happiness, but I like JLo best when she is spunky and perky-not all mushy-mushy.

The ever-catchy \\"Jenny from the block\\" is extremely dancable, while her blatantly bland \\"Glad\\" falls just short of boring. She brings a more earthy feeling to a Carly Simon classic, \\"You Belong To Me\\" and records one of her best tracks yet, the smile-inducing \\"Baby I Love You.\\" While this record isn't nearly as polished or hit-worthy as her past efforts, \\"This is me...then\\" seems to be a stepping stone to something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"ERICA HANSON IS A DUMMIE :D","review":"My girlfriend purchased this particular album and honestly I reefed it out of my car stereo after about 3 songs snapped it in two and tossed it out my driver side window, and then handed her 20 dollars for her loss.

The rest of the CD just doesn't really click. One of the worst song is \\"Dear Ben\\" which, well, I don't need to explain, just listen to it. Yeah, Jennifer Lopez needs to stick to acting. This album definitely proves that Jennifer Lopez can't sing and needs to stick to acting. The vocals here are not that impressive. Her last cd \\"J.

The whole album sounds rushed and uninspired. With each album she always has a new name, a new sound and a new boyfriend. So this is what Ben Affleck has done to her?

Given the number of producers on each track, you'd think it'd be possible to come up with one song that isn't simplistic and bad. Well, that premise would be wrong.She is still unsure of what direction to take musically and that makes her come across as some sort of artistic mish-mosh as she tries a bit of this and a bit of that. Add to this the fact she still doesn't use her voice properly (she needs to take it down a notch).\\"Jenny from the Block\\" is a hypocritical tank of a song and yet it does have a nice background beat. It's a shame she didn't more with the lyrics. No one's buying the \\"don't be fooled by the rocks that I got\\".

Whereas in her previous releases, 3 or 4 of the tracks were bearable to listen, this one has even the first single, Jenny From Da Block a nightmare to the ears. I can't believe I really bought it. Jennifer Lopez should stick to acting or dancing or whatever fits her but singing is definitely not her speciality. Oh and I almost forgot, Dear Ben is probably her worst song ever. Um, let me rephrase it, probably the worst song ever. So corny, so bad.

I recommend better albums out there like Charmbracelet from Mariah Carey & Norah Jones Come with Me. Who I feel are true artitst.. in every sense of the word. They write their songs, produce, etc..."},{"rating":"1","title":"thank god mine was a promo copy","review":"One feels obliged, in all fairness, to point out that not everything about this album is bad. I have to concede that the photos in the booklet really are very nice. As for the content of the disc itself - that's another matter. Okay, we all knew that dear Jenny couldn't sing, but that didn't prevent us from enjoying some of her earlier, uptempo fluff. On this album, though, she seems to be suffering from the misguided notion that she can sing and she's put out an album full of bland ballads to try and show it. What it does confirm, is that despite the fact that the melodic range required in the songs is miniscule, her voice is as tinny and little as we all knew already. Couple that with embarrassing 8th grade lyrics and by-the-numbers, dull arrangements and this is certifiably DOA."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was that?","review":"I dont even want to waste my time writing this, but i really loved that first single (Jenny from the block) this album is trash, J-Lo can't sing, and she needs to stick to acting. I should have just bought the single. DO NOT BUY THIS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good enough","review":"nice but somehow similar dances. ballads are the same....not so good. To evryone who wants to buy this album......THINK TWICE! or MORE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jenny Needs Some Lessons","review":"This C.D. is crap. I listened to my friend's before buying and it literally put me to sleep. Jennifer Lopez needs voice lessons, instead of being so busy bragging about \\"the rocks that she's got\\" she should be practicing her song writting skills right now. But I bet as I write this, she's hanging out with Ben, avoiding the paparazzi and whatnot. Anyway, besides her singles that are played out as for as radio play, she doesn't have much going for her with this album. I personally think she's only come this far because of her image, and nothing else. Sorry Jen, you've missed with this one. Try again next time, but AFTER the voice lessons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite what I was hoping to find...","review":"I was anticipating hearing all the songs on this CD after I heard Jenny from the Block.

Jlo is beautiful, true. But she's an abysmal singer (all her CDs are so techno-enhanced it hurts) and an extremely mediocre actress. But once again, hype can sell anything and make anyone a star. And all those who say Jlo works so hard? When people out there are willing to pay you ridiculous dollars for being completely average, it's pretty easy to look like you're working hard, because you really don't have to work as most of us define the word."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hahaha I like laughing at people who think they are talented","review":"All I have to say (for now) is that this cd is a puddle of kitten puke (heard that somewhere) and you know SOMETHING about the fact she has no musical talent must be true if 165 of her 425 reviews are 1 STAR REVIEWS. Unfortunatly the 100 reviewers who gave her (cracking up) 5 stars are being shipped off where their kind can be with the other musically impared in this world where they will meet nice people who think that Britney Spears should've won the grammy instead of Christina and that Ashanti IS in fact the successor to Aaliyah's throne & is the new Princess of hip-hop & R&B."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's this [trash]","review":"This CD is terrible on every level. There is no artful chances being taken, no substance, and no sense of style at all in any of the songs on this awful CD. What this album is just TRL-oriented hip-hop junk aimed at simple-minded suburbia kids. \\"Dear Ben\\" is sickeningly sappy to an unbearable lever. I don't mind a little sappiness from time to time but \\"Dear Ben\\" is just stomach-turning! This CD almost sounds more like a 10 year old who has a crush on someone and I can't believe that this is coming from a 30 something person. Stay far away from this album as much as possible. I haven't heard such horrid sludge in many years!"},{"rating":"1","title":"jlo stay in the block and never com back!!!!!!!","review":"no no no no no i hate this album. her voice isnt unique.ths album is practically boring and stupid. the worst...song has to be dear ben. i used to like her but not anymore she could stay on th bock for all i care."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me a break!","review":"I thought this album was BORING and SLOW! I mean, give me a break a song titled \\"Dear Ben\\" She's addicted to love and seems to fall for every guy she works with. Her voice is sounds like she's got a cold. There are no songs that are catchy or fun, they're all slow and boring. This album [slow]."},{"rating":"1","title":"There should be a new title for this CD","review":"This new and most anticipated CD of Jennifer Lopez' should have a new name...let's call it \\"THIS IS ME....WITH BEN\\" This is a collection of slow love songs...which painfully shows just how weak her vocals are...she should stick with \\"Jenny from the Block\\" type hits...and steer away from ballads...which is what this entire CD is made up of...there are 12 songs on this CD...and only one decent track...not worth the Money at all...there is nothing to dance to and certainly nothing to clean your house to..."},{"rating":"2","title":"First there was Vanity, then Apollonia, Now there's Jenny!!!","review":"Beautiful pictures inside cd, listenable music. If anyone is still buying the [poor] music that pop legend Madonna is still putting out, then they should definitely pick up this one! J. Lo sings to her vocal capabilites. Of course her voice is not as strong as Patti Labelle, Mariah, Whitney or Brandy, but she's not trying to emulate them! Great dance tunes and balads just like her previous releases! Thanks, J.Lo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not The Best But HOT!","review":"Hey I love Jennifer Lopez's new cd This is me... Then.

Go cop the awesome new jennifer lopez album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmm...","review":"I really like Jennifer Lopez, but I don't see any originality in this new album. She samples so much of other people's music throughout the CD. I'd like to hear more of her own style. Does she have her own style?"},{"rating":"2","title":"It could of been better","review":"This Jennifer Lopez CD, is more melow then her past CDs. Most of her songs were talking about love and it got kinda boring. I think that CD could have been better and she needs to rock out a little more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not that bad","review":"I have always liked Jennifer and still do today. Most people say her 3rd album is all ballads. Well thats partially true. (#1) Still- is a song to get you moving right from the start. (#2) Loving you- Is pretty good but gets old. I'm Glad is another song similar to STILL. The One is another soft track but has beat to it- Dear Ben is alright but has childish lyrics like \\"I love you your perfect\\" But does use some more advanced words \\"manifestation\\" and \\"infedelity\\". All I Have is alright but the girl is a little annoying. Jenny From The Block is the strongest track on the album. You all have heard it. Again (#8) is probably the most beautiful ballad she has on this album. \\"You belong to me\\" is a get up track like #7. But not as strong. #'s 10 and 11 are Ok. \\"The One\\" Version 2 is Ok just has different lyrics than the original version. She has pretty lame lyrics that she used on On the 6 and J. Lo . I hope another remix album comes out because she really needs to Spice this thing UP!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WORTH MY TIME","review":"I just finnished downloading the whole album, and I need to say i'm glad that i didnt spen any money on this one.

Sorry jennifer Im a fan of yours.......all i can say is that......better act. You cant sing baby. You cant be Mariah or whitney. the dances are nice but some of them are alike somehow.....while her ballads.......! Ballads are not your line. Just focus on latin dance songs! ... :( I regret buying this Cd!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Childs Play","review":"Is she kidding us with these lyrics? It sounds as though a seventh grader wrote them while daydreaming in class!! From I'm Glad to Baby I love you she drones on and on with mind numbing lyrics and a mediocre singing voice. She should get back with Puff, at least then her songs were a little more interesting!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jennifer Can't Sing","review":"I bought this Album because it was a top seller. Unfortunately people have been wasting their money on junk. I wasn't sure wether it was a dog, cat or a human being singing. Not only are the vocals hideous, but the lyrics were very elementary. What educational background does JLO have. She didn't complete high school or what. This Album is ghetto. I strongly believe Epic should terminate her contract. Epic has brought us very talented and creative artists in the past. I strongly believe Jennifer Lopez is a failure and dissapointment. If you are considering buying this album I urge you not to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Work from JLO!","review":"I actually like this album. I think it has some very mellow & sweet tracks on it and jlo does a good job of holding it down. I have rated the songs from 1 being the worst to 10 being the best.

Pinched coloratura- strained above the passaigo, to sum it up: tortured, twisted, abused and resigned vocals."},{"rating":"1","title":"When is she going to give up?","review":"Geez, how can anyone find any of her songs good?! I got tired of hearing \\"Jenny from the block\\" on the radio every two seconds so why should I buy the album? Thankfully, her trick of getting #1's (i.e. collaborating with Mariah Carey's rappers) has tired out so now everyone sees what an untalented 'singer' she is: the third single, \\"I'm Glad\\" and the new one, \\"Baby I love you\\" both flopped miserably. And rightly so. Let's just hope all her poor victims will wake up in time and won't buy her next album. If you wanna hear how a REAL singer sounds, pick up Mariah Carey's Greatest Hits, you can't go wrong there.P.S. even her new film with Ben Affleck, \\"Giggling\\", flopped at the box-office."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jenny, please go back to the block","review":"Oh my God, I can't believe I wasted my time listening to this album. Did she go crazy or something? Her second album had some good songs but this album is trash. She's beautiful and a good actress but when it comes to music, I hope she retires."},{"rating":"1","title":"No talent You know what","review":"After hearing her sing, I've decided that I'd rather listen to fingernails running down a blackboard. If she were starting out on \\"American Idol\\" she wouldn't even have made it in the first auditions. All she has is a bunch of hype clowns who try to turn a punk kid from the back alleys into some kind of glamor girl--she's not. Her acting in movies is just as bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better off on the Big Screen","review":"Jennifer Lopez is a fine and talented woman and there is no question about that...the problem with her music career is that she tries to cater to every audience at the snap of her finger. It just doesn't work that way..This album is like her last album to me...she tries to please her ricans, BET and MTV and it comes out confused. Yeah, Styles and Jadakiss sound good on her lead single \\"Jenny from the Block\\" but the video looks as if she still wants to show that there is life after Puffy....who cares..Jennifer Lopez should concentrate more on her acting career and leave the music to more focused artist..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait before buying--people will be returning their copies!","review":"I liked her previous CDs because they were light-hearted and fun... Someone fooled Jennifer into thinking she was a \\"serious artist\\" able to belt out a ballad--WRONG! The only reason Jennifer even had a somewhat successful singing career is because she sang silly tunes you could sing along to on the radio. She had Latin-pop, dance tracks, and some R&B; influenced tunes. But with this CD she tries to sing slower songs and the results are horrible. She has a very, very unpleasant voice and her lyrics are laughable. When she's not talking about how \\"real\\" she is, she's going on and on about Ben. *Snore*Either you have the goods or you do not, and now that I hear how she really sounds without all the studio trickery, I know she DOES NOT HAVE WHAT IT TAKES TO BE A REAL SINGER. This CD is awful and I will be taking it back for a full refund! So, if you want to buy it, just wait and pick it up used."},{"rating":"1","title":"Latin Spice","review":"I have always had a weakness for the J Lo. Bought 'On the 6', cuz \\"Waiting For Tonight\\" was a great song to look at yourself in the mirror to while getting ready. Even 'J Lo' had great pop nuggets like 'Play' and 'Ain't It Funny\\" , cheesy fun. The Remix album, i thought was a bit of a stretch, but we all know those Ja Rule songs were manipulatively charming. 'This Is Me...Then' is not good. 'Loving You' and Jenny From The Block' is the best the album has to offer, only because it downplays Ms. L-O's vocals. The woman can't sing. This reminds me of how bad we thought all of the Spice Girls (the one's who cant sing...4 out of 5, i think it is) solo albums were gonna be. My advice for Jenny Lo-Lo: if u wanna be a somewhat respected musician, just release a few singles. No album. I feel sorry for her when i hear her try to hit the high notes. We all do. Fingers crossed for 'Maid In Manhatten\\". Sorry Lo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to dancing...and learn how to be a wife","review":"This album is definitely a collection of mushy tunes, that come off as unexperienced as her vocal talents. It seems her view on love is blurred into her songs, in turn making them as unrealistic as her marriages. She should call her next album \\"true to myself\\", because she really needs to be in order to rise up from her unrealistic approach as a musical artist.The album also samples without crediting the source, her catchy beat which holds her \\"Jenny on the Block\\" song together, comes from the group, \\"Beatnuts\\", from their hit song, \\"Watch out now\\". Shame on you J.LO...Good Luck Ben!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jennifer's Bomb","review":"I have to say I was quite disappointed in this cd. There are no latin style songs. She has a forgotten her latin background. There are some good songs on this album like I belong to you a remake of the Carly Simon song. If you like R&B than you will probally like this cd. If you are a dance fan you won't like this at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This sucks","review":"This is the most pathetic attempt i have ever heard, if i didnt have to give it at least one star i wouldnt. i cant believe i wasted money buying this piece of s**t. Her voice sounds so pathetic on this cd and it is nothing like JLO, which i thought was really good because of all the up-beat tracks. This album only has about 3 good songs on it, Jenny from the block(but the lyrics are so up herself!, and it was way overplayed) Im Glad, and All I Have. Dear Ben made me sick. I dont recommend this album to anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I like J. Lo but...zzzzzz.....","review":"It's not that this is that bad, it is that it is so catastrophically boring. She has eschewed the dance-latin-pop vibe that had an irresistible ...-shaking quality to it, for an impossibly bland, mid-tempo sound.The worst thing about this album is that when you try to hum or recall the tunes afterwards, you will most likely end up humming a different song done by somebody else. These are too generic.\\"On The 6\\" and \\"J. Lo\\" are much better, with much more personality, and some catchier-than-hell tunes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jenny Jumps The Shark!","review":"I will admit i have been amused by these reviews! A few comments: 1) Didn't Mary J. or someone already use the \\"You Are Everything\\" notes in a song? 2) While \\"You Belong To Me\\" is a good choice, what is with the dog yelping sounds on it? Yucky. 3) A song like \\"Still\\" is really a good pop song, but I agree that her voice just starts to grate. 4) What was she thinking with \\"Baby I Love You\\"? Did anyone have the nerve to tell her she can't really pull that off? At least put some more reverb on that voice.Oy, Miss Lo. Start again. 2 stars and I'm generous."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great CD!","review":"No matter what people say about this cd, I think that this is a great JLO cd. Her other cds were great and this cd ranks with them. I think that this cd is very personal and the best song on there is \\"Jenny From The Block\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Pathetic 10 Tracks.....And Boring","review":"I thought Jenny from the Block was her worst single yet, but listening to the whole album, it sadly is probably the best single. The whole album is very slow and very boring. Her ballads are not powerful, since she doesn't have the pipes to pull them off. \\"The One\\" is okay and she will probably release it for a single. Jennifer...next time spend a little more time and effort instead of rushing the album out to hit at a time with all your publicity and new movie! This is her worst album yet, and one of the worst that I have bought. Don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Carolina From The Block!","review":"first that everything is Jennifer's faithful follower, their music I like this album that I find the best, much especially it is not the one better than had taken out but of all it is the one that I have liked but not for their quality, but because it falls in love me of the song Jenny from The Block, I also find super a girl talented and that she has good ideas, I hope doesn't fail quick in the music's field, since in the cinema she already made it with her Gigli, the only bad is that to be had married with Marc Anthony that is super Horrible. but good this doesn't have anything to see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slightly Biased","review":"I admit my review of this CD might be a little bit generous because I am a hardcore Jen fan.I enjoy all her music, because it sounds really sweet to me and sometimes I just need a break from the hardcore rap stuff. This CD was pretty relaxing and enjoyable. Although I must admit the Dear Ben song was pretty cheesy and not very good at all (and quite obsolete considering she is married to Marc), I liked the rest of the songs. Her major hits like Jenny From the Block, I'm Glad and Baby I Love You are all included on this CD. Not the most vocally impressive CD, but nevertheless very sweet. You are THE BEST Jennifer!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What Was Up With This CD?","review":"This Was Me...Then...just a sappy love sick high schooler, or so it would seem.

It's nauseating."},{"rating":"1","title":"J. Lo's version of Glitter","review":"This is a poor album for Lopez. She doesn't really show any strengths in her voice or most of her lyrics on the album. All I have with LL cool J is a catchy song, but without the rap it may not have been that good.This album also has no dance tracks like Lopez's last two albums, making this album considerably different.

It has good lyrics with a catchy beat other than that I'm glad that it was borrowed from a friend (who was trying to pawn it off on me) because this cd would have been a HUGE waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad...very bad...","review":"I am very disappointed with this CD. I bought it thinking it would be like all of the others (upbeat dance music). It is nothing of the sort. I agree with the others when they said that \\"Jenny from the Block\\" was misleading. This is the only dance song on the CD. If you want to buy a CD full of sappy love songs, then buy this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"I don't recommend it, save your money. I love J Lo's first album. The second album only had 3 good songs. And now the 3rd album, all songs suck except \\"Jenny from the BLock' and the one w/ LL Cool J. Majority of the songs sampled and all but one song are slow love jams. I love slow jams, especially Mariah's, but J Lo's voice, beat and lyrics are soo weak, the songs sound boring and syrupy. All the songs sound the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album should sell low","review":"Well based on her record sales which are from Soundscan:On the 6Records sold in the US: 3.2 millionRecords sold globally: 6.0 millionWith singles globally: 9.0 millionJ.LoRecords sold in the US: 3.3 millionRecords sold globally: 6.2 millionWith singles globally: 9.1 millionRemixesRecords sold in the US: 1.4 millionRecords sold globally: 2.5 millionWith singles globally: 3.1 millionJ.Lo has sold 22.2 million albums and singles in three albums.This is me then is a horrible album she sings really annoying everytime I hear her doing a note I have a seisure thats how bad It really is.Unlike Mariah , Whitney or Toni women with true talent I have chills when the hit notes.Anyways this album is really, really bad Jenny From the block is the only I mean only catchy song on the album everything else is ear shattering."},{"rating":"1","title":"J.[L]O CANNOT SING!.","review":"THIS ALBUM IS AWFUL!

THIS ALBUM PROVE THIS."},{"rating":"1","title":"ABYSMAL THIRD EFFORT FROM J.LO","review":"I never thought she had the strongest voice, but at least Jennifer Lopez had catchy material and, of late, street-cred in the form of an urban reinvention.However, this album proves to be both a musical and career setback for Ms. Lopez. Her voice is shrill and bland in many of the songs. Of course, it wouldn't have mattered much if the songs themselves were any good. Bland, 70s' -inspired R&B production on boring, unmemorable tunes. The whole thing feels rushed, uninspired, and unfun. Only her collaboration with LL Cool J, and the current JENNY FROM THE BLOCK are noteworthy.Dont trust me? You'll see what I'm saying when the very first track plays..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get bored with the only rythm in","review":"This new album is more of J.Lo's rap, hip-hop, R&B style. All her songs are basically the same boring tempo and rythm. If you are expecting house music, freestyle or, even, latin music in this album, this is not the one. I have to wait one more year to see more of her latin and freestyle (house) music style. \\"Still\\", \\"I am glad\\" and \\"the one\\" are okay, but all songs sound the same. There is no variation in her songs, probably only in \\"Jenny from the block.\\" I think this is not the best album of J.Lo. All her fans, like me, expect some house, freestyle, and latin music in all of her albums. I hope she thinks to make an album of her real latin roots or nuyorikan style like Lisa Lisa, Safire, Brenda K. Starr, The Cover Girls and much more. That was definitevely an era of freestyle puertorrican divas. As I said, wait one more year!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"this is me then titled just plain OK","review":"the album has no new feel to it it feels like just any other j-lo album and all together is not that great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Same Repetitive Crap","review":"I'm going to keep this review short and sweet.

I am not joking this is the worst CD that I have EVER bought in my whole life. Now, I have to look for a second hand CD shop and who knows how much money can I get back for it. I was waiting a whole year for this CD...what a waste of time and money. I think that her glamorous life is affecting her few talent and skills. J.Lo, de verdad que estoy muy decepcionado con este CD y con la musica y dedicacion a tu Ben. Hay muchas mas y mejores cosas en las que puedes inspirarte para componer tu musica. Este CD es simplemente aburrido y muy malo y les recomiendo a todos que no gasten su plata en este CD. I am from the Bronx, but what you show in your Jenny from the block video clip is nothing to do with the Bronx. Are you alright?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jennifer to Ben","review":"This CD is all about Ben Ben Ben. As she had also written at the end of the disk. All songs are fair, and is mixed with a variety of songs' abstracts, for examples, \\"You Are Everything\\" in \\"The One\\" and \\"Hi Jack\\" in \\"Jenny From The Block\\". I am sure that the song \\"The One\\" is Jenny's favourite because she did another version of it which included the lyrics from \\"You Are Everything\\". Honestly, the song \\"Dear Ben\\" is awful, it is practically not a song. It is sweet and sensual simply because it is for Ben. This is the first time Jenny shout her love out so publicly and so sweetly. I think they will be together. Ben's a lucky guy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good =)","review":"I expected more from this album, but it is actually pretty good. If you enjoy slow/R&B/Pop songs then..this is perfect for you.

But she has deliver some pretty good tracks that you dance to and j lo is her best album yet. But this one doesnt even have a glimpse at being good.

But other then that music lovers or guys if you love jlo for her body dont buy this record because you gonna come to hate it !!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jennifer's 4th album rocks!","review":"Okay. all you people think that \\"This is me...Then\\" stinks. well you are all wrong despite the song \\"Dear Ben\\" is boring, it shows J.Lo's pasion for actor Ben Affleck. Jenny from the block is still a #1 hit in my opinion. This C.D. also has a bonus \\"The One\\" after track 11 on the C.D. I recommend this C.D. to all audiences, it has no \\"Explict Language.\\" So save up your money and buy this album. Don't listen to what other people say about \\"wasting your money.\\" Believe me you want this C.D. And if your a hugh Jennifer Lopez fan, (Like me!) get this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely nowhere close to the album \\"JLo\\"","review":"When I bought her album \\"JLo\\", I fell in love with it! Then she released \\"This Is Me...Then\\", and I expected similar to \\"JLo\\". It came nothing close. The entire CD, with the acception of three tracks, are all samples of other songs. Therefore, almost the whole CD is really not her own. That doesn't really impress me much. The only two catchy tracks are \\"Jenny From the Block\\" and \\"I'm Glad\\". \\"All I Have\\" with LL Cool J got very sickening after about two weeks on the radio. I'd prefer to watch her on \\"The Cell\\" or \\"Selena\\" over this album. I think the only reason this album is such a success is because of the millions of dollars she has. This success is very much NOT deserved."},{"rating":"1","title":"0 STAR ACTUALLY","review":"AN UGLY WOMAN WHO CANNOT SING NOR ACT. I FEEL SORRY FOR HER.

Lo and This Is Me...Then are CRAP! Why is she trying SOOOO hard to shove down the planet's throat that she's 'real'? Jesus Christ.....first the original \\"I'm Real,\\" then a remix, THEN she friggin tells us again in Jenny From The Block. Someone trying so hard to say they're real is obviously NOT. J. Lo, you should do a song called \\"I'm Not Real.\\" That would be far more accurate. You're just a figment of the music world's imagination, and nothing more. You're a puppet. You're a fake. The last thing you are is 'real.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"The definition of narcissism","review":"So if \\"Jenny From The Block\\" is so \\"real,\\" as she repeatedly insists on album after album, why does she have to throw her riches in our face (\\"don't be fooled by the rocks that I rock,\\" \\"I used to have a little now I have a lot\\") before letting us know how \\"real\\" she is? Give me a break. A real woman, with class, would never throw her riches in her audiences' faces. It just shows how low these lyrics are. A superstar like J Lo could surely hire a person with brains to write these songs. And she needs to quite trying to sing R&B (and rely on tired, used up samples)! One of the few highlights on this album is her remake of Carly Simon's \\"You Belong To Me,\\" which is in her range, and she really pulls it off. J Lo, my dear, take a hint, there's nothing wrong with not singing R&B, just sing good songs in your range and stop singing about how rich you are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Be Fooled By The Cover,This Album Sucks @$$!!!","review":"I'm starting to like Jennifer Lopez,because her On The 6 album was koooo.This album is not kooo.Mostly because her voice is not that strong.Songs like Still,I'm Glad,and All I Have deserve a better singer to sing it.And by the way is All I Have a remake or something because I heard another song that had the same chorus?Anyway,songs like Jenny From The Block and Dear Ben make this album a filler!Jennifer's first album wasn't horrible like This is Me...Then and Rebirth.Speaking of which,both the album art for Rebirth and this one make you think that the album has something good in it.But it's just to get attention!Buy \\"On the 6\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is me....after lissenin to this wreck","review":"OK.I got to admit i sorta like jenny from the block.BUT that was it. This whack singer sound like a dying chipmunk.I am also upset that Jadakiss and Styles P. ain't get longer verses,(40 seconds combined for both verses) because even tho they were short as hell, to me (since they are both 2 of my fav. rappers)they kept this song from going BYE BYE. Stick to acting, because even if you're hit song is blowing up bigger than ur A**, after the copies are sold i think this will get less than 3 stars i has at the moment.GET A TLC ALBUM, They Have Talent.( rest in peace to Lisa Lopes)1 luv yooh one more thing. If You make a song called Jenny from the Block wouldn't you,considering you do come from the Bronx, shoot the video in the Bronx, OR ATLEAST NEW YORK, instead of L.A(no offense to L.A, but i hope u no what i mean) i dont get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it!","review":"I love JLo's movies and loved her JLo CD and her remix CD but I totally hated this album. I bought it thinking it would be a good CD and after listening to it once I realized it was a waste of money. I should have listened to it before I bought it. She really disappointed me. The only good song in her album is her first single Jenny From the Block. The other songs [are bad]. Mostly because she CAN'T sing! She's doing songs that only people like Mariah Carey, Toni Braxton or Whitney Houston could do. These are ballads for singers with good voices. J-lo doesn't have an amazing voice like those other singers. She does good with songs like It Ain't Funny, Jenny From the Block, Play, but not with ballads. I'm gonna sell my copy on ebay because it's not worth my money. I expected better from Jennifer. If you are thinking of buying this CD DON'T! Instead get Mariah's Charmbracelet, that's a great album!

Lo should stick to acting (and leave it at that please)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good thing this is her then...","review":"...if it were her now...I'd be forced to shoot myself for every listening to her music. There is ONE track on this WHOLE CD worth listening to, 'Jenny from the Block'. Even then, it's all, 'I'M FROM THE BRONNNNNXXXXXX and YOU'RE NOOOOOOOOTTTTTT!'. All the songs are super slow ballads only worthy of Mariah Carey. ((Who's new CD is WAAAY better than this)) These ballads have reeeallly lovey-dovey titles like 'Dear Ben' and 'Baby, I Love You' that make you want to hurl at the mention of the songs. The lyrics are the worst. It sounds like she uses whatever words rhyme, throws them all into a blender, and out came this. 3 minute long ballads with a 2 minute musical intro.

Negative stars maybe?))"},{"rating":"1","title":"Perfect album for self-masochist","review":"If you consider yourself one who enjoys self-abuse, or even the abuse of others, then this is the album for you. Few other works are able to reach this plateau. Yoko Ono did it, and now J.

Wait for the remix cd of it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Weak","review":"Jennifer Lopez's a good actress and have some charisma. She's also beautiful. But nothing more. It's so offensive the fact that she's been called a Mariah Carey's rival. Tommy Mottola can try, but Jennifer will never be a new Mariah. \\"Jenny From The Block\\", the lead single from the album, is a radio-friendly but a weak hip hop song. The ballads only shows even more her weakness as a singer. The fact is that Lopez's isn't original, unlike Madonna or Mariah, she's only making what has been done.Jennifer Lopez needs more attitude. Lopez's growing but far from greatness."},{"rating":"1","title":"THAT'S ALL? UGH! (Good Luck with your...next album?)","review":"Oh! That's all? Seems Jennifer have done everything she can do.

Maybe its one of those cd's where I need to listen to it more, but it is very \\"love\\" oriented not much of what her fans love about her. She says this is for us, but I can honestly say after buying everything else she has done, this is not for me at all. I guess its nice to just \\"chill\\" with, but I am very very surprised/disappointed with this cd.

THis CD is full of weak songs, trying to be 70's but ending up as garbage.Even the videos here are getting cheaper. After I'm Glad, maybe JLo thought \\"gosh, no ones liking this CD, the video for my next single should be shot cheaply so i won't lose to much money\\" so with that, her Baby I luv You video was like a stupid video showing JLo having an epilepsy attack on the bed.After a CRAP album, there came the CRAP stink bomb movie GIGLI.

Her remake of Baby I Love You is the worst track on the album and I often skip that. On ballads, the only decent track is only AGAIN which I really like the piano solo. Most of the songs in here doesn't sounds like JLO cuz her vocal in here is plain and monotonous and most of em are crappy love songs.The good thing on this album is that JLO actually writes her own lyric. All of us didn't know that JLO could actually write a song.. LOL!! \\"This Is Me... Then\\" is Ain't Real and It's Funny and LOVE DO COST A THING and that's a really awful album.

For some reason she has been marketed as a musical diva, in the same category as Shania Twain, Whitney Houston and Mariah but those women all have one thing going for them...THEY CAN SING! Songs such as Dear Ben, I've been thinking and Again only show her mouse like range. What has gotten her career so far in music is her hooks,those catchy little sing song chorus' attached to her awful singing are just mind stickers. One thing J.Lo needs to do is take time out from the media and take some singing lessons or at least study some Minnie Ripperton some more, its obvious she listens to her after all she cribed the entire album from her style.

What a dissapointment! Jennifer Lopez being Jennifer Lopez, I thought she would release a better CD. There is no way to distinguish one song from another since they all sound pretty much the same (with the exception of Jenny From the Block and All I Have). YOu would have thought she would have better songs to put on the album! If all her albums will sound like this, then she should just stick ot acting.Anyway, if you're debating whether to buy this or not, listen to the clips available on her website and here and then make up your mind.

But she is in the top 10 since her album drop. She and Shania are examples of what's wrong with the music industry. You put a pretty girl with a weak voice to sing third grade material, but get a great producer to put the tracks over the top. Of course it doesn't hurt to show how \\"sexy\\" you are in your videos and pictures. What's even worst is neither J.Lo or Shania cares about growing as artists. They both have other agendas for their music. Its a shame that the generation after me, will never know what \\"real\\" music is when there's J.Lo and Stankia (Shania) running around and thinking they are hot stuff. Avoid this trash and then burn it."},{"rating":"1","title":"she's trying to be mariah","review":"jennifer lopez is trying to be mariah , using rappers in her songs, the ONLY PROBLEM ABOUT HER IS THAT SHE CAN'T SING and obviously mariah songs are a lot better and she is a writter, a producer and an AMAZING SINGER."},{"rating":"2","title":"Her best album yet!","review":"I like this album cause JLo isn't trying to be someone she's not.

I can't believe she went this route with her new CD. I wish I had known what the CD was like before I bought it. I hope she can recover from this one. She'll turn into a has-been with lyrics like these. Don't do it to yourself JLo. I hope life with Ben isn't making you boring. JLO, get in touch with Puff before you make your next CD.

There are probably three songs on the album that I listen the whole way through on, but I find myself hitting the \\"skip\\" button more than I thought I would be.

The highlights of this album is the first single Jenny From The Block, the beautiful love song Dear Ben, written of course, for her fiance; Again and The One."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much different than past albums...","review":"and that is why I really enjoy the tracks on this CD.

You might not be able to notice it that much though since most of the singing is from backup singers. Miss Lopez is definitely not someone who should be singing slow love songs. The two singles that are already played out on the radio are the only tracks worth listening to. During every other song I just sat there and waited for an exciting break from the droning, maybe an actual chorus or a guest singer. But nothing. The word nothing basically sums up the entire album.

The intensity of Barbra Streisand, the soulfulness of Aretha Franklin and the cool breathiness of Billie Holliday rolled into one. Jennifer writes all her music and delivers her songs with nothing but class.\\"Don't be fooled by the rocks that I've got, I'm just, I'm just Jenny From The Block\\", these are lyrics that Bob Dylan and Joni Mitchell can only dream of writing.From this album alone, there is no denying Jennifer Lopez won't be in the Hall of Fame someday.

Basically songs that you can dance too. Well, there aren't many any of those on this cd. She's changed her style but isn't that what most artists do anyway? Still this cd is good. There are a couple of bad songs such as DEAR BEN, YOU BELONG TO ME, and BABY I LOVE YOU. The other songs are great. My favorites would have to be AGAIN, ALL I HAVE (feat. LL COOL J), and LOVING YOU. This is a MUST for any J.Lo fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing great","review":"I was pretty disappointed by this album, 'cause it lacks the beat and soul that J.Lo used to have in her other albums.She's trying to sing too many love songs and it doesn't really suit her. She's got a song 'Dear Ben' for her new fiance, but apart from that, none of the love songs have any meaning. The only good song is her duo with LL Cool J 'All I Have'. Even this song isn't anything great, but it's the best one on the album. All of them are too slow and you don't even know when one changes to the next; they're all too similar. I think she's in a really lovey-dovey mood 'cause of dear Ben, but she shouldn't let that ruin her album like this.She says the same things in all the songs and it gets really boring...."},{"rating":"1","title":"From the Block??............Im Sure.","review":"Jennifer Lopez is best left to the dancefloor. She does not posess the vocal range to pull off alot of these songs which about 70% are ballads, and 3rd-rate ones at that. Another thing is the irony in songs like the first single \\"Jenny From The Block\\" ......Don't be fooled by these rocks that I got/Im Still Jenny From the Block/I used to have a little/Now I have alot/No matter where I go I know where I came from.......Oh yeah THIS coming from a women who reportivily only baths in purified imported mineral water! Jennifer Lopez you are HIGH SOCIETY!! Nowadays you've got about just as much in common with the average Bronx NewYorkian as Barbara Streisand does with Manson & Tool fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"She should go back to Then!","review":"This cd is pure [junk]. I usually give cd's two or three run throughs to pick up on the song beats and riffs that I didn't catch the first time. But on the 5th time through, I haven't found one song worthy of any acclaim. Dear Ben - has to be the worst song on the cd - did JLo pen this herself? She should just sing and not write! In all honesty I am having a hard time finding who wrote any of the songs... I wouldn't claim them either. There are no dance beats just poorly written ballads. Jenny From the Block is by way an expression of this cd. And if she really still believes that she was from the block, she wouldn't have to keep saying it, she would show it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah","review":"This CD is quite boring. With the exception of Jenny From the Block, there is not a single upbeat song on it. Its full of ballads and they aren't very good ones either. They all sound the same and have the same beat. Her other CD was much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"You have got to kidding.","review":"I was trapped in a soccer mom van for half an hour while they insisted on playing this CD. I thought I was going to be sick. All of her lyrics are about HER and what she has. With all the problems in the world does she really think anybody cares about her Cartier watch or what she drives? She really needs to get over herself.There is absolutely nothing on the this CD of *any* substance. The lyrics are elementary and the beats are played out. No new ground is broken here, but when was she ever a ground breaking artist?Anybody hear the new singles by Kelly Rowlands, Christina Aguillera and Pink? Those songs are actually about something and have a message."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is very pathetic.......","review":"It's really sad when artists like Jennifer Lopez put out records that don't have any quality just to sell and make more money! Let's face it, Jennifer has mediocre talent and she just uses other artists to get what she wants! Jennifer's voice is appauling to say the least....her voice has no strength or versatility whatsoever, yet she has the nerves to sing and put out records? Her voice practically ruins any song she sings! This new album truly showcases how bad her voice is, especially when she's singing dreadful ballads such as \\"Dear Ben\\". Most of the albums other cut's are just the same over-produced fluff she's known for! It's a disgrace that her record company even keep releasing any of her material to the public! Jennifer is just pure \\"show\\". She uses her body and image to sell her records and movies! Fortunately, more and more people are starting to realize that J-Lo ain't REAL!"},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"There are no fast songs on this album what so ever.....except jenny from the block--which is just a dumb song to begin with.

This may be true. But in this case mature translates to boring. There are not more than three songs on this entire album, worth listening to more than once. In fact, even the singles that she has realeased from this album, aren't that great. Possibly the best track on this album would have to be \\"The One\\", and truthfully, the bonus track \\"The One Version 2\\" is actually better. Her duet with L.L. Cool J, \\"All I have\\" is an all around great song. Nice vocals, Ok lyrics, and the rapping is pretty great. But all in all, this album just can't hold my attention for more than five minutes at a time. Her voice leaves something to be desired, and her writing skills are deffinitely lacking. I certantly hope, Mrs. Jennifer Aflec, goes back to her Latin/hip-hop roots on her next album."},{"rating":"1","title":"when life imitates the very worst of art...","review":"Is it only me or has anyone else noticed that Jenny from the Block is J.Lo's version of Eva Peron's Don't Cry for me Argentina? You know: \\"And as for fortune, and as for fame, I never invited them in, though it seemed to the world they were all I desired?\\"There is, however, a BIG difference. Webber's dreck is tinged with irony. J LO wants us to take her seriously as she parades around in high heels and a thong repeating her mantra. She even exploits her new relationship for more press.You, the consumer: Don't you deserve better than this ?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Please","review":"Nothing phony! I'm Real! huh. Pity we cant say the same about her voice. Who does she think she is! She struts her stuff as if she is the best at what she does, but the truth of the matter is she cant sing. Most of the songs are slow which is a bad turn with a (mainly edited) voice like hers. The best song on the album is the JENNY FROM THE BLOCK which happens to be the autobiogrhical single that she didnt write.Its a shock to me that someone so talentless would have a record deal in the first place.

First of all, She CAN NOT SING IF HER LIFE DEPENDED ON IT. Anyone who says otherwise is a complete fool. I would love to see her perform any song without the help of prerecorded tracks and instraments which would mask her horrible voice. I would pick the Star-Spangle Banner. Next, she has some nerve saying that she just \\"Jenny from the Block\\". Sure, you are. I guess that's why you moved your whole entourage from one hotel to another one right down the street in a fleet of limos just because P. Diddy might have stayed there. Finally, anyone who has bought any of her albums should be dragged out into the streets to be shot in the back of the head."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not talent","review":"How is it that a woman who has admitted to having a weak voice can be hailed as one of our times best singers?!? Okay, so she can sing better than say myself, but that does not mean she is a great! This just goes to show that people will listen to anything music executives throw at them. Its a shame that no talents like our \\"ghetto princess\\" here (FYI, she went to a private school...seems like Jenny only lived near the block) are taking contracts away from people who really deserve them.

All I have to ask is ...what was that?!! It was not even good or inspired, and talk about deep lyrics, \\"My pride is all I have...\\" oh just kick me instead Jennifer Lopez. \\"Still\\" and \\"Loving You\\" are just boring, as is the rest of the album. However the reason this would even get a one star rateing (even though amazon doesn't give no star ratings... shame really) would be Jenny's cover of \\"You Belong To Me\\" a Carly Simon song...

I think she wasted too much time to impress Ben. Also, the tracks sound the same and don't have depth in the lyrics. I hate her collaborations because JLO is overshowded by the other artist. She did improve on her vocals, but she still lacks the ability to impress anyone, even her hardcore fans. \\"This is Me...Then\\" was too over-rated, thus, I went out and bought the album.

Her art is more on the surface than it is deep. It is quite apparent with her on again off again relationship with Ben Affleck that she's more concerned with glitz, glamor, and making a headline than she is with content.

To sum it up, nearly everyone had early success, blown out their account, and then recovered. The revolving theme seems to be that traders need to be competitive, disciplined and have almost an obsessive drive to find a way to make it.I did find the reading to be a little more interesting near the end with some more insightful interviews.

It is a powerful work, as through her sharing of her knowledge and her experiences she encourages the readers to practice and to experience for themselves. It is through our own inner knowing that the Teachings are alive.Through our listening and living the language of the symbols and the metaphores in our daily experiences that we connect with our own power and our own connection with the Divine.

The tractors are great in this one and the addition of Lennie and the Lazers is great. The movie is a great advance in the team's animation and cinematography (not that 3-yr-olds care about that, but it makes it more enjoyable if you're an adult).

She has taken, looking at the bibliography, what seems like a huge body of work and given us a clear, concise and accessible rendering of Martinus' worldview. The spiritual principles expounded in this book not only match others I have studied; our energetic makeup, karma, reincarnation, the cycles of our lifetimes, the movement towards becoming whole, but also introduce further theories that, whilst being foreign to my previous thinking, are thought provoking and a challenge to look further and deeper.

I drop calls every few minutes and sometimes seconds while on the road. Remember, this is the third 8125 I have owned and they all do the same. I have spent hours and hours on the phone with Cingular toubleshooting. My cheap Nokia never dropped calls like this phone does. In fact, my wife could be in the car beside me talking on her cheap Nokia (she uses Cingular also) and never drop a call, while I, on my expensive 8125, contiuously drop calls.

I recently switched to the Olfa 45mm Ergonomic Rotary Cutter and there is a big difference.This Fiskars cutter has a hard handle so pushing down on it is not comfortable which makes cutting uncomfortable if you're doing it for a long period of time (like cutting pieces for a quilt).One of my biggest complaints about the Fiskars is that it \\"skips\\" when you cut. It is not a smooth cut - there will be sections of the fabric that are not cut, even after putting in a brand-new blade. So you have to go over your cut a couple of times to go all the way through the fabric (even with only one piece of fabric). This does not happen with my Olfa cutter.Overall.

The band has since found a new lead singer, but the voice of Layne (or any distinctive lead singer, really) is impossible to replace. This box set is now an excellent ride through the Staley era of Alice, including all of the singles, and many outtakes and demos.This set appeals to the hardcore fan providing the alternate takes of songs, and the unreleased stuff, and the casual fan with the singles.

This is a disappointment, Naylor seems to be softening in her age, and no longer feels the need to defend her women. These men did not need defending, in my mind they had no excuse for what they did.

In the \\"Customers who bought this DVD also bought\\" section they put Genesis-The Way We Walk Concert, some Pink Floyd's DVDs and other references of progressive rock. Amazon may mixed the info about what customers bought or the site gives such poor information about this DVD that make Genesis band fans buy something they do not want."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice but long intros","review":"The children sing very nicely but the arrangements have long musical intros that are out of character with children's singing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, few highlights","review":"While there are interesting passages showing that Miles still performed at a high level, particularly early in this set, over production and poor writing destroy what could have been a memorable effort. The reuniting of Miles Davis with John McLaughlin is never given a chance to materialize. In fact, I dont think either hardly plays a note on \\"Indigo\\", a meandering piece. There is a bit of fire on \\"Red\\" but it is short lived. It is too bad Miles allowed his name to be attached to this misplaced effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hit & Miss","review":"Been a Miles fan for years and I appreciate all periods. The last period is Miles weakest in some ways. Most albums in the last period have some brilliant stuff, after all it is Miles. This one is spotty.

At least Miles continued to search unlike some of the moldy old figs out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree with the critic from CT","review":"This is a 'production', not a jazz alubum.

I installed this on a 2004 Ford 6.0 Diesel with a single alternator. After I removed the old one I looked at them side by side. From what I can tell this is the same as the OEM Ford Belt Tensioner.

He succeeded in the latter with 90 or so pages of text ... but unfortunately, fails to provide any intelligent information though does throw in a few amusing anecdotes and cartoons.Just because a man isn't familiar with pregnancies doesn't mean he's an idiot, although the author seems to be writing for that audience. Less fluff and more facts, written intelligently and humorously is what this book purports to be. Yet the authors' only credentials seem to be that his wife had a baby and she cut Hilary Clintons hair a few times. Let her write a book...I'm sure it'd be more interesting than this.Don't waste your time on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh and learn!","review":"\\"My boys can swim\\" is a real guy's guy approach to pregnancy.

This is a must buy for everyone who is expecting."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star for the ink and paper...","review":"This book is supposed to be funny, but frankly, it is not. Additionally, it falls into the typical cliches that men don't know anything about anything when it comes to pregnancies and babies, and that somehow they are emotionally or mentally challenged in these matters.But the worse part about this book, is not even its condescendence, but rather the complete lack of in-depth information the rare times it brings up subjects of interest. The book is like 12 pages long and is read in half an hour. It's like an expensive pamphlet.

It's more like Cliff Notes for husbands - what to expect when your wife is expecting and her emotions are running wild.

I got what I was looking for with this book. However, shelling out $10 for a book that looks more like a hand out from the local clinic was not. Mr. Davis says not to fall for buying the most expensive \\"baby\\" related items as they are seldom worth the money - whoops, I already did buy buying this book. Save yourself the money, find the book at your local bookstore, buy a $2 cup of coffee, and breeze thru this \\"book\\" in 30 min or less. Don't worry about buying it - you won't look at it again after you read it once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not informative, not funny","review":"There is nothing informative or at all funny about this book. Basically, it's like someone allowed that guy in the office who thinks he's funny to write down what he would say if he were to do a stand-up comedy routine on pregnancy.

(This is our first child and, by his account, he has never even held a baby.)I read the book in about 20 minutes (not hyperbole! it's really very short). It's devoid of any practical information and--as I should have guessed by the cover--is basically a joke... and a pretty bad one at that. I'm not just putting it down because it is useless in a practical fashion, it also isn't funny to boot.Poor man Amazoned his own daddy book, The Expectant Father (?), after I harrassed him about not reading the books I bought, I guess because he thought the lady pregnancy book would make him lactate or something. I've read a lot of it & it's pretty good. It doesn't have as much information as the mother-centric pregnancy books, but bc it's addressed to fathers (and all my books are addressed to mothers) it seems easier for him to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of $10","review":"Look carefully at the details on this book before you buy.

The author pilfers from Seinfeld again when discussing passing an unwanted gift off to someone else, or what he says he likes to call \\"re-gifting\\". Yeah sure, you made that up! What is next, the \\"Formula Nazi\\" or just suggesting naming your baby Kramer? This book is nothing more than unintelligent, common sense, clich��d-filler to support a catchy title, has few laughs and even less substance. I learned more in fifth grade health class.

I bought it because I thought the humor would be great and more relatable for him but I also thought it may have some good information. Boy was I wrong. I was flipping through it and got to a chapter on birthing and one of te first things it said is \\"request the epidural right away.\\" Now, I get that this is intended to be funny but it can also lead those who are less informed to make a poor poor choice. It's not up to the husband to request the epidural and if she isn't in active labor, it can slow down the whole process and be a great disadvantage to your lady and your baby.Humor is great, but deliver it in a way that educates your readers and doesn't mislead them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I bought this for my husband and he has actually read a few pages! :) Great info and an easy reader for future daddys!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hysterical and Informative!","review":"This book is a must for newly expectant fathers.

I even paid for express shipping because I was so excited. When it arrived, I tore open the package and was crestfallen just by looking at the book. It weighs in somewhere around ten pages (exaggeration) and is much more a humor book than a real life, honest to god, book for guys who want to know about what's going on in their wife's body and mind. Don't get me wrong, the author has a good sense of humor and the book would be good for one guy to buy another as a gift, but I found it dissapointing at best and unreadable at worst. In one sentence: It was not what I was expecting."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book provides humor and realism!","review":"I bought this for my husband a few days after I found out I was pregant. He is enjoying it very much - it is quite funny and, he says, a welcome relief from skimming through my more complex manuals on pregancy. I recommend it as a lighthearted look at pregnancy - certainly not as a comprehensive guide, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bound, uneducated blog","review":"There's not a lot of meat to this book. It's a quick read, but dads-to-be are not going to get much out of it. It's basically a blog--the author has simply written about his observations during his wife's pregnancy. It's strictly \\"here's what happened with my wife ...\\" and sometimes, but not always acknowledges that some traits are case-by-case. And how did his publisher get away with having him print things like \\"I don't know why [xxx] happens ...?\\" Do a bit of research and give the answer rather than go to print with admitted ignorance in a book that is supposed to give advice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of funny, but mostly for men that don't like women.","review":"I bought this for my husband, thinking it sounded like a light hearted guide for guys. It's not - it's pretty much one long anecdote about his wife's pregnancy. I can also sum up the whole thing in one sentence: \\"Your wife will be fat, mean, and blame you for everything so tell her she's pretty and get out of the house.\\" My husband liked some parts, like to stay above the elbow during delivery since blood makes him pass out...but the rest was kind of insulting to both of us. This caters to a LOT of stereotypes that are pretty annoying. It also holds very little in the way of actual descriptions and conditions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Funny, But Not Very Informative","review":"Ian Davis writes of the pregnancy experience with a respectable amount of wit, but this book falls short on quality information that will actually help expecting fathers. In fact, to put it bluntly, I was highly unsatisfied with this \\"book.\\"If you're looking for nothing more than a light read that will take no more than an hour and a 1/2 to finish, this is your book.If you're looking for substance, try Armin Brott and Jennifer Ash's \\"The Expectant Father.\\" You'll get more milage out of your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author is obviously unhappy about his wife having a baby...","review":"I bought this book for my husband after reading some reviews on Amazon.com. According to the reviews, this sounded like a fun book. I read the book when we received it (in about 45 minutes, that's how small it is), and I was very disappointed. While the author tries to hide it with humor, he is obviously unhappy that his wife is pregnant. It's little things that give it away, like when he says if you're into the fact that your wife has gained weight and gotten bigger, then you should tell her so. You should tell her so regardless! Lie through your teeth! That is the time for an oscar-worthy performance! If you are looking for humerous advice from a guy's perspective, I highly recommend \\"She's Having a Baby - and I'm Having a Breakdown\\" by James Douglas Barron."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insulting and Uninformative","review":"I thought this book was insulting and uninformative. It not only makes fun of pregnant women, but presumes that the father is a complete idiot. The \\"Dolly Parton\\" comparisons in the first part of the book are degrading and sexist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a lot of advice, but a few laughs","review":"I have to say I was pretty disappointed in this book. While it had a few chuckles in it, the book didn't really give much in the way of quality advice or what to expect when your wife is expecting. I was more impressed with the books by Armin Brott."},{"rating":"1","title":"Asinine","review":"This is written for the most insensitive, neanderthal types of men who have no common sense whatsoever. I gave it to my partner and he couldn't believe what he was reading. I bought it at the recommendation by a friend and I am not sure if she actually read it or if she just gave it to her husband and assumed it was good. The jokes are not funny and at times offensive. If you are a father who actually thinks this writer has something worthwhile to say, please consider giving your child up for adoption."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your money or time spent reading it","review":"I bought this book for my husband thinking it would be a cute, funny read for him. It is funny in the beginning but overall ends up sounding sour and rude. The author doesn't seem to be very sensitive toward his own wife or the whole pregnancy experience. I think he tries too hard to be funny and comes off sounding like a jerk who doesn't really care. I have a very high tolerance for stupid humor but this book crosses the line. Save your money and buy something cute for your husband."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for men who never read","review":"I felt bad buying all sorts of books for myself, so I picked this one up for my husband. I couldn't believe my eyes when I actually saw him reading it! I have never seen him read anything aside from the sports section in the paper. He read it front to back in one night, laughing out loud at various points. He really seemed to enjoy it - he read several passages from it to me out loud. I liked it because it made him understand what women go through while pregnant. It was a really short book (less than a hundred pages) but nevertheless a good purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"He thought it was corny","review":"I bought this for my Daddy-to-be thinking it would be cute to stick in a funny book with all the other serious books we planned to get through before baby arrived. Initially he seemed interested and even picked it up to read the same evening I gave it to him, but soon it ended up on the bookshelf with all the other discarded and/or previously read books. I later confronted him about the book, asking if he liked it or finished it. He confessed he felt it was stupid and not worth his time. Thankfully he was still interested in the serious books, so I didn't realyl care but I would warn others that this may be a little too... I'm not even sure the word, but not worth buying and/or reading. I would suggest checking it out at your local library before purchasing."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Complaints!","review":"I got this for my husband when I found out we were expecting. He seemed to really enjoy it as a whole. He found the information really helpful. While the book is not the end all be all on info for dads to be, it was a good starting point. Since reading this book my husband has taken it upon himself to get further educated on pregnancy and labor. From the couple of pages I flipped through the book seemed pretty funny and easy to read. I think this is a great way to get a future dad involved and excited about a pregnancy!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny but informative","review":"This book is a great addition to any couple that is expecting a baby. It is a easy read with lots of fun insight into the changes during and after pregnancy. My husband read this right away and it helped him to get even more excited about our pregnancy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I bought this book based on the consistently high reviews. I thought the author was kidding when he said you could read this on a short flight or in a few trips to the john. In fact, the book is extremely short, and contains very little information to help the expectant dad. The extent of the first trimester chapter was, basically, your wife may get morning sickness, and she may not. Don't name your kid something easy to make fun of. I get that the author is trying to be clever and witty, but it comes off as trite and unintelligent. The misspellings don't help.In short, if you want to read this book, at least you won't waste a lot of time doing it. I would save your 8 bucks and spend it on something meatier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect book for dads-to-be","review":"My husband used to read books all the time. But now only has time for things about the length of a newspaper or magazine article. This book is really short and funny. So it keeps his attention enough to actually be informed as to what is going on. He reads a little at a time while things progress. And has laughed out-loud on a couple of occasions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good humor, but not very informative","review":"This was a great short book, and was very funny, but it didn't provide any information I didn't know already. It covers some basic facts, and if the dad-to-be is totally clueless about pregnancy, this would be a great place to start. If you're looking for more in-depth information I would pick another book. But I have to give it some credit; it is a funny quick read and is probably worth the $10 for a couple of laughs."},{"rating":"2","title":"As quirky as it's title!","review":"I bought this book for my husband on recommendation from another new mom-to-be. Worth every penny! It's written for a man by a man and gives it to them straight without sugar-coating a thing, and is funny all the way through. I read it myself for kicks. It could have been a bit longer and covered a few more things, but was a very enjoyable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Author is not as funny as he thinks he is","review":"I read it in about 2 hours. There is no real clinical information here. It is more of an autobiographical account of this guy having a kid. You can ask any of your friends about their pregnancy and get more insight."},{"rating":"1","title":"yeah...whatever","review":"The author tries to have that cute \\"Dave Barry\\" thing but instead just plays on old stereotypes that all guys do is watch football and don't know thing about women's bodies or what happens with a pregnancy. My wife and I are expecting our first child and I was thinking this may be informative. Instead it was a quick, one day read with jokes that wouldn't even be funny enough for Mad Magazine on a bad day. Sorry, but this one wasn't for me and felt like a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as funny as billed","review":"I bought this book for my husband hoping he would find it funny and useful.

It was moderately entertaining and marginally useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money. Don't bother!","review":"I suppose this tiny book is meant to be a comic relief to more serious books, but it's not funny at all, unless maybe you're 12yrs old. Not funny, and it doesn't contain any helpful information. The author is a lobbyist for a fortune 500 company in Washington. Now I know what's wrong with Washington. If you want a book that has some humor but also lots of useful information, try the book \\"Dad's Pregnant Too\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than expected","review":"I wanted to buy my husband a book to read to understand what my body and my mind was going through during this pregnancy. I bought this book because my husband isn't exactly the avid reader. I was expecting that it would be detailed in what I was going through as well as what he could expect, but we both were less than happy about it. It barely touches the topics of pregnancy, let alone dives into detail. I wouldn't recommend it unless you are looking for a quick read about pregnancy that is otherwise common sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the intelligent, more like Pregnancy for guys who shouldnt procreate","review":"This book is full of useless information about the authors own experience, Alot of it has nothing to do with pregnancy. Its a joke it seems as if it was written by Adam Corolla, from \\"The man show\\" or Tom Leikas except not as entertaining.

I read it, and found it completely devoid of any useful information for future dads, and couldn't BELIEVE the author was up until 5am writing, as he says at one point in the book. He gives about 2% real advice and 98% stories about his wife and annecdotes from other friends who have had kids, and devotes WAY too much time to telling you what NOT to name your baby, including a chart (a whopping 3 columns and 3 rows) of celebrities and their wacky baby names. Terrible book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't let him read this ladies!","review":"This is the most chauvinistic, disrespectful book ever written. It teaches men how to \\"deal\\" with a hormonal pregnant woman, and it always refers to the woman as \\"wife,\\" as if girlfriends can't get pregnant. The book is paper thin, so its not worth the price they charge for it, and it is obnoxious. There are cartoons making fun of pregnant women too! Ladies, make sure your man stays AWAY from this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A decent supplement","review":"Men definitely need at least one pregnancy book that's not a full-fledged textbook, and this is a nice one. I preferred this to What to Expect When Your Wife's Expanding, but I liked Breathe! A Guy's Guide to Pregnancy best of all. But most men will need one of the three.For real medical advice, use your wife's books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amusing, but falls flat","review":"This annecdotal review of pregnancy from Dad's point of view is at times humorous, but often falls short of delivering either humor or information. If this book intended to be pure humor, it lacks the punch to really be funny. If this book intended to be informational to the father-to-be, it stops with one line where a page was due. In short, the book tries to do too many things in too short a space - and fails at all of them. It's an amusing read, but don't plan on the \\"laugh out loud\\" experience other reviewers have claimed. Set your expectations low, and you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fun, Enjoyable Read","review":"I saw the author featured on CBS News Sunday with Charles Osgood on Mother's Day. He was really funny on the show, and when the reporter said that this book sold over 50,000 copies based on word of mouth alone, since I hadn't been able to get through any of the books my wife purchased for me, I figured I'd give this one a shot. I'm glad I did. While other pregnancy books for men are earnest/endearing works of 200 plus pages, which of course makes them impossible to get through, this one hits on the issues most men really want and need to know, and is written in a very fluid, lighthearted manner. It's a quick, fun read. If you're looking for a deep, detailed, and comprehensive text on pregnancy, there are plenty of other books to choose from (see \\"What to Expect,\\" or \\"The Expectant Father.\\" But if you don't have much time to read a lengthy book about the subject of pregnancy but want to feel better informed - and have a few laughs in the process - this book is a great choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid","review":"I purchased this book for my husband, hoping for a funny, lighthearted, yet informative book on the challenges of pending fatherhood. The jokes are lame. My husband read the entire thing in about an hour and said, \\"Well, that was stupid\\". I was doubtful, so I also read it and agreed. The \\"book\\" is more of a booklet, and does not give much in the way of actual useful information. Mostly banter about moody mothers to be, but nearly nothing actually factual or helpful about the actual pregnancy itself written from a mans perspective, which was our intention."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't be fooled","review":"This book was quite a disappointment. I read the reviews and thought there were several positive ones, more than other like-books. I was surprised at how short it was. I did not read it but my husband did, in about 2 hours. He said the humor was sophomoric and stupid, his exact words were \\"There might as well have been a fart noise every time you turned the page. If I wanted this kind of humor I would watch an American Pie movie.\\" He found absolutely no useful information or good humor. Don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"For dumb dads","review":"This was a totally dumbed down book. My husband actually likes being a father and was insulted by this book. This is for a dad who likes to sit on the couch, drink beers, and not do stuff with his kids. Sorry book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Offensive, humorless and poorly written...but short","review":"Like it claims, this is a book for men. That is, the worst of men. The ones who belittle women, mock foreign accents, make fun of children's names and, generally, are lucky to have gotten a woman in bed at all. If you're buying this to actually learn something, look elsewhere. If you're buying this because you're a guy who needs to look like he's reading a pregnancy book to pacify the little woman, you found it. To be sure, this book is horrifically offensive, extraordinarily self-indulgent and terribly written. A title like, \\"The Red Neck's Guide to Pregnancy\\" would be more apt. Fortunately, at one-sixteenth of an inch thick, it'll all be over quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this Book!!","review":"My husband loved this book while I was pregnant. Said it tells all the real details they leave out of most books. Funny and real. We actually have passed it on to our daddy friends having babies and they are also passing it on. Great Daddy Gift!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My kind of pregnancy book","review":"Okay i'll admit that I am not much of a reader, short attention span, distracts easily, video game nerd, whatever you want to call me i've just never had the stamina to sit down and enjoy a 600 page doorstop. This book keeps it short and sweet and I finished it in about two hours (at work with distractions.) I bought this book, and \\"Breathe: A Guy's Guide to Pregnancy\\" because let's face it, it needs to be funny for a person like me to stay interested in it. At 92 pages it seemed short, even for me but overall I liked the book and would recommend it to others.Cons: production quality, the first time I opened the book the cover peeled away from the pages, I could read it but the glue holding that thing on was poorly applied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb down version","review":"If you don't want to understand much about the pregnency, then this is a great book for your. It has very little detail and talks in very very general terms about things. If you like information i would strongly recommend another book that has much more detail.I was very disapponted and returned it after 1 hour of reading the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Crap","review":"This book is completely awful!!! I bought this book for my husband, thinking that it would help him better understand the issues of pregency. The comments about childbirth classes and having an epidural are awful (you are told that your wife should be given one, whether she wants one or not. The book never gives the many many reasons why an epidual may not be used)!!! This book is completely written from one person's point of view and lacks anything creditable!! I am debating whether or not I should even give this awful creation to my husband. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"uhhhhhhh....","review":"It takes about a half hour to read this book, and much of it is spent wondering where your money went. Really, the only thing you can come away with on this book is that you could have written a longer one and you could have been funnier."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you knew Nada, you would laugh even harder...","review":"Ian Davis and his wife are friends of mine, so I have an \\"insider's\\" view of this book. When Ian gave it to me to read, I stayed up late that same night in order to finish it. I loved every page, and laughed out loud on many occassions. As funny as YOU might find it, it is even funnier if you actually know Nada, Ian's wife. I read many books on fatherhood before my two children were born, and this one comes closest to any of them in describing the man's view of the \\"blessed event.\\" We men may have been there on opening night, but from that point forward we are definitely along for the ride...I loved this book and have bought it for every guy I know whose wife is pregnant. Thanks, Ian...and don't wait to long for the sequel (maybe you can get the second out at the same time Nada does...?)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"This book is a waste of money! No useful information at all. This book is definitely less than I expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"iriver clix is great, this device is horrible","review":"Bought this device instead of using a 1/8 inch jack plugged into my tape player. Not a good decision. I live in south florida. I have tried many stations and they all come out with static and interference. It makes it almost impossible to enjoy the music. I would not purchase in less you live in the middle of nowhere.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Great concept, but not useable. I live in Houston (granted there are LOTS of FM stations) and the interference from adjacent stations was too much for the little transmitter to handle.Also, the gain (volume) was not dependable and was usually too low for proper listening levels. Once again, that could have been from interference from adjacent stations.I talked to their technical support (super nice people) and tried it on two different vehicles. No luck on either vehicle.They let me return the item for full credit. Very nice people to deal with."},{"rating":"2","title":"iriver radio adapter","review":"The radio adapter is relatively easy to use. The only thing that can be problematic is you have to use a radio station not currently in local use. Unfortunately I have found in some cars that there is no option to automatically tune your radio, it only has the scan/seek button so you can never get to a point where you have a non-receptive station. That is more of a car issue than anything. Aside from that I have no complaints."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't last long","review":"Worked reasonably well for a while, as long as volume of mp3 was adjusted properly. Then began to get a high pitched, ever increasing whine and sudden static no matter what station, which car with an ipod nano. I've only had this device about 6 months. I emailed tech support from I river, advised to send in for warranty, no other suggestions made. Unfortunately, it is out of warranty."},{"rating":"1","title":"iRiver AFT 200","review":"This device does not work for all portable media players, as initially advertised, it is specifically designed for the iRiver Clix.

But for rough cuts and basic work these do ok."},{"rating":"2","title":"A decent cookery book but definitely not for beginners","review":"I generally liked this book. There is a fairly extensive collection of recipes that go a good bit beyond the usual standbys and it is enjoyable to browse through even though the layout is a bit cluttered. Although there plenty of photographs, including step-by-step pictures for each recipe, this is not a book for novices. There is not much in the way of a textual introduction to Korean cuisine, or ingredients typically , and the recipes themselves, although well illustrated, are not that easy to follow. However, those with a good familiarity with Korean cooking, and well-developed cooking skills should find the book quite interesting. I particularly liked the fact that the book has recipes and instructions for making fermented Soybean lumps and soy sauce at home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good food, but NOT \\"Practical\\"","review":"I'm the kind of cook who does not mind pinching the leaves individually off cilantro. I like to chop and prepare fresh vegetables in all kinds of futsy ways. However, I draw the line at recipes that ask me to pound cooked rice in a mortar to achieve a thick paste. Would a blender or food processor work? How about rice flour? Without hours of experimentation, I'll never know, and the author does not tell us...To it's credit, this book has wonderfully detailed instruction, but the preparation for most recipes is so intense that I don't find myself using it as a cookbook. For me, it's more of an \\"authentic\\" reference, a jumping-off point for creating meals with what's on hand...If you really want to make your own konju-jang or your own soy sauce, it's in there, but unless you're confined to the kitchen with nothing to do all day but cook, you may end up using this book as interesting reading material more than a \\"practical\\" cookbook."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mistakes, missing recipes, and MSG","review":"This cookbook has some great things going for it:It attempts to be as clear and concise as possible. There are many photos illustrating techniques, and while the photos are very 80s they are at least well-lit and clear. The author is a relatively famous cook in Korea and she knows what she's talking about. The book has a lot of recipes and is simple to read.However, some things have literally been lost in translation in that for some recipes the measurements are totally wrong. Some of these dishes would be nearly inedible if you followed the directions. And for such a comprehensive book, some classic Korean dishes are inexplicably missing. Finally, almost every recipe calls for MSG, which was indeed in heavy use in Korean households at the time, but has since fallen out of favor.Given the price of the book and these large mistakes, there is no possible way I could recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Guys vs Bad Guys","review":"If you love old western movies, you'll love this collection.

I will give it four stars cause there is always room for improvement!"},{"rating":"1","title":"smaller","review":"It is smaller than I imagined, looking at the pic, comparing size to the size of the cable clamp. The zipper opens it up all the way like a clam shell. It would be better if only the top opened making it easier to put the cables in and out. The center divider is attached only at the bottom and has a mesh zippered pocket, and several small pockets well suited for screwdrivers, which I don't need to keep with my jumper cables. Just like the extension cord bag, the handles are thin and floppy compared to the bag.Update 8/7/12.This is now made with a single handle zipper which means you HAVE to open it up all the way. The older one came with two zipper handels so you could zip both open slightly to slide out and in the cables. This minor change to save, what $0.05, makes a big difference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pricey but very well made","review":"This bag is not cheap but it is very well made - plenty of room for extra long jumper cables along with many other things you ought to have in the trunk for those bad luck days.The bag arrived when expected, was reasonably well packaged for shipping, matched the picture, was very well made, and is a nice way to keep the trunk organized - what more can you ask for.5 stars for quality minus one for price"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cable Bag by Bucket Boss","review":"This bag is great for stowing premium style (heavy guage, extended length) jumper cables in your vehicle.

I purchased a 4 gauge - 16ft jumper cable set and this little bag can handle it and more.I like this bag because it's quality is excellent and there is enough room to truly carry any length of jumper cables and even some small handtools inside.The only negative is that its handles are kind of \\"cheesy\\" and could be made with a little more heft to them. This should not keep one from buying this product because this bag is built to last - probably take it to my grave.Overall, I like it and think it would be a most excellent and practical gift for anyone.I gave this a four-star rating because I just don't like the \\"cheesy\\" look and feel of the handles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Introduction of Brian Macalvie","review":"Brian Macalvie is one of the important supporting characters of Martha Grimes' Richard Jury novels. Macalvie wrestles with some of the same demons Jury does (for instance, an apparent inability to have a satisfying relationship and a dogged need to resolve cases that are rife with complexity). Naturally, the two men initially drive each other rather crazy. Here it is Melrose Plant who is able to be the bridge between them, appreciated by both of them, serving to center and calm both of them.This is a complicated story about how revenge can become the abiding force in a life, and, conversely, how deciding to care aobut someone else can make even the most damaged person capable of strength and greatness."},{"rating":"2","title":"light reading with interesting characters","review":"All of Martha Grimes' Richard Jury novels have had me captivated; her main character is somewhat mysterious but not overstated, and the supporting cast are just quirky enough to catch the eye without being blown out of proportion. You have to have a certain taste for british landscape and atmosphere, but if you do, these books are great. I can't pick one I like best, so I am just reviewing this one because I think they are all equally good! Lots of small cultural references fill out her books to make the world in which they are set realistic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enter Brian Macalvie","review":"Martha Grimes pulls the strings tight in this short finely crafted darker edition of Jury and Plant.

She came highly recommended by an Englishman who claimed she could easily pass as an English mystery writer.

When you print on them, they look great. However, there are a few downsides. For starters, if you look close you will see print lines that run up and down the surface of the disc. Which isnt that big of a deal, but it prevents it from looking truly professional. My biggest complaint is the frustrating fact that when you rub your fingers a long the disc, it leaves smudges that arent removable. This is more noticeable with black ink. And you can forget about running a cleaning cloth or towel across the face of these discs. The results are obvious scratch marks that you cant remove. This is a huge downside for me and makes me want to get my cd's done professionally. I hate to give these cds such a bad review, but they are so limiting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the Best","review":"I bought the \\"Dymo Discpainter\\" that prints designs directly on printable CDs but I got very different results depending on the exact blank CDs I was using.

Well, the ink never dried on that CD and it \\"stuck\\" to the top lid of the CD jewel case! Then I tried these CDs. WHAT A DIFFERENCE! The image was beautiful. It gives a smooth mirror like finish with all the colors brightly shown. It also dries quickly and the ink doesn't \\"stick\\" to anything.

They were hot, sexy and steamy together. The secondary characters added great humor to the book. Miss. Sims gave us very vivid details. However, I was not too pleased how everything panned out. It took to long for the bad guy to strike and it was all solved in one page. The ending seemed so rushed after the fact that the rest of the book was in great detail.

I understand that Powermatic simply put their name on what was a Performax sander model. Both companies are owned by the same group along with Jet. The machine was accurate right out of the box. It performs nicely. I have to say though that the finish results using equivalent sandpaper grits is about the same as the Grizzly. The difference is the Powermatic is very heavy duty with nice fit and finish. It weighs in at about twice that of the Grizzly and doesn't complain when you inadvertantly try and sand a little too much in one pass, though that isn't recommended. I do recommend this machine highly but if you are a little more wealthy and have 3 phase electrical, go to a large belt sander.

My high hopes were soon dashed when I realized that the vibrations from the toy caused it to turn itself off within 30 seconds of being put on the ground. I don't give up easily so I taped the switch down. The dog played with it for probably 1/2 an hour the first day. The next day I turned it on and it broke... just broke. I don't know why, but it seemed that the inner mechanism that made the \\"bumbling\\" happen just fell apart. I left the toy for my dog anyway figuring she might still be able to get some enjoyment out of it... about 10 minutes later she had chewed off a few of the nubs, and that was that.

He loved the sensations of the vibration, the way it made his voice sound funny when he tried to talk, and how it got away from him and he had to chase it around the house. I was surprised to find that this is no longer marketed for children when I decided to track it down to purchase for my grandchildren.

Firstly, the reinforcement cones inside the ball came unglued one by one, each time jamming the motor unit. I spent much time interupting her play session, in order to take the ball apart to get each cone out, before reassembling it. All the while my poor dog looked on with great frustration. After all that, the motor was working but the ball would no longer move, so I had to jiggle it about myself (which rather defeats the object!) In the end, I had to put the ball away as I could smell the motor burning itself out. I'm angry considering that this toy wasn't cheap (plus the amount of shipping costs).

Less than 5 minutes he chewed one of the colored feet off and the gray piece inside, that I could see inside the ball, and also he had another foot chewed almost all the way through. So... I threw it out. This is not a dog toy. Dogs chew things. If you can not trust a toy with your dog for less than five minutes without getting something caught in their throat, it is not a safe toy. If you decide to get one of these, make sure you supervise, and do not allow your dog to chew on it. You would be better to give this to a cat that does not chew things up.

My destructive behavior began in college when took up cohabitation with an older man looking for that father figure.

I bought it for my daughter; she didn't like it either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smart Women Read Other Books","review":"While I thought the personal assessment exercises in the back of the book were very helpful, I felt that the book as a whole was biased. The book suggests that women set lower standards in order to find the man of their dreams. The book also diminishes the mother's crucial role in raising children and implies that the decision to have children lies solely with the woman.I felt that the book was contradictory. On one hand, it tells women the type of men to avoid and what type of woman is most desirable to men. On the other hand, it says that the smart woman who has learned from her past mistakes \\"may have served to narrow her vision and opportunities.\\" Perhaps smart women are too much of a challenge for a real man."},{"rating":"1","title":"No good enough","review":"This book do not provide women with enough incentive to drop off the bag of bad choices.

I thought it would be similar to Christopher Moore's books, like the \\"Island of the Sequined love nun\\", but it wasn't. I read through about three chapters, with an open mind, but it wasn't the weirdness that was a problem, the book was simply boring. It didn't even seem that weird.I stopped reading, skimmed through the pages to see when Vishnu was going to make an appearance, and it wasn't for a bunch more chapters later. My time is important, so I put the book down.So you can guage my judgement, I like authors such as:* Christopher Moore* Terry Pratchett* Jonathan StroudThe cover looks awesome though."},{"rating":"1","title":"It never goes anywhere","review":"I was really excited to read this book after reading some good reviews for it. The first couple of chapters were entertaining and intriguing, yet after a while it just seemed like the book was going around in circles.

I picked it up in library to enjoy a funny spy novel as per it's back cover.. which it is absolutely not. Not sure what the author is trying to prove but bashing Hindu culture in almost every chapter and relating the story with 10th incarnation of Vishnu and picking up (or I may say stealing?) pieces of mythological references to Hindu mythological stories and characters are pathetic.

I wouldn't read this author again and waste my time.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid Book","review":"Aside from the few (very few) likable passages this book was a chore to get through.

They sounded like some sick cross between Hunter S. Thompson and Tom Robbins. It's more Tom Robbins when he he was in his prime (I'm not sure where he is mentally today). Maybe there's a little Ken Kesey for extra spice (or some chemicals of choice). I'd say Will Clarke writes like a 21st century throwback to the 1960's and 1970's.

Gary Jenkins has a reasonably well-developed vocabulary, but there is the whiff of imaturity about his writing as well. This book is heavily opinionated in some respects and this little fact gets obnoxious after awhile. He also tends to get off track; for instance, no one cares about some dude's crumbling marriage (not Lucas') and the book is about the story behind Star Wars, NOT American Graffitti. This book reads more like a biography rather than a book based solely on the production of 3 movies as the title suggests.

The old speakers sounded good, but time and weather had done in the cone of one of them. I looked over the offerings in 6\\" & 6x9\\" speakers and chose these, largely from their reputation. What a disappointment. The sound was thin, with almost no bass and little mid-range. There was absolutely no \\"fullness\\" in their sound.

When finished, the joint requires little hand work to clean out the bottom of the mortise.The only improvement that Powermatic could do is to make adjusting the angle on a bevelled mortise easier.

The wood was hard enough to where the chisel bit could not be held with the brass screw thru the bushing and kept sliding up. The solution was to allow it to do so and adjust the auger to suit.

That one word alone describes the latest from one of my alltime favorite bands. There is not one memorable riff on this entire album. I love Steve Morse's instrumental solo albums but he just does'nt write good rock riffs in a band context. These songs are meandering drivel. Ian Gillan is my favorite singer of all time, but on this one he just mailed it in. Maybe Gillan's Inn was his last hurrah. Nothing stands out here. Drumming by rote, blah-blah-blah bass playing and non-descript keyboards just make this whole effort a big waste of time.At least Bananas had some good songs on it.There is no tune here that you might catch yourself whistling or humming at work. Nothing,zilch,nada.You used to be able to rely on Deep Purple for a quality effort every time.I guess its time for the old boys to pack it in 'cause the well seems to have run dry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miles off","review":"Okay, before I start ranting, I admit to buying Machine Head as my first ever Purple album. The band has produced an exceptional amount of great rock music since the late 60's and are live the best rock band out there. I bought this CD because I own everything they ever made. Slaves and Masters was a catastrophe, Bananas was almost as bad, Rapture of the Deep is dismal. I have not been able to listen to it in it's entirity once. It really is a case of, even for younger fans, if you want to hear THE Deep Purple, buy In Rock, Fireball, Machine Head, Made in Japan (must have), heck, even Who do we think we are is fast and furious at times. My advice to those thinking of buying this CD -- save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reaching for the No-Doze","review":"I got this a couple of months ago and gave it a few spins.

I didn't love Bananas, but it was more interesting than Rapture. For me, Purpendicular was their last good album. I have all the DP cd's and it saddens me to see their quality sagging so low.

Maybe Rick Rubin can squeeze something good out of them?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rupture of the Deep","review":"I have listened to Deep Purple since Kentucky Woman in the 1960s and I have never heard as disappointing music as Rapture from the Deep. I can not imagine how other listeners compared this album to anything recorded during the Blackmore years. Guitar work on this album is always background music. The band has moved into a new style and I am too much aligned with the old style. I am listening to Slaves and Masters, and I find it more true to the past - but I cannot recommend it either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor and unispired","review":"Very poor release from one of the greatest rock bands in history. Songs are very uninspired, and it looks like they rushed the production. There is not a single memorable moment in the album, just average tracks, with average solos.

After reading good reviews I gave it a chance and finaly purchased new DP with Steve M. Don't get me wrong, he is a good musican, but he is different person (than Ritchie), so his song writing is different - it's no Deep Purple. Same thing would happen, if Eddie Van Halen was replaced in VH with let's say Jimmy Page - it would not be VH, even though Jimmy is great.I'll just keep listening to the great old Deep Purple and will try to forget about Rapture of the Deep ASAP."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disposable like the diapers they're wearing","review":"A major disappointment after JU JU said so many good things about Deep Morse.

My favorite song is \\"Nuthin Left\\" that was the first song I heard when I was at the show. Taxman came out in a body-bag then jumped out and then Judge D came out I fell in love right there!

I have the audio version and it likewise is terrific."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Christian Book Ever","review":"Waking the Dead is filled with New Age philosophy, constant inappropriate movie references, and theology that is so weird that even the author admits that many of his friends have abandoned him over his wacko theories. He mixes New Age spirituality with Catholic mysticism and 14-century theology to come up with a virtually worthless book. It is a complete waste of money--I can't think of any redeeming qualities, except that he wants us to focus more on our \\"heart.\\" Yet his claim that the heart is always \\"good\\" and that modern Christianity is wrong from proclaiming that the human heart is born bad is just plain unBiblical.

His examples from the lives of friends and fellow believers give concreteness to this book. I would like to see a more thorough scriptural explication.

This book packs a whallop of insight into what it means to live bringing God with you as you learn, get entertained and live. John supports his image bearer theme much more intently in this latest book about recognizing false humility and has a great quote from Nelson Mandela that will knock you into the truth. Many quotes from movies and books like the Wizard of Oz, and Cinderella. If there is book man that understands and explains the heart scripturally it is this book. For those who previously didn't support John's books due to lack of biblical reference, he is quoting more often. I am only halfway through the book and it was worth every penny for the first 4 chapters already. If any book can show you a different perspective about what the Bible is for John can do it. Jesus was called Wonderful Councelor yet we don't often look at scripture as a counsel for there heart issues. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"An eye-opening, valuable read","review":"I read this book for the first time just after it came out in 2003. Since then, I've read it several more times, and I find that it has influenced my thinking regarding spirituality more than any other recent book.Some have slammed Eldredge for taking some scriptures out of context in his books likeWild at Heart: Discovering the Secret of a Man's SoulandCaptivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul. In this book, however, spiritual concepts are set forth in a beneficial way for both mature and new believers. Those concepts are very accurate and they present an amazing and refreshing picture of the spiritual journey as a disciple of Jesus.Eldredge writes early on a line which has become for me a lifelong challenge to keep in focus: \\"There is a glory to your life which your Enemy fears, and he is hell-bent on destroying that glory before you act on it\\" (pg. 33, hardback ed.)I like most of what Eldredge has written, but for me, this is the pinnacle of his works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Waking the Dead: The Glory of a Heart Fully Alive","review":"Simply put, Amazing!

Then, John walks the read through practical steps that invite healing. The result is a renewed heart- a heart that can more fully reflect the glory of God. He writes about the four essential truths' that will help us on our way to restoration.As leaders, we are called to fully love God and love others. We are also strategically placed in facilitate healing and freedom in those who follow us. This book helps us address our own leadership and life wounds so that we can facilitate others in their living to their fullness.

The basic thing I've taken away from the books is that it teaches us to be open about our futures and grab some nostalga along the way. Waking the Dead like Wild at Heart focus on what most conservatives will call OPEN THEOLOGY. This approach to God creates a sort of open question as to the future and whether we have a hand in it. John frequently sets up statements that lead conservatives to view them as redefining God, His intentions and what scripture says.While conservatives can tear apart these writings based on John's innaccurate portrayal of scripture, none I have spoken with have not liked the book. One man said they got him off his duff, out dating again, and on with his life - all good.Scripturally sound, no. Biblically accurate, no. Encouraging and exciting and forward thinking, yes. It's a great read but just not to be reconciled for accuracy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stuffed With Fluff","review":"This is an okay book but it has a lot of fluff.

I'm not entirely sure what the point was to parts of the book or to the entirety. Eldredge seems to try and build these wispy, grandiose ideas but they feel more like a house of cards.

High Rhulian, on the other hand, had almost the same plot as Marlfox (an earlier book). The author has used the same formula as many of his other books:1. A group of young squirrels/otters/mice/badgers/whatever go on a quest, following a group of adults2. Villains act extremly stupid stratigectly.3. The heroes defeat a huge army with nary a causalty.4. One young animal from said book becomes a great leader.This formula has been used too often. This book was so pathetic, I was rooting for the bad guys at the end.

The series episodes were always about the little things -- sly cultural references (often glimpsed only briefly in the background), snappy one-liners, and character tics. Plot lines were usually only secondary. That's OK for 22-23 minutes, but a movie-length production requires a more coherent story line and continuity. \\"Wild Green Yonder\\" feels like four TV episodes strung together, and the result is less than the sum of the parts.

The only really good thing to point out is that the little event at the very end should've been them back at the 18th hole, leaving open the possibility of bringing back the series and, hopefully, this time, keeping in its proper format.All in all a lackluster finale for the greatest animated comedy series in history."},{"rating":"2","title":"2nd best from the Futurama movies","review":"Although personally I think Benders Big Score is the best out of all four Futurama movies, Id have to say that this one is second best.

Out of all of them, this is the first Futurama movie I could have seen that would have possibly made it on a big screen. Regardless of what you thought of the other movies, this one is worth watching before you form any final opinions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this then, the untimely end of Futurama?","review":"Disappointing on several levels, this installment of the Futurama movies is inconsistent, rambling, and has a rush-production feel to it. None of the movie length features measures up to the quality of the episodes, but as another reviewer observed, that was a rather high bar. FOX would have been better served to invest their money in another season or two and let the Futurama creative team do what it did best, the 22- minute episode.Fans like myself will want this for the sake of the completeness of their collections, but are unlikely to give it repeated viewings, to those who want to get to know the series, as I and others have admonished, start with the series episodes. The first movie was pretty good, but the last three were weak in comparison.The features had some nice moments but are nothing outstanding."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE LOST WORLD JURASSIC PARK","review":"The book takes place four years after the jurassic park disaster.A man named DR.LEVINE ask if IAN will go to the island of isla sorna with him.LEVINE goes to the island and gets stuck on the island.Then IAN,DR.THORNE,and EDDIE CAR go to the island to save him.After they arrive they go into a lab and find out ingen's secret of how they made there dinosauar's on site b and how they had a disease.Later on they find out that amy and arby had snuck on in to the trailer.

This is a must read if you are truely a fan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"AOL, (Aliens On Line)","review":"Let me guess, they are running AOL (Aliens On Line)If you go to her website (S), all you see are aliens, aliens and aliens + plus reptiles etc., aka, Junk in the trunk. I see more things in reference to Satan then of God. There is not one thing listed how to come to the Lord Jesus Christ, lifting up His name and become saved and how to know our Savior. Prophet? I don't think so, we see from the Bible what is a \\"True\\" prophet which she falls very short of. She is against Jews and Jesus was a Jew. She also has the thinking of a White Supremist, pure racist.A person posted if your not a true Christian you should not read this book,I say again, if you have any wisdom God gave you, read the Bible God's Word, not Sherry Shriner. God tells you what you need to know to get saved and that is through Jesus Christ and no demon or alien invasion can steal you from the hand of the Lord. Jesus said we will have trials but to trust in Him."},{"rating":"1","title":"NEVER AGAIN will I purchase anything made by PRICE-PFISTER!!","review":"(White unit) Although I did not purchase this from Amazon.com, I bought it from my local home improvement store (my first mistake). After installing it, I tried it out, but the spayer would not work properly. You press the button, but water continued to come out of the faucet. I called the home improvement store to return/exchange it, but they advised me to call Price-Pfister. After explaining the problem to Price-Pfister, they too refused to exhange it and said they knew what the problem was with the diverter and would send me parts. My second mistake! I didn't know I was part of their Price-Pfister free plumbing repair staff!! I got new diverter parts with schematic instructions to field strip the entire unit to fix it. It still does not work properly. NEVER AGAIN WILL I EVER PURCHASE PRICE-PFISTER!! Hope you look elsewhere for a different manufacturer!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sundome In The Night - 'In Lean Hours' (Garden Of Delights)","review":"This neo-psychedelic band isn't like most of the other bands that have release(s) out on the Garden Of Delights label. Mainly because it's material from the '90's. Have to admit, I liked what I was hearing. Their influences are from the likes of the Doors and maybe early Pink Floyd or even Nirvana. Just a couple of tracks worth mentioning are \\"I Ran For You\\", the awesome rocker \\"Codine\\" and \\"Borderline\\". Personnel: Uwe - vocals, Christian - guitar, percussion & vocals, Michael - bass, UC Kuhlmann - organ, guitar & piano and Pete - drums. Have to wonder why these players don't use their last name. Nontheless, not a bad pick."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT HAPPENED????????????","review":"The book starts off good, get's great, easy reading....then BAM!the story ends and the propaganda starts. \\"Ed's Children\\" part two...talks only of all the Psycho, Chainsaw Massacre, stuff that spawned from his man. I am sure there would have been a bit more information to stuff into the first half of this book and drop most of the second half.(63 pages of 167).The guy was a strange one... add it to your Serial Killer library."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Misunderstood Book","review":"If you want to know just the facts, read Deviant by Harold Schechter or Edward Gein by Judge Robert H. Gollmar, both great books.However, this tries (in it's own crude, juvenile, and trashy way) to tell a different story, a story of how a twisted man-child named Eddie, who fed himself on a steady diet of mental junk-food, including E.C. comics, penny dreadfuls and true-crime magazines, and how he ended up becoming the unwitting father of modern horror, inspiring everything from sick jokes, sideshow attractions, and whispered camp-fire stories, to watershed books and films like Psycho and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.Sure, this is itself mental junk-food, the kind that Gein would probably appreciate. It's compulsively readable though, especially for fans of horror films, bad books, and the dark side of pop-culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"I enjoyed the story however I didn't enjoy the writing.","review":"This book was horrible... the story was interesting but the writer thought it'd be cool to write a bunch of cuss words every chapter or so, and had a poor command of the English language. I mean I don't speak it perfectly, but at least if I were going to write a book, I'd write it well. To paraphrase Capote on Kerouac: That's not writing, it's typing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost a Work of Fiction","review":"This book is entertaining, but almost completely void of fact. Woods doesn't even get how Gein was arrested correct. His imaginary dialogs between Gein, his mother and friends are written with a out of place southern drawl. If Woods did his research, he'd know that people from the upper Midwest (which includes myself) talk like in the movie Fargo. I credit Woods on writing about the pop culture phenomenon of Ed Gein, but that is about it. An almost complete waste of paper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite a clever method of detailing Gein's trek into insanity","review":"A good book, overall. It gives a reasonably clear description of Gein's upbringing as well as the contributions to the deterioration of his psyche. Embellished with details which I still am unsure if they came from Gein's admissions or are fabrications from the author, the book tells a frightening story which is so macabre, it borders on fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Horror, from facts to fiction..............................","review":"When thinking of a good psycho film Ed Gein comes to mind. This is one sick, and twisted book that covers all. First we get the story of Ed's life, childhood, people he knows, mom, and a course his crime. Another good thing about this book is the information on the movies that were inspired by Ed Gein. Great photos, and short read makes this book a perfect keep."},{"rating":"2","title":"From monster, to pop culture legend, The true story of Ed.","review":"If you like The texas Chainsaw Massacre, Psycho, and The silence of the lambs, read this book. Learn about the true story behind the (man?) who commited some of Americas strangest crimes, and why he did it. The take a look at the last few chapters regarding how he was brought from psychotic monster to pop culture hero in music as well as in the movies. Read this book, and develop your own opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Gein-er, interesting Book! Great Intro to the man.","review":"I am new to Gein, never heard of him before I started cruising amazon.com's true crime books. I really enjoyed the style of the book, its design, and the pop culture review at the end. I rented as many of the movies as are available and appreciate the new eye I have been given with which to see them. Facinating!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly waste of time","review":"Sick though he may have been, Ed Gein nonetheless remains a morbidly fascinating individual. In this putrid little tome, however, Woods fails to add anything either interesting or significant to the admittedly skimpy body of work on Gein. This sophomoric little potboiler is a disjointed mess, combining half-witted commentary with outright fabrications, including ludicrous \\"dialogue\\" between Gein and others. Woods seems particularly interested in the line of junk Gein-related \\"memorabilia,\\" most of which appears to be as shoddy and third-rate as Woods' writing. This book is a dreadful waste of the reader's time. For a scholarly and informative treatment of Gein, read \\"Deviant\\" by Harold Schecter, which is well-researched, highly readable, and vastly superior to this sad, sick piece of garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning- this is historical FICTION and may be misleading !!!","review":"I must say, I was horribly disappointed with this book. Do not buy this if you are looking for accuracy! It is historical FICTION! I will say this, Paul a Woods has a talent for blurring the lines between fact and fiction, truth and lies! This book is nearly useless to a person who is interested in learning about the True case... Paul a Woods has created a monstrosity of truth diluted with lies... I won't read another book of his- EVER!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Chronologically disorganized, author has immature approach","review":"Though this book does provide an overview of the Ed Gein case, I found the lack of chronological organization annoying. The author reveals his age in the second part of the book, by presenting the money-making unevolved cultishness surrounding this truly pitiable, completely insane man as \\"cool.\\" The Ed Gein Fan Club (with address included) was just a little too much for me. I also found the author's gratuitous use of profanity in his analysis to be another indication of his immaturity, both as a writer and as a person. As someone with an interest in the facts and psychology behind serial murderers, I found that, in the latter part of the book, I learned much more about the psychology of the author -- and it wasn't pretty. I would not recommend this book, and encourage anyone interested in this subject to seek a more complete, intelligent presentation in a better-written, better-organized volume."},{"rating":"1","title":"Politically Correct Logan..... yuck!","review":"Not a very good read really.. Annoying back and forth timeline, All the characters seem to be thinking with the same personality,( even using the same phrases in their thoughts!) And worst of all, a strangely weak and spiritless Wolverine.. Especially in the present time. His quoting poetry.. being concerned about his smoking and a rather feminine reaction to being flirted with had me wondering who this guy was. Poor Silver Fox, we are told.. lies buried somewhere in Canada after having been murdered by Creed. Logan himself wonders why he hasn't avenged her.. Whats with that? It certainly isn't explained in the book. I wish a really good writer would take Logan and do something with him. He is an excellent character and deserves more than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was so ZZZZZZZZZ! BORING!","review":"I got half way threw the book and I was falling asleep. There is no action or adventure in this book and I suggest not buying it. It is a waist of time and money. Go by the old saying and \\"DON'T JUDGE THE BOOK BY IT'S COVER!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"More Spy than Superhero. Not Marvel's best.","review":"I was disappointed by this book. I was expecting a story aout the X-men, or at least about Wolverine as an X-man. Instead, I get this weak storyline putting him and a few other Marvel characters in a cold-war espionage story told through flashbacks! The characters were weakly developed, the story on the flimsiest of premises, and a deeply unsatisfying ending. Definately not the best book I've read."},{"rating":"1","title":"So inconsistent with the comics.","review":"For one thing Wolverine has his metal skeleton in this novel, but he didn't in the comics during the time this is supposed to take place. It also makes no reference to the fact that Wolverine met the black widow before this adventure, because he met the Widow when she was a child in 1941."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. Golden has run out of ideas.","review":"I was very disapointed by this novel. It's not an X-Men story at all, it focuses solely on Wolverine and that's it. The Black Widow, Maverick, Banshee, Mystique, and Sabretooth all play unimportant roles in the story with various flashback sequences that are poorly placed together making it difficult to follow the continunity,which is already tough to keep up with as is. Mr. Golden should not do anymore X-Men novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"A really bad surprise...","review":"Though I'm use to buy Marvel Comics books from the web, the time I opened the box with this one I felt rather stupid. I expected to see a comics book, and this is instead a juvenile novel with a simple plot and 1 dimensional characters, printed in a large, dumb font, with no drawing but the cover. To go through an X-men book without the graphics is like to watch an action movie blindfolded: next time, caveat emptor... I still wonder I could I have find out what it really was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christopher Golden is the best","review":"Codename: Wolverine is the best Marvel book I have ever read. I am a wolverine fan and love learning about his past. This is one of Golden's best work and I recommend it to any marvel fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite Hymns, vol. 1","review":"This was purchased as a gift for my wife, who sings at various nursing homes in our area.

Dispression has had a stigma attached to it forever. Many women are afraid to seek help because what others may say. The story itself was positive and probably many areas true regarding foster homes. I'm glad the ending was upbeat and gave glory to God."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"This was a wonderfully inspiring book for anyone who has suffered with depression especially when it is due to a regrettable life choice. I found it very healing and is a great reminder to lean on God during those hard times in your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent book","review":"When I ordered this book, I wasn't expecting it to be the best book, but when I got it, I was amazed that it was precisely accurate. I thought that it was going to be without some of the music, but all of it is in there. And I think it forgot to mention that there was guitar tab in there if you read music that way, and there is, so no worries. It's pretty cool though because I'm able to play some of the stuff on piano and bass, and this is the best way to go because otherwise you'd have to pay 15 or more dollars to get the separate books. Plus, it's cheaper than buying it for regular price which is why I bought it off of amazon rather than going to some other music store. All in all, i'm pretty satisfied with this. I'd say that if you're really looking into buying a \\"By the Way\\" book, I'd go with this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful !!!","review":"Very Acurate book !!!

Anyone should be able to tell that this is very obviously wrong.The tabs in this book are about the same quality as the ones you can find for free on the internet. Use Amazon's \\"Look Inside\\" feature and you can see for yourself.Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disapointing","review":"I waited the arrival of this book with a lot of expectative, but it's very disapointing. It's very childish and give not many ideas at all. To me, the worst thing is that it works with fabrics that you only can find if you are at USA; it doesn't help you to make really new creations. I'd like a book that could teach a person from everywhere how to make great creative scrapbooks, and not this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEAUTIFUL VOICE! Awesome, inspired music!","review":"Cindy Diane's voice is so beautiful! And the songs chosen for this CD are all GREAT, not one stinker! They are so beautiful, especially \\"Child of God\\", which is more like a deeply meaningful prayer, and the great \\"Walk With Me\\" is a very energetic praise song that will have you jumping. The guest artists in duet with Cindy--Fernando Ortega and Cindy Morgan--are wonderful complements to Cindy's smooth, clear, and wide-ranging vocals. I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH about this wonderful CD! Just a great combination of real vocal TALENT and great choices of songs! I loved her last CD, \\"Closer,\\" but she has topped it with a very different sounding collection than on \\"Closer\\". Beautifully done instrumentation and engineering too. I can't wait for her next CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Had a good ending","review":"This book was good. It was pretty boring in the beginning, but it turned out to have a really good ending. I find that the most exciting parts of the book is at the end of each chapter. I'd get this book, though. It's good if you like a boring beginning."},{"rating":"2","title":"A.J.'s Excellent Review of the E-Mail Mystery!","review":"The E-Mail Mystery was a very good book.

It worked fine for the first 6 months or so, but after being in storage for the summer months, it developed tiny cracks all over. It was just sitting in a kitchen cabinet. If I squeeze it slightly, I hear cracking noises, which leads me to believe that the thermos is not very stable, and possibly now dangerous to use because of the plastic chemicals leaching out. I believe this company now makes a glass thermos, that might work better."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE NOTE - THIS IS PLASTIC, NOT GLASS","review":"This product came up under a search for \\"glass thermos\\" and it is definitely NOT.

The latter is a genuine memoir from TV's second greatest journalist (next to Edward R. Murrow). The former is a brief tape that breezes through events so quickly as to be wholly unsatisfying. Walter Cronkite has lived a long enough life and had a rich enough career to merit two autobiographies, but CRONKITE REMEMBERS is so superficially brief as to trivialize his career and the events he covered rather than add to our understanding of them. This isn't a terrible tape. It isn't unpleasant to listen to. I liked hearing Cronkite's voice, which I could only imagine while reading A REPORTER'S LIFE. But I was left wanting more - much, much more. That's why CRONKITE REMEMBERS merits a low rating. Skip this and get A REPORTER'S LIFE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of PCS500","review":"Do not buy this if you are looking for a semi-serious scope.

The Tantus Twist, however, exceeded my expectations by lightyears. When I bought it I thought, eh, doesn't vibrate, but looks interesting anyway. Great price. Ok sure why not. The first time I tried it I felt like jell-o afterwards and went for a niiice looong smoke. I highly reccomend this product. The raised twisting texture works wonders and feels great with sufficient lubrication, and it has this very nice slight curve to it that hits just the right spot without making you want to crawl up a wall. I give it two thumbs WAY up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"There are no major spoilers ahead for your convenience. ^_^This is a fantastic movie! The movie was animated beautifully and with Lindsey Lohan also added into the movie, the movie is up-to-date and perfect.The fashions used are very pretty and modern and so is the My Scene gang!It's also different. You know how some reviewers go on about how My Scene copied Bratz? Well, first of all, My Scene characters look human, since Bratz have more than one half of their face taken up by their lips and they also have the tiniest bodies and they scowl WAY too much. Plus, Bratz is inappropiate for the targeted crowd.I highly recommend this!!! :D This is a perfect DVD gift for your girl. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad My Scene dolls, bad bad bad","review":"This movie doesn't looks good at all.

All of you doll haters need to get a life, okay? My Scene Goes Hollywood was really enjoyable and I learnt some stuff about Lindsay Lohan. I would appreciate though if they didn't go on about boys so much. Kids should focus on school, not cute boys all the time. But, other than that, the movie was really enjoyable. Madison eventually goes back to normal, before, the fame was in her head. The boy (can't remember name) was just interested in himself as the My Scene Girls found out. It also taught me more on how they make movies!!! I would live in one of the trailers, actually! It was cool how the girls were picked as extras (won't go on anymore, hate to spoil the movie if you haven't seen it).The Bratz movie was excellent as well. There is no need to hate dolls, I want positivity.

I mean, Madison was a total jerk to her friends, what is up with that, that is like the only thing this movie was about, and their outfit weren't nice or fashionable at all. And what was the deal, they didn't even go to hollywood. And I hate Linsey Lohan, and that Ryan guy wasn't cute at all. And it is sooooooo innapropriate that Madison kissed that guy like 10 times, gross too. And So I watched the Bratz movie, and it was soooooooooo much better.

I knew for sure when my son said Mom I like your new perfume and then he went ha ha ha. Even he could tell! I don't think the company will be very happy to hear you are selling perfume under their name and it is definetly not!I tried this once before buying some perfume being lured in by the low price only to be completely blown away that the perfume was bootleg. My husband ordered this for me.This time I'm not going to lay back and do nothing. I'm going to contact Paris and let them know about the false adverstisement. I don't think they will be very happy. I would prepare for some bad news.I'm stuck with one closed new bottle of perfume purchased from you and I would like to return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nicely done.","review":"After reading this book, I have a thorough understanding of XSLT 2.0. I was really surprised that it covered the Sarissa API, which I use extensively and is also used by other APIs such as MapBuilder.Though it says 2.0, 1.0 is covered in the book too, although not specifically. The code in the first 200 pages (and probably more) works with 1.0 as long as you change the namespace references and fix your own typos.The thing about the community is that most of the XSLT in use is in browsers and is still version 1.0, so 2.0 info isn't useful - yet, though it is covered well in this book.This book got me up and running with detail in a few days. The explanations and the chapters flow nicely. I liked that it didn't read like a PhD dissertation. Good job Jeni.Sam"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry. Can't recommend it this time.","review":"I highly recommended the edition of this book that caters for XSLT 1.0 and thats where the problem of this book lies. The author uses the same base material and examples but doesn't highlight the differences for XSLT 2.0. To those who say didn't I see the word Beginning in the title, yes, Beginning XSLT 2.0 there are vast changes between the versions and the Beginner tag can still be applicable to experienced XSLT 1.0 developers migrating to XSLT 2.0. Those who try to do so are ill served by this book.

We used another book for basic XML and Tennison's book for XSLT. For just learning about XSLT, this book is way over my head. The running example throughout the book is too complex for learning the basics and the author assumes the \\"beginning\\" reader is more advanced than this. Very disappointing and frustrating to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not incredibly useful...yet.","review":"I paged through this book and Ms. Tennison's other book on the subject \\"Beginning XSLT.\\" I ended up purchasing her first book, \\"Beginning XSLT\\" because XSLT 2.0 has yet to gain widespread acceptance in both client and server side technologies. The difference in price between the books was $20 (at least at my local Border's)...so I went with the cheaper one which instructs you on how to use XSLT that will actually work (1.0). This book, \\"Beginning XSLT,\\" I highly recommend. Easy to read. Very in depth. A great book on the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect meld of pix and text","review":"Tom McGuane is hands-down our best fishing writer. His observations are always provocative and invariably dressed in memorable language. The surprise here is Charles Lindsay's photographs. Lindsay does not give us familiar shot of the country's top fly fishing destinations, as do most tomes in the photo book genre. Rather he offers a look at the shape and whirl and textures of fly fishing. He gives us the trout as it noses up out of the element to take a fly, or as it leaps from the water, sending a spray of water. He offers rainbows schooling beneath the surface, the water purling over rock so that it is hard to tell where the water stops and the rock begins. A lovely meld of words and pictures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The author of this slim volume is a London-born poet who spent a significant period of time in India studying Buddhism before returning to England to found a Buddhist center. He retains a Western poetic bent -Allen Ginsberg, John Donne, Virginia Woolf, Philip Larking are all present by allusion or dedication.His poetry covers a wide range of implied beliefs - the title poem is highly environmental, \\"The Pilgrim\\" a reflection on Tannhauser, \\"Mother Goose Revisited\\" a reflection on childhood and sexual roles ... The depth I expected from the author's long practice of Buddhism is absent. Rather the book presents an erratic collection that is likely appreciated by those who know the man behind the poems - but which do not stand on their own."},{"rating":"2","title":"It makes uniformly sized meatballs","review":"It makes uniformly sized meatballs, and is much less messy than rolling them by hand.

So far I have been very lucky, I stumbled onto both the Animusic DVD, as well as the Gartel- Trance, Dance and Other Living Things DVD here on Amazon. Both are cutting edge, and both are extremely entertaining. If you only have two DVD's in your \\"Media\\" collection, I would strongly recommend both. The Animusic is for all ages (new borns to adults), while the Gartel DVD is not for kids (probably because of its intense imagery). If you can afford both, then I sincerely recommend you get both the Animusic, and the Gartel- Trance, Dance and other Living things. If you need to make a choice between one or the other. The entire family can watch and enjoy the Animusic. Just like the Gartel DVD, the music supports the visuals on Animusic, instead of the visuals supporting the music.

While the music might not get any air play on anything but really obscure progressive radio stations, combined with some superlative computer graphics it's simply enthralling. In fact, I've been looking for something to get my brother for his birthday (45 a week ago!) and just couldn't pick something for him until I got this from Amazon today.

For 40 minutes Wayne Lytle, Composer/Producer/Director, treats your eyes and ears to a modern CG concert. Not only are the graphics eye-popping, they are consistant throughout each piece. The robots/instruments use the same key/horn/item to produce each sound. It's no wonder that each piece took about 4 months to produce. My favorite compositions are Pipe Dream 2 and Gyro Drums. The other 6 are also great eye/ear candy. A variety of audio formats, screen aspects, and special features are especially appreciated."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Visualization of Sound","review":"It is impossible to not enjoy this DVD.

I highly recommend this video for those of short attention-span."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh...","review":"I don't know what to say about this...it was interesting but not wowing by any standards.

When would you watch this? Stoned and lonely? Anyways, the weird \\"string-instrument-pogo-stick things\\" are extremely annoying, I don't understand that segment at all.the one with the balls flying through the chutes and playing the drum set was semi-captivating, but again, the music is lame.Sure, it took a lot of time and effort to produce this I'd assume, but it just doesn't seem like something anyone would want to buy.

For anyone not familiar with the Chosun Dynasty of Korea and does not like to read history books, this book will provide that information in an exciting novel format. There is suspense, love, death, inter-cultural clashes, and war. Many cultural aspects of Korea identified in this book are still very prevelant in modern South Korea. Anyone planning on visiting or living in Korea should read this book to better understand the Korean people and where some of their beliefs and attitudes come from. The author of the book himself lived many years in Korea and is married to a Korean. So he is not just talking off the top of his head - he has an insight into the \\"Land of the Morning Calm\\" most westerners do not. This epic is the 'Shogun' of Korea.

Armstrong manages to appreciate both the heroic working dog and the fiesty house poodle. I found some of the descriptions of the sea-faring dog to verge on the poetic and made me misty-eyed with respect and admiration.Nicely woven into the tale are ruminations on WWII and the french resistance, as well as what is essentially a travel diary as the author recounts his experiences in France.This is a moving tribute to dogs without ever becoming too cute. I certainly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pearl for Your Collection","review":"Regards Rodeo is a communication between a poodle in Massachusetts and a berger (German Shepherd) in Cassis who share a patron, Alan. As their correspondence deepens, they share tender anecdotes about philosophy, frailty (human and canine), family, work and love. The author is clearly a \\"grown up\\" a la Saint-Exupery whose childlike wonder is intact. The illustrations, created by the wife of the patron/author, enable the reader to visualize the wonderful experiences shared by Jefe and Rodeo. I bought 5 copies to share with friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love those dogs!","review":"What a charming tale of two pups who are trans-atlantic pen pals. A \\"must\\" for those of us who believe that dogs DO run the world (or should!).

Also a lovely and true picture of beautiful Cassis, France . . .

However, after a series of calls to Compaq (24-hour, toll-free) and Logitech (9 to 5 Pacific time, toll call! ) we have not been able to get the built-in microphone to work. Logitech has been less-than-helpful in remedying the compatibility/driver issue with their microphone. I dug up a 12 year-old stand-alone mic and plugged it in for audio instead. I don't know if this issue extends to other models of computer, but if you have a Compaq, I recommend getting a Logitech web-cam without a built-in microphone, or just purchasing a different brand of camera altogether."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impractical for many RVers","review":"I found this book totally impractical and a waste of money for cooking in a small RV. It might be okay for the person with a 40 foot motorhome with a complete kitchen and all the comforts of home. Many of the recipes contain ingredients that I don't even keep at home. Access to perishables and fresh produce is assumed although the authors mention cooking in the middle of the Mohave Desert in the Introduction.

It is when the Professor is Proffessor Roth with his love for Sanskrit( inspired by Nixon, read the book to find out)falls for an Indian American Lalitha Gupta, who is not interested in anything remotley resembling her heritage. The book was written very uniquely. The author disects the Kama Sutra and applies it to his own life.He follws the Kama Sutra in a way that I am sure Vatsayana had not meant.

But - to the book!This majestic acrobatic verbal dexterity proves again and again how much talent remains in American academia and how lively the \\"dead\\" form of a novel still is. The plot is insanely funny, multilingual delivery in a form of faux media clips is sheer genius, the appearances of the author himself as \\"the\\" character are nothing but cheeky and hilarious.The more you know (as the NBC logo claims), the more you appreciate this marvel.

It was a big disappointment because I couldn't wait for it to come out. It was a REAL downer. The other books were semi-violent, I mean the series IS about someone who beats up criminals, but this one is VERY violent and graphic. As for the characters, Sam is no longer on my list of favorite people. Let's hope he redeems himself! If I were you, I would skip this book and spare yourself the gory details. Just wait for the next book to come out. It will probably fill you in with the details."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good book","review":"This book actually upset me. It wasn't worth it. I really liked Pascal's earlier Fearless books, but this one is not good at all. I didn't like the graphic sex details - this is supposed to be a Young Adult series, not a Harlequin.

Ivan's character is more fully developed in this novel.

They are rated to work for as long as '2000 hours,' but really they mean 200 hours. I bought my first set in April; when my passenger side burned out 3 months later, I had assumed it was a fluke and bought a second pair. When my drivers side bulb burned out a month later, I was pissed (especially since the original lights had lasted more than 3 years).I would not buy these 'High Performance'-type bulbs again. I would heavily recommend against buying these bulbs.

I loved the light so much that I tolerated it and replaced them with the same bulb.I was using the practice of letting the Camry turn the lights on automatically with a turn of the ignition key. The process was (1) lights turn on (2) engine starts. I could see the lights flutter a little during the starting process.I then experimented by manually turning on the lights AFTER the car was started. It has now been 2 years with NO BULB BURNOUTS.

Other reviewers will no doubt agree that these are short-lived bulbs and there is a reason for this. These bulbs are colored blue to *simulate* the HID look. Any color on the glass actually reduces output, so Sylvania uses an over-rated filament to get brighter light to compensate for the light absorbed by the coloring. Because federal laws are very specific about the output of headlights, Sylvania cannot use a filament that draws more current so the filament is burning overly hot and therefore has a shorter life. They same seems true for their uncolored X-Tra Vision bulbs. (Which may be the Silverstars without the color.)

While this is not particularly important, no historical constext is given either. A positive aspect of this book is the relevance it has to modern algebra. Marker uses ample examples from algebra.

So, if they could have asked him what to do, I'd like to think he'd have said 'Do you even have to ask?' I thought by The who playing they enabled more people to join in and honor his memory by doing what he would have loved to do if he could've himself.

I knew it wasn't waterproof but according to some reviews it does a decent job at keeping the water out... it happened to lightly rain briefly in LA for about 25mins and the bike was soaked. I should have spent the extra money for the waterproof one. I don't see it lasting more than a year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cover","review":"I bought this for my husband as a birthday present. His motorcycle lives outside in the open with the cover being its only protection. Since we live in Georgia I know the sun will have its way on any cover I bought, therefore I didn't want to go high priced. This cover fits great, and after quite a bit of rain and strong winds it has stayed put. It feels to be a well made cover, we will see how it hold up after the summer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good cover for the Price","review":"I had the same cover before...Good Build...It lasted 2 years while keeping the Motorcycle in the open parking area.(Except Winter months.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"fits and works","review":"the cover fit's my 2012 Triumph America fine. all is well. it shipped and was received quickly. the price was good"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fits like a glove on my Yamaha Roadstar","review":"It fits so well, it looks like it was made for the bike when it's on, even with the OEM windshield on.

Because of its location it get hit with a fair amount of outdoor elemenets (rain, snow, sun, etc.). So I was looking for a medium weight cover that would preserve the paint job, but still allow my bike to \\"Breathe\\". This is IT!!! This cover is water proof and just the right size for my sport bike. It even has bungee cord hooks at the bottom that you can hook together underneath the bike to keep the wind from blowing the cover off. Trust me,... these come in handy as my last cover did not have them and I would frequencly come to find the cover blown off of my bike. Buy this Cover! You be happy with the purchase:-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW. HEAVY DUTY","review":"This is one awesome cover. AND very thick. It will fit in my VF1100's nylon saddle bag as well.It is thick enough to prevent some hail damage too...I wish they sold one for cars....It is also truly all season........ It is basically a garage in a bag for your bike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scooter cover","review":"I confess I bought this cover for my new scooter because it was on sale and lots cheaper than anything sized for a scooter. I was worried it was going to be too big, but I wanted a waterproof cover for the scooter because it lives in my full sun backyard when it is not on the road. The cover is great - light weight, durable, and not too big for my scooter (which has a windshield on the front and carrying box on the back). In fact, I think it is easier to deal with because it is a little more forgiving to handle because it is not too tight fitting. It is a great cover for the money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Works for the first month, after that it fell apart","review":"I bought this cover to protect my harley 1200 sportster. It worked well for the first month, but it quickly developed holes all over. Also, the hooks you use to attach it to the bottom of your bike both fell off pretty quickly.I kept my bike outdoors, and it rarely rained of was windy. I was careful putting it on an off. Now the cover is riddled with holes and is pretty much useless.I would not recommend this bag for larger bikes like mine. It seems if the cover is under any stress it will rip and tear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"I bought this cover to keep my bike protected from humid, rainy San Francisco weather. First night I put it on, it fit over the bike well enough, I fastened the hooks and otherwise made sure my Harley Sportster was covered nice and snug. I come to take the cover off the next morning and lo and behold, the bike is soaking wet. I was like WTF. So the next night I made extra sure the bike was properly covered and aligned to the body of the bike. Fastened the hooks once again and went to bed with fingers crossed. Come back the next morning and sure enough the bike is soaked. I don't get it. I closely examined the material, there's no holes or other defects that would explain why the bike got wet. Seems to me the answer is pretty simple, this piece of trash isn't waterproof.Fail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good heavy duty cover","review":"This is the second cover i've owned.

I have a 2012 ducati 848 Evo it fits it pretty well except the back wheel is slightly exposed. I keep my bike on side of the house. I worry that the nice red wheel will get ruined from the sun or weather. I'm thinking about buying a larger motogear cover. Other then the wheel being exposed this cover rocks. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice cover","review":"Great cover, great price. A bit thicker than some of the others I've seen which does mean it will take up more room on the road. Only complaint is the hooks. While I am usually a big fan of metal versus plastic, in this case im not. No matter how careful I am the 2 hooks used to secure the cover will knock against the bike when in installing or removing the cover. They are super easy to remove though. Overall a great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware ! Product has changed","review":"Over the past two years, I've purchased and happily used the motogear deluxe cruiser cover on my last two bikes. It was reasonably priced, large, and well made, with several fabric panels. When I sold my bikes, the covers went with them. So, imagine my disappointment when, for bike number three, I received my new motogear delux cruiser cover - same specs, same product name, same label - and found that the cover was significantly smaller and more cheaply made than previously. It's nowhere near the product it was in the past. Ah well, nothing stays the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cover and great value","review":"This cover isn't just good for its price range, but it's a good cover for any price range. It's very sturdy, the vents work great, and the \\"elasticized bottom hem\\" keeps it in place. It physically fits perfectly on my 2011 Triumph Speedmaster and the look fits my Triumph's character as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Cover but small IMO","review":"Bought this cover for my 1980 HD sportster.

If you are looking to buy this toy -- take your money elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work as described","review":"I should have known since the boxes for all three in the store were kind of beat up, that they'd probably been returned, and after reading these reviews I think for sure that is the case. So, Toys 'R' Us puts them back on the shelf when people return them as defective??? The thing doesn't stay on the wall very good, and it has two settings which seem to work the same - continuous music with no change when you pour into the cups - NOT AS DESCRIBED on the box. Guess I will look for the receipt and take it back to the store. I was hoping it would keep my 7-month-old great nephew from standing up in the tub!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It Just Doesn't Work!","review":"I bought this for our daughter's first birthday as she loves tub time. It worked for about 3 seconds the first time and then didn't for several weeks until the entire bottom portion got wet, then it mysteriously started working. It never works on the single mode, but will on the \\"orchestral\\" mode where the whole band plays, but the entire band plays only if the bottom of the toy is wet (hey, that's not in the directions). Of course, it ALWAYS works when I take a shower.Should have read the reviews first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch out for chipping paint!!!!","review":"I do not recommend this toy! The paint chipped off (even though my daughter never put it in her mouth). The contacts inside that make music get dirty after the first couple times. This makes the toy stop working. After the contacts got dirty the first time, we had to clean them before every single use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!","review":"I bought this at a garage sale for a dollar (less than a year old), and it worked for a couple of months. I replaced the batteries, and it still didn't work. I decided I had nothing to lose by taking it apart to see if I could fix it. When I did, I realized it was far from water tight, and the electronics in it could easily get wet, even when using the unit properly. There was no reason for the holes in it (besides the speaker holes), and really no way to keep the electronics from getting wet. I tinkered with it and still wasn't able to get it to work. While it worked, it was fun and had a cute song, but it should be built for the bathtub since it is a bath toy. I'm glad I only spent a dollar. Save your money, and use the radio or a CD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Purchased Twice....Both Defective","review":"I'm always looking for good bathtime diversions and purchased this toy last month. My toddler boys seemed interested, though not enthralled, with it in the short period of time before it completely stopped working. I exchanged it for another and guess what? Same thing. Not exactly the highest quality toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Satisfied","review":"After my initial review I went back and tried adding liquid soap to the conductors, as suggested by another write up, and the product has worked fairly well since. I must remember to put the switch in the off position as it has gone off in the middle of the night several times. Do try the soap if you are having problems with the product working!I received this item as a gift and while still in the box there was a switch where you can play the music without water. Well my one year old girl just loves it and would start dancing everytime. But when we got it out of the box and in the tub it would work once every ten times and only one of the instruments would play. Changing the batteries did not help but turning the unit on and off sometimes would kick start the music. It was very frustrated. Quite a shame as its a great idea for bathtub fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"How frustrating.","review":"Bought this one for my twin boys, 10 months old at the time. It stopped working. I contacted Little Tikes, followed their directions and was sent a replacement. The new one worked once so far. It is basically a teething toy right now. Still haven't heard one tune from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy this toy","review":"This toy is not at all worth the money you spend on it. Like another reviewer I bought at Kohl's on a 1/2 price sale and am super glad that I did not pay full price. My 1 and 3 year olds were not impressed. It was fun for them for about 5 minutes and that was it. It goes in and out and plays when you don't want it to. After 5 minutes my kids were playing with their Dollar Tree plastic boats again. I believe toys should be fun and simple. This toy however is alot of work keeping the bubbles out and the water pools in the instruments prolonging the play. I would not recommend at all. Stay away from this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it!","review":"I got my 1 year old this toy and I hate it. You hardly hear the music & it plays only when it wants to.

Aside from that, the colors are nice - and it drains as you pour into it - so aside from the music - it would have worked just fine for a basic activity toy... but darn, it would never stay on the tub. It's the suction cups. The toy is constantly falling down for us. It's probably just our tub or something - but it just keeps falling down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Work","review":"This toy worked only while it was in the box.

It has certainly jazzed up our bath time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I absolutely agree with most of the reviews: this toy is a cute idea, but the fun doesn't last. I haven't been able to get it to work now for several months. Haven't tried cleaning the contacts though. But, I'm not sure it's worth fixing because my girls lost interest in it fairly quickly -- especially since the music playing was sporadic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad!","review":"Such a great idea! Too bad it never worked consistently, and eventually not at all. It got to a point after being used maybe 10 times tops, that I would have to flip the switch off and then on again to get it to work. And when it did, it would play one time and then have to be turned off and on again. AND only one of the little instuments worked at that point. I hoped it was a battery problem - no such luck! Too bad!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Never worked","review":"Little Tikes Bathtime BandI purchased this time for my two toddlers for Christmas. It looked so cute and my 15 month old loves music.

For the last 2 months, this CD has been the only one in my car CD player. I listen to it over and over again. I have literally hundreds of CD's, but I feel no need to take this one out of my CD player. Perhaps the most moving song to me is titled \\"Won't You Come Down\\". I can identify with this song so well, that it literally brings tears to my eyes, and I find myself singing along with it at the top of my lungs! The musicianship and lyrics are truly incredible! This CD comes close to being my favorite CD of all time. It is a must-have for all musical tastes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Ancient Rituals\\" Review","review":"Being a person with rather diverse tastes in music, I am usually reluctant to impose my opinions on anyone. In this case, however, I feel compelled to comment on Scooter Scudieri's \\"Ancient Rituals\\" CD. This collection contains some of the most powerful and beautiful songs I have had the pleasure to listen to in a long time. Their power and beauty derive not only from Scooter's amazingly beautiful voice and dynamic music, but from his own personal conviction underlying the lyrics. Scooter's huge talent lies not only in his ability to create his music, but in his ability to convey his own personal humanity throughout it. Treat yourself to \\"Ancient Rituals\\" and if you have a chance to see Scooter in person, it's an experience not to be missed!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ancient Rituals","review":"My wife Lydia and I bought a copy of the CD at Scooter's Release Party and it's hard to find the words to describe this debut CD.

We were lucky enough to catch Scooter's performance. Great acoustic rock on stage, and the cd, with the full band behind him, is absolutely fantastic. His songs have a certain quality that often lacks in today's popular music. The honesty and emotion that poured from the stage was phenomenal, and kept all of us in the club wanting more. I have a new favorite music artist thanks to that night out on the town. Scooter Scudieri is not one to be missed live, on in your living room. He is not your run of the mill, cut rate unsigned artist.

I have no problem whatsoever doing the Ken Dragon Punch combo with this controller. I think Sony should seriously change the D-pad design for their PS3 contorller just like the ASCII pad. The build is very durable and seems like it can take my beating on it for a very long while =P Overall, I think it is one of the best control pad for 2D fighting games like Street Fighter, Guilty Gear, or King of Fighters.

During my reading I was able to picture in my mind when the characters engaged in their roles throughout the book. Once you start reading, it is quite difficult to stop until you reach the end. At all times throughout the book I was curious to know what would happen next. Mr. Mann's writing style is clear, concise and quite descriptive especially when he is describing the intelligence briefings, planning and shooting scenes, not to mention the sex scenes. It also gives you an idea of how the intelligence community works throughout the world and how easy an operative can die as the result of an operation gone badly. One can only imagine the circumstances under which Jason found himself, that cost him his life. It is a great book to read, and I recommend it to anyone. I hope you enjoyed as much as I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Master Spies - Fascinating Story","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It is a fast and curious read, which I feel is important since the plot is so interesting that you will want to read it through quickly to its final resolution. Knowing that it is inspired by the true and heartbreaking story of a young man who really was murdered in Vietnam, not too long ago, makes it all the more chilling. I wondered as I read a particularly bothersome event if, in fact, that episode actually took place. Also, being a young college student during the Vietnam War, it felt good to learn about the Vietnam of today as well as of yesteryear. On the romantic side, I enjoyed the male and female detectives/husband and wife sleuth team, who are truly \\"special agents\\" and so in love with each other. I also recommend this book because it's a slightly different kind of espionage novel. Learning how spies really operate and the risks they take is an education in itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Designer Whey \\"Putty.\\"","review":"It may have plenty of protein in it, but the Designer Whey French Vanilla flavor tastes awful.

When freshman Grady Tucker is brutally murdered by his debauched pledge trainer, he finds himself stuck between earth and the afterlife, a wraith with an attitude. There's hell to pay for those responsible as the dead man learns a few things about the meaning of life and comes to terms with his lack of a physical body.

California Coastal Byways covers roads from the Oregon border to San Diego, focussing on the coastal Route 1 and offroad between this and 101. It's easy to look at the general map, choose a specific region, then read the different trip descriptions which include notes for car, bicycle and stops along the way, maps needed and how to get there. Highly recommended for any California resident or visitor who enjoys rural back roads explorations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works fine in Sony DSC-V1","review":"Without spending a lot, this battery works just fine in an old Sony I use for sporting events.

The story focuses on the author's imprisonment and battle with the Soviet government to grant him emigration from the USSR.

By focusing on the early stages of the disease, Kuhn provides the right dose of help and hope to those struggling to come to terms with the myriad changes in roles and responsibilities of all concerned. The second edition provides updated information while leaving intact positive messages about living with Alzheimer's and not merely surviving through it. A new chapter gives voice to experienced family members who share valuable lessons. This book provides accurate information about the disease and useful tips that enable family members, friends and interested professionals to cope with someone's memory loss and other thinking problems. It's the one book that should be read by all starting down this difficult road. And doctors should be writing down this title on a prescription pad!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If only I had seen this book years ago","review":"When my mother was first diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, everything I read about it scared me out of my wits.

I really appreciated its combination of honesty tempered with kindness. It includes not only the author's considerable knowldege of the topic, but also the perspectives of victins of Alzheimer's as well as a host of different caregivers -- real people, all of them. When I read this book, I felt that it had covered every single one of the myriad conflicting emotions I feel every day in joining with my family to care for my father."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mrs","review":"i purchased this book from Amazon and it a very informative book. i would highly recomend reading this book for anyone in a family facing this situation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative and up to date book","review":"This book contains much of the information needed for a caregiver to prepare for dealing with the progression of Alzheimers.

After a little practice getting used to them, I won't go back to the other style and weight of picks. The lighter finger picks seem to give the strings a sweeter sound.

The picks are made from a thinner than usual plastic and the thumb area does NOT hold the pick in place (on your thumb). On top of that, the 3 picks, in the package, are nested inside each other so when you pull them apart only the inner-most pick is even a \\"medium\\" size. The other 2 are stretched out from being slipped over each other and are useless! I would NOT recommend these to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun thumb picks","review":"Never used this type of pick before. I love them.

Little criticism can be found in the scholarship of the translation, and for those who are curious, thorough notes are given at the ends of chapters, but I am forced to subtract a star just for the fact that one wishes that a work of this scope would be published in a superior binding than what is found in the current edition.

I found I could only reliably download 1 file before the thing went crazy. I am returning it to Amazon.After this one sucked, I bought a Rio 500 and it is a MUCH better product - it works reliably and sounds good, but you have to be smarter than the software they give you or forget it.

Yepp was simple and easy to install. My CD Player is frankly obsolete as I now use Yepp while running. Great sound (CD quality), extremely light, and no skipping since there are no moving parts.

Acceptable, but 64MB would be more desirable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light!","review":"The best about this Thing is it's really really light!

One thing is because it would cost $100 more, the other is that you need to press a putton to switch between cards. Too complicated.----------You really don't need to buy another headphone for this. The headphone comes with this player is just fine (even though it's not very very comfortable)! And you would look better with the original headphone.----------- One thing bad about this thing is that the control buttons are too hard to press! very hard. You need to press it down all the way in a very inconvinent way.----------- And also, sometimes the software makes it a kind of confusing to download musics to the player.----------I am listening to my Yepp as I am writing, it's a great thing to own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for your lectures at school","review":"I bought my Yepp-32 just for my class.

A friend lent me a 128mb smartmedia card to try and again the player would not read that either. It needs the 32mb cards. I'm still searching for a better interface set-up. Any ideas please post them.If you want better quality sound you need a good jukebox program that will allow you to rip or write music at or near CD quality.But remember, the higher the kbs the bigger the file therefore, the number of songs you will be able to download will be less.Otherwise it's been a great little toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Abuot Smart Media card for this player","review":"I want to know, can I put 64mb Smart media card in Yp-E32 player, or to this player fits only 32mb card??

It works really well, the sound is good enough that you can hear even when it is noisy around you, and when it comes down to it, it is pretty easy to use. The problems are that you can't store a whole heck of a lot on it (I have to figure out a way to compress the music... that might help) and the instructions aren't all that easy to follow. Once you figure it out though, it's a piece of cake. My friends love the MP3 player, and they all want one now. Also beware, it eats up batteries like most electronic things.

While I understand the concept of basic household items combined with their coordinating signs, I feel they tried to jam too many items into their usual short video time, therefore not being able to have more time with the visuals, which is really what the children love. Take for instance, cat. You were shown the word, the picture and the sign. Then you saw two live cats and that was it. 2 seconds of visual.

If you are interested in teaching your child signs, whether or not they can hear, I would HIGHLY recommend Signing Time instead. It's real sign language as well, but shows a lot of repetition, kids and babies doing the signs, cute songs, etc. I can't emphasize enough how much better these videos are than the baby wordsworth.In fact, the signing time people were used to train the cute little twin boys in Meet the Fockers movie.

It arrived and I watched it with my son almost immediately. I was very disappointed. The pace is slow and did not hold my son's attention. Also, as a teacher and a mother, I know that kids need repitition. There is not nearly enough repetition of each sign, each sign is only repeated twice, once at the beginning of the segment and once at the end. Also, I believe the signs they chose were far too complicated for little ones.

I think this one is comparable to Numbers Nursery, which my sister gave me because her son loved it so much. My 17 month old daughter loves that one, and Baby Wordsworth seems like a winner too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible -- don't buy it.","review":"This DVD is too slow moving. It doesn't hold my child's attention. Buy Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Neptune, Numbers Nursery, Neighborhood Animals or Noah instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD!","review":"This is a great DVD. I bought it based on the description on Amazon. It shipped quickly. My son LOVES this video. He is very interactive with it and has learned a lot from it already."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring - Confusing Signs - No Music - Dry - Child Hates It","review":"Let's just say it is no Signing Time! And worse, it's not even a decent Baby Einstein. There is very little music. There is only a little narration. Though I adore Marlee Matlin, she is a little wooden in this video. There is only one other person signing, the same child all the way through and she looks about 7 or 8. Each sign is repeated twice. I know there are many different signs for many different words, but they are often different from the ASL I am teaching my daughter. At first, I thought they were trying to make the signs more intuitive for toddlers. Then came \\"puzzle\\" and \\"blocks\\" both of which were also different from the signs I learned, and both of which were VERY complex for small children. This video does not hold my child's interest at all. She would happily sit for 3 hours and watch all 6 Signing Time! videos back-to-back if I let her, but did not make it through 5 minutes of this before running off to play."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not against signing, of course, but video is boring","review":"I have to add my voice to those who have written that this is one boring video. Our 20-month old enjoys BE videos, and usually asks to watch one before bedtime each night. Baby MacDonald is his favorite, with Baby Mozart a close second, and Baby Beethoven and Baby Van Gogh tied for third.This video held his attention for oh, about 5 minutes! It's NOT because of the signing, not at all. Rather, the animation is very boring, there is very limited puppetry, and it's very slow paced.I'd recommend lots of other videos in this series, just not this one very enthusiastically."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby Wordsworth","review":"We purchased Baby Einstein-Baby Wordsworth for our 18 month old twin granddaughters. They have thoroughly enjoyed it, are fascinated by it, and respond to it with enthusiasm. The variety in approach with sign language and foreign languages, in addition to English has enthralled them. This DVD is superb."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"I love to use this dvd with my one year old son. I treat it like a lesson and sit down with him, explaining everything on the screen. The music and colors on the screen really keeps his attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this movie!","review":"This is one of my favorite Baby Einstein videos. My 10 month old son loves the Baby Einstein puppets; he smiles and laughs every time they come on the screen. And fortunately, this DVD is full of the puppets. I really like that sign language is incorporated into it as well. Even if baby doesn't catch on to it right away, I've definitely learned a lot, and have used lots of the signs on an everyday basis. I find some of the Baby Einstein DVDs to be a little boring, but this one is really entertaining and actually keeps my interest, mainly because of the signing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wordsworth","review":"I was so excited to get this video. My daughter loves it and it is helping her to tell me what she needs in the house. Thank you so much!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just because its popular doesn't mean its the best...","review":"...Or even very good, sometimes. I never liked this video. My two babies and later as toddlers would never watch it. The signing was just ok and not, in my opinion, good enough if you actually want your child to learn and use sign language at home. The animations were uninteresting and even I never could sit through much of it. Instead, I would recommend the Signing Time seriesSigning Time! Vol. 1: My First Signs DVDfor that purpose. My niece and her family very successfully learned to sign using these videos. While I never owned them, they used to come on PBS on Sundays and all of us (husband and 6yr old daughter included) used to watch them. I love the Baby Shakespeare DVD but was incredibly disappointed in this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great video, well done BE!","review":"This video is so great on so many different levels. First off, the words my son has learned. When we first got the dvd a few months ago, I would take him for a ride in his wagon around the neighborhood, & he was naming all the trees, flowers, dogs, etc. Then one day, I noticed he was signing all the words he was saying! I was so proud of my lil' man! Now at 16 months old, he knows almost all the words & signs for everything in the video. So, give it a shot, it's worth it! And on a personal note, we just bought our first home...after seeing the beginning of the dvd many times, he was able to point at our house as we walked up to it and say \\"Home\\"! My heart just melted!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD","review":"This is another great DVD from Baby Einstein as a follow-up to the \\"First Signs\\" DVD. This is a wonderful way to continue to build baby's vocabulary. I was pleasantly surprised by the additional sign language that is taught. I recommend this as an addition to your collection but it is not the most entertaining DVD compared to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too boring","review":"As a baby and a toddler, my daughter found this to be one of the more boring Baby Einstein videos. There are not enough animals and music in it and it is too slow moving."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby Signing Time Is Far Better","review":"My daughter loves all the other Baby Einstein movies; however this one is about like watching paint dry. After the first 5 minutes my daughter doesn't have any interest, and me personally I find it a totally boring. There are some things in the movie that are cute and make my daughter laugh, but those are very few and far between.If you are interested in baby sign language, I would strongly recommend Baby Signing Time. My daughter loves the baby signing time movies and when I put it on she comes running to watch them.Don't waste your money on Baby Wordsmith, I would recommend any other Baby Einstein movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Preverbal Babies?","review":"As a counselor for families with young babies, I have had the opportunity to review a number of sign language resources for preverbal babies.This DVD seems more appropriate for older children rather than preverbal babies who are trying to communicate basic wants and needs. Some of the most important first words and signs for young babies are not offered - eat, drink, milk, more, etc. Instead this DVD offers words and signs such as computer, puzzle, clock, etc.In addition, there are no babies signing or speaking in this production and it lacks an appropriate tutorial for parents of hearing babies who are teaching their babies to use sign language.I recommend the My Baby Can Talk series to teach either sign language or first spoken words to babies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Educational","review":"We have been trying to get out daughter to say more than the few words she knows for a while. Once she started watching this she can't stop talking! It is great! She knows what everything around the house is - after only watching a couple of times. She has been talking and repeating almost anything anyone says since she started watching this video. While TV is not a babysitter, educational videos have a place for small children. A review of the newest Baby Einstein ranted about ADHD and more if children watch TV before age 2 - do more research! I am a Sociologist/Psychologist and if I thought that it was harming my child or was uneducational, I would not let them do it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sub-standard Baby Einstein Material","review":"This DVD was very disappointing. My 19 month old son loves the entire collection of Baby Einstein, but this one does not hold his attention. The content is very poor and not suitable for teaching beginning sign language to babies. Many of the signs demonstrated on Baby Wordsworth are too complicated for an infant to learn.We have My Baby Can Talk, which is formatted very much like the other Baby Einstein DVDs. My son loves that one and has learned practically all the signs on it. We're waiting for the second volume to come out and were hoping that the Baby Wordsworth would be a nice complement to it (not the case!). We also have the first few Volumes of Signing Time. My son has learned those signs as well, but he likes the imagery on My Baby Can Talk better whereas Signing Time shows a lot more children actually demonstrating the signs. Hope this review helps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging, but bad habits","review":"My son is facinated and sometimes tries to do a sign. He can be playing and when it comes on he'll stop what he is doing and just watch. He's one, so he's kind of back and forth. But he definately loves it.One concern that I have is that there are several things that I wouldn't want to teach my child. Like, jumping on the bed, or licking up spilled milk. I know the character is a cat, but a baby isn't going to make that deduction.I think the signing is well done, and the fact that in addition to Marlee Matlin they later show a child doing the signs. It's a great model for them.Overall I would definately recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Help for a Late Talker","review":"My son just turned two and only says about 10-12 words regularly, so he's a late talker. This DVD is helping him with his language skills. He doesn't care much for sign language, but he loves mimicing the words. The video definitely keeps his attention. He asks for it to be played every day. He sits on his little couch with his blanket and watches the whole thing. He would watch it twice if I let him. Great for teaching language to babies!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Addition to the baby eintstein family!!","review":"My kids just love this DVD. The music is typical of BE. I was also able to fast forward/skip through all of the commercials.So if you love Baby Einstein, this is a definate must have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a little disappointed","review":"We love the series but this one lacks.It's too slow paced to keep my daughters attention.

It is about the heart of man - not the heart of God.\\"Have you got what it takes?\\" is the recurrent humanistic theme.The author's psychological analysis of the male psyche is interesting, but its message of \\"validation\\" puts man firmly on the throne, and there is no room for that if God is to be King in His kingdom.It espouses no Christian distinctives whatsoever even though it frequently and selectively misquotes scripture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous lack of Biblical truths","review":"This book has a big lack of Holy Scriptures and is based on man's psychology views instead of God's views.

The whole book is opposed to the core beliefs of christianity. According to this book, we should not be afraid to give-in to the sinful desires of our heart, men were created in the wild and therefore they have a wild heart.okay Mr. Eldredge, enough about the wild heart, is it okay if we use our brains sometime also? or does that make men a sissy?I WOULD PREACH EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT THIS BOOK PREACHES: do NOT trust your heart. Use your brains to carefully meditate upon the words of the lord.

So much of what Mr. Eldredge says challenges me to be a better husband, father, and leader in general. Dissapointing to me was all of the references to \\"Man Movies.\\" I was a little uncomfortable with so much allusion to the world's models of manhood and so little communication of the Biblical model for men. I am sure that Jesus Christ should not be compared with William Wallace, Maxximus, or James Bond, etc. If we can't look at the Word of God and get a clear picture of God's expectation for men, then where can we really look? Read the book. Take all that is good from it. But look into God's Word to find out what makes a real man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chapter One was good....rambling and poor analysis for the remainder.","review":"After reading the intro and first chapter, I was very excited to read on. Unfortunately the book became a rambling sermon of movie reviews, a few Bible verses, and life stories, most of which seemed made up in order to fit the mold of whatever the author was talking about at the time.

He fails to recognize that God made men different. Just look at the disciples. In fact, Christ chose them for their differences, not their similarities. Yet Eldridge sees one way for all men to grow as believers. And he is mistaken. Climbing the highest mountain and taking huge risks may work for some, but it simply isn't the style of all. Nor should it be. This book touches a nerve in young men in particular, thus its popularity. But it is not especially Biblical and should not be considered part of the accepted works of the modern evangelical movement. In fact, this one is best left on the shelves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mundane: common, ordinary, unimaginative.","review":"for having the word \\"wild\\" in the title its quite a let down. its the most mundane/boring repetitive book i have ever read. its like someone came to John Eldredge and said \\"hey john would you like to write an entire book of the same chapter over and over and over and over and over?\\" I am a christian and i agree with that men should be embracing their masculinity as opposed to apologizing for it. the problem I have with it is that everyone says its the best bold and enlightening book they've read and say that every man should read it. forget it, just read the back and you'll have read the entire book. its not bold its old."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"I place this book in the top 10 of all my readings.I read at least 12 books a year.I am 60 years old.

I thought it would be a good read, and I had heard a lot about it so I decided to check it out. It was a great book! I tend to devour books, but this one I read a chapter at a time and felt completely satisfied. It was a highly interesting look into the brain and hard wiring of the male christian mind. I recognized traits of myself in the book, just as a child of God, and I recognized traits and tendencies of all of the men in my life as well. It taught me that it's okay to be a little wild and uncut sometimes - that God made us all to be exactly who he made us to be, and it's okay to play to our strengths and be ourselves!

Books like Wild at Heart--books that humanize God and glorify man--books that teach a generation of Christian men, already weakened by humanistic philosophy and biblical ignorance, to look anywhere other than the pages of the Bible for guidance--have a seductive appeal to the flesh--a poisoning effect in the already deceitful and desperately wicked heart of man. \\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not wild about Wild at Heart","review":"John Eldredge wants us to believe that Jesus wants men to be like William Wallace in Braveheart. His idea, simply, is that men are warriors and Jesus' desire is for each of us to find our way back to that place- Doing battle, Going on Adventures and Winning a beauty.He offers primarily celluloid theology, substituting movie scripts for scripture and the actions of William Wallace, James Bond and others for the lessons of the Christ. He never offers to reconcile his thesis with the words from the sermon on the mount- that happy men are made from those who mourn, are meek and make peace.While his ideas about healing the wounds left on us by the past hold great merit, trying to find that healing in film plots instead of Christ's words falls far short of where today's Christian men need to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic gift","review":"I appreciate and like John Eldredge's style and personal insight from other books of his I have read.

A strong word yes, but unfortunately authors and speakers such as Eldredge have only helped to promote sexism and gender stereotyping.

I am appalled, and yes I am frightened, that some well-known teachers and writers have endorsed this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a crock...","review":"This book has to be one of the most annoyingly offensive books that I have ever read in my life. Not only is scripture misinterpreted, but the author actually believes that certain activities, such as fishing, hiking, and beating the crap out of each other is what makes you a \\"real\\" man. John Eldredge has so much animosity towards \\"nice guys\\", that he compares them to Mr. Rogers and makes other such demeaning comments. If you don't hunt elk or go rock climbing, then you are made out to be totally worthless.Well, I hate fishing. I occasionally enjoy a good hike, but I'm not crazy about it. I'm really not crazy about fighting, either. I guess I have a long way to go, according to Mr. Eldredge. Words cannot express how much I hate this book.Don't waste your time reading this piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie Review","review":"See \\"Faith Plus One\\" episode of South Park.(I wasn't going to compare this guy's book to a cartoon, but he already took my Braveheart/Bible analogy.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Little Over the Top","review":"The claims that Eldredge makes are a little hard to believe such as the comparison of God to William Wallace. God is loving, merciful, and beautiful while he says that he is a warrior that is filled with anger towards his people. To me this is too much. He also makes claims that women were not a factor in many past movements and claims that men are the one's that always stop hate and evil in the world. But the fact is that women started the anti-slavery movement and also men were the ones that started the institution of slavery. This is just one example of women stopping slavery and men creating hate. He says that there are too many nice guys in the Christian world and he sees that as a bad thing. Nice does not equal weakness. But there are some good points which address the issue of standing up for what you believe in. This is a testostrone packed work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simplistic and one-dimensional","review":"Eldridge's attempt to revitalize Christian masculinity is well intentioned, and I cannot deny the obvious passion with which he writes. In many men Eldridge rekindles the fire for God that has been smothered in our current culture.However, his concept of \\"wild\\" masculinity fails to go beyond the Braveheart, sword-wielding, strap-a-machine-gun-to-my-Hummer-and-take-off-for-a-weekend-into-the-mountains-hunting-cougars view of masculinity.His point is this: Live passionately. What he says, however, does not encourage spiritual growth among men as much as it tries to bring us back to our caveman roots. For a more balanced look at Masculine Spirituality, try Arnold's \\"Wildmen, Warriors, and Kings.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrified at the madness","review":"It's frightening how many thugs I know who have used this book as an excuse to return to their mindlessly violent approach to life, freed at last from normal Christian restraints at least to imitate civilized behavior. The function of religion throughout human history has been, in part, to mitigate this sort of barbarian thuggery. Now John Eldredge has turned the thuggery loose once again on the world. He should be ashamed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"INSANITY AT HEART","review":"This is one of the most illogical books I've had the misfortune to start reading. It landed in the trash before page 99 and that was only because I was being fair. It started to leap out of my hand and toward the fire within the first few pages but I overcame the desire to be wild at heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Load Of Crap","review":"It's really sad that a topic with so much promise has been handled by such a poor writer. It seems as if this book was hastily assembled from a collection of random thoughts without any structure or purpose. By mentioning God and quoting bible verses the author hides behind the shield that gives all good christians protection from criticism justly deserved in this case. What a load of crap. If you think this book is great then buddy, you got problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strong on Movie References....not Bible References","review":"I was eagerly looking forward to reading this book because I have been struggling with what the Bible truly says about how to be a good husband, father, and man in general. I often see people confusing the role of the man with what society says and was looking for a good Biblical viewpoint on it. After reading Eldredge's book, I was left disappointed. I felt that he was writing from a soapbox more than from experience and research. I didn't actually go back and count but it certainly felt like he referenced movies more than he did the Bible. Finally, while he tried to be balanced in his description of men, his descriptions came out more stereotyped as those guys that like to hunt, camp, wrestle, etc.Overall, I do think that this book could be good for many men and women out there, but not for those looking for a Biblical perspective on what it means to be a man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wild at Heart by John Eldridge","review":"I ordered 4 copies of this book and all arrived in excellent condition and in a very timely manner! Shipped by Time Out Books, would use them again without hesitation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Revolutionary Thinking for Men","review":"This book amazed me and hit me at my core. Eldredge was able to put into words feelings and ideas that I have struggled with for years. He nails many of the problems the \\"good guys\\" of today face and examines the origin of the mixed signals we are bombarded with. More importantly he gives us answers and points us in the right direction to make important changes in the way we feel about ourselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Loving Look into the Hearts of Men and Women","review":"This publication offers a loving and spiritual explanation of the earlier philosophy behind MEN ARE FROM MARS WOMEN ARE FROM VENUS, which left me with the feeling of, \\"Well, so what are we supposed to do with this information?\\"John Eldredge offers a brilliant understanding of God's ultimate plan in the creation of men and women, their unique differences, and how we can lovingly adjust and adapt to build stronger bonds and more nurturing relationships between the two genders."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get it now.","review":"I loved Wild At Heart so much I went out and bought 10 copies to give away.

GREAT PURCHASE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A biography of a man's soul","review":"I first read Wild at Heart about 6 years ago, and it deeply affected my life as a teenager, trying to figure out manhood and what it meant to really be a man of God. This book brought back memories of the first time I read it, in a nicer presentation, and some newer and updated content revisions. It really takes an in-depth look at the emotions (yes, men do have them) and energies that drive a man to do what he does - I felt like I was reading a biography of my soul. Love this book, and have given several copies away to other young men of the faith that I do life with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wild At Heart By John Elderedge","review":"A five star book that every man should read. Elderedge shows men how to restore the passion and God-given masculinity that so many of us today are missing. I liked his use of popular movies. They bring his ideas to life in a way that the every guy can relate and connect with. I think that one of the biggest problems that men face today, one of the biggest battles that we have to fight is passivity, and Wild At Heart brings out the answer to this and many other issues common to men; it describes how we were created to be, wild."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go to the source instead...","review":"If you want to know how to be a good Christian man...read the New Testament. This book skips the parts about \\"the greatest of these is love\\" and \\"turn the other cheek\\" and \\"blessed are the peacemakers\\" and many, many others. It is riddled with stereotypes and poor interpretation of scripture. The author takes outdated notions of what it means to be a man and tries to pass them off as biblical truth. It takes a lot more courage and wisdom to be one of the \\"nice guys\\" that the author disparages than it does to be one of his \\"wild at heart warriors.\\" This is a hurtful and destructive view of manhood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book EVER","review":"This has got to be the worse book ever written. The author states that everyone has a wound and and the wound is nearly always given by his father. What a bunch of BS. My Father loved me. Neither I nor my siblings have any stupid wound from our Father. Neither does my wife nor my friends. I thought we were to respect our parents, not lie the responisiblity for my screwed up life on them.My wound is the result of the sinful nature into which I was born.Also, I don't need to be Grizzly Adams to have a relationship with God. I don't need to go out into nature to find God. I find God sitting in front of my urban office in the wee hours in the morning, praying to the God of my salvation.Do yourself a favor...don't even open this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average","review":"Eldredge does a good job of tapping into Christian consumerism with his hit book, \\"Wild at Heart.\\" John is a great speaker who uses current hit movies to augment his messages. Wild at Heart was an adventure in the obvious. If you are a man, act like a man. If you don't act like a man, you are not Wild at Heart according to John. I agree with some portions of this, but I also believe that we all must act as we are wired to act based on personality.Are there differences between men and women? Sure, but are there guys who like to shop? Yes. Are there women who like to play football? Yes.So, this is not a bad book, this is not a good book - it is a book, and again, really just emphasizes the obvious. Read Away! JVD"},{"rating":"1","title":"hey guys, like lattes? eldredge says you're a pansy","review":"As a twenty-something heterosexual man who owns a miniature poodle and enjoys strawberry margaritas and massages, I don't really identify with much of this book.Eldredge, bless his heart, is so frantic to prove this idea of macho masculinity that he grasps at any and all Biblical content that can be twisted into proving his point. Quite simply, his exegesis is hurried and his hermeneutic is careless.In the end, there seems to be no focus or point at all. It's just a fountain of strangeness. There are much better works on Christian manhood available. Practically anything is better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the read","review":"John Eldredge is writing from a fundamentalist perspective, and is part of the backlash against the feminist movement among other things.The following are my major concerns with Eldredge's book:1) Eldredge speaks right past anthropological scholarship that regards gender as a social construction.2) Eldredge takes stereotypes of masculinity and femininity and makes them normative and ordained by God.3) Furthermore, Eldredge's stereotypes are rooted in sexist notions of manhood and womanhood.4) Eldredge uses decontextualised texts from the Bible to uncritically support his argument.May I suggest an alternative, a book more rooted in Scripture and scholarship than 'Wild at Heart'; namely, 'New Adam' by Philip Culbertson.New Adam: The Future of Male Spirituality"},{"rating":"1","title":"Irresponsible at Heart","review":"Sadly there will be many people who take heed of Mr. Eldredge's hypocritical and irresponsible interpretaion of a Christian man.In Mr. Eldredge's view a Christian father encourages his children to use violence to solve problems. Even for a kindergarten student, (this is his advice!)I am disappointed and enraged that I read this book with hopes of some inspiration. The views that are presented are so absurd they border on sensational. Maybe Mr. Eldredge is the real poser and is chuckling all the way to the bank.If you want to be a good man and a role model for your children do not buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wild at Heart","review":"One of the most profound and enlightening books I have ever read!

All of the Promise Keepers stuff, Ed Cole, Gordon MacDonald, etc.This is nothing but pop psychology packaged for Christians. I have never read a book that I have more visceral disagreement with than Wild at Heart.This is not Christian and it is not helpful. It appeals to men (you can't sell a couple million copies without general appeal). However, I found him contrary to biblical teaching and personal experience.If you believe that you should embrace your \\"warriorhood\\" and challenge the world, this is probably the book for you.If you believe in forgiveness, submission and embracing the fruit of the Spirit, this is probably not the right book for you.He did write a book that caused me to think about what it means to be a Christian man, father, husband and leader. The more I thought about Jesus' teaching and compared it to the gospel according to Eldridge, the more I saw this as a pop psychology tome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow...","review":"I actually haven't even finished all of the book yet, but I just couldn't help myself to write a review. It is truly an amazing book that all men (and even women...yes, women!) should read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Someone is making sense for a change.","review":"I only read the exerpt but if the entire book follows the message that Christian men are being taught to be just 'nice' but that should not be the 'limit' of his self. Free expression of being the man God created him to be should be the goal. We are losing the dreams of our childhood 'who we want to be when we grow up' and it's turning Christians into automatons. God is a wonderful 'Creator' - making us all unique but Christianity seems to be propagating the notion that we should all be the same, lose our dreams and become a part of the one. Careful what you are believing people. If this book propogates being true to your true 'self' and believing in God at the same time then read on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Insight","review":"This book is written for men but should be read by every wife or wife to be - even young Christian women who are dating. It truly gives an insight into what may be on a man's heart or what may have wounded his heart. This insight can be invaluable to the strength of the relationship and the understanding of the wife's role in the man's life. This could result in a more meaningful and deeper marriage relationship!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't give up","review":"I agree with another reviewer's comment. The first few chapters were interesting but really didn't speak to me. I'm not the out-doorsy kind of man.However, further into the book (especially the last half) I was really moved and was made to reconsider many things. I hate to use buzz words but I had a paradigm shift. I'm working to include this in our church's discipleship training courses."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't bother","review":"The book seems to be based primarily on popular psychology and over simplified cliches.

I also suggested my dauthters read it. Good, interesting read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spot On","review":"I read some of the one star reviews and was floored. At first it made me angry, and then just sad that a few people can't absorb this. A lot of critics hated T.S. Elliot too. Elliot's response was that to understand his writing, you had to have read what he's read in the order that he's read it. An impossible feat, yes?His point was that everybody's not going to like his stuff---and he was cool with that.I have been a Christian since I was 7, Sunday school teacher, choir member, missions worker, committee leader etc., I've run the gamut of Sunday morning rituals. These are all beautiful and Godly things. But don't think for a moment that your heart cannot be lulled to sleep/or exhaustion doing \\"service\\" work.This book helped me rediscover something I had that was important to God. My heart.

I read it about 2 months ago and I don't even really remember what it was about - other than that men should reclaim their wild heart. It was certainly not a life-changing experience for me. It was an interesting easy read - something I'd take to the beach with me. I didn't agree with all he had to say about women - how we don't want to be independant etc. I don't think that's true.

It exposes the lies that have kept so many men from becomming what God made them to be, fully devoted followers, and fully ALIVE! It hits at the heart of why so many men are not really living at all, but just trying to \\"do the right thing\\" day after day. Sure, you end up nice, but dead inside.

Everything after that is redundant; the author says the same thing with different emphasis. The point that he seems to be making is that you can be a Christian and behave like a man, providing your behavior is tempered by Christian idealism. The author is affronted by the concept of \\"being a nice guy\\" as if that is somehow evil. In short, this is a book worth buying, reading and sharing.

I highly recommend this book to men and women. Jesus said 'whom the Son sets free is free indeed', we as Christians are not to live bound and linked to our past. If we are new creatures in Christ old things have passed away. Unfortunately for the majority of us this is not the case. We remain deeply tied and bound to our past. This book is the beginning for a new release and freedom for men who have a warped worldy view of manhood, and for the women in their lives. This book would make a good book for a men's Bible study or discipleship class. All women who are looking to marry or are already married should get a copy for themselves. You have to read this book more than once.My only issue- some of the examples are cave manish, but this book is for men so I dealt with it. Other than that, excellent book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Follow Christ, not your heart!","review":"The late great Rich Mullins penned the song \\"Maker of Noses.\\" The lyrics drive home the criticism of the premise of this book.

Then Mullins points out, But the Father of hearts and the Maker of noses and the giver of dreams He's the one I have chosen and I will follow Him.This book would have been more useful if it would have been presented as a secular study and not a Christian work. His use of Scripture is minimal and terribly misused. His references to \\"R\\" rated films turns this into psychobabble. Still, I added one star because some of his points about validation and risk are worth pondering.Bottom line--don't follow your heart, follow HIM."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Biblical analysis","review":"Eldridge attempts too much to draw on modern, cultural perceptions on men and women. Though he may have some good ideas with varying degrees of merit, his sources are almost all Hollywood movies and when he does use the Bible, his interpretation and insight is shallow, strangely skewed, and taken out of context.some points for considerationIt is strange how he openly advocates violence, telling his son to resort to violenceThough he says he does not advocate open theism, he claims that God is the biggest risk taker of all, who gave man free will as a risk. This is simply false because it means that God does not know events in the future. This of course is ridiculous.This is too seeker sensitive and is an example of the strange winds of doctrine Paul warned against. It is merely a fad that will not last due to lack of Biblical merit.I recommend Recovering Biblical Manhood and Womanhood: A Response to Evangelical Feminism by John Piper and Wayne Grudem"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for women too","review":"This book was given to me by a guy friend to help me understand my husband better and did it ever! It helped me vocalize many of the feelings I had been having about our relationship and how my husband deals with things. It also helped me vocalize to my husband my feelings about me as a Christian woman and what I desired from him as a Christian man. It is a quick read but some of the first chapters were kind of slow to me. They were more towards the male readers. The best chapter for me was The Wound. I also liked the way it brought in everyday life. Not everyone goes to church every Sunday and Wednesday. I did find it enlightening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Originally Spiritual","review":"I loved this book. John Eldredge does an excellent job of addressing the apparent contradictions in being a man and being a Christian. I love how he speaks to the adventurer in all men and seems to have an empathetic sixth sense. I was skeptical of the book when I received it as a gift, but after the first chapter it was tough to put down. Eldredge explores how it is in the nature of men to adventure, battle, and look for women to woo. He also explains how these are all Christian virtues that both society and the church have neglected, forgotten, or found inconvenient."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incorrect Amazon Listing!!","review":"Do NOT buy this Amazon listing!

Everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wild at Heart","review":"This is such a good book for every man and all the women with special men in their lives. The premise of the book is that men are not domestic animals; God did not make men exactly like women but today's society is trying to feminize men. Eldredge says that the adventure, rowdiness, and risk loving nature of men has become a condition to be cured. Men need a battle to live and die for. My husband says the book is true to how he feels it is to be a man with a Y chromosome. He has talked about this book ever since I met him so when I got the opportunity to review the newly released copy, I was all for it. With 2 sons and a husband, I knew I needed to learn a little more about how men work. I feel like it has given me more respect and understanding toward my husband. I understand now why my husband feels like he isn't fulfilled in his quest to provide for his family and live out his purpose by just sitting behind a desk all day. I hope this book helps me be a better mom to my boys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, thought provoking book","review":"Enjoyed most of this book. In the sections where the author regurgitates dogma, his opinions become predictable, muddy, and sometimes backwards (gender roles, physical aggression, etc), but most of the book is sufficiently enlightened to be thought provoking, useful, and invigorating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrongly Dividing the Word of Truth","review":"John Eldredge has written a book that justifies his lifestyle of macho-ism by changing scripture to meet his own capitalistic intentions. This is Sacrilege 101. I can handle honest disagreement over the interpretation of scripture. I cannot handle someone intentionally mis-stating scripture in order to change the meaning of the passages in question. The Jesus of the Bible was a very different man than the Jesus of Wild at Heart..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seductive, mistaken","review":"Eldredge takes Robert Bly's \\"Iron John\\" and attempts to Christianize it. He does this without discernment, keeping the disparagement for order and commitment, and celebrating \\"wildness\\" and \\"adventure.\\" One can almost hear Bly's sneering dismissal of office workers.Eldredge is an actor, and a seminar-speaker, and this book is an infomercial. Unhappily, to many Christian men, a few bible verses, and a \\"Christian\\" publisher are an imprimatur - and they are starting study groups at their church.This book is to be avoided. Eldredge is not a \\"wildman\\" - he is aping the worst of popular culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Life Changing","review":"All I can say is WOW! my life is so much better now.

Eldredge makes this book friendly for women trying to understand where men are going and what they are thinking in their journey with God. I found it helpful for myself in my own walk with the Lord as well as more understanding about the men I knew reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Self Help meets Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus meets How to Raise Boys","review":"As a woman, I found this book to be very captivating. Each chapter offers something extra that I hadn't expected. In one chapter I gained a lot of insight about men in general, another about marriage, and a third offered insight into raising boys. Not only does Eldredge talk about how men have lost their true self and what it is, but he also shares a little about a woman's true self. Wild at Heart suggests that having a good male role model is one of the most important things a child can have, regardless of gender. It will either make them or it will break them. Unfortunately, the latter is most often the case. The only hope to fix this epidemic is for a man to understand his role as a man, as God created him, and for society to allow him to be that man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christian Men and life","review":"I got this book because a friend of mine mentioned he was reading Another book my Gordon Dalbey \\"Healing the Masculine Soul\\" so when I came to amazon below there was a mention of this book, Wild at Heart. I thank God I found this book, at this time in my Christian walk Im going through some difficult times and this book basically touched on several of the challenges I'm going through, no author is prefect except Almighty God, but there is some great wisdom and experiences that John shares in the book. The only problem/suggestions I see with it is that there is a lot of focus of you as the reader, basically who you should take action, action which is true, but to a certain extent. I dont know if I see God as a Risk taker but he is faithful, loving, strong, powerful,but John did write an amazing book, I recommend it, keep reading your bible daily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly Spiritual Junk Food","review":"There might be other books that are more dangerous to the faith of a Christian, but this one is mainly junk food feeding male stereotypes.

Instead of focusing all of ourselves on Jesus, the author writes this book to boost ourselves up and at one point almost advocates open theism. If everyone who reads these kinds of books, or any books for that matter, would do as God directed and analyze everything against the scriptures, we would be better off and not so easily distracted by false doctrines."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wild at Heart - Wild, with a Great Description of a Man's Soul","review":"What a great book! Eldridge explains what makes a man's heart tick and why - and, in my humble opinion, is very accurate with that description. He reveals why a man thinks the way he thinks, does what he does, explains why churchs, religous groups, and even the ladies often miss the mark...This book, which I am studying in a church-sponsored men's group, has opened my eyes to why I am - and has even brought tears to my eyes as I learn that I'm not really all that strange, nor am I alone.I thank God that Eldredge was chosen to explain the male's heart and soul from this angle...BarryBat"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for moms of boys","review":"This book was referred to in a sermon series at my church. While this isn't the book's primary purpose, it is a great source of understanding for moms of boys. Why is everything (blinking/not blinking, jumping, throwing a rock - everything) a competition? What drives some of those characteristics that are (mostly) unique to the male species? This book is a great insight into why men are the way they are.

Really.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"Great Awakening\\", not only for the Christian","review":"After just graduating from Bible College, it was nice to read a book of my choosing and not a \\"have to\\" read. This book hit on some of the things that so many of us want to ask or say but too often are afraid to. It is truly a must read for any man or woman, adult or teen. The topics that John Eldridge brings out truly draws out the fact of what causes the relationship boundries that so many men have set and goes a step further by showing why they are there, why they are set and how to take them away. These boundaries are not just set to keep others out but to keep ourselves in. It has changed my perspective of what a man really should be and how to get to that point. Whether an individual is involved in Christian ministry, a church lay-person, a corporate executive, or a stocker at a grocery store, this book will give forth a new light of one's self and their image of themself. If you want to see changes in your life for the better, read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"did not get what was listed in the Amazon description","review":"The product description on Amazon listed that I would get volumes 1 and 2, both Wild at Heart and Captivating.

I DO, however, strongly object to his portrayal of women. In reducing us to \\"beauties\\" to be \\"rescued,\\" he makes women objects instead of people (despite trying to claim otherwise). The additional, sublte implication that a woman's value is in her looks doesn't even bear thinking about. Furthermore, he claims that a woman's method for getting things done is to seduce her man into doing them (yes, he literally uses the word seduce). I could hardly believe, when I read it, that anyone would actually say such a thing. I will be a hero and a warrior in my own right, thank you very much, Mr. Eldrege. The Church has a long history of doing wrong by women, and it saddens me deeply to see such wrongs continued."},{"rating":"1","title":"biblically grounded?","review":"christian audience will rush to buy any book that claims to be biblically grounded.

I had several problems with the book, but the main one is that the entire book is based off of a bad theological premise. Eldredge makes the assumption that since the Bible says that Adam was placed in the garden, that he was created outside of the garden of Eden (not a bad assumption at all). But because of that, all men have always longed for the outdoors, wilderness and adventure. That seems to be a pretty big jump to me. Besides the fact of the many guys I know who are incredibly Godly men who don't long to be in the wilderness...this book implies that they aren't really living like the man God created them to be.I've heard great things about Eldredge's other books, including Waking the Dead, but I'm aphrehensive about spending my money on them after my disappointment with this one"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wild at Heart: Discovering the Secret of a Man's Soul","review":"This is an exceptionally good book on CD. It is read by the author with passion. I learned so much about how men struggle to know themselves. As a woman, it was very helpful to me to understand my husband of 33 years and my son age 30. I listened to this CD a good dozen times and I learned something new each time. The book tells men what women really need from them and will help men understand them as well.

I read this book at my mid-life crisis and it cleared everything up as to why I was thinking certain things, feeling certain ways. It has really confirmed what God was showing me in my quiet time.There is no teaching today about the heart of man, from the perspective of God, and what role it plays in our fallen and redemed state; the many scripture references on God and the heart.The really great thing, is our true self can only be discovered with intimacy with our heavenly Father. It makes life so much easier to live. It has really blessed my marriage and broght us closer because I no longer have to draw my strength soley from my wife. In this \\"crisis\\" she did not have what I needed. Rather, God is now my source and I can pour His strength back into my wife.

Of course, there is no better model for a man than Jesus Himself and the all sufficient word of God.

Do not read this book if you are just interested in \\"information\\" or looking to \\"expand\\" your views.It is a dangerous book. You will WANT your heart back.

So if you want to know the various format options to printf for example, you have to leaf through to find the right page in the appendix. Once you've found the entry in the appendix, there is no summary of the function, just a prototype and a Chapter number. So to get to a good description of a function, you find the appendix, leaf through it to find the most appropriate chapter and then leaf through that chapter. Totally unacceptable for a book marketed at the experienced programmer.Sections are called \\"Start Up!\\", \\"Take That!\\" and \\"Go Ahead!\\", which illustrates how unhelpful and inappropriate the layout and format of this book is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Star of Buffalo music scene","review":"Wendell's performances in western new york have been the hit music events of the summer.

The book was primarily sex scenes with bits of action thrown in. The sex was graphic at times, but never in a scorching, sexy way. The tone seemed to lean towards funny, but the humor mostly falls flat.The story is about a werewolf named Devlin who needs to find his one true mate in order to rule his clan. The mate is Tala, who falls for him even though her common sense tells her not to. Enter a brother who wants to stop their love in order to become ruler himself and a band of shifter hunters they all must escape.Sadly, there was nothing to distinguish this book from any other shifter tale other than a few minor gay and bisexual characters written into the novel with no purpose.

I wanted something more factual and simply a straightforward historical reference guide for the non-religious. Something that would simply make a comparison bewteen facts in history and claims fo Brown. Also, too long. And, in my opinion, too expensive.This book, I must say though, is better than the one by Garlow and Barnes.But I'd try Abanes' short volume \\"The Truth Behind the Da Vinci Code,\\" especially for non-scholars out there. Abanes is a bestselling, cutting-edge author who writes more for the popular market, gets to the point, and has great documentation. And it retail's for only $6.99 (JUST released)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A startling omission","review":"Buyer beware: This book does not deal with the question of Leonardo da Vinci's art at all.

And neither author seems to know much more than what they have heard in sunday school or read in a modernized badly translated bible.The DaVinci Code offers readers glimpses of well-known and well-documented stories of christinaity and its origins.

The Da Vinci Code is a work of fiction, and this book tries to poke the many holes in THAT dreadful work of art. But how do you refute a work of fiction by using the same source? What I mean is, the Da Vinci code is basically saying the Bible does not tell the whole story. Ok, fine, but how is Bock's book going to refute Brown's work by using the Bible and scriptures as it's main source? The Bible is what they are arguing, so you cannot use the source of the problem as the answer. They are like two children saying \\"Did not!\\", \\"Did to!\\", and so on. It's just poor research.

VOLUME 2 NOT MUCH BETTER THAN 1!","review":"I saw Kiss in '78 and they had an amazing stage show. It's a shame the footage doesn't look or sound better on this set. Volume one wasn't any better. It's pretty low grade and this should not be the case as these shows go into the 90's! There should be better video available for shows this late. If they only had the forthought back then to record these shows better. It's hard to believe Kiss would not realize how important good quality footage would be now! This band spent so much money on a fantastic stage shows but, then they didn't tape the shows with top quality cameras? If these shows were professionally done they would have sold 100 times over this release and would be an incredible legacy left by the band. I'm glad to have it, but it should have been way better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"kissology","review":"I enjoyed two of the three disc's in this set; but unfortunatly the second disc did not want to load.

To eliminate the elevator entrance on the 79 \\"Return Of KISS\\" Tour in Largo is truly a disappointment. I wish KISS would consult a fan about what is worthy or not.

Like other fans though I would have loved to have seen the Animalize Live Uncencored concert on here.

Other than that it was a fantastic DVD.P.S. My favorite part was after the credits there is a short video Eric Carr made while he was in the hospital.

He weaves the intricacies of yoga into a picture beginning with the tree and connecting the tree's parts to all the different parts of yoga. It is filled with simplicity and humanness. His knowledge and experience of 80 plus years is weaved together to create a complete understanding of the history of yoga to how to practice it with more wisdom. Mr. Iyengar is an inspiration to those of us who don't intend to give up family, career and laptops to live on mountain tops. He assures us that living as a married man and as a father has not diminished his practice but has enhanced it. A must for beginner and advanced students and teachers for your bookshelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Iyengar book","review":"This is a great book for the new and the familiar to yoga. This compilation of lectures is a more philosophical look at his yoga, unlike the more technical books Light on Yoga and Light on Pranayama.

This enables the reader to take in the theme and then spend time considering its importance for his or her practice or teaching. Never has Iyengar been more digestible.

Amazon will only give a refund if the the package is unopened, however, how is anyone able to discover that there is a deleted scene without viewing it first??Overall the editing is getting poorer with abrupt scene cut-ins / outs, rather than professional fading shots at the commercial break slots.With these flaws its not worth the money to buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little House on the Prairie dvds","review":"I was very pleased with the timely service of receiving the dvd I ordered and I would be happy to order from you again."},{"rating":"2","title":"LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE","review":"AS WITH TOUCHED BY AN ANGEL & HIGHWAY TO HEAVEN THIS ALSO NEEDS NO INTRODUCTION.I RECENTLY BOUGHT THE LAST 6 SEASONS I NEEDED TO COMPLETE MY COLLECTION ALL AT ONE TIME,IN ORDER TO WATCH THEM BACK TO BACK.GROWING UP WATCHING THESE AND WATCHING THEM NOW SEEMS LIKE SEEING EM FOR THE FIRST TIME.ANYTHING WITH MICHAEL LANDON IN IT IS GOOD.I LOVE HIM & ALWAYS.I MISS YOU MICHAEL,THAT'S WHY I NAME MY SON AFTER YOU."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny thing the press and PR","review":"Our PR is the truth.

For example, instead of the more accurate instruction in 4:34 that husbands should \\"beat\\" their wives and slave girls (when they are suspected of disobedience), Ali renders the passge \\"beat them [lightly]\\". The unwarranted addition of the word \\"lightly\\" is the translator's attempt to soften the impact of this horribly barbaric verse.For those who feel they have some reason to read the Qur'an, here are a couple of more accurate translations:1) M.A.S. Abdel Haleem (Oxford University Press)2) N.J. Dawood (Penguin Classics)"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best translations of the holy Quran","review":"This is one the best translations availabe.

Prof. Laycock exposes the book's serious, multiple errors of fact.

It is about a boy named Tom that everyone called the great brain. He was very smart and liked to outsmart other people, but only if he got money for doing it. He could outsmart every kid in town and most adults. The Great Brain wasn't very likable--he took people's things, especially money, and he made fools of people. But what he did was entertaining. He put his great brain to work on how to swindle someone to get what he wanted. What motivated him to do this was his money loving heart. In this book he is involved in the buried treasure swindle, the horse race, and the chute the chute (a thrill ride). In all of those he gets money. I really think you should read his book because the characters each have an interesting, believable personality, The swindles he pulls off are fun to read about, and it is a really funny book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The music is nice but.....","review":"There is hardly any singing in this one.

My favorite is \\"Breath of Love\\", a haunting melody, that reminds me of the pain and joy of love. This song is sad and yet hopeful, somehow. The artist uses different instrumental sounds in these songs, giving one a sense of movement, of being \\"in\\" the songs, part of the story the music tells.

It's a great book for those who are skeptical about capitalism and how the whole process works in a free society."},{"rating":"2","title":"Defending Capitalism","review":"In \\"Capitalism and Commerce,\\" Edward W. Younkins provides a clear and understandable defense of capitalism. The book covers such topics as: the individual, communities, the proper role of the state, law and justice. The author calls for a \\"return to the political and economic foundations upon which our nation was born.\\" Dr. Younkins rightly contends that society should be based on a commitment to individual freedom, the free market, and the right to private property. It is through these methods that we can overcome the \\"obstacles to a free society.\\" I recommend this book to any \\"seeker of the truth.\\" \\"Capitalism and Commerce\\" is both well thought-out and well written.

My mother loved Mahalia Jackson, so I grew up listening to her in vinyl round the clock it seemed. I actually thought I couldn't stand to hear another Mahalia Jackson song as long as I lived. But as an adult, I found myself humming some of the songs my mother had played over and over, and one day I realized I missed Mahalia's voice. When I bought these collections of hers, I actually went searching specifically for Mahalia Jackson music. Imagine my mother's surprise when I told her I had Mahalia Jackson blasting in my house the way she'd done when I was growing up! :-) There are still more Mahalia Jackson songs that I'm looking for that, in all the songs on these collections, weren't included.

Songs like \\"Great Gettin Up Morning,\\" \\"Elijah Rock,\\" \\"I Will Move Up A Little Higher,\\" \\"If We Never Needed The Lord Before (We Sure Do Need Him Now),\\" \\"God Put A Rainbow In The Sky,\\" and many, many others confirm the need for all gospel music lovers to own this record."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great voice to listen to!","review":"Too bad she didn't have the instrumental backup of today, it would have been 5-stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"MAHALIA JACKSON, GOSPELS, SPIRITUALS AND HYMNS","review":"Purchased with 2 other of Jackson's CD's we found this one to be the most disappointing.

She's not that bad, but the movie itself is bad. The plot is boring and too predictable. Of course this is only a movie, but I've watched other movies and though something called fate or luck seem to take place, they don't seem half as unnatural as the one in this movie. It seem that the storyline made as if the two main characters were somehow brought together by the director, or the writer, rather than by fate itself. I don't know if this movie was supposed to be a comedy, but I didn't find it funny at all. Also, the fact that they both had lovers already at the time made it kinda lame.

His name is on currency that, if fate speaks, will find its way into her hands. I like John Cusack a lot and Kate Beckinsale is a very good ingenue type.

When the Kate Beckindale character won't give the John Cusack character her phone number or name, unless they have a sign from \\"fate\\", I was hoping he would throw up his hands in digust and decide to go be in a better movie. Alas. The idea the the female lead's behavior is forgivable or even acceptable is just plain wrong. This sort of belief in \\"fate\\" is what leads some people to disregard real happiness right in front of them for some distant ideal which may never materialize.

A chance meeting, enchatment at first sight, a chance on fate, a twist of bad luck followed by love's refusal to drift off into the sunset despite all odds and all rationality add up to a spellbinding movie that, all by itself, makes up for every single romantic comedy that's tried to be this good and fell far short.

Back then Beckinsale was a new comer, now shes done all that \\"accent\\" stuff, like the gypsy with wolverine and patsy cline with that fly boy. In Serendipity, these two actors make a nice flick. The eyes work, but they wouldnt make a couple in real life. Not like James Van Der Beek and Katie Holmes if it werent for that show they did, what was it? Another cheese ball corn job drama.

It's supposed to be far-fetched, and you're supposed to go along with it.Assuming you do, you'll have a wonderful time, because this one's put together very, very well. Fine performances from Cusack and Beckinsale in the leads are nearly lost amid the excellent performance by the supporting cast: Jeremy Piven as the loquacious obituary-writer-best-man, Molly Shannon as the oddly \\"earthbound\\" new-ager, Eugene Levy as the obstinate store clerk, John Corbett as the free-spirited musician boyfriend, and even a small, uncredited cameo appearance from Buck Henry.To describe the plot at all is to do this film a disservice.

Instead she writes it in a book which she says she'll give to a bookstore and it's his job to find it. We then see them several years later as they are both about to marry other people.

And fly across the country in search of her the night before his wedding? What!???? Talk about unrealistic! And to think that someone as hot as Kate Beckinsale would still be on the market after 3 years is highly unlikely. Though romantic saps will love this movie, it is far too improbable and out of reach for my tastes. This movie is so unlikely, I can't even classify it as a fairy tale.

Was this movie a trade-off for other projects they wanted to do? All four are accomplished, smart, talented actors but this flick was a D - O - G dog.

The film is sweet and funny and features the always-good and grossly underrated Jeremy Piven as Cusack's sidekick.Normally a film that relied on coincidence as much as this does would bother me, but since the very theme is that of fate, destiny and happy accidents, it actually works in the movie's favor.

The fact that he is best known as Weird Al Yankovic's bass player in what reviewers have called \\"the ultimate cover band\\" is a shame when one knows what talent lies beyond Jay's work with Yankovic. With every Stephen Jay CD bought on Amazon, it's refreshing to know that more people will become aware of Jay's creativity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring fluff fanfiction","review":"I read this while it was still on [...] and that says a lot about this book.

I thought the the red/yellow/green stopligh visual would make this book a nice reference book, although I knew up front that the descriptions of some of the conditions were not entirely accurate. In reality, I found that I had to spend a great deal of time correcting the textbook each time we covered a new chapter. This text doesn't even begin to cover current pathophysiology, which I think is important so that students can begin to think about what causes disease, rather than just memorize a list of conditions where massage isn't indicated. I found many of the references questionable. We expect massage therapists to have a good scientific knowledge of the human body, why shouldn't they have an equally scientific knowledge of pathology? I will not teach with this textbook again."},{"rating":"1","title":"an embarrassment for mosby---no stars","review":"mosby should be ashamed for printing this book without having had a living breathing editor look at this thing! my massage school decided to switch pathology books for our semester. we all shelled out top dollar for this piece of junk which had just been published at the time (yes, that's six years ago and i'm still annoyed, guess i need a massage) and then had to go purchase a different book because this was so un-helplful. glaring typos and poorly written. while i am not an expert on pathology nor a writer, i have worked in a medical library for many years and have a good idea of what constitutes a quality book of this type. this ain't it folks."},{"rating":"1","title":"This edition is garbage","review":"This edition has a dozen spelling errors on each page - looks like it was scanned without proofreading.

As far as the jokes and (not terribly) funny stories, they are rife with spelling errors, confusing paragraphs ( I honestly had trouble telling if Lutherans eat fruitcake or not) and other indications that this book needed some serious editing. Finally, by \\"Lutheran\\" the authors apparently mean \\"Scandinavian\\" as there isn't much mention of German-Americans in the book.

It's a bit wordy in places, and some examples are not entirely relevant to the average builder (who, besides the author and Burt Rutan, wants to build an asymmetrical design?).

Yet the larger issue he points out: that North America is culturall divided primarily by economics, but also by social outlook and culture, remains relevant and hauntingly accurate.Taken with a grain of salt to make allowances for the time that has passed since its publication (I, too, would welcome a revised edition), it is a fascinating read on America and largly remains relevant, particularly in the age of NAFTA and CAFTA."},{"rating":"2","title":"great cultural overview to give friends in Europe/Asia etc","review":"He discusses 9 different regions of America, with a map showing the boundaries.

There must be millions of movie fans who want subtitles/captions for different reasons, so I'm not sure how the studios think they are economizing by ignoring the wishes of a large segment of the market. I like to watch movies at low volume with the English subtitles turned on so I don't have to strain to catch all the dialog, while my wife is a non-native English speaker who needs subtitles.

Not only is it wonderfully written like his other work, but it brings out the demons that haunted him in his later days. It brings out some familiar characters from his past work, and shows how they've all changed, or grown out of their wilder youth. It is a deeply depressing book, because you want good things to happen to Jack, but he can't quite get it together and be happy. His description of his depression and alcoholism is haunting. Also the fact that he resents the \\"beat\\" label that is put upon him by society seems to torment him to the point to where he feels public shame. I would recommend this book to anyone, but if you haven't read any of his earlier work, you should read that first to get an understanding of it all. This is a great book and worth every bit of the praise that it has gotten and ever will get."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best descriptions of an alcoholic's suffering ...","review":"Nobody but Kerouac could describe the horror and suffering of alcoholism in lyrical, fluent prose. The opening pages show Kerouac's true gift as a writer. I often pick this book up at book stores and re-read the mesmerizing beginning where Jack wakes up 'all woe-begone and goopy' as the church bells play a mournful version of \\"I'll take you home again, Kathleen\\". He describes the alcoholic's hangover as the worst experience on earth -- like standing in pork blood as a 'mudman backbent monster' pulling 'a long hot burden to nowhere'. Atute readers will see hints of Jack's descent into depression and alcoholism in his earlier works. In \\"Big Sur\\" Jack openly acknowledges the nature of his suffering. Sadly, he would go on to drink himself to death. Kerouac's true gift lies in his original voice as an witer and not in being a joyful icon of the open road. \\"Big Sur\\" eloquently shows that the man suffered enormously."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tilting the bottle at Big Sur","review":"A very good and heartfelt book. One of Kerouac's best. Brave and awful in it's honesty... The cabin at Big Sur, Mien Mo Mountain, the beatniks of San Francisco, the fog, the surf, the canyons, the author sitting on the rocks alongside the Pacific Ocean and writing down all that the ocean tells him, the paranoid ravages of alcohol delirium tremens, the wild imaginings of all those evil forces out to get him, the agonizing, the haunting, the warlocks and the UFOs...Poor Jack suffered through it all--but by his on volition! Most of the time he was only \\"marginally there\\" but he still composed himself long enough for the writing of this novel. At the end of it all you wonder how he ever did it.--Alex Sydorenko, Chicago, 2001."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Other Side of The Beats","review":"This was a very interesting read. Just as Kerouac wrote the book in a very short period time, I read the book in a very short period. One and a half days, for me, is a short time to read an entire novel.

They took every zombie plot and put them all into this one movie. The gore ranges from normal \\"eating people\\" scenes to complex death scenes like a guy getting pulled in half. That looked REAL! Some of the gore scenes went on too long and the acting was bad in spots, but it was still a cool video for 15 bucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE DRIVE IN LIVES!!!","review":"Todd Sheets believes in real horror, horror for the fun and love of the genre. He is one of the few horror directors to produce good, fun, old fashioned horror flicks that the seventies produced. Zombie Bloodbath is a PHENOMENAL film in this respect. The low budget only adds to the fun, he is keeping the horror scene real, what most horror directors arent doing. (you should be ashamed Wes!!) This is the story of a new development by a Nuclear Plant in Kansas, we get meltdown, so we get ZOMBIES. and i mean ZOMBIES! There are scenes of extreme gore in this cult classic! In my opinion one of the best horror films of the decade. Highly recomended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Seductive vampire story","review":"Good movie.

I heard about it from a friend and immediately thought about giving it to my 75-year-old dad for his birthday. My dad is still really active--skiing, hiking, etc.--but over the past few years he has started looking and acting older. We've always told him that he needs to start doing some weight training to keep him strong and healthy, but he just never would. But after John Humble and the doctors explain it in the video, my dad is finally sold. He's been doing the regular weight training workouts for over a month and he feels and looks great.

Something about John speaks to our hearts and the yearning we have to continue to be attractive and strong, and his fitness program shows us how to accomplish this. One of the great things about the dvd is that there is a card included that you can take to the gym with you that outlines which exercises to perform and how to perform them. No question, this dvd will get you moving and definitely help you to improve your life. It did mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gift to my parents","review":"After watching the videos on the website I immediately knew I wanted to buy this DVD for my parents.

With the exception of the bonus tracks by Bennett and Joel added years later on CD, each song was a duet recorded with a popular country performer of the era - 1984. The album charted at #1, and four of the cuts were top 20 hits., but each and every cut got a great deal of airplay on country stations. Who else but Ray could land performers like Hank williams, Jr., Willie Nelson, George Jones, Johnny Cash, and (kneeling here) Merle Haggard? My favorite cut is \\"I Didn't See a Thing\\" with George Jones...ironic title...incredible performance. Totally inspired, fabulous, and unique.

It looks great and is built quite well, but it doesn't work well for simulators. The fundamental problem is that the auto-centering mechanism involves a concave metal ring that sits around the base of the stick. The friction induced by the movement of the ring against the base is significant, and make it incredibly hard to move the stick by very small amounts (as is necessary for maintaining level flight, for instance).In the end I got the Saitek PZ44 PRO FLIGHT YOKE SYSTEM GAME CONTROLLER instead, which doesn't have the same \\"sticking\\" problem, and is almost as accurate as the simulator controls at the local flight school."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love the throttle.","review":"This is a very nice combo. I came from using a single stick with a built in throttle. I had to set it on my lap to get the best angle for me. But this is great now that I can wet the suction cups and set them on my roll out keyboard drawer. Comparing it to my old stick the only thing that is bad is that it seems to have a bigger dead spot from going from the middle of the stick to the outer part and just getting use to the massive amount of buttons and where they are placed. I don't play any fancy flight sim games just Star Wars Galaxies and having all sorts of buttons on the throttle make it allot easier than having to reach for the keyboard. The only thing that I don't really like is that it's not force feedback."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Flight Control System","review":"Great piece of hardware.

Dozens of flights were interrupted by loss of power and watching the aircraft crash because of loss of control.Then when I attempted to contact Saitek we discovered their forums no longer accepted new members and they refused to respond to countless emails asking for assistance. At these prices, you'd think it would at least allow you to complete at least one sortie before shutting down but apparently Saitek has other ideas.Don't waste your time or money, buy Logitech or CH."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of controls","review":"I use this joystick with x-plane. It works fine and has a lot of bottons/sliders. I am still learning to adapt it to the simulator. As any other joystick it may not be perfect, but it's still very good.Follow up:This joystick could be improved. If the bottom part (where the spring is) is not lubricated, the movement may not be so smooth.Update:After a while I got fed up of the jerkiness around the center and I disassembled it and remove the main spring. This is may destroy your joystick. Now is center-less just as I liked it.

It's good to see that Saitek kept the solid feel of the X36 in the X52 pro with some extra switches and controls. Overall I am very happy with the X52 pro. I considered the X65 but the cost changed my mind as I already have the Saitek yoke, throttle and rudder pedals. The only issue I have with the X52 pro is when using the twist rudder and trying to bank with the joystick it jams the stick a little when using both."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saitek x52 pro flight stick and throttle","review":"It is a very good system with plenty of controls. Some of the controls require time to learn how to set the programs.

Also of huge note, is the inclusion of his own songs. They are all amongst the best songs on here. Why Cliff did not include more of his own compostitions on albums is a mystery, as he wrote some incredible b-sides.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is trash","review":"Murder mystery that is is done by an amateur. So many things in this book made me roll my eyes in disgust or disbelief. The narrative jumps from thoughts of one person, to another (including the murderer).

Hannah is certainly a believable and strong character.The scenario is interesting, as are the suggestions of what we call today post traumatic stress syndrome.

The only criticisms I have is that the manual mechanism may be difficult for elderly folks or people with weakened hand strength to operate.

The book's jargon may be a bit much for the non-techie reader, but with careful and steady plodding one should be able to get one's head around most of the concepts.

That is the 'successstory' of evolutin, not an ever growing complexity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kurzweil's Now Classic Book","review":"Excellent book about the history and exponential progression of technology, the idea of the singularity (AI reaching human intelligence), and how the world could change over the next few decades. Read this concurrently with the audiobook forThe Singularity is Near, would definitely recommend both."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfounded fictional ramblings","review":"If you read this as speculation that purports to be based in reality, then it is a good read, much as The Blair Witch Project is a good movie. But this book smacks far too much of goofy 1930s predictions about two-legged vaccuming robots and lunar outposts. We're apparently unable to create a word processor that doesn't crash, and yet we are going to create superhuman machine intelligence in the near future? Anyone who has followed the history of AI knows that we haven't made much--or any--progress in that area, aside from a few novelties based on brute force, millions of dollars, and thirty years of research, like highly paralell search engines that compute chess moves in a thoughtless manner.Some of Kurweil's visions are downright dumb, such as AI artists that will create art in lieu of humans. Now that's an interesting gimmick, much as chatter bots--programs that converse in chat rooms--are, but nobody really wants such things."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book with fine amplification of detail!","review":"This book is a preorganized, distinct, and phenomenal publication. With the fine amplification of details, the book is well described and the information it provided is superior. With astonishing work, the endless possibilities cannot be surpassed. Ray Kurziel did a remarkable job in the clarification of Artifical Intelligence (AI). Marvelous work!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be 0 stars; but this machine doesn't allow that.","review":"There is very little science in this book. It is really about Kurzweil's ego. He frequently implies his software is the future of computing. His \\"most significant event\\" for 1999 is the publication of this book. Such self serving hype is unforgivable.Predictions for 2009 are easily extrapolated from today's technology (probably because he will be around to be held accountable). Longer range predictions are pure SCIENCE FICTION. According to Kurzweil, humans will become borg-like drones, or even worse, extinct; replaced by self replicating machines. No way!There are some interesting bits of computing history, but even these facts are distorted to promote Kurzweil's agenda.Save your money. Pulp science fiction has more integrity than this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"magical science","review":"If you are interested in hard scientific stuff, this is not your book.

Mr. Kurzweil is wordy without saying much and his predictions are way off. What made me suspicious of the quality of research was that in several places he referred to Washoe as a male gorilla who was taught sign language which he (Kurzweil) apparently thought funny. Washoe was a female chimpanzee who lived in Central Washington state, at the university, with other chimps who were taught sign language. A young male chimp was added to the group and she was observed teaching him sign language so he could communicate with the caregivers. So much for \\"funny\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much to think about","review":"Please correct the review I've already written: instead of \\"Combine all this and the next millenium may see us ...\\", it should say \\"Combine all this and the next century may see us ...\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Not how but then","review":"What is important and valuable about this book is not its own well-researched and informed story of AI and its positive hopes for a bright AI future.

Read anything Kurzweil has written. This book draws the incredibly arrogant conclusion that just because computers will soon surpass human being in computing power, they will become superior thinkers and spiritual beings.What a load of crap. Tell me, who will write the software that exceeds human intelligence? The machines themselves? Or perhaps the geniuses of modern computing, who can't even write code to shut down a modern PC without crashing it 20 percent of the time.This book is a catalog for sci-fi horrors.

A vision of what I thought it would look like. It was nothing like that described by Kurzweil.

It's remarkably hard to find something that--with however much doctoring--will fit the bill! Everything is either way, WAY too big, or way, WAY too small and nothing really looks that realistic. I'd wanted to find plastic sheets, so I could paint them with model paint--I'm going for a very particular effect--but everything I found was just...horrible.These sheets, however, are perfect. Technically, yes, they're 1:24 scale, not 1:12 scale, but they really are the absolute PERFECT size for 1:12 scale metal roof sheets. They're plastic, obviously--a plus only if you really dig model painting, which I do--but the plastic is high quality, nicely and uniformly extruded, and free of burrs, etc. Overall, these are some of the highest quality plastic sheets I've purchased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product and Service!!!","review":"I have a wheaton who is prone to itchy skin--this food helps and i was impressed with how quickly the vendor sent it out to me.

You can imagine my disappointment when I played \\"Race\\" and it was either a re-make or just re-mixed terribly with the vocals turned up so loud, they drown out the music! Then, I listened to \\"Good Year\\" and discovered to my horror that it was a complete re-make! What the hell?

This is ridiculous!"},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT COLLECTION","review":"This is one incredible boxed set, there is no question that George Jones will go down as one of the greatest singers in country music history, along with Patsy, Johnny Cash, and Hank Sr. One thing I took out of this was the little booklet where Patty Loveless, said \\"George Jones is my hero\\". Patty is one special singer and a personal favorite of mine. Everyone is aware of standards like \\"Two Story House\\" and \\"He Stopped Loving Her Today\\". But what I like is his humor in his songs, like \\"The Corvette Song\\", \\"White Lightening\\", \\"No show Jones\\", \\"Love Bug\\" (Later remade by George Strait),and the later \\"Beer Run\\" (With Garth Brooks). There is so little to feel good and laugh about in popular music (George Strait is an exception). It is pretty amazing that despite all of Jones's troubles he never forget his audience, and that is why his music lives on. This is a must have set for ANY country fan. Simply put, it is an excellent collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Living Legend","review":"George Jones, at 75 years old, is still the single greatest County Music performer of our time.

I finally got around to hearing the group's acoustic album \\"Union Street\\". The group gave fans a teaser a couple of years ago as b-sides to one of their singles and I loved what I heard. It was a different side to my favorite pop group. I was so pleased they would try to explore that acoustic sound with a full length album on \\"Union Street\\".Initially I was hoping Andy and Vince would include \\"Oh L'Amour\\" and \\"Always\\" for \\"Union Street\\" but instead the duo wisely chose songs that were less popular (for the masses). After hearing \\"Union Street\\" the first time, I was pleased that they chose songs like \\"Alien\\" and \\"Boy\\" instead of their bigger hits. Hearing these songs with an acoustic makeover is certainly different than what one would expect but I personally loved this different side of Erasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain boring","review":"I've tried to make it through the album twice and I'm bored to tears with these songs.

I wouldn't recommend this to anyone but a die-hard fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"my worst fears come true","review":"I've been Erasure's biggest fan from their very beginning, and have everything they have ever released, so it was with much disappointment that I evaluated Union Street. As an accomplished and trained musician and someone who considers Erasure the best band in the world, bar none, the new album absolutely, positively stinks! And I was really afraid of this. If you are an Erasure fan in any way, do not buy this record - there is not even one song worth listening to - frankly, it's embarrassing and it may be the one and only Erasure album that I get rid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slide Guitar?","review":"I ended up buying this album on sale and am so glad that I didn't pay full price. I am an Erasure fan from way back. I own all of their albums (look at my other reviews, I defended them during their Loveboat days) singles, etc. I am sorely disappointed in this album. I thought Other People's Songs was better than I expected and the Boy EP was better than I expected but this whole album is largely bad. It lives up to its acoustic apellation but the use of slide guitar and the reworking of the songs makes them largely into new songs with the same lyrics and singer. I think that Andy's voice is shown in a great light here. My disappointment is with the music. I couldn't recommend this to anyone unless you like old school country (not even then since I like Johnny Cash but not this)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A SURPRISE TREAT","review":"I'm not really into acoustic music, but I gave this album a try and I'm glad I took a chance.

I agree with the other reviewers who suggest that to fully enjoy Erasure, one must do so with all their electronic glory; but I appreciate a band that is constantly willing to rework the formulas and deliver surprises to their audience - especially when the songs are so good in so many formats.As they did so adeptly in their recent live show at Lakewood Theater in Dallas - even going beyond this song selection and into other singles performed in this same \\"acoustic\\" touch - they prove to be a thoroughly enjoyable act, despite life's monumental hurdles they have overcome.The songs are solid and have stood the test of time and guitars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!! one of the best!","review":"Very few albums are worth listening to start to finish over and over again, and when you find one, it is called a masterpiece.

Fantastic rock album that never got the recognition it deserved. I bought three albums at the same time when I turned 15, this one, Whitesnake's \\"Slide it in\\", and Y&T;'s \\" Rock and Rolls Gonna Save The World\\", I was hooked.

I'm using it for my mac, which is plugged into my TV, so that I can maneuver around while sitting on my couch. It picks up the signal on pretty much any surface (including my marble countertops) and it works from at least 20 feet away. I didn't have to plug it directly into my computer, which is great to conserve usb ports by using one on my keyboard. I don't see how you could accidentally open the battery compartment unless you tend to hold the mouse lower than normal.

A serial killer's obsession with a beautiful woman produces really gruesome murders. The way Davenport goes about getting his man is well written. I also liked how the secondary murder was solved"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best of the Prey Series...","review":"In the last Prey book, the reader did not know who the bad guy was. In this one, Night Prey, the identity of the killer is known to the reader, and the reader is allowed into his psyche and is a part of the deterioration of that psyche. Both presentations of these stories were done well. Usually I like figuring out who the killer is, but Sandford does both ways in a compelling manner. Another interesting component in this book is Lucas's female partner, Connell. She has an interesting secret that I won't give away, but the flawed character of Davenport grows as he comes to terms with her situation. Weather is here too, first introduced in Winter Prey. Another superb addition to the Prey series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"I don't get it. I heard so much praise for Sandford novels that I was looking forward to discovering a new author. It was like reading a 'Hunter' episode..it was sooo boring. This book lacked everything! It had no character development and was extremely predictable and unimaginative. I don't like to be so harsh with a review but I cannot understand the accolades."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Many Errors","review":"This book has so many spelling errors, it seriously detracts from the story.Many single words are spelled as two words. For two examples, pleasure it written as plea sure and pilot is written as pi lot. This is not an occasional mistake, but every time you come across the words above.Then you run into what should be two separate words combined into one word. For example, a long becomes along.This book needed some serious proofreading before publishing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Night Prey by John Sandford","review":"Lsm Enterprises never delivered my product.

Like his idol Otis Redding, O'Neal handled both slow-tempo romantic ballads and stormin', sizzling-hot uptempo tracks equally well. The plaintive and angst-filled ballads \\"A Broken Heart Can Mend\\", \\"Look At Us Now\\" and the immortal \\"If You Were Here Tonight\\" are undoubtedly this CD's standouts but the mid-tempo groovers \\"What's Missing?\\" and \\"You Were Meant To Be My Lady\\" foreshadow Alexander's accomplishments on subsequent releases like \\"Hearsay\\" and \\"All True Man\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Money to Burn encompasses all the elements of a classic","review":"Money to Burn might be the greatest film I've seen since deat Ring struck video stores everywhere in 1992. Don McQueen from Gator's Breath, Florida was so right. This movie was great. It is a tragedy that great cinema like this doesn't get recognized for such accolades as Oscars. If the American Film Academy wasn't corrupt, Don Swayze and Chad McQueen would be battling it out for Best Actor every year, and great films such as Death Ring and Money to Burn would be winning in the Best Picture category. The other reviewer of this film is obviously a man of many wisdoms, and should be acclaimed for his reviewing prowess. In closing, if you are looking for a great new film to add to your list of favorites, ten Money to Burn is te movie for you. Once again, this as been Art Vandelay.

Pork shoulder to make pulled pork sandwiches, baby back ribs, and brisket. Everything came out great. It's truly set it and forget it. I don't even want to mess with propane or charcoal now. You may have to add liquid or chips 1 additional time during cooking - but compared to adding charcoal every hour or two - or filling propane tanks - this is much easier cooking. I recommend aWeber 3601 Rib Rack(or similar -buy two!) to hold the ribs on their side - then you can get at least two full racks on each layer.Good eatin' awaits ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the look...

The thing finally arrived and the box looked like it was run over by a truck. Then I opened it and found an amazing piece. It went together quickly and the clock mechanism works fine (don't expect a fancy gizmo, it is a simple plastic cased battery motor).

While the quality is slightly lacking, it doesn't impact the functionality. My clock is mounted in a a two-story entry, near a stair case. It looks amazing from below, but you can certainly see the quality (construction & paint) when you get close. If you're planning to mount this in a large open area where people won't get very close to it (say, within 10 ft), then I would recommend buying it. If people will walk directly by it, then I suggest spending a bit more money for a (presumably) higher quality clock. Overall, I'm pleased with my purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"THEY ARE DEFECTIVE!","review":"Same experience as the other reviewer. I was so excited to get this clock. Too bad half the parts were missing and some of the holes were not where they were supposed to be either. Amazon service was also poor. They told me they would ship another one overnight. I didn't get it until 2 phone calls and 2 weeks later. And guess what? It is defective too!The Amazon customer service rep told me they were taking the clock off of the website to investigate why the item continues to be missing parts/defective. They obviously didn't do that either. I told her I just wanted a clock with all the parts in working order. She told me to go buy it somewhere else!Disappointed all around. Too bad- it does look like a really cool clock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Twice disappointed - hope you have better luck","review":"Really liked looks of this clock & ordered after reading reviews. Got on 9/11/110 - both outer shipping box & inner box had holes & both were poorly taped - inside parts were loose inside & screw/nuts missing. After assembling even without all known parts clock did not work. Returned, I packaged parts in my own zip baggie & retaped both boxes in same manner as received & marked in black marker on outer box about holes & bad taping. Got replacement 9/24/10. This time clock only shipped in 1 box - the EXACT SAME clock & inner box with my zip baggied parts were sent and box was in worse condition!

I do not know if the item would have worked eventually or not, but not having all parts didn't really help determine that either!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Clock movement comes broken","review":"When I originally received my clock, it came in a beat up, flimsy box. It looked great once hung and hanging was easy. However, the clock movement mechanism had a broken shaft so the hands could not be attached. Also, the hands come very poorly packaged so the cheap aluminum needs to be restraightened prior to hanging.I requested a new clock from Amazon which came within 24 hours. Same terrible packaging, another broken movement mechanism.However, I like the look enough that I have purchased a movement mechanism separately and will fix this myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Volcanoes Jersey","review":"Size is inconsistent with description and label.

But this is where DBZ starts to gets really good. This is where the animation gets really good and where the story starts to really pick up with less filler. I always thought the Gohan vs. Cell and the Goku vs. Majin Vegeta fights were the some of high points of the whole Dragon Ball series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dragon Ball Z: Dragonbox Five","review":"The Dragon Boxes are great, as an owner of both the season sets and Dragon Boxes, I would recommend the Dragon Boxes for hardcore fans of the subbed anime. They are in 4:3 format instead of 16:9 like the season sets, although this may be a little annoying it's better because that's how the series was made. In 16:9 format you lose some of the screen. The Dragon Boxes went through a much better remastering process, in the season sets, many lines were deleted do to the remastering process used. They do not include the English broadcast music, so if your not a fan of the Japanese music or the 4:3 format then I would recommend the season sets, I you like both of these then I would recommend the Dragon Boxes."},{"rating":"2","title":"EPIC","review":"Dragon Box vol.5 is more of the same of the previous dragon boxes. Which is to say it has excellent quality both picture and sound, uncut, 42 episodes and comes with a dragon book which contains episode summaries, top 3 listings, Profile of Goku family,family tree and sketches. This covers the cell games over to the start of the (25th?) Tenkaichi Budokai. The cell sagas were my favorite of the whole trilogy and it's great to watch it in such good quality. if you are a Dragon ball fan/Japanese fan/Cell fan then you should buy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uncut Dragonball","review":"Uncut Dragonball Z, this is what you want. My only issue is I wish they put a chapter skip break after the \\"last time, on dragon ball Z...\\" scenes. You can still fast forward it but you can't directly skip it.

Only because of Verizon and how they have disabled the many features that this phone has to offer.

Well, I went out and purchased a transflash as well but quickly found out that I couldn't transfer the files to the new software that is now installed on my phone. Bottom line is if you have the older software you can enjoy this V710 but if you have the newer software FORGET it. I wish that as a consumer there is something that we can do about this misleading options on this phone. I only wish I could return the phone. I truly don't think that what Verizon has done is legal.

I liked my LG and it worked great most everywhere else but I was hoping to get a phone that I could at least hold brief conversations with in my office without constant dropped calls. Well, I have used the V710 for several hours now in my office without a single dropped call. If it had better battery life I would easily give it 5 stars. Great phone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not performing to specifications & Poor software design","review":"1) Not performing to specifications: battery life is very bad and charging the phone takes time - this phone doesn't really last more than 1.5 days. Poor Design for battery swapping: swapping battery is not an easy job. The cover needs to be removed and often gets stuck (I don't know why) I had to remove the antenna to remove the cover. I had to pry the battery to get it out. Replacing the battery is also an issue. I need to line it up perfectly. I found out the first time I installed the battery. The cover snapped back OK and the phone worked but it wouldn't charge. So swapping batteries is not a solution for the battery life issue.2) Not performing to specifications: camera takes poor pictures based on specifications and comparing to other cell phones that are less epensive.3) Poor user interface design for the Phone Book due to the display of multiple entries for cell, home, office, Fax, etc. with the same contact name."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY","review":"I purchased the phone because of the Bluetooth technology.

Verizon sold me a new battery, but that wasn't the problem. After four trips to the store, they FedEx'd me a \\"new\\" (refurbished?) phone, which also went dead after a few weeks. They gave me a third one, which also went dead, so they gave me a fourth phone this morning. Always the same problem -- the screen says \\"unable to charge\\". Verizon can't explain what that means, but it must be more than a problem with the battery or charger, because they keep giving me a new (or refurbished?) phone of this same model. I don't know much about cell phones, other than there must be better ones than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"This phone has nice features, a large screen, a great speakerphone, and a decently loud ringer. The battery life is horrible though, although maybe it should be expected because of the large screen size.

I have yet to see either of them. After the first month the internal screen went all white after a period of the phone sutting off randomly. I'm on my second phone. The phone just seems very flimsy. Also the camera is absolutly the worst camera I have ever seen on a camera phone. I know it's just a phone and not a digital camera, but I would expect that pictures would be somewhat decent especially becuase this phone boasts a 1.2 megapixel camera. Very misleading. This phone is soo bad I am contemplating paying the 175 cancellation fee and leaving Verizon (since the bastards won't let me switch models) for the very highly rated SLVR and Cingular."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU WANT FULL BLUETOOTH CAPABILITIES","review":"This phone is great, I love it. BUT Verizon crippled it - they disabled object transfer over bluetooth, so you won't be able to get pictures off your phone, put mp3's onto your phone, or download your contact list withouth buying a Transflash Card and Reader.This is something Verizon did because profit is their middle name - they want you to pay $.25/picture to send them to yourself. They want you to buy THEIR ringtones through Get It Now.Other than this problem, the phone is great. Pictures are a bit grainy and dark, but they are as good as can be expected from a phone.

As about everybody knows by now, the device is seriosly crippled by Verizon. As a telephone, it's pretty good, though there are undoubtedly others that perform as well and can be got for a quarter the price. The absence of fully functional Bluetooth, however, overrides the features that made it desirable in the first place. And Verizon's attitude towards its early adopters have me seriously considering another carrier the next time I'm due to re-up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Verizon Screwed this one up","review":"I bought this for the bluetooth connectivity to my Totota Prius navigation system.

This is Verizon's problem-- not Motorola's!"},{"rating":"1","title":"PRACTICALLY USELESS BLUETOOTH","review":"Caveat!! this phone is pretty good, but Verizon has limited the bluetooth capabilities to supporting a headset only, in other words, if you want to get a file (ie: photos, addresses, messages) into or out of the phone, you can't use bluetooth to transfer them to or from your computer. You must either pay to e-mail them, buy the software/usb cable, or the extra memory card and card reader.

That being said, there are some features people may be looking for in a phone that it just doesn't have. First, it's bigger and heavier than any other \\"camera phone\\" you're going to find out there. The picture quality is crap compared to other 1 megapixel camera phones. Also, the camera does not have a flash, it has a crappy light which is pretty much only good for finding your Bluetooth, it is definitely disabled. I don't have any accessories, but I do have Bluetooth in my Apple iBook. I can make a 14.4 internet connection, but that's it. The phone does not work with iSync and files can't be transfered via Bluetooth. There was a class action lawsuit over this, and to be honest, I will probably be getting a new phone soon.

Because like I said, I do love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it for Bluetooth","review":"As others have mentioned, in an attempt to force customers to use their \\"Get It Now\\" service, Verizon has crippled the Bluetooth so its only function is to let you use a cordless headset.

Working adults who want a phone they can use to store information and transfer it between devices should choose another carrier and another phone.You can find a good overview of the phone's pros and cons--as well as a breathtaking sample of Verizon's arrogance and uncaring attitude towards its customers--at http://www.nuclearelephant.com/papers/v710.html."},{"rating":"1","title":"NEW MOTO E815 PHONE TO REPLACE V710 in Q1 2005","review":"This V710 phone has had terrible reviews because of its many bad features and numerous problems.

Finally, the camera is aweful. I've seen better pictures from cheap 640x480 cameras and don't even try to take a picture indoors. I am very disappointed that this is the best Verizon can come out with in a Bluetooth handset.

Even at half-price, it was an overpriced piece of crap.Although pretty, it lost nearly a minute per day, the day function didn't stay synchronized with the time, you could hear the low-quality winding mechanism grinding away as you moved your wrist (winding the watch), and the \\"sweep second hand\\" was more like \\"spastic second hand.\\"Please, don't buy into the marketing hype.

It failed to keep accurate time, usually stalled while trying to move all the gears past 12 a.m. (and so had to be reset every morning) and for me the last straw was the continual breaking of the fragile pins that hold the strap onto the watch. I nearly lost the watch several times when the pins failed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agree with the bad reviews","review":"I would have been better off had I not purchased this watch. The reviews that are negative are all true. Here is my story: I bought this watch and initially all was well - it was difficult to wind and set, but it ran. After owning it for three months one of the pins unscrewed as I was walking home and the watch fell off my wrist on to the ground. It lost a sapphire so I sent it to Steinhausen for repair. It has never worked since it came back from being \\"repaired\\" for which I paid $50 additional dollars - the second hand freezes and it stops in the middle of the day.

These watches can be had for $49.00, $59.00 and $89.00 dollars.Someone is playing a game at 595.00-890.00 for these so do not fall for it. I can not believe these guys think they can pass these off for those prices. I own one I bought for $59.00 dollars new and wear it as a fashion style item with limited dress shirts.

Very retro and detailed. It looks beautiful. It is just junk. After wearing it for a week I noticed a small hand laying on the bottom of the dial. I took it to my watch repair man. It happened a second time to another small hand. The repair man told me he would repair it as often as I would pay for it, but that I should just save my money. It wasn't worth more than a few bucks, even when running, because of its junk movement. Stienhuasen is a deliberately misleading name.

In fact, the hands could not even be manually moved with the crown.Thinking this was an isolated incident, I ordered a second watch. That watch lasted less than a month.

Despite the fact that the rebate is ongoing and that I would qualify if I was able to jump through the hoops properly there was little simpathy on the part of the Manufacturer (Viking) to support its rebate policy.

To my ears, the antiquity pickup really nails that authentic vintage strat sound, with less noise than what an actual 60 year old strat pickup would have.

David Hess (Krug from LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT) plays a hitch-hiker who just robbed a bank and double-crossed his partners to keep the money for himself. Along the way, he meets up with a \\"problematic\\" couple and hitches a ride. From there, we're treated to fist fights, double crossing, cops being killed, more double crossing, rape, and yes even more double crossing. This one truly is a 5 out of 5. To start off, the cinematography is amazing. And even though this only played overseas (25 years ago!), the image on the DVD is stunning. Every single shot is crisp and picture perfect. We can all hope that the upcoming LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT is this good. You also get the european trailer, and a 17 minute documentary with the director and the 3 stars (including HESS). This one is a must have, especially for all you LAST HOUSE fans! What are you waiting for? Skip HARRY POTTER, and order HITCH-HIKE now!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hitchhikers guide to the galaxy was scarier.","review":"Hitch-hike is one of those small movies you watch becouse you hope that becouse of it's budget they would spend some real quality time on the script and try to make up for it by giving us a good move ie- Night Of The Living Dead, Holloween, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Mad Max, and Blair Witch.So it sould come as no surprise that this film is as bad as those movies are good. David Hess plays a hitch hiker picked up by a husband and wife couple. After getting into thier car he reeks havok with thier lives. I don't know if the movie The Hicher with Rutger Hauer came before or after this but either way it is a much better film. THat movie was suspensefull where as this movie is just tiersome. By the end you don't really care who wins just that the movie ends."},{"rating":"2","title":"There can be only One!","review":"My wife is a Big New Jersey Devils fan.

But when I saw those cups are made in China, I thought they were far too pricey, so I did not buy them."},{"rating":"1","title":"The cups don't work well at all","review":"After doing extensive research we purchased 4 of training cups for our infant. They were very highly rated on multiple web sites. He was having difficulty drinking and becoming frustrated. I tried the cup myself and got mostly air and very little liquid. I respositioned the insert multiple times with no improvement. Thinking it was that particular cup we opened the others and tried them. About 1/3 of the time they actually work. The rest of the time you/the baby sucks mostly air. We purchased Gerber brand and a no name brand to see if they were any better. Sadly enough they were. We have used Dr. Brown bottles for the past 14 months. They are great. The training cups are absolutely awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the bottles, not the trainer...","review":"My breastfed son LOVED the Dr. Brown's bottles and used them exclusively when I was at work. When it came time to try a trainer, we were excited to try the Dr. Brown's trainer. Unfortunately, it was not what we'd hoped. 1) It's HUGE, so a large amount of liquid must be placed inside. Otherwise baby/toddler will have to tilt his head at an extreme angle to get any liquid. 2) It's leaky. We've had lots of leak issues with this trainer. 3) If the valve isn't positioned just perfectly, the child sucks and gets nothing but air while the trainer leaks all over the place. 4) It's expensive! I really wanted to love this trainer, but in the end it didn't work out for us. We finally ended up using a Nuby silicone trainer at first so that my son got the idea of sucking on a soft trainer, then switched to Playtex sippy cups which are excellent! Sorry, Dr. Brown's..."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointing","review":"I bought these cups because we had used the bottles and loved them and my son was having difficulty drinking from other sippy cups. They are easier to drink from- because there isn't anything preventing fluid from flowing right out. Even with the valve correctly placed (which is a trick), it dribbles. Not to mention that they leak from under the lid. I have made them the official \\"water sippys\\" because they make such a mess but I'm too cheap to throw them away. I may just give in and chuck them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible cup!!","review":"These cups are horrible!! At first I loved them because the liquid does flow easily from them - when it comes out. My daughter (11 mos) was getting so frustrated with the cup one day, so I gave it a try, nothing but air was coming out. I keep trying to use them (we have four and none of them work), but about 90% of the time, nothing comes out but air. then I resort to taking the stopper out and that makes a huge mess. DO NOT BUY THESE CUPS!! I don't know why I keep trying to use them, they are so frustrating!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Boat Guides","review":"Goods were delivered in shorter time than expected, weel packed and free of any shipping damage.Guides were easy to install following the instructions provided.Hardware should have 1 or 2 spare nuts and washers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missleading picture","review":"The item pictured is not the real item, nor the item shipped.

The dialogues were fun and while much might be missed one the first pass, after you finish the associated chapter you should really be able to \\"get\\" that conversion - even if you don't understand each word.

Interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound quality was poor.","review":"The show streamed perfectly fine but the sound was barely audible. This was with all volume settings maxed with PC and television. Didn't have problems with any other on demand videos so my best guess was the transcoding didn't go as well as it should have.

Beyond those indistable facts this book has little to offer.The book has the feel of being written to an editor's specifications: so many chapters, so many words, etc. Although the author may have a passion for her subject matter and may be deeply concerned for her patients, little shows through in her writing. Reading this book was a chore which in the end offered little fresh thinking on the topic. The book also comes across as preachy and condescending. Save your money and keep looking for a better book on cardio health. If you must sample this author's writing, look for the excerpt in Womans Day magazine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland Music","review":"There's just no real reason to recommend this, or to listen to it.

But there's nothing here to enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Changing is the Key Word Here","review":"The Changing Land is not so much a sequel to Dilvish the Damned. The book is less like Eye of Cat and more like Changeling and Madwand. The writing style is more story-based and less of a poetic narrative. I particularly enjoyed the character \\"Black\\", a demon in the form of an armored horse that Dilvish made a pact with. I found the depth and breadth of characters refreshing. This is a great read, but don't expect a seamless continuation of Dilvish the Damned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Designed and Difficult to Install","review":"I purchased this item for my Breezy Ultra 4 Wheelchair. Each grip has two parts. An inner foam piece and the outer fabric cover. The foam goes around the metal wheel grip and has self adhesive edges to make it stay in place around the wheel grip. These take some stretching around the grip ring and especially past the standoffs which attach the grip ring to the wheel. But once you have struggled through this they seem to stay in place OK. The fabric cover is much more of a challenge. It is not wide enough to go around the foam core with out a lot of tugging and trying to compress the foam. I could barely get enough wrap to close the Velcro strips along the edges especially around the standoffs. After a week's use the Velcro edges started to open and had to be re-closed.Also the ends of the cover are not adequately dealt with. The grips are are comfortable to use but a real pain to install and maintain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cloth cover too small","review":"It is a great idea, however, the cloth cover over the foam does not fit.....more cloth is needed. Placing the foam on the rim is simple.....but it isn't possible to then compress the foam on the rim enough to bring the Velcro closures together except in a very few places. The grip posts, which attach the grip ring to the wheel, also present a problem....the foam will compress around them but the cover with the Velcro must slide around them so no closure is possible. Do not spend your money on this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I was looking for a book that compared & constrasted all the different project management methodologies. According to the book's description & the feedback from the other readers, this was a very good book. I was alittle apprehensive about the book because of its age, but since the book dealt with methodologies & not the latest technology, I thought I should be ok. I was terribly mistaken. The book uses a very general tone & lacks all details. To compound the issue, the author writes about methodologies that aren't used & about methodologies that were never used. This book would have been a terrible book even when it was new. I've never been so mislead by other reviews in my life."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful instrumental music","review":"I never thought that something this good could come out of Lansing, IL. A friend of mine who owns a computer store let me borrow this CD yesterday; I popped it in the CD player today, and was very surprised. The recording quality is excellent (some of the best I've heard from the new wave of home computer recordings, and much better than your average 4-track demo). The songs are intelligent; mostly keyboard work, but the drum and trombone is damn fine and separates the album from the average synth crap. 3fm seem to have found their own sound amongst the electronic dabbling--it's not pop, it's not dance, it's not really new wave either--and that makes it a very rewarding listen. The CD ends on a note that makes me want to press play again and again...I'd recommend it to anybody who's interested in the independent music scene and isn't bored by music that doesn't have vocals. Thanks to Bach, indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works but has issues...","review":"It definitely works and was easy to set up but my major problem was that the voice coming out was very tinny and it also was difficult to get it loud enough to properly hear over any background noise (including quite typing). So unless you want to sit in complete silence while using this, I would recommend against."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Product","review":"This product went straight to the junk drawer. It hooked up easily but takes over completly on audio. When this is connected it wipes out your other audio output so you have to plug it in and then unplug it each time you need it. Maybe ok for a laptop bag?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kinda works","review":"This device works, but the sounds quality on it is very poor. The speaker is not great and the mic on it is very weak. I turned the volume all the way up on the mic (which they recommend as the default, which tells you something), and still had problems with the volume being to low. On the plus side, the device plugged in and was picked up right away. I tested it with Skype and except for the volume and sound quality issues, it all seemed to work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Childhood Memories Revived","review":"I originally read this series of books when I was in the 2nd & 3rd grade and they were my absolute favorites at the time. They have since disappeared from most libraries, which is quite a shame. I still hold onto the image of the topiaries from the books. They really captured my imagination. I found one of the series recently in a used book store and started my love affair with the stories all over again. I have now not only purchased myself a new set, but have purchased a set to donate to the school library."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Green Knowe books are wonderful and magical.","review":"The entire series is pure joy. This, the first in the series, introduces us to Tolly and his grandmother and their mysterious and exciting home.

I then realized there are other Green Knowe books, that we will also look forward to enjoying together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe the worse Book I've Ever read","review":"This is seriously one of the worse books I've ever read. And I love children's fantasy fiction. I am surprised 19 people gave this a 5. REALLY?! It had a lot of potential-the plot and characters both seemed interesting, but the book is BORING. Through 90 percent of the book, we read how Tolly, the little boy, explores the house and grounds (with mundane activity), listens to birds, and plays flutes. The actions are very mundane-look at the book cover; that's pretty much the whole book. Finally, toward the end, we see a climax-one that is supposed to be scary and adventersome, but I personally found it uninteresting and not very climactic. Plus, the book is creepy."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME","review":"I love C.S. Lewis - and this book is great at capturing him throughout all his works.

A free Kindle e-book seems to mean that you are taking risks and what you see is what you get once you open it in your Kindle. Although not every free book is defective, this is just one of the few textless free public domain e-books I've found on Amazon. The others were a free volume six of Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire and a free complete edition of Macaulay's History of England."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tortoises","review":"This book was just beyond me, I guess. It tried to draw an analogy between little tortoises bodies after they were born and the Crucifixion of Christ. It also kept repeating how a young male tortoise kept trying to breed an old, clumsy, ugly female, in GREAT detail, which I thought was disgusting, repetitive, and pointless. Not a good book at all, and certainly not his best work. I don't know what he was thinking on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A morbid but hilarious book","review":"My brother was given this book in the 1950's. I somehow received this book in the 1970's.It is set in New York City. An impoverished and sickly mother and son - coming back after the father's funeral. Harry's main goal became to purchase and carve a grave stone for his mother - who died shortly after. Harry himself got run over by a luxury automobile (obviously a bad and blind rich person :) ) near the end of the book after staying after dark carving that gravestone in the cemetery.We made fun of the book. Everytime my nephews came over, they would ask me to read it. We all cracked up laughing hilariously - every time.On a more serious note, I couldn't help but shake my head that someone would write so depressing a book and call it a Children's book. My Mother thinks this was a great book and can't understand why it isn't a great Children's story. To me it a more of a dark horror story. With thinking like that, no wonder our Christian generation today is so screwed up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Bits","review":"Even though they're made in China, these bits are strong and solid. I have a Milwaulkee M18 impact driver and have used the torex bit and the philips bits extensively to build some cattle feeders out of rough cut lumber (oak).

His albums alway seem to reach new territories, and Form and Function does this with a classy, simple approach. His soundscapes are structurely very complex and clinical, providing an antiseptic type approach to beat construction and quirky nuances that fill your ears with unique sounds. This minimalist style allows room for each timbre of sound to hit your ears with an unusual precision, leaving you offguard for what's to come next. Choosing sounds and programming beats to create moods rather than \\"just to dance to,\\" this album aurally has many soothing qualities similar to Stewart Walker's \\"Stabiles.\\" By far one of the great producers of electronic music, Photek remains a true pioneer, discovering and creating his own art form without the usual influence of so many others."},{"rating":"1","title":"its not what i expected","review":"the episodes are edited and weirdly arranged.

Apparently taken from sources so old that digital remastering was difficult to restore them to their original sound. The fact they are included is nice. Songs from the early 1960s are excellent in their reproduction. Song selection is outstanding - multiple versions of his standards are included.

Well, these sheets DO fit great, and they stay on without wrinkling up for longer than 5 minutes.

I washed them after they arrived and they felt fine for the first couple of days, but then started to get scratchy.

Imagine my surprise when my order arrived and the packaging indicated it would only fit up to a 20\\" mattress! Since I paid $10 in shipping for them (and would have to pay more to send them back), I washed them and thought I'd give them a try. I managed to get the fitted sheet on my king sized mattress, but it isn't a good fit. Also, the flat sheet is incredibly small- it only overhangs the mattress by 3\\" on each side. These are not good quality sheets either- they feel scratchy and cheap. I would have been better off going to a department store. I'm very disappointed with the sheet set, and with the description of the set on Amazon.

That said, I have not had any trouble with piling which has been mentioned by a number of reviewers, and the top sheet still fits quite nicely. But won't buy this brand ever again, cannot imagine trying to get it on a pillow-top mattress!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice for the price","review":"I purchased these sheets as finding split king sheets is difficult. The deep pockets are a little too large for my Select Comfort mattresses, and the sheets come out of the dryer quite wrinkled. However, with repeated washing, the wrinkling seems to lessen. The sheets are soft and comfortable, and I like that the top sheet covers both mattresses with a decent hang on the sides.The cost for these was well under many sets on Amazon, and significantly less than if I had to purchase 2 twin fitted sheets, a king top sheet, and 2 pillowcases separately in a store. Even then finding single sheets is difficult as most stores carry only sets.Overall, a nice set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smooth Deep Pocket Sheets","review":"I've had these sheets for about a year now. I love that they have really deep pockets. All of my old sheets barely fit on my mattress, so after a couple nights they would slide up on one corner or another. I don't have that problem with these sheets.I also really like the feel, they are soft and smooth. I have some 800 thread count sheets and I like these better because they don't feel so \\"bulky\\". I picked these up for like 40 bucks and you honestly can't beat that price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Been loving these sheets for years","review":"I love these sheets. I have used them for years and couldn't be more pleased. I initially got some to fit on my deep mattress. Now I have them on every bed in the house and love to give them as wedding gifts.

King mattress. While I can find deep pocket fitted sheets, the top sheet never makes it a quarter way down the side. I mean, if a company makes sheets to fit oversized mattresses...? Okay, off the soapbox.To my delight, these sheets, both bottom AND top, fit great and stay put. The issue I have is with pilling! One wash and I feel like I'm sleeping in sand. For the price, that's not worth it. I'll see if there's anything I can do, outside of shaving the sheets with a dull razor, to get the pills off.Too bad. The fit is wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product, great price","review":"As I said on my previous review, sheets fit perfectly. Can't beat the price for the thread count anywhere else.

The vivid descriptions of people, places and things go far beyond what one could imagine. The painstaking detail of conversations that took place between Jesus, His Apostles, and all of the Biblical charecters that have been with us for centuries are beautiful.

Having a mix of Harbor Freight, Skil, Freud and now PC bits, I can say that I have a pretty good perspective on where this bit falls...somewhere in between the Freud and the Skil, but closer to the Skil. I seems pretty sharp right out of the package, cuts relatively smooth and left only a couple burrs in some scrap red oak I was free-handing just to test it out. I did notice the red(laquer?) coating on the bit started to flake off after only a few feet of cutting.

There is not a single leak of any sort in my 20x15 patio, so thats really what matters. I'm getting a second kit for my front yard too, its so simple. I found this product for $35 at Lowes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple, easy and works","review":"The timer works great and the whole system is super easy to set up. I found the instructions on the box work better than the book enclosed. I have 13 medium to large pots on my patio so I had to order extra \\"T\\" connectors and line drip heads. I read one of the reviews where the person stated to replace the stiff yellow ring on the timer with a rubber hose ring. Nothing leaks at all.

This book is dearly appreciated by San Franciscans but appeals to all people with a sense of humor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had potential to be a great movie","review":"MARIA GORETTI had a tremendous cast, and with an excellent Marriconne musical score, this movie could have been outstanding. This story was more about the activist priest than about the subject of the movie, Maria Goretti.A poorly-written script that deflated quickly after the first ten minutes. There were many inconsistencies where the writer took too many liberties with the actual story. It seems that an Italian-made movie about an Italian saint would be a more accurate tribute. It was a made-for-TV movie in Italy, and maybe that's the explanation, however, this had the potential to be a much finer presentation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite a Story!","review":"Since I was a little girl, I have known the story of Maria Goretti. I was thrilled to know that there was a DVD made of her life. The child star was perfect for the part...the story was heart-warming yet very sad. It was a true story, well-done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"True to her life...","review":"St. Maria Goretti is an inspiration and a model for youth, not only in days past but for all time. She held onto her virtue in the face of the most heinous attack by a young man who had been watching her with lust in his heart for quite some time.When he finally did murder her, not receiving from her what he most wanted, she forgave him and went to Heaven.The acting in this video is superbly done; I had never heard of any of the actors; I went merely on the notion that this was a movie about one of my favorite Saints...and I was not disappointed.Even tho' it is Italian, with English dubbed in, as I watched it this didn't bother me at all; I even forgot for the most part that I was watching a foreign film.I would recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to know more about the day-to-day life of a modern Saint."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a story","review":"If you are familiar with this Saint you will want to make this part of your library.Take the time to see this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maria remembered","review":"I was just a young girl and I saw a picture of the real Maria Goretti. All htese years it stuck in my head and heart. The movie was wonderful, and it shows powerfully what true FORGIVENESS is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointed","review":"Very dull, no real insight. Maria Goretti's great act is of forgiveness and of how she lived in God's love despite a hard childhood, NOT that she fended off a rapist. What female wouldn't do as well. Maria's story is of reconciliation, peace, and love for all. Acting was poor, and I found the actress who played Maria to be the weakest."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRENDOUS NOT STUPENDOUS","review":"I STRONGLY DISLIKED THIS MOVIE AND DO NOT RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE IF THEY DO NOT WISH TO BE SCARRED FOR LIFE.

Count on 20-50 of these resets during any given football weekend.It just now reset again during my Rose Bowl party!Here's the best part: DirecTV knows about the problem! And has done nothing to fix it, just keeps selling them like hotcakes to unsuspecting buyers like you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Want mine?","review":"The first one I had mysteriously stopped receiving local channels, so they replaced it. The second one developed distorted tinny audio, and then a tendency to reset spontaneously. The screen goes gray, and then the box goes through a five minute satellite download cycle. That was real fun during game 7, inning 9 of the world series.The unit gets scorching hot, and I once had to reinsert the ID card several times to get it to come back to life.

Originally published in 1993 in fewer than 1,000 copies (of which I've been lucky to own one), it has been out of print for years. When used copies turn up they go for hundreds of dollars. And they seldom come up.As the seller of one of two copies of the 1993 edition available at this writing says in his description of the book: \\"The last book by Avram Davidson published during his lifetime,a collection of erudite and digressive essays on mermaids, phoenixes, silk, dragons, and similar topics.\\" That pretty much sums it up, except to add that it's a great read. George Barr's accompanying illustrations sprinkled throughout the text are a delight, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Style: 5; Content: 3","review":"A collection of essays--some previously published in divers venues, some not--each around or about some matter of legend (e.g., the phoenix, werewolves, mermaids) or sometimes just fringy science (frozen mammoths, extinct birds). If you're at all familiar with Avram Davidson, you won't be surprised to discover that finding factual foundations is scarcely the point of the essays; the point is listening to a wonderfully erudite and widely-read scholar riffing on a miscellany of eccentric subjects. And I say \\"listening to\\" deliberately, because his style is so very chatty and personal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad to see it","review":"If I had the gift of resurrection the first author whom I would restore to life would be the great American fantasist Avram Davidson. No one brought more learning, wisdom or humor to the genre and we are all poorer for his passing. How good it is then to see the reissue of this collection of his musings on the stuff of legends. Those familiar with The Master's work will see here the fruit that his researches bore in his fiction. It's an entertaining book to read on its own but it should also entice readers to pick up something more from the Davidson canon. \\"The Phoenix and the Mirror\\" is a good place to start."},{"rating":"1","title":"fire point","review":"One of the most sickening endings I have ever read where the villian (Sean) not only avoids his just deserts but is rewarded with the prospect that he will eventually get what he has destroyed so many lives for - his old flame! What was the author thinking? People really do like to think that justice will somehow prevail and therefore the creepiness of the last two paragraphs was very disturbing. What a waste of time not to mention the bad taste the reader is left with. This was the first and last book by Smolens I will ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"very porr quality","review":"so poorly made and lightweight my cats can't even use it.

Does he know George Orwellpromoted democratic socialism in his works?Perhaps Orwell, and Chomsky criticise the very same authoritarianstructure in their works? Mark Bauerlein seems to misunderstandGeorge Orwell as well as Noam Chomsky."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy Place","review":"I've listened to this relaxing CD over and over and over and (I think you get it).

She is adopted and is forced to search for her birth mother after she learns she desperatly needs a bone marrow transplant.

Lurlene has always been a great author, but the new triology truely exceeded her expectations.Although all three of the novels have to do with a young person dealing with a disease, she seems to make death seem like a thing that they looked forward to.

I'm a digital scrapper, but I still send my 12x12 pages out to a printer. But I use my printer with my Silhouette Cameo die cutting machine to create print and cut items for my scrapbooks.

THAT'S MY EXPERIENCE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sacred Spirit Drums","review":"My husband is First Nation and has played on traditional Pow Wow drums. The music on this CD seems very contrived. I think it is better to get real First Nation drum music rather than to turn it into this unrecognizable, synthesized and distorted electronic sound. It is being \\"passed off\\" as Native. To me it it is not Native. It sounded, well, sorry, but, it sounded tacky. I don't know if Mr. Gordon is First Nation. Some of it even seems to be somewhat African, which would be appropriate if it where meant to be African in nature. But, all in all, it's far to \\"Hollywood\\" for me. And we all know how \\"Hollywood\\" has mis-informed the world about our First Nation's history.

Just another example of the exploitation of the true Americans. It's like there was a Lawrance Welk of native American music only worse. An equivelant might be buying a Metallica cd and hearing Madonna music coming from the speakers. You expected something with some real spirit but you got watered down syrupy bubblegum music instead. It's not the real thing. Besides that I'm a professional drummer, and I'm definitly not impressed with the drumming. But having said that, if you just want some pop music to listen to and delude yourself that your listening to real native American music then this is for you.It would probably be better to rename it and put a different picture on the cover that would be less insulting to the people it's making a mockery of and more suitable to the disco minded crowd it's apparently trying to foster."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book","review":"This is a well written easy to understand book about security.

The production was excellent, and listening to all 18 CDs gave me and my children an entirely new appreciation and understanding of this book. When it was time for my son to read the book as part of a required book reading list for his AP English class, he benefitted greatly from having already heard it on audio.The story - how could there be any better than the story of Tom Joad and his family? Despite what the other Amazon reviewer claimed, this is not an entirely depressing novel.

It is good quality and a beautiful piece of jewelry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stimulating, Provocative Discussion of the Mind and Memory","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Dr. Khalsa has apassion for his work that carries over into hiswriting. In straightforward fashion he moves from a very good discussion of how the brain works to a well organized plan for how anyone can employ nutritional, stress reduction, and exercise techniques as well as pharmacological therapies to prevent brain degeneration, optimize performance, and even reverse the course of such conditions as age related memory loss and Alzheimer's disease. I began reading this book to educate myself. I came away a \\"convert\\" to Dr. Khalsa's program. He convinced me to make some lifestyle changes that no doubt will enhance my overall well being and quality of life. I can think of no higher praise for a book than this"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazingly Insightful","review":"Dr. Khalsa has some amazing insights into our health. He has confirmed for me the things I'm discovering about my body and the American health system. Before reading his book, I was already doing the majority of the things for his Brain Longevity Program, but found that even at 34 yrs old, I was starting to have some memory issues. As he vividly describes the functions of the brain, various body chemicals, I think my excessive exercise has caused high cortisol levels. I will integrate his medicinal tonics and mind/yogic exercises to complete the program and begin doing that within the next couple weeks. I'm looking forward to improving my memory, brain functions. I love his case studies where he gives examples of all walks of life. This book is very well-written!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent, well written, good mix of science and explanation","review":"Five years ago I received a nasty head injury. Before the accident I was pushing my neural limit, employed as a scientist concurrent with writing my doctoral disseration. I learned a great deal about how the jigsaw puzzle between our ears works. I bought the book because he stated the brain grows new neurons. I and friends who have had \\"spectacular recoveries\\" know this. The book is a multifaceted approach to how our neural networks, and our selves, integrate. Good work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written, factual and interesting.","review":"This is a well written, interesting and easy to read book. The explanation on how the brain works was a revalation, and the guidelines for preventing brain degeneration should be compulsive reading. My main impression is that prevention should begin at the earliest possible stage. One criticism is that Dr.Khalsa occasionally made wild assumptions. For example, that telelphone numbers were a specific length so that people could remember them easily. In fact the size of a phone number reflects the number of people who need phones and this is growing with the advent of the internet and mobile phone numbers. But, I suppose this is a growing field and we all have a lot to learn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate information about how the brain actually works","review":"According to the information that is accessible to me about how the brain works, this book provides inaccurate facts.In The Amazing Brain by Robert Ornstein et al. we are told that the information moves from the axon to the dendrites.Brain Longevity says that the information moves from the dendrites to the axons.Does the author know something new about brain function?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hollistic approach to brain-care with Eastern influences","review":"When I purchased this book, the first thing I wanted to do was zip ahead to Dr. Khalsa's program to improve cognition and read it first. However, the chapters that detailed his various patients' cases and the treatments they received were absorbing. The book also explains the various functions of the brain and its systems that, in turn, gave me a stronger reason to adhere to the programs that the doctor suggests. Not only does the book give good practical advice concerning nutrition and stress-management, but also excellent spiritual advice. It is a beautiful, well-rounded book that will lead its readers to a path of enlightenment. The interesting comparisons of Eastern thought to Western thought are interesting and are presented in a manner that everyone will appreciate. If you're over 40 and some of your memory seems to be slipping, I would certainly invest it this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"It's been a WHILE since I read this book but I remember it was very helpful in educating me on the various supplements & meds available to enhance & lengthen brain function.

It was written as a very practical guide for those who do \\"short term\\" therapy, typically consisting of only 3 or 4 sessions.It gives scenarios, and solutions. The author is unapologetic with the language, (in other words, he can be very BLUNT.) This however doesn't detract from the valuable teachings contained therein.I like its brevity, and lack of \\"fluff.\\" The author gets right down to business and stays there."},{"rating":"1","title":"One liners and mildly interesting","review":"As a psychotherapist I was also excited to check out some new brief therapy ideas. However like a few other reviewers I found the book to be a collection of cases that offered pithy one liners and quick come backs to people exhibiting genuine pain and difficulty. I'm not sure what the point is in dismissing their concerns as silly or shutting them down. It seemed belittling to me. One case comes to mind where a client was expressing that they feel their personality is lacking and the retort was \\"I guess you need a personality transplant!\\" Well, now that their concern has been mocked where do you go from there? Do you do the transplant or laugh it off and dismiss their issue? I don't know what the author intended next because each case ends with the punch line. I expect a drum roll at the end of every page."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Book","review":"This book was very disappointing. The idea behind the techniques is a good one, however the execution and context of these is off. They come across as disrespectful and patronizing.

I saw the Crabbs on TBN and had never been exposed to them and I must tell you I have NEVER heard ANY male vocalist be so exacting in harmony, pitch, range or blending before, famous or not.

There also seems to be a lot of bad language just for shock value. These problems served to be a distraction from the plot, which showed more promise than it eventually delivered.

It seems an odd thing to skimp on details of when the time was so critical.Most of the book analyzes the impact for privatization and social movements.

The musicians are fantastic and the vocalists are capable (despite the occasional sour note), but the mix ruins this album for me.

If you were around in 1978 and want to cherish a good scent memory, the new version of this fragrance will disappoint just like all the other old classics that the perfume industry has watered down.It had oakmoss in the base.

It also has a long FireWire cable which is important if you ever want to move your camera around to show other things. Another nice feature about the iMac G5 is that there is a magnetic spot right in the middle of the top of the iMac, so it holds the Pyro webcam securely in place. This worked natively with OS 10.4 and didn't need any drivers. I picked mine up on ebay.If you are looking for a webcam, try to find one of these babies.

The graphics and sound are excellent, including real voices from the actors in the movie. There are many different story lines and levels, and many different villians to fight, so the game has lots of variety. Spider man takes on different personalities (black suit) as in the movie, which adds a twist to the game. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love This Game","review":"I bought this game for the PSP and I really like it. After the disappointment of Spiderman 2 for the PSP, this was really a surprise. The free roaming aspect that they took out of spiderman 2 is back in part 3. Yes, you do have to go to certain points in the game to keep the story going but you can also help the police regain control of gang territory.One additional thing. If doesn't follow the plot of Spiderman 3 exactly. It goes off in a few different directions throughout the story, which is great for a few unpredictable hours of game play.As you go on in the game, you earn additional skills or moves, either by earning the points for it or by making it to a certain point in the story.The narrator has amusing things to say from time to time and adds to the enjoyment of the game.There really are no cons that I can think of.

The authors seem more concerned with trying to amuse their readers than with providing them with helpful information. While some good information exists within the book, it's buried among lame attempts at humor. I found myself being annoyed over and over again by these unfunny intrusions.If you're looking for a lot of helpful, well-organized information on car care, I'd look elsewhere (e.g., \\"Lucille's Car Care\\", by Lucille Treganowan, which I highly recommend).

Buy something else if you actually want some function."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed with this headset","review":"This headset is a horrible fit for the ear. Item does not stay positioned properly on the ear, and is unable to be used comfortably with small ears. I would try another brand with a different type of ear holder. This one is not acceptable, nor usable for comfort. I would send it back if shipping was more reasonable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not compatible with Samsung Epic","review":"The device says that it's compatible with most phones, but the plug is not compatible with the Samsung Epic and does not include an adapter for the plug.

I'm sure the problem is in the factory connections near the plug-in jack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Volume too low","review":"The volume is way too low. The headset isn't really usable for me because the volume is so low, I can only hear the other person if the room is quiet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't fit in ear","review":"I suppose the earpiece is not supposed to go into your ear, because it's pretty much flat and so rests on top of the ear canal. If your car allows a lot of noise in, as mine does, the result is that it's hard to hear because the earpiece rests away from the ear canal and flops around as you might turn your head. I'd have much preferred if they said in their packaging 'doesn't fit into ear' because then I could have made a choice. It never even occurred to me someone would make a headset like that, so live and learn. There are a lot of perky reviews for this thing, so perhaps it works on some ears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Awful...","review":"This product worked for one day with my phone at work and then the static set in.

Even my 5 year old Plantronic did a better job at background noise suppression.

And the fit is bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plantronics M220C","review":"I purchased this headset specifically because the complaints about it were that the earpiece was too small. Unfortuntately, the sound was great but the ear piece so large it kept falling off of my ear.

So I said enough and went ahead and returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loose and floppy","review":"I was expecting this to be similar to my platronics bluetooth that I had for my work phone. This one is much longer, does not have a cushioned earbud, but rather just speaker that sits loosely on your ear. It does have a loop to go around the ear, but that alone does not seem sufficient to keep it secure. Minimal head movement causes the thing to fall off. I am not using it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returns Department my next stop!","review":"The cord is much too short. The whole point in having a headset to begin with is to be able to move about my desk while I am talking. This headset is marginal at best.

Perhaps my phone is just to quiet for this device. But for me it's useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much static","review":"I got this to use with my cell phone (Motorola Tracfone). I did not want to mess with batteries in a bluetooth so I opted for a wired earpiece. Tried to use it once. The volume is too low. When the volume is turned up so you can hear it there is too much static. I have not looked for another yet, but will spend a little more next time and get an earpiece that works. It's not even worth the effort to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the normal Plantronics quality","review":"I own 3 other Plantronics headsets and each of them is great. This model is an inferior product that should not bear the Plantronics name. You would expect a wired headset to be clear and loud. This on is neither. Ironically my other Plantronics units are all wireless and work wonderfully. Look beyond this unfortunate model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most uncomfortable headset ever","review":"I don't know how this headset has any positive reviews. It is quite literally the most uncomfortable headset I have ever worn. The plastic piece that wraps behind the ear is so stiff and uneven that it rubs and irritates my ear so bad I can hardly keep the thing on longer than just a couple minutes. There is no soft ear bud type cover for the actual ear piece, just a horrible round hard plastic piece that just hangs next to the ear by the part that wraps uncomfortably behind the ear. It hangs so far from the ear that it's very hard to hear clearly, unless you use your hand to push the thing closer to your ear. Then the horrible design of the round, hard plastic ear piece hurts where it is pressing. Just an absolutely horrible headset design... I highly recommend looking for another style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Effective Earpiece","review":"I have been using this ear piece for over 3 years now. I really like it. It fit comfortably on my ear without having to have a piece of gear that goes over my head and leave an impression in my hair. My wife also likes it. The sound quality is great and the people I'm talking to say they hear me fine without noticing that I'm on an ear piece. I had an issue only once, then I simply moved the switch (have no idea what it is for) and it went back to working fine. I recommend this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after 2 days","review":"I had one before that lasted for about a year until the cord snagged on my fence and it snapped across the top. Ordered this one to replace it. Call quality was fine...not exceptional but better than most. Two days after I got it, the cord caught on a cupboard door and it broke on top in the same spot. It does take some time for the plastic to loosten up and fit my ear. It is quite uncomfortable until it does that. Either way...I'm moving on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding for the Price","review":"I am very fussy about headsets for my land line phones and find very few acceptable. I currently have three Plantronics headsets and this is the latest one. All are great, but this is the best so far at less than half the cost of the last one. I have this one on a Vtech phone with the volume on the headset at the lowest level and the volume on the Vtech at the lowest setting and everything is loud and clear for me and for person I am speaking to... on land lines and wireless phones. It is very comfortable to wear unlike the other two Plantronics I own. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED at twice the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unusable: volume too low and pinches my ear","review":"On the positive side, the headset is extremely lightweight, and I'm told by people that I've called that the sound quality is very good. Unfortunately, I found the headset unusable for my needs for two reasons. First, the earloop pinches my ear and I can only wear the headset for about 30 minutes before it becomes unbearably painful. Second, I could only use it in very quiet environments because the volume of the earpiece is too low. I would recommend this headset only if you have very small ears and plan to use it in the quietest surroundings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended for all day","review":"Sound quality is good, and it's fine for occasional use, but I need a headset that I can wear for hours at a time - this one is just too uncomfortable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plantronics M220C Mobile Headset for Cordless Phones","review":"Good headset for the price.

The microphome won't stay close enough to my mouth in order for people at the on the other end to hear me. After trying a few times I found out the it helps to use the clip on the cord to attach away from the ear you are using to pull against it.It brings the microphone closer to my mouth.I would buy a bluetooth if I new it would work with my Panosonic cordless phone. Overall, for the price it's okay!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great and is comfortable","review":"I bought five of these for my office. So far everyone likes them and have not had any problems. We had to reconfigure our phones but it all went smothly. Very comfortable and you can switch from one ear to the other, you just have to flip the inside clip. Sound quality is good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loose Fit","review":"Usually I love Plantronics product but this is just ill-fitting. There is no pressure at the earpiece and the whole thing just dangles from your ears.

I will maybe not even hassle with shipping it back..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Volume too low and a ton of echo","review":"I have been using this headset for a few months now as well as my officemate.

We have had multiple complaints that we can hear other people talking and even dogs barking in the neighborhood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected....","review":"Very floppy..does not fit in the ear canal so it just flops around. The sound was ok but it is just not a secure fit and you can't get it to fit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful to use","review":"This thing will hurt your ears. The part that sticks into your ear is large, made of solid plastic and is in no way contoured for comfort. Whatever idiot designed this should be fired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Find something better","review":"I ordered this to use with my cordless phones. I wish I had heeded what others mentioned; the wrap around ear piece is stiff plastic and pinches. It should be, but is not, flexible to mold to ones ear.The sound is adequate but features are disappointing. The volume slider buttom is stiff and difficult to feel in order to adjust when wearing the headset. Further, it does nothing for the volume on the receiving end (the sound coming from the headset); it only works for the volume of your voice for those you are talking to.I am told by others that the volume does seem to increase the volume of my voice up to 40%, which is good since I tend to be soft spoken. But frequently it creates an echo on my end; since it has occurred randomly, I believe it is a headset issue and not related to the brand of the other phone.I'd find something else if you use a headset, as I do, with regularity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept, won't stay on your ear","review":"The sound quality was good but the earpiece wiggles on your ear, unless you keep your head perfectly still. Very annoying, it keeps falling off."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Get What You Pay For...","review":"I bought this because I needed a headset/microphone that was cordless and I didn't want to spend much money on it. Well, you get what you pay for... sound quality is not very good and it is hard to hear with this, even with the volume on the phone turned up. I actually had to push it further into my ear and hold it there with my fingers to hear well. Kinda defeats the purpose which is to be \\"hands free\\". It now sits in a desk drawer, unused. Ended up with the MX505 model at about $35.00 and like it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"very Uncomfortable","review":"The sound quality is great and it is light weight, but the ear piece is just plastic. There is no foam or rubber padding on mine so it is very uncomfortable. Also I can't figure out how to switch it to the other ear so it only works with my right ear."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what expected","review":"The bud that goes in the ear is a hard plastic and hard to fit into the ear and unless you hold it closer to your ear it is hard to hear out of...although people can hear you clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Fit","review":"Very poor fit on my ear unable to adjust for my ear. Not enough protrusion for ear bud to be incerted securly in ear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this","review":"I agree with the review by Chris B on Aug 10. There is no pressure at the earpiece and the whole thing just dangles from your ears.

Do not buy this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Volume too low!","review":"Positive: Good looking, comfortable, voice quality is good (natural sounding, no noise)Negative: Mic's volume is too low!

Volume of the speaker (headphone) is quite loud, I have no problem hearing other people's voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helping with my TMJ","review":"If money was no object, I would prefer the totally wireless headset phone, however, this has been a great alternative. I have TMJ, and activities like talking with the phone crooked in my neck, while holding my toddler, while preparing dinner, compound my pain...go figure! I find that having the phone clipped on my hip with the cord hanging is kind of a pain, but, the product works great. I have had no problems hearing anyone, nor has anyone had difficulty hearing me. The earpiece is comfortable and easy to get on and off, even for someone with elfishly small ears like me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"very uncomfortable, poor volume","review":"I recommend AVOID. This item is poorly designed -- it's very uncomfortable (the ear-hook is odd and stiff, there is no soft cushion against the ear), the volume is poor and can't be adjusted much, and the cord for some odd reason comes out on the inside of the mike boom. (Whose brilliant idea was that?)I can't explain all the great reviews, which induced me to buy this, so I won't even try.Consider the M175 if you want a really nice headset at a reasonable price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossibly low volume","review":"I tried using it with my HTC Thunderbolt. In the house, with no road noise, I was, after making sure the volume was all the way up, almost able to hear the voice on the other end of the call. I heard the keyboard beeps just fine, but I tried several calls to different phones and the call volume was almost nonexistent. Great if you want to be the only one talking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best headset ever!","review":"I've been using this headset for years and while I have tried others, nothing can compare. I love that it goes over the ear rather than in the ear and it's inexpensive to boot. My voice is always the most clear on all conference calls. This is a real deal!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomfortable, poor sound quality","review":"I work from home full-time and spend a majority of my day in teleconferences.

In the last 12 months, I've read all Couplands books and I think that this and Shampoo Planet are my favourites. I've read the reviews below and cannot understand some of them. One complained of the number of Anglicisms in the book. Now, for one Coupland is Canadian so uses more Anglicisms than someone from Dead-dog Indiana, secondly - try being British and having Americanisms rammed at you all day. The worst comment was that the satire was pointed at targets that were too easy. This misses the point of the book. What Coupland does so well is to take easy targets and make you care about them -- it would be easy to mock a grown-up child beauty queen and her monster of a mother, it's a lot harder to make you understand what makes them tick and see them as real people. Buy and read this book, then go away and buy and read all Coupland's others (apart from Lara's Book)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast & fun to read","review":"The only other Coupland book I've read is Microserfs, so I picked this one up just for the heck of it. I'm glad I did, because it was a great read. Coupland's style -- skipping back and forth between present & past & between character viewpoints -- can be a little jarring at first. However, once I got into the book, I found the style to be one of the best parts. It kept me interested and made a relatively simple plot exciting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I have listened to over a hundred books on tape, and this is one of the worst. The story switches from past to present to past to present. It is very hard to follow the story. Don't waste your money on this, there are to many good tapes out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Jackie Collins novel","review":"I've read better fiction from highschool students! We have six people in our bookclub and all of us HATED this novel. John Irving, he is not. Save your money and don't buy this book. If you somehow get stuck with it, it's good paper for the bottom of the bird cage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Microserfs","review":"Dennis Coupland's Miss Wyoming was not at all what I expected, but it was well worth the wild read. Part social commentary on the cult of celebrity and part gonzo Hollywood buddy book, this is a fun story that has some very poignant moments. From the aging movie producer in recovery to the crazy mom of the former child beauty queen, the characters are well-drawn.The locations lack detail and panache, but the real story here is the people. This book leaves you wanting just a little bit more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally Trashy!","review":"If you are addicted to reading the tabloids then you'll love this book. If you're looking for depth, and intellectual stimulation stay away!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Coupland Touch","review":"The book didn't have the philosophical bite that others do but Coupland excells at, as another reviewer mentions, pointing out absurdities of modern life and the common struggles we have.I heartily recommend this book although as a first Coupland I'd start with Microserfs or Generation X."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would the real Miss Wyoming please stand up?","review":"Haven't we met before? Coupland's latest work is a depressingly entertaining story, but it's full of character styles, locations, anecdotes and analogies that are getting a little stale. Stale because they have all been used in his other books (can you say \\"Peter Mayle\\"?). Also, Miss Wyoming is organized in a series of flashbacks which can have some effect, but in Miss Wyoming, end up confusing things. I'm not exactly sure why the story was written this way - it's almost as if Coupland dropped his final draft down the stairs and then hastily organized the pages back together. It's time for some fresh stuff, Doug."},{"rating":"2","title":"Same unique style, different scenarios","review":"What I perhaps enjoyed most about \\"Miss Wyoming\\" was that Coupland tackled new subject matters. No self-absorbed twentysomethings. No plans to save the world. Instead, there were unique characters on their different personal quests. And I love the amazing detailed descriptions only Coupland could devise (John's pale blue eyes are \\"the color of sun-faded parking tickets.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Coupland's best fictional work","review":"Miss Wyoming is simply a great book. While I enjoyed Microserfs for it's witty and satirical look at life in the mid to late 1990s, but this book has much more depth. Life After God, a super book, shows the depths that Coupland is capable of. Again, he does not abandon the style that brought him this far. Colgate and Johnson (who seems supiciously like Don Simpson, if Simpson had lived and found redemption) are fully drawn and lively characters. You care about what happens to them. Colgate's Jonbenet/Tina Yothers (okay, not a beauty queen) life rings true. Johnson sets out like John Sullivan in Preston Sturges' Sullivan's Travels. The results of his journey are different, but just as important. The love story and mystery work well. Miss Wyoming works as satire, love story, and social commentary. A terrific read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please try again!","review":"Doug, we felt we had a voice in Generation X, we felt the depth of the conclusion in Life After God, and we felt the depth of pathos in Girlfriend in a Coma, but what happened with this? It seems as if Douglas Coupland has drowned in his own cliche's. Chapter after chapter of character development with no real plot. Was I meant to pity these people? Blame their past? Their upbringing? Yes, yes I know the style, every third chapter refering to a different character, but where are we going with this? What are you saying? I felt no pity for these people written like some characters from a Jerry Springer show. However if you want 35 chapters of character development then read on. Otherwise choose something from an earlier period of Coupland - you won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please go back to the suburbs!","review":"I have to admit, I was very disappointed by this novel. I have read Douglas Coupland's previous books, multiple times, in fact, and I have loved them all.My favorite characteristic of his books has always been the flashes of brilliant insight that he seems to find in the austere desert, a suburban mini-mall, in the woods. The Hollywood backdrop for this story rang hollow, and didn't provide for that same kind of insight.I was also disappointed in the dialogue--usually I find his wording to be charming and intelligent, but here it sounded like the unedited prose of a precocious 10th grader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointed","review":"I have read all of Douglas Coupland's books and this is the first book that I gave away before I could finish it. I was so anxious to get this book that I pre-ordered it from Amazon before it was available for sale (that should expalain what kind of a Coupland fan I am). I found the story to be unbelievably boring! I usually appreciate Coupland's rambling style, but this time his rambling didn't go anywhere. If this is Coupland's true impression of what society is like now, we're all in trouble."},{"rating":"1","title":"And Miss Wyoming is...","review":"Would you be seriously interested in knowing who Miss Wyoming is? No.So why read this book?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful. Douglas Coupland's (Only) Flop","review":"I've now read severl Coupland novels, and this is the only awful one I've stumbled across. Microsers was great, Girlfriend in a Coma was hard to get through, but once done one could see it's magnificense. Generation X, though cheesy, was fu. Miss Wyoming is completely different from anything else Coupland has written. In a bad way.Save your money. By something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not typical Coupland.","review":"In this novel, Douglas Coupland veers away from what he does best. This work is predicable and mundane. I believe he was trying to take his story telling in another direction- a more mainstream direction, but he fails. The characters are poorly developed, the plot is thin and predictable. Having said this, I remain a huge Coupland fan and if you bored of the formula of Generation X and Microserfs, perhaps this is hte novel for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, this is bad","review":"This is my first DC book and probably my last. Using the tired jumping back and forth in time gimmick did not work, I could barely keep track of who was who and where their cliff hanged three chapters ago, was Susan nine or post-crash or is this the present? What a nightmare of a novel. There is the expected assortment of larger-than-life eccentric characters who are unbelievable or do unbelievable things. The worst sin is after all the building and dragging, there is simply no plot!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL READ","review":"I recently read the author's work, MICROSERFS, and found it an enjoyable read. I find this novel to be as fascinating but for different reasons. The author clearly understands the Hollywood scene. The ideas explored here-redemption from the past, fated love, and the tangential nature of life-are all handled with a sly sense of humor. I highly recommend this. It is a solid effort from this novelist."},{"rating":"2","title":"All is forgiven","review":"I have been in love with Douglas Coupland and the characters of his books for years now. I own first editions of everyone of his books, and he had always been high on my list of men I would marry--living or dead. That being said, I removed him after stumbling through Girlfriend In a Coma. It was surface, uninspired writing; and for the first time I didn't get to that special place that I get to with every other Coupland book. That place where I have read a line and he has described something in that most perfect way. The way I had always wanted to express it, but never knew until I read it. It is those moments when I lay the book against my chest and sigh. Douglas has redeemed himself with Miss Wyoming. There is at least one perfect moment in this book. No, it is not Life After God or Microserfs. But it is good. It's worth your time. And it reminds you that just like you're mother, Coupland isn't perfect. And that's okay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Normally a fan of Coupland","review":"But this one didn't stick. Microserfs? A-plus. Gen X? That book was rich with character and story telling. Miss Wyoming just doesn't quite do it for me. I actually didn't even notice when this book was written, but i assume after those, but it feels like one of those writers that....I don't want to say has run out of stories to tell, but isn't writing like he loves it anymore. Maybe I'm being harsh because I know he's a great author"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very far-fetched","review":"Pickard doesn't have a real \\"feel\\" for the South. Some of the mannerisms and customs she described were laughable. Southerners don't sit around and drink Mint Juleps unless it's the Kentucky Derby. I never heard of an 60's era Underground Railroad for blacks such as she described. If something like that were going on in a small town, everyone would know about it right away.The mystery in the plot was good. Pickard had me guessing as to who the villains in the story were. That's the only good thing about this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bof","review":"I read it in a few hours because the storyline was so predictable and I didn't care mot read the details.

Compilation 3 is also fun, effective, and something I will use to keep exercising without boredom. Kick Bound is led by the vivacious Traci. A little shorter (24 minutes) you will still work up a sweat. Interval Bound is just fantastic as it gives a good workout with a great variety of moves that are easy to follow. Hi-Lo will remind anyone old enough of your aerobics classes from the mid 80's thorugh mid 90's. Latin Bound was not for me, too slow paced and short to be a good workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great work out video","review":"This compilation does offer a good variety of workouts. The music in all four videos is very nice. Kick bound is my favorite just because Traci is the instructor. I haven't tried the Hi-Lo because it seems more for the advanced type and I'm just not quite there yet. I like doing the Latin bound on days when I'm not feeling very up to exersicing because its slow paced yet fun and upbeat. Interval bound is a nice change too, its more of a sporty type thing but its still fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done!","review":"These rebounding exercises cover all the areas (arms, torso, legs), they're choreographed so it's easy to learn the routines, the music is good - and they're fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good exercises but poor DVD quality!","review":"I have purchased many exercise DVDs at the local stores or online.

I wanted to try some routines so I bought two videos to give it a try. I found the trainers slightly annoying and the routines to be dull. I liked learning the basic types of bounces but it seemed VERY repetitive after the first 10 minutes. I prefer to use the basic moves I learned from the DVD's and do my own thing.

There was one drawback. It turned my finger green. I only wear sterling silver or white gold jewelry, and I have many sterling silver rings, none of those rings have turned my finger green.

Nowhere in the description, even in Chinese, mentions about the Holy Bible. This is a great book, and I'm still finding a lot of answers each time I go back to read it. For anyone interested in the metaphysics and Feng Shui (obviously also have to be able to read Chinese), this book and those in the series would be one of the best investment you make in books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent introduction to the bodhisattva ideal","review":"In all due respect to reviewer Jeaniei, this book is not particularly difficult to read. In fact I would say that it treats a subject which could be quite technical in a straightforward, down-to-earth style. The book does deal with the Buddhist origin of the bodhisattva ideal, and in the process does introduce Buddhist philosophy, but does so in a way that a beginner can follow. I would hazard a guess that Jeaniei hasn't been exposed to Buddhism at all or else she doesn't appreciate it. Still, don't be put off by her review; this is not a difficult book to read if you are comfortable venturing into new areas of thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rachmaninov rendered by a robot?","review":"This recording was very interesting to listen to. After a few hearings, however, I became suspicious and started also to listen to the audio recordings Rachmaninov made of the same pieces and of the earlier releases of Ampico rolls on LP's (I have these already for 20 years on tape). There are noticeable differences, and the audio recordings do sound more \\"human\\". Particularly in the Humoresque Op.10 nr.5 I find the sound too robotical. The broken chords in the fast sections Rachmaninov plays more with a \\"wigling hand\\". Generally Rachmaninov's audio recordings also contain much more improvisation and are nicer too listen too. Anyhow the CD is a very interesting edition of old music coming alive anew. I hope Wayne Stahnke will continue this series. There is still much to be transcribed (Hoffman, Busoni, Rosenthal, Friedheim, Godowski, Paderewski, Chalov to name a few...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"An electri fying chance to sample a past once beyond reach.","review":"I can't say enough about this CD!

This is not a remastered recording made back in the '50's. This is actually Rachmaninoff performing via a special, pressure-sensitive type player piano. It truly sounds like he was recorded live with our current technology. The accompanying booklet explains everything very clearly.Rachmaninoff was not only an exceptional composer, he was also an exceptional (if that is a strong enough term) performer.

When the DVD arrived, one Saturday we sat down and watched it first in English. Then, he took control of the DVD's remote control. He laughed with the English version and laughed again with the Persian version and had a great time.It is now a ritual in our home that any new kid stopping by would sit down to watch this wonderful movie with a heart warming story and I simply enjoy how my son tells the upcoming scenes to his friends.My congratulations to the producers and artists on this movie.Thank you on behalf of Ashkaan.Thank you on behalf of Ashkaan's parents."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a woman","review":"I got this as part of the research I was doing on the era.

The fact that it mentions that she believes that she cannot be with child and its mentioned multiple times just affirms that she will in the end huge give away.

I mean, he goes off on his brothers when they are only trying to give him good advice. He orders people around and tells them what they will and will not do like he's their slave owner of something. I guess I wasn't very interested in Vera and Marcus's story anyway. I had to read this book to get to the next because I'm very interested in Angelique and Adonis's story.

All you can do is hate this man who can't hold a job, allows his family to starve, and repeatedly beats and rapes his stepdaughter while claiming that he loves her. The mother is equally frustrating when she won't get rid of this piece of garbage despite how dangerous and completely worthless he proves he is time after time.

(This was the final straw that I stopped watching Lifetime movies altogether.) Just can't manage it. The level of abuse heaped upon this poor child makes me physically ILL, and that her mother allowed it to go on, and in the end, chose to give the child away to save her life, and STAYED with that monster?

Child abuse is very real, and the only way those of us who are fortunate to have never experienced it will understand the trauma is to see the ugly reality - UNcensored!

The acting is impressive for a made for TV vehicle but the staying power, I believe, rests with the power of the story's visuals and its words. I understand Ms Huston agreed to direct \\"Bastard out of Carolina\\" only if she was allowed to show the true ugliness found in the novel. She used her freedom very wisely and managed to draw the needed emotions out of her cast.I honestly believe this tele-movie is must seeing for all of us. The story is true and it is being repeated all around us every minute of every day by our neighbors, friends, and relatives against our loved ones. Until we believe this and look very closely for the signs things will only get worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful and disturbing...","review":"When I first saw this movie on, 'Lifetime' tv I was so horrified I literraly trembled.

I would certainly recommend it to anyone who says/believes that Bob Dole has the \\"character issue\\" advantage over Bill Clinton! The book shows, with sufficient documentation, the Bob Dole will sell his vote to the highest bidder -- often making people VERY RICH in the process.Did you know that long before the Whitewater people went to court, one of the Doles closest business partners was convicted and did jail time for illegal activities directly associated with the Doles? Why havn't the \\"liberal media\\" picked up on this?On the down side, Hilton is a lawyer who writes like a college sophomore... not exactly the heights of prose! It also hardly touches on Dole's personal life -- another area where Dole hardly has an advantage on the \\"character issue.\\"Nevertheless, I still recommend Senator of Sale"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not That Smart of a Book","review":"Looks like the anti - Dole forces have found their Kitty Kelly in this \\"Unauthorized\\" tabloid look at good old Bob.

All this plus a bunch of good old Bob Dole straight talking quotes.For the Dole fan like me this book is nothing more then a smear campaign book meant to hurt the candidate and make the author some money. If you do not like Dole, this will be a rip roaring good time for you.

It's about a woman who marries an up and coming successful businessman. At a critical time in his life he feels God calling him to become a pastor. The wife reluctantly goes along. She truly loves her husband, but she is at odds with the situation. After all she didn't have any call to be a preacher's wife. Her struggle and the husband's reactions are the teaching gems.

I really hate reading books that are written in the first person. It gives a limited view of the world and of other characters and often leaves you feeling overloaded with one person's baggage, trapped in their ordeal with little perspective on the situation from any other view. I recently have read too many books written in this style. It leaves me drained of spirit and feeling dredged.

Some songs are reminiscent of 60s garage bands, others of 70s punk, many on this album sound a lot like mid-80s Gun Club (from the \\"Mother Juno\\" period, not the bluesier Gun Club sound from \\"Fire of Love\\".) But they don't ever fuse these sounds together to form a style of their own, unless that style is simply to inject the music they play with an insipid blandness. The garage-ish songs sound like an anemic version of their 60s models. The punk-ish songs sound like watered-down punk, and the Gun Club-ish songs sound like lame out-takes from some justly forgotten Gun Club sessions. Maybe it's their producer's fault. But someone should tell them that this kind of music is supposed to ROCK and sound energetic.

Louis Prima's \\"What Will Santa Claus Say . . .\\" starts things off on the right track with the real thing and plenty of fun. Satch's \\"Cool Yule\\" is classic. The \\"Jingle Bells\\" featured here is the better of the two Glenn Miller versions that float around. Can you go wrong with Ella Fitzgerald? A few of these selections pop up on dozens of compilations (Satcho's, Ella's, and Deano's numbers), but there are some pleasant surprises here, too. In particular, Pete Fountain's \\"Medley\\" is a delight and swings with the best of them. If you're lookin' to swing this holiday, this is probably the CD to get."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor.","review":"This album takes half-hearted holiday recordings of many of the greatest musicians ever (e.g. Louis \\"Satchmo\\" Armstrong), and puts them all on one album. A listner new to these musicians would write them off on one hearing and never experience the dizzying heights of their work. This album trudges along from one atonal tune to the next, making the listener wish Christmas didn't come every year. Please, don't use this collection as a stocking stuffer-- the recipient would prefer a lump of coal!"},{"rating":"2","title":"American Buses","review":"Greatly recommended. Good nostalgia book for anyone who travelled extensively by bus or for anyone who works in the bus industry.Over 300 black & white photos of every conceivable type of bus. It would have been nicer if the later pictures had been in color. I think it would have add zip to the book.Each decade has 2 to 3 pages of text, giving the highlights of the industry at that time, followed by pictures of each type of bus in use at the time.Interesting tidbits and little known facts are also given. I learned that the official color of school buses is \\"national school bus chrome\\".The quality of the books is good. The pictures are nice and sharp. Every bus aficionado should have this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Start your bus library here.","review":"A reasonable book for bus fans to start with. It covers makes from 1900 to 1989 and author Donald Wood has done his research and crams in plenty of facts for the introductions to each decade. This is primarily a photo guidebook though and as another reviewer has commented, it is a pity some of the photos are not in color.The three hundred black and white photos are mostly good quality. To bulk out the pages the definition of a bus is stretched, for example, on page 76 a photo of some Chrysler limos and on page 80 a Mack truck that just happens to have seats added. There is an index and bibliography.I was disappointed by the dull layout (why is it that these fan orientated titles always look so bland?) because most of the photos are to predetermined widths there are plenty of large empty spaces and it is a shame that the publishers did not care to put a bit more creative effort into the layout.Still, this book will be good start to your bus library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another CD of Christmas songs RUINED","review":"They took all these wonderful Christmas classics and turned them into Country & Western songs.

It's too bad, because Lamont seems to have put in a lot of work reviewing his encyclopedia for vapid generalities about dead white men.Specifically, the \\"philosophy of humanism\\" in Lamont's hands is an exercise in wool gathering, padding, and trying to look like he's saying something while saying as little as possible (but the same could be said for the Humanist Manifesto III). In addition, the book definitely shows a '50s mentality which has not been edited out of the later \\"editions.\\" For Lamont, the '60s never happened.The historical review probably has some value as a bibliography to more vital and lively works.

Pantone is being very upfront and responsible in this matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful","review":"I bought the Huey on recommendation from a friend and a couple of favorable mentions in articles in photography magazines. It has not worked out. After calibration and recalibration there is a greenish tint to the grays on my monitor. I have tried everything I could think of to get rid of it. The adjustments via Huey's own setup are minimal and very large. No fine tuning is possible. Calibration with my monitor's own software and the adjustments via my graphics card setup prove to be infinitely more accurate. I wrote to Pantone about the problem and 2 weeks later I still have not received an answer. Save your packing materials, just in case you have a similar experience and want to return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Tool for Serious Photography","review":"After attending a Nikon school last year I decided to take the instructor's advice and invest in a color management tool. The Pantone name is synonymous with color and has been a part of my art tools, since I studied color theory in art school over 25 years ago, through the use the Pantone color swatches.The Huey is so simple to use and made an immense improvement to my display as well as the photos I am printing. The colors are now accurate which means that what I see on my display is what I see in the final print.The use of the Huey to adjust and correct the display on my ancient iMac has been a great success and a very simple process. The ability to continually monitor the settings and automaticly adjust the display for room lighting is an added bonus.I reccomend the Huey to anyone who is serious about getting the most out of their photo software and printers. In short it was money well spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for a first monitor calibrator, works well with OS X","review":"This is my first monitor calibrator, so I'm comparing the Huey to not calibrating at all. The calibration really appears to work. For example, when I go to the photo equipment review sites I can now see the difference between all shades of white, gray, and black along the spectrum. Previously, the whites and blacks on either end all looked the same. Also, I can can see much more fine detail in hair, or in shadow detail. I never realized how contrasty my monitor was before calibrating.Two reservations: there's no support for dual monitors. I assume that if you're the kind of person who calibrates your monitor, you're also the kind of person who uses dual monitors. Also, the construction of the Huey seems a little flimsy. That's OK--I don't plan to take it out in the field.Overall I'm happy with the Huey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pantone Huey Monitor Color Calibrator","review":"This is a must have if you want to print what you see on your LCD screen.Priced right and very easy to install and use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanna live in \\"The Matrix\\"?","review":"It's cheap for a reason.

Horrible product, and you'll get raped on the return fees..."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible item","review":"Either all the people who love this item work for Pantone or I got a lemon. And since a couple of other reviewers reported having to exchange a few until they got one to work, I think quality control is an issue. It is easy to install. What is not easy is calibrating your monitor to match their settings. As another reviewer wrote, I also found it impossible to make the top 3 rings match the lower ones - and after you install and reinstall the software a few times (just in case you or the computer did something wrond) you just want to give up. Moreover, no matter how I adjusted the levels, a preset screen showed a suspiciously similar \\"before\\" and \\"after\\" image. And my own before and after printed photos confirmed that nothing was adjusted. I've returned the item, because I do feel it could be defective. But it wasted a lot of hours and was needlessly frustrating. I fell for the Pantone reputation. Don't."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE huey MUST BE COLORBLIND!","review":"I notice a little difference in what my prints look like compared to my LCD's default settings, so I figured for $80 why not try the huey. Hey it from Pantone and GretagMacBeth and they make quality stuff and have reputible names...I thought. My grey's turned to tan's and prints look awful. I gave it an extra star though because it's cool that it adjust to the lighting in your room. It's still crap though and I wouldnt waste my money if I were you..but hey you monitor might have better results than mine, I'm no expert."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not work at all","review":"Installed the software, no problem. Plugged the Huey device into a USB port and it was recognized by my computer, no problem. Clicked on the Huey icon to run the program and the screen came up with the \\"start\\" button, no problem. Clicked on the \\"start\\" button and the program immediately terminated. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling the software, same results.Called Pantone. A human answered the phone after one ring -- impressive. Bad news, he indicated that my problem seems to occur frequently with Dell computers (which I have). Something about the USB ports not providing enough power for the Huey device to function properly and that I'd need to get a USB hub with its own power supply. Ugh. I suppose I could get one (they're inexpensive), but what's to say that that's indeed going to solve my problem. I've already spent too much time trying to get this $65 product to work.Long story short, Huey's getting returned. Huey, we never even knew ya."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not accurate and not adjustable, thus not recommended","review":"The huey is easy to use, but doesn't produce adequate results. My screen was far too bright and red, and the huey program simply doesn't offer enough adjustment options to make it work. You can't adjust the gamma level, or really do anything with the brightness, contrast or colors. You are given a selection between 10 presets, with 8 of them being completely unusable, and two of them being semi usable. If you want more options, Pantone expects you to pay 40 dollars to upgrade to the Pro version. This is simply unacceptable. I could not recommended this product to anyone. Buy something else that actually works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unacceptable color \\"calibration\\"","review":"I tried the Huey on several pc's, using several different monitors(CRT and LCD). In every case, the colors were severely off. Defective unit? Possibly, however I believe that the Huey is just not up to par. Unlike other calibrators, the Huey doesn't help you manually correct your monitor. Instead, it does some display tests, and makes adjustments through software(the profile it created) to get the desired effect. In other words, it doesn't calibrate your monitor at all, it simply adjusts your pc's video output. Unfortunately, this method doesn't seem to work well.I would suggest spending a little more and getting the Spyder2. It will actually help you adjust your monitor, not just \\"calibrate\\" through software."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was not satisfied with the results","review":"Setup and installation was easy. Following the istructions during calibration was straitforward and relatively easy to understand. However, after calibrating several times (8 total) I was not satisfied with the result each time. After my monitor was \\"calibrated\\" all colors looked washed out, almost like there was too much blue. Also, my monitor appeared too bright for my liking, even with auto-light correction turned off. I'm not satisfied with this product and I am returning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crashes on Vista","review":"I run Vista Home Premium 6.0.6 build 6000. My Huey software is 1.0.5, the latest that supposedly supports Vista. After a successful install, when I run the Huey application, and press \\"Start\\", it immediately stops working and crashes out. I have tried plugging the Huey directly into the HP Computer port as well as a hub to no avail. Returning the garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid hardware, software could be better","review":"I used the Huey to calibrate a Dell 2007WFP and Lenovo T61 laptop display. For the money the Huey hardware can't be beat. I personally think the Windows software they bundle with it is crap. I calibrated my monitors using Argyll CMS, open source Linux software. That software is professional quality and paired with the Huey I got amazing results.The Windows software uses between 10 and 15 different color combinations (I didn't count the exact number) during calibration. Argyll allows you to control the number of colors and quality. It takes longer, about 60 minutes to create a high quality profile with Argyll, but the difference was noticeable, and the profile I created in Linux worked fine in Windows. So, excellent hardware and highly recommended. The software for Windows will yield good results but not the best possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned It","review":"Received info in mail from Pantone so figured I would try it...using it turned my grays to pinkish and couldnt control that changing light sensor. But it was cheap so I didn't lose sleep. Was frustrated enough to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incompatible with Windows Vista","review":"What a disappointment! The unit looks neat and I was looking forward to using it. It installed OK, but a warning message came up, telling me of known compatibility issues with Vista. I downloaded the latest drivers and the system ran, but gave me a very green cast!!! After that, it would not restart, so I uninstalled. Even after the system was uninstalled, it took over my color management ad gave me green screens! I eventually had to do a system reset to an older date, to get rid of the Huey!!! What a terrible experience. It's going back for a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for my laptop computer","review":"Great performance for the money. Purchased this for my laptop so I can edit photos while on the road. Unit folds (in the stand) and the base is designed so that the cord wraps around (in a grove) and the USB plug snaps into the bottom. Calibration was a breeze and it even reminds you to re-calibrate, which is something I am really bad about remembering.Not quite the quality I would want for my main editing workstation but it gets you really close, it is small, and it travels well. The ideal solution for what I needed. For this particular need I can't imagine buying anything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"it is good as long as you get a good one","review":"I ordered 6 of them and 4 were in very poor quality. Basically, the 2 good ones performed nicely. However, the rest 4 of them are in very bad quality and turn the monitor into dark red, light yellow, or bright red! I think Pantone should improve their overall quality, cause 4 out of 6 is pretty rediculous!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great product for the price","review":"I used this product to calibrate about a dozen monitors, including flat screens and CRTs from several manufacturers. There was a visible improvement in color fidelity as compared to print samples, and flesh tones appear much more realistic.It's very fast and easy to use - it takes just a few minutes to go through the process.We're hooked the Huey to one system in order to see how the automatic room light adjustment feature works. Since our office space has the standard overhead flourescent lighting, this really isn't an important feature for us. We just \\"set it and forget it.\\"I plan on recalibrating in a month to see if there s any visible drift over time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great on all my Macs","review":"I'm just an average user; doing some photoshop, web browsing, etc, and this tool really makes the image much better to my eyes. I've used it on an iBook(G4), Mini(G4), eMac(G4), an old and new iMac(Intel), with Tiger and Leopard, and in each case it makes the image much better, and certainly better than anything I could do manually myself fiddling around with the controls. Highly recommended even if you only use it once in a while. It really does make the image much better to my eyes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pantone does not live up to it's reputation","review":"I own a Mac and no matter what I did this made my monitor worse not better. The factory default setting for my monitors was the closest to true color when printing color samples. Very disappointed. In fact, I had to call Apple to get this program removed and help in getting my monitor back to where it was. I was hoping a product with the name 'Pantone' on it would produce desired results."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy for a Mac with Leopard","review":"If you have a Mac running OS X 10.5 (Leopard), be advised that Pantone has been promising since last year to fix whatever is broken that prevents the use of the Huey. The company won't even respond when you ask support what is going on. They said the new installer would be available \\"early\\" in 2008. When I wrote an inquiry to the Pantone people on April 3 the automated reponse said it could take two to three days to reply. I'm still waiting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Colours don't match","review":"I bought this wanting to match on screen colours with printed pantone swatches. It doesn't work. The on screen colours are extremely washed out and dull compared to the pantone swatches. I am very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy setup, too bad the results sucked","review":"Easy enough setup, easy enough to start the calibration, pretty to watch the colors flash on the screen, but the results had a horrible color cast. Checking the Pantone site showed it was a known issue, great. I sent in an incident as they requested, wound up calling in as well. I returned it for another, same problem. Turns out there was a batch of them bad, they knew about it and were waiting on replacements to go out to all us suckers who bought one.Great business model, product is defective, but rather than recall them and lose sales, sell the broken product and force a user investment in time hoping they'll just wait it out.Returned it and bought a Spyder3. Bought the Huey late May, was told July 1st a replacement would be on it's way, got an e-mail on the 3rd it would be the 21st at least. So sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Quite What I Expected...","review":"I bought this because I made a web page on my laptop and when I uploaded it to the web and looked at it from another computer all the colors were way off. I was hoping that this Huey would make it so all my monitors were the same color. It did correct the color on my Asus laptop and brought it closer to the color of my other monitors. I ran it on 3 computers all next to each other and all 3 monitors have slightly different colors."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad product","review":"I bought a Pantone Huey last October...it worked great until January, then just died. Tried re-installing software, using a different USB port but nothing worked. Wrote to Pantone and they replaced it with a new one, no questions asked (good!). The second one lasted about 3 weeks then also died."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy, cheap, problem free","review":"It installs and runs like a charm, no problem at all.Remember to disable all color profiles, color management apps.White is white for the first time."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent starting point for color calibration","review":"I bought this when I started printing my own photos at home, but it's useful whether you send your photos out to be printed or do it at home. The price is about right if you are just getting started with color calibration.The basic Huey device is easy setup and use, but I don't really use the auto light adjustment. It's small enough to take with you if you use a laptop (in fact it's always in my laptop bag). If you are going to use it with a laptop, then I think it's the perfect buy, but if you are going to use it with a permanent desktop setup you might want to consider the pro setup since there isn't a huge price difference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Calibrating printer","review":"W ithout the calorimeter, my monitor photo and the resulting print on an HP professional photo printer had discrepencies in color matching. With the Huey calibrater the print and the monitor photos were close enough to the point where it was difficult to notice differences. I am very well satisfied with the unit that removed the frustation every time I made a print from my digital camera. My photos are mostly of exotic succulents of amazing colors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I received my huey earlier this week, installed the software, and ran a calibration on my iMac G5 (OS 10.4). The screen turned pinkish. I ran the calibration MANY times and every time got the same result. After a couple of hours, I put everything back in the box and sent it back for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"I wanted a cheap profiler for amateur photography. I don't have an external monitor, so I only work on my laptops - an older MacBook and various Dell Latitudes and Inspirons. The Huey did not do a good job of profiling these laptop screens - results were inconsistent across laptops, and even different in Windows 7 and OS X on my macbook. Profiles were visibly ugly and tinted. Perhaps it would work better with better monitors, but I wanted something cheap for cheap screens. I returned the Huey for a Spyder 3 express which does the job perfectly."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 strikes - it's out","review":"I ordered Huey to calibrate my CRT monitor. The original (manufacturer's) monitor profile was pretty accurate, I was mainly interested in Huey's ability to automatically adjust for ambient lighting.Calibration with first unit created strong yellow cast.The replacement unit sent by Pantone created even stronger green cast. I tried it on 2 different displays, under different lighting, same results.Their customer service was trying to be helpful - no complaint there. But I had to return the calibrator. It simply does not work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"Works like a charm. Used it to calibrate an LCD on a Mac and CRT on a PC, both times it worked flawlessly. Easy installation and operation. Color change can be drastic if your previous settings weren't right, which I know is a problem for most of the people complaining. Not much control in the huey application, but enough for most users (harder to mess the settings up). It basically gives you several choices, preffered color temp at 6500K and options for 5500 and 9300 (actual numbers not mentioned, only named Warm and Cool). Actual device is rather cute, tiny at only 4\\" long. Using suction cups on my LCD was not a problem, they are very soft. All in all, a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed after one calibration","review":"I purchased this item in April and used it to calibrate my monitor. It seemed to do a good job. Then the software prompted me to recalibrate after 2 weeks. After running the program to do this recalibration, everything was magenta and my cursor arrow was electric blue-green. I ran the program several more times with same result. I contacted Pantone - they said the item was faulty and that they realized this was a problem with a number of these units and they promised me a replacement unit. They told me the new units would be in by early July. That didn't happen, then they gave a later date of July 21. It is now July 30 with no new units. I can't recommend this unit to anyone. Maybe the new ones will work, if they ever come in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Huey Works","review":"As a digital artist it's criticaly important that what I see on the monitor mataches the printer's output, Huey does that with ease. I've used other monitor color adjustment devices but Huey is much simplier to use and the price is right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Damages the LCD screen","review":"The Pantone Huey can leave permanent marks on the LCD screen. It uses rubber suction cups to stick to the LCD screen surface, and when you pull it away it pulls the delicate LCD layers along with it. One of my LCD screens survived this, but another now has an array of bright spots in the upper middle portion of the screen, exactly where the suction cups were attached. Yes, I followed the instructions and used minimal force when handling it. Pantone support didn't bother to return my calls or emails.Never let this product near your LCD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy to Use but Doesn't Cut It","review":"This little device is easy to install but does not correct your screen to match prints. Save your money and try something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Distorts images.","review":"I have the Pantone Huey and I recently installed it because I purchase a Samsung SynchMaster 2233 for my Mac. I couldn't get the settings just right on the Samsung and I needed something to help me out for all the photos I take. I tried this product and followed all the steps perfectly. I tested it out with a few of my photos like a before and after. The pictures appeared to be darker in many instances almost to the point where you couldn't see them. So pictures also seemed distorted, like certain materials turned out to be blotchy. I didn't like it and returned back to the custom configuration that I figured out. I wouldn't get Pantone. There are better companies out there, or just play with it your self in advance mode."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"Spent an entire evening after installing trying different settings and all produced a picture on the monitor (and same printed on upscale printer from digital camera)that was clearly worse than what I started with so sent back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toy","review":"Ive heard good things about Pantone calibration in the past but this misses the mark by far. I thought finally an affordable calibration tool. Well I was wrong. This thing would not stay on my LCD monitor. When I finally did get it to stay and I did a calibration it just didnt seem right. Then the monitor changed on me due to the ambient light adjustment. That feature is a gimmick at best. No way do I want my monitor in constant flux when editing images. If you do buy this , turn that feature off and maybe you can live with this product.Back to the reseller this goes. Anyone have suggestions on an affordable calibration tool?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Green Color Cast!!!","review":"If there's such a thing as \\"0\\" (zero) rating, that's what I'll give this item. I calibrated my monitor as soon as I received the Huey today and now I have a reeally bad green cast on my monitor! I did some research on the Pantone website and it appears that they have already received reports about this problem. As to why these defective items are still out in the market is beyond me. But what I do know is that I am one dissatisfied customer of Pantone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as expected","review":"It's easy to use and does exactly what it says it will do. It took only a couple of minutes to set it up.Initially, the first calibration failed, but then I paid closer attention to the very clear instructions, and it worked. I set it up to re-calibrate based on the ambient light in the room every 5 minutes. It works great. I'm very pleased with the results."},{"rating":"1","title":"pass on this one","review":"Ok, so I had to get a colorimeter and went with this one. I should have spent more money on a better one.

I don't have a way to turn this off, and I can't open the program up in the controls panel due to \\"an error with the program\\" So now I'm stuck with this crappy software.

When I set up my new Eye-one/Display 2, all I could get was a \\"fail\\" on the emissions test, over and over - and never did get to testing my Mac LCD monitor. No response from the Eye-one \\"support\\" to my e-mails.I brought the gadget back to the store that then told me I had moved it during the test or the screen had gone black - and that was the only reason it failed. Neither of those were true. ...However, I did get a refund. So, beware. I'd like to give it a 4 or 5 on the basis of what I saw the demo do, but for how the one I bought worked, I'd give it a zero.

It is dominated by synthesizers and drum machines. \\"Brotherhood\\" and the instrumental \\"Touchdown Raiders\\" are the only good songs on the album.

There is very little in the way of original music; and in fact (like most later Santana albums) he doesn't play his guitar very much. The few licks that do exist are the only thing that distinguishes this from thousands of other bland, unmemorable MOR recordings. This was not a commercial success, either; it was the lowest charting album of Santana's career at the time of its release in 1985. Skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably the worst Santana album","review":"First off, fans of Santana's early work will probably not like this album at all.

I love Tintin, but this book is for adults and for kids who are old enough to understand opium smuggling. (Hmm. The end of that last sentence didn't exactly sound right.) Also, much of the erratic behavior that Captain Haddock exhibits as a result of his alcoholism and hallucinations from delirium tremens (he thinks Tintin is a giant bottle of champagne and tries to pop the cork by pulling off his head) was intended to be humorous. As an adult I now see the humor, but as a child I just found it upsetting. On the positive side, rereading it as an adult, I had forgotten how great Haddock's insults were (\\"Iconoclasts! Rats!
