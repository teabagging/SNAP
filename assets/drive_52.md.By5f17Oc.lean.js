It is easy to set up and takes little space. The versatility and the ability to learn using the controller are excellent. I was on a touring road crew for 15 years and am very familiar with what makes a good drum kit. As others, I agree that there are better kits out there. If you are a professional or even a regular drummer, get a professional kit. If you are just a tinkerer or a beginner, this is a great kit for the money.Pros: Good versatility, easy setup, ability to create your own kits and aux input to play along with your own songs.Cons: Pads are somewhat generic in that they do not have authentic response, no rim shot sensing, kick pad is not big enough for a double kick.Overall, I would recommend this kit to any hobbyist or parent with a beginner. Experienced drummers looking for a practice kit should not expect much from this kit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Important WWII PACIFIC WAR history","review":"Now out of print, this well written book details the Pacific War in around the Leyte Gulf.

Also when applying the two 2 lb end caps and weighing them on a scale, I found that the total result was only 1.91. When applying the two 3-lb end caps the total weight result was only 2.85 lb, and when applying the two 1-lb end caps the total weight result was only 0.87 lb. So overall...not accurate.

I agree with the reader below that it complements Coulter's much larger book \\"The Anatomy of Hatha Yoga\\" well, and would add, that if you found his text daunting, start here. What makes \\"Anatomy and Asana\\" more accessible is that it was created to accompany a live workshop, and has more of a \\"workbook/presentation\\" feel. That said, it's amazing how much information is on these pages. You will refer to this yoga resource for years to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"I am very disappointed in the book The book is written poorly, very dry and expensive for what you get.

I'm in the camp that was disappointed and frustrated. Surely it's a well-intentioned project, and there's lots of information here, but it seems poorly processed - just thrown at the reader, almost as if the author is just showing off her anatomical knowledge. To me the writing is a bit dry and doesn't make the material real, doesn't really relate the knowledge to working with actual bodies. Too much unconnected fact and speculation, not enough energetic personality. I was also irritated that the discussion of the more ethereal, ancient concepts such as the bandhas are presented in the same breath as the medical information, and aren't explained in any depth. I'm on my second read because I'm waiting for new material that I've ordered from the States, but it's sometimes like working with a hostile witness, trying to glean the information that I need."},{"rating":"2","title":"Won Ton Baby ---a classic","review":"This is a great Indie movie. It is well scripted and moves very quickly along the plot line. This is a Horror movie but has many scenes that are absolutely hilarious. The scenery is fantastic and well represented for the movie theme. The acting was extremely well done and all the actors were well suited for their parts. This movie is one that MUST be viewed way more than once to appreciate what the writer and director was trying to get across on the screen. This movie will become a CLASSIC for sure.

I had been concerned about the replacement costs of the drum at 50,000 pages, but not a problem, the printers crapped out first, each just a few months after the warranty expired. We only bought the second one because it was super cheap and we had the spare cartridges and drum from the first dead one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great toy, but buy another brand!!!","review":"I bought these egg shakers for my daughter's first birthday.

There's really not much in the eggs to make a sound. My daughter, who is really familiar with this toy and enjoys the egg shakers from her music class just threw these aside out of frustration.Second, they break very easily. I kept insisting that my daughter try this toy, but about after the 5th try one egg broke in half and I had little black beads all over my floor. I'm scared to think what would have happened if they would've broke with my daughter and I wasn't around.This really is a great toy that kids love.

So happy with these; I've hardly taken them off my head.

With my Bose Soundwave or the output from my computer sound-card, even this 85 ohm set needed a bit of a boost. A $10 inline headphone amp solved that.

BUT there is just one thing that came up that prevented me from giving it 5 stars. 2 weeks into my ownership of these sonic bliss generators. It developed a hollow clicking noise originating from the left speaker. This was only present on low frequency bass music or movie scenes. I don't think it was a issue with the driver or transducer like the other people had due to the fact that I think my issue was a cabling issue. If i were to bend my head the slightest degree (the point where the cable meets the headphone then also bends) that clicking noise would appear and disappear. (personally I am not for giving myself a neck cramp while trying to watch a movie). Other than that issue, they are a beautiful sounding pair of headphones.

I can tell anyone reading this that you will not be dissapointed, I'm not taking anything away from Senn or Audiotechnica, but these cans are truly fantastic. The fist song I heard with these gave me immediate goosebumps. The sound is crisp, well insulated, and powerful.

Great isolation, sound doesn't leak out, very comfortable, great bass. I swear I can hear new sounds in songs I've listened to before with cheaper headphones. There is an obvious, significant improvement when listening to high quality music. If you're not a musician or a DJ this is still a great investment if you have the extra cash. The cord is very long so these headphones are not really portable, but It's no reason at all to even consider taking a star off the rating.

I always buy NGK since i've never had a problem with them and these have been great, no problems.Hopefully the longer life and more precise spark justifies the additional expense, but really, since you only have to replace spark plugs very infrequently anyway why not go with a higher end plug (seriously, 8 of these plugs cost less than a tank of gas in this truck so why not).These were pre-gapped and i did not have to change them at all after measuring each one. The old plugs were well worn and way out of gap spec. The engine ran fine before and i had not yet started logging my gas mileage since i only had it for a month before changing plugs so i don't know if i've gotten better MPG or power out of these but they sure couldn't hurt.

The price is hard to beat - everywhere else the plugs ran $7-12 each - good thing I looked here! The only downside is the packaging that my plugs were shipped in - a small (but adequate) box, but only a small airbag to protect 4 smaller loose boxes - would have preferred packaging peanuts and the wrong receipt was sent with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well","review":"First of all, I'm not sure if you are supposed to gap these or not, when I tried, these scratched the gaper.Nontheless, when I replaced my old worn out spark plugs with these (there was a huge gap difference, these are much smaller), I got a good 2 extra mpg that I was looking for in my Honda Prelude.

She struggles with it. We read because we too can relate to the anger, sadness, and struggle (in whatever area of our life).

She uses herself to mirror reality rather than the foundation of the Christian faith, the Word of God, aka the Bible.In trying to find herself, she projects her image on everything else. Jesus is made in her likeness, and God becomes her alter ego.The things she reveals of herself would be better said to a paid professional, though you must give her credit.

Sparing myself any further diatribal dialog, I skipped to the last two chapters hoping for a softer tone and a bit more religious respect for the sacred. Too much to hope: More profanation and irreverence toward what is not understood. Question: What Would Jesus Think of how He is referred to in this quest-for-a-faith-falling-short?Further Thought (and a bit Deeper) is needed to rise to the level of 'Faith writing' that even comes close to the Bible taken less frivolously. Why cheapen Grace which is the Hope of the human race?

She started off the interview with witty statements which almost made me want to buy her book.. but I respect authors who respect people.She appeared biased, sad, insecure and bent on stomping around anyone who dared challenge or question her!No Lamott for me!Her book may be wonderful.. but who wants another 'spike my vodka for I cannot stand me and hence I turned to Jesus' book... especially when she doesnt mean it in her actions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aimless meandering, mindless ranting","review":"I liked Blue Shoes and Traveling Mercies.

But, what I must say is that I did read the first chapter, and on that I will base my review.The first paragraph of the book begins by bashing George W. Bush. I have figured out that Lamott is a liberal from her other books, and I still love and respect them, but this book starts off on a whole different note from her others.I respect Anne Lamott, and in time, I will read the entire book, and I will write another review if my opinions have changed.

Some might think this \\"refreshing\\" but it wasn't for me. I'm all for living one's beliefs and following Jesus' example of charity, but I don't think that \\"being human\\" is an excuse to use that kind of language and displaying hatred.

She also has many moments of joy and acceptance with all of these people and find a growing contentment with herself and her life. She is down-to-earth and so real. I strongly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"First book I ever threw in the trash","review":"I love books and reading. I read Traveling Mercies and enjoyed it and learned and was touched by it. I tried to read this book but couldn't get past the Bush bashing. Comparing him to Osama bin Laden was the last straw. I wouldn't recommend this book to anybody, except maybe Nancy Pelosi or Harry Reid."},{"rating":"2","title":"blunt, honest, and on-target","review":"Anne Lamott loves Jesus and isn't afraid to say so. She's also not afraid to show how messed up her life (just like the lives of all of us) is. While some readers might get tired of her string of self-deprecating stories, I find it refreshing to find someone who is not only vulnerable, but also a gifted writer.I will admit, though, that after awhile I got tired of hearing how much Anne hates George Bush but doesn't want to hate George Bush because Jesus loves George Bush, but still she hates him anyway and Jesus is helping her with that, and... well, you get the picture. I can accept it for one story, but it becomes one of the underlying themes of the book. I'm surprised that someone as gifted and insightful as Anne Lamott has such one-dimensional political views (republicans=bad! democrats=good!), but I can accept it because her writing is so darn good.After reading this and \\"Traveling Mercy\\" I can't wait for \\"Plan C.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Lose the politics already!","review":"I like Anne Lamott's writings but she continuously bashes the President in this book. I think this is uncalled for. Seriously. She hates the President instead of praying for him (and as another reviewer noted she should \\"love thy neighbor\\") it totally turned me off in this book. Thank goodness I got this one at the library and did not waste my money on this book. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"Honest to Pete - Lamott blows it with this book. I quit reading it when I was half way through as I wondered why I was bothering - why continue to be assaulted like this? Other books by Lamott have been invigorating and fun - this one bashes our President repeatedly (Ok for a chapter - but in almost every chapter?), flaunts the use of vulgarity (just because she's free to do so, doesn't mean she should), and champions rebellion. Lamott is a smart sassy woman - and I love her and I have enjoyed reading about her jaunty walk with Jesus. But this time around I simply wanted to yell at her \\" Oh, Anne, CUT IT OUT!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Cardinal Sin: It's just not very funny.","review":"I have always appreciated Anne Lamott's writing for its upfront honesty, downright hilarity, and the raw edge she brought to her spiritual quest. Now a lot of what she is writing seems trite -- maybe like she's gotten pretty comfortable and lost her edge. The only thing that keeps her going is her hatred of the right wing in American politics,but she doesn't even probe that hatred very skillfully -- it's just there, like a dull toothache. There are some moving moments, for sure, like the ski trip with her friend who is dying of cancer. And it's nice to know she's made friends with her cellulite, I guess, but ultimately not very enlightening.The spiritual insights aren't very insightful, they boil down to this: make friends with uncertainty. Be open to the universe. Breathe regularly."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Disappointment!","review":"I am a longtime Anne Lamott fan from Tiburon California, and a left-leaning democrat of eclectic but genuine faith. So you'd think this would be right up my street. I think of Anne as part of home, but I fear she's lost her mind. I loved Traveling Mercies: it didn't preach, it was funny, it was full of mercy and joy and wonder. Plan B is strident, arrogant, ignorant, and narrow-minded. I can't imagine who would like it. Annie! Quick, call your friends and get your joy of spirit back! And send Sam to a relative until you recover your sense of humor and proportion, for goodness sake!"},{"rating":"1","title":"False faith","review":"I used to love Lamott's writing, but this will probably be the last of her books that I buy. I was extremely disappointed in the underlying tone of bitterness and resentment. If she is truly a Christian, where is the joy? Her take on Christianity is superficial and false. She writes, \\"But in any case, we should try to stay on God's good side. It's not hard. God has extremely low standards. Pray, take care of people, be actively grateful for your blessings, give away your money--you're cool. You're in. Nice room in heaven, flossing no longer required--which is what will make it heaven for me. Oh, I mean that, and Jesus.\\" Her ideas about God and Jesus are more cultural than biblical.Lamott's rantings about George Bush and war in Iraq should have been omitted. We can hear that for free on CNN. Who wants to pay for that kind of drivel? She should not write when she is in a really bad mood."},{"rating":"2","title":"loved this book!","review":"I thought this book was fabulous. I totally dug the journal, storytelling feel of her writing style. Regardless of whether or not you appreciate her more liberal political views, she still brings an honest and refreshing look into what it takes to truly be a follower of God and the scriptures. She is the first to admit that she has problems with always following the \\"rules\\" but approaches them in a way that keeps you engaged in the story... like you are sitting next to her in a coffee shop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time to grow up","review":"I found this book so disappointing. One might expect more growth and love and tolerance from someone who embraced a spiritual path - how many years has it been? The narcissism and whining and self-indulgence is wearing pretty thin. Like another reader, I will definitely take a closer look before investing in another book by Ms. Lamott, hoping to see some growth and transcendence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Method and Message","review":"I like Ann's method of writing: articulate, descriptive, witty. I read Bird by Bird and Traveling Mercies and enjoyed them.I really disliked this book's message. I came expecting to see her progress in faith, and instead I found her message to be angry, intolerant, and unforgiving. Wading through her bad language is tiring. She seemingly scoffs at all historic and practical, let alone biblical, standards of Christian behavior, while forging her own brand of Christianity instead of it shaping her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anne is so Human","review":"I don't necessarily agree with the idea of plan B, I believe Anne is just moving along lifes trek being a human adjusting to daily change. From family to her own god given responsibility for her actions, Anne is a true seeker. What is it she is seeking? A better way, she's trying desperately to help us realize were all human and fall , and fall into plan B as she states. Read Karl Mark Maddox about moving on."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated this book.","review":"This lady thinks that declaring herself a Christian and professing love, she can then do anything she wants. Well, I am sure she is a Christain and is full of love, but Jesus said Repent and do not sin anymore. He is the judge, not me. But I don't have to enjoy her writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anne Lamott Strikes Again","review":"I love Anne Lamott and this book is no exception. As always, she writes with honesty and humor about her everyday experiences. She helps me see the lighter and darker side of Christianity and life in general. I can relate to her foibles and rejoice with her in her human triumphs. I'm glad for Christian writers who I can relate to-not holier than thou, never make a mistake writers. I won't mention names. This book was a blessing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Lamott, but this was a huge disappointment","review":"I was incredibly disappointed with this book. I've greatly loved everything else I've read by Ms Lamott (Bird by Bird, Operating Instructions and Traveling Mercies were all phenomenally funny, real,and wise), but this book seemed to be a mish-mash of nothingness. I was hoping for a further exploration of her faith, much in the same vein as Traveling Mercies, however, Plan B was less of a treatise on \\"the journey\\" and more of a vehicle to bash the Bush administration.What a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plan B","review":"(...)It will take the multiple panicked pumps of CPR to provide minimal resuscitation for a collection of jumbled stream of consciousness ramblings about streetwise spirituality a la Oprah Winfrey, M. Scott Peck and Dalai Lama/Deepak Chopra.Robin Williams has the cure for this sort of illiterature: a few light slams."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts On Faith","review":"I have read and reread Ann Lamott's book Traveling Mercies. I fell in love with the beautiful black women who helped her through her pregnancy. And their great capacity for love. Enjoyed her journey to God, it brought to mind how many of us take the circular route with many detours before we really receive God in our hearts. This book, however, was a great disappointment. Not many thoughts on Faith, a lot of thoughts about how much she hated George Bush, how depressed she and her friends were because if the Bush administration. If I want to read a book about politics I will buy a book about politics. I feel cheated.She already wrote why she makes Sam go to church. For some reason, probably not the authors fault, I cannot seem to see Sam as a real breathing person.I couldn't finish reading the book. I found it repetitious and boring, so much so I doubt that I want to read her latest book. I will probably try though hoping it will be more to my personal liking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth reading and well worth owning","review":"A series of thoughtful, truthful, funny and poignant musings on the framework of life from her perspective - what it's like for her in the aftermath of Bush's re-election, what it's like to be raising a teenage son without his father, how she reaffirms her faith and her religious practice from day to day, written with humor, empathy, compassion and her customary sharp wit and intelligence. I think it is excellent, and am very happy to have it on the shelf - I think I will return to it often; it contains many illuminations and insights I found very valuable on many aspects of living day-to-day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugghh","review":"A dreadful, awful, and utterly terrible book. I enjoyed Anne Lamott's previous work but this one did nothing but anger me. Yuck. Read at your own risk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks Substance, Conviction, Even Reasonable Courtesy!!","review":"I really enjoyed Anne's previous books, but this one is hit and miss. There is no real cohesive message outside of her ranting against President Bush, pro-life conservatives, etc. She presents herself as a deeply committed Christian, and I honestly believe that she is, but then she says so many thoughtless, careless, and even arrogant things.Arrogance is perhaps the one characteristic that makes this book so rough on the windpipe. I believe that Anne Lamott has a big heart, but she also has a big mouth which often discounts her core message (but then again, one is never really sure if she actually has a 'core message'). I wish she would mature a little through her writing rather than regressing with every book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough already","review":"Lamott has obviously run out of gas. She should have stopped writing long ago. She seems to have lost her joy and her muse. This book drones on and on, and it's a downer. It's also preachy. It's like a boring letter that goes on and on, but it's not a good book to read. I'm sorry I got it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gift to the world","review":"Anne Lamott is a gift to the world and I am going to buy four more copies of this book to give as gifts to my friends. Her honesty and humor and compassion for her fellow man are truly remarkable.I have read all except one of her books and this is now my favorite. She has hit her stride."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meanspirited humour at the expense of the ridiculed","review":"Ideal fodder for any who rise to hyena-humour as epitome of laughability. Ridicules what she doesn't understand. Loathes whom she should love with God's love, even the unlovely and unloveable. As a non-Jew, great exception is taken to the level these excuses-for-thoughts sink to for yuks at others' expense.Faith has nothing to do with what got trapped between the bindings and dust jacket."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it.","review":"Anne Lamott is at her best when she's writing about her faith and her kid; she's at her worst when she ventures into the realm of political commentary. Unfortunately, this book had too much of the latter and not enough of the former. There are some gems here, but not enough to make me recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass the sour grapes, please","review":"There is not enough cheese and crackers in this world to go along with the \\"whine\\" that Ms. Lamott serves up in Plan B. I have loved her previous works and based on their merit, I pushed on into this book, beginning each new chapter with hope and ending in dissappointment until I finally had to toss it into the garbage. It was tedious, from menopausal maladies to blaming George Bush for all the problems in her life. And God Himself, or \\"Herself\\", as Ms. Lamott would say, seems to be a reflection of who SHE is and not the other way around. Yes, God loves us just the way we are but He also loves us too much to leave us that way...except in her case apparently. I wanted to like it and I am sorry to say that it fell way below my expectations. Bummer."},{"rating":"1","title":"How can Jesus save a life but not a lifestyle?","review":"Words are not able to describe how loathsome this thing is. As a Christian, I found little Bible-faith and lots of bile. I could hardly believe how she envisioned 12 year-old Jesus as dissing Joseph His stepdad with 'you're not even my dad so I don't have to listen to you..', and Mary standing by with a rock in her hand... or something to that effect? Bizarre!?! to treat Bible history this way!!It's all very well to claim Jesus saved one's life. But this salvation needs to extend to lifeSTYLE, which is sadly lacking here if her vocabulary, expletives, adolescent sass and profane misuse of English is any indication of how an author claiming 'true believer of the faith of Christ' conducts the tongue. See James chapter 3 for a few pointed pointers on Christian conduct of conversing."},{"rating":"1","title":"WAY too much cussing and disrespect for Christ","review":"I barely made it through 1 or 2 chapters before the cussing detracted from any points being made. My minister at our fairly liberal and 'inclusive-of-all-sinners-needing-Jesus-forgiveness' church told me he was immensely offended at how she treats Christ in her writing. I was also shocked at the disrespect with utter disregard. Is there no holy shame? Where is reverent adoration for The Savior?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful But","review":"Anne Lamott is absolutely wonderful at showing the reader where God's grace has entered her life and thus helping us, the readers, to be more awake to grace in our own lives. But, her constant references to her dislike of George Bush (either one) detract from her message and serve no useful purpose (except perhaps catharsis on her part). If I hadn't already read Traveling Mercies I might have put this one down after the first page. I chose to read on because I know what truth and life can be found in her writings."},{"rating":"1","title":"YOU ARE ALL TOO FUNNY!!","review":"I was thinking of buying this DVD and I'm grateful to have read these reviews!

Also, when videos go to slow, i don't get the workout that I want.Eoin Finn seems to hold the postures, just a little longer, so you can really develop strength and some heat. On top of this, the flow is really nice and I felt that I gained a lot of flexibility.I liked the spontaneous nature of the dialogue. It made me feel like I was really in a class.One last thing.

It's really beautiful, and Peggy Hall strikes just the right balance between the physical and spiritual sides of yoga. There are easy modifications to follow, and she's really inspiring and encouraging. She also ends with a very peceful relaxation sequence -- great images for visualizaion without getting sappy. There's a real sense of beginning, middle, and end, a full, complete practice. I also have Yoga for Surfers I, and I'll buy whatever else Peggy Hall creates!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps it real","review":"This is a fantastic workout with both the long and short version and Eoin Finn is a fantastic instructor...I read the reviews and some people enjoy an instructor who talks and those who just instruct...I personally enjoy someone real who talks to me instead of an autotron going through the motions of the poses.

The story about the boar's tusks is amazing. One of the last stories is about all the men before they start fighting, they talk about their time in San Francisco, for most the last place they were in the US.It's a lot different than his others books, especially a lot thinner. It's magically written and sometimes heartbreaking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long, tedious, yet worth it.","review":"Liquor, love, babes, war, ships, planes, etc.! You name it and Michener included it somewhere in his book. Tales of the South Pacific is a book that is written to make many different points about human nature and war. Many of the characters whom the reader is made to sympathize with show the aspects of human life. These characters are also brought to the piont that the only thing they will ever have is what they had doubted the entire war... heroism. These short stories are written in a heavy style that becomes too much work to read sometimes. Even so, the reader is brought along by wondering about the welfare of the special character that they feel close to. This writing is best if one can take brakes through-out the book to let their mind catch up with the story. This book was interesting, yet overall the way in which the characters are represented made the book come alive with emotions."},{"rating":"1","title":"unacceptable spelling errors","review":"stay away from this edition, from this publisher. spelling errors thruout book are unacceptable. plus, print quality is so poor that parts of words are simply obliterated. to the publisher: what is the point of so many speling erors? oops, spelling errors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid basic resource","review":"I got this Commentary set based on the recommendation of the pastor who was teaching a class I was in. I've never done bible research before so this was a good way to get my feet wet. It is not too deep for a beginner like myself, but it gives enough detail and background to broaden your perspective and help you think critically about how you interpret the bible - a very important thing! i'd say for the average person like myself it's a good, handy biblical resource. Seems reliable, nothing I've read in it so far has set off any red flags (in terms of being too subjective). My mentality is that you can't be too careful in what you allow to influence your thinking - especially when it comes to scripture!

When I found a paperback reprint as an adult, I quickly grabbed it. I feel this is one of the most important children's books ever written for this age group, handled masterfully by writer Marilyn Sachs.It is not a happy book, but it is thoughtful and moving and will teach children about other walks of life and how many people live. It will teach them to appreciate what they have and to have compassion for others. I agree that it is best read under the supervision of an adult so children can talk about what they're reading.Disney stories are wonderful, and so are happy endings, but there is a place even among younger readers for books about kids in jeopardy, in poverty, and who are struggling to make sense of the world. I also recommend the sequel, \\"Fran Ellen's House,\\" for those who wonder what happened to the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"THis is an awesome book!!!","review":"I first read this book as a lonely, insecure, slightly overweight 13 year old. I was picked on a lot at that age and i could really relate to what Fran Ellen goes through in school. I, too, was also a big klutz in PE and i was so shy and afraid of bringing attention to myself that i'd hide in the bathroom just like Fran Ellen did. I however think that when those girls bullied her she should have stood up for herself more. I would have, i think. However they did pressure her a lot but i would not have given in like she did. It was cool the way in the end the teacher stands up for her as she notices Fran Ellen is improving a lot. The ending was sort of a cliff hanger, however, but one of my fave things about this book is Louis Glansman's illustrations! I had checked it out at the library and could not get enough of his pen and ink pictures--they are so real!

Content is funny though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"This book is BEYOND funny!!! My dad bought this for my mom in the 80s, and I just found it in my basement and I love Dave Barry, so I was really excited. Typical Dave Barry humor...relatible events with an exaggerated twist that make you literally, laugh, continually, until you are under the kitchen table on your back, sustaining the laughter.This isn't intended to be ACTUAL pregnancy advice, obviously, so I don't know why anybody would take the title, cover, or author and assume this is a serious book.Buy this! Every sentence is pure gold!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Warning - Do not read in last trimester!","review":"This book is very funny, weirdly prophetic and difficult to read if you've got 8lbs of baby pressing down on your bladder!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"This book was absolutely NO help whatsoever!!! Totally ridiculous! It was so out of date that it was pointless. I originally bought it for my husband but after reading through it, threw it away!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Joey Jordison Snare Review","review":"I received this item in 3 day's after purchasing it. The item arrived in perfect condition (no issues with shipping and packaging). The Snare came tuned but,at a low pitch. It only took me a few minutes to tune the drum and get the tone and pitch I wanted. For the money, this is a great sounding snare drum for someone who wants a high crack with tonal sound (fat) and articulate response. Nice Snare Joey!"},{"rating":"1","title":"He's supposed to be better than this","review":"The cover and slipjacket of the book smell of terabyte hard drives and organic cell phones. But that's about it. I didn't buy this book---got it from the library. Feel like I didn't waste money, but I did waste time. There are gems...the section on biotech is really provocative and well-written.But the rest?Filler. The ideas about the importance of networks in the future (whether cell based terrorist groups, or profiteers) are covered in more depth in both sterling's fictional DISTRACTION and Rheingold's SMART MOBS. The critique of education is pedantic, as is the discussion about the future of politics.I get the sense that these pieces were just lying around on the hard drive, and he realized there was a book in there. He was almost right...some tight editing would've been very helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly staid","review":"I like Bruce's work a lot, both his SF and his punditry/journalism on the Viridian list and elsewhere. So I had pretty high hopes for this, but unfortunately came away unsatisfied. Years ago, Bruce said that cyberpunk aimed for \\"crammed prose\\" - a density of ideas, impressions and telling details which his own SF novels provide brilliantly. \\"Tomorrow Now\\" is far from crammed - it's padded. While there are cool, convincing ideas (cloned babies will grow up to be the world's most angry adolescents) on past evidence I'd expect about 10x more of them per page. I haven't read a lot of futurology books, so this may compare more favorably to most of them. But for Sterling fans this is thin stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sterling's Future","review":"I enjoyed Tomorrow Now tremendously; it's not as densely-packed with speculative nuggets as some of the author's work, but his approach here waxes more poetic than techno-polemical, and focuses on the human context of the changes he's projecting, and the attendant dilemnas and decisions we'll need to confront in order to navigate it all. This book is not about \\"nuts-and-bolts\\" futurism, but about the choices and conflicts surrounding social, political and technological change, and I found it extremely grounded and candid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not STERLING, not gold, just boring","review":"I enjoy all of Bruce's fiction. Every book and article has been great. But these article are boring and uninspiring.No-one could ever finish reading this useless stuff in 50 years.It makes you wonder how he can write such good science fiction.Actually, I have found his no-fiction science in various magazines very good but these are not. I ordered this before it was even published , since he has never disappointed me.This is a great disappointment since I expect much more from him."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Good Author Loses His Grip","review":"I have enjoyed Sterling's fiction and probably will continue to do so. Unfortunately, he has skidded off the runway with Tomorrow Now. This is a pile of words with no real ideas, just recycled catch-memes that read like the breathless cyber-cheerleading mindporn of a late-nineties Wired issue.Between the lines of this book is the feeling that Sterling felt compelled to write it; that he needed to publish a volume of punditry in order to continue being invited to Davos, an achievement that he mentions frequently enough to be irritating. An author of his stature and experience shouldn't have to strike a pose, over and over, but that is what this book is really about. If you want to understand the future, go back and read Orwell."},{"rating":"1","title":"No meat and no potatoes..............","review":"I read the book in a little over two hours. In the title, Sterling says he is \\"envisioning the next fifty years.\\" In fact the book is little about the next fifty years as it is Sterling's own thoughts about the past fifty years. In the introduction to the book he presents his \\"seven novel aspects of the twenty-first century.\\" He does this using a character from Shakespeare's 'As You Like It'; Jaques, who is best know for his famous lecture, which begins with: \\"all the world's a stage\\" and ends with \\"Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.\\" It would have been more appropriate if Sterling had used Shakespeare's 'Much Ado About Nothing.' Sterling tells us he is both a Science Fiction writer and a Futurologist. I know a Futurologist when I see one, and Sterling is no Futurologist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good...","review":"Not very good... tries to examine the social and institutional trends, but goes into much self-serving prose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super advice but hard to enact..","review":"This book is very informative but requires real honest effort to be effective. Give it a try. I fully recommend taking the time to read this book slowly and apply it seriously over time and don't quit. Gary Hill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blaspheme","review":"This book is very crafty. He tells you that your to love you enemies, then writes words that Blaspheme God's word, and tries to make people that are right seem wrong. God put 1 Timothy 2:11-15 in the Bible because He's God which makes it true, and him a liar!"},{"rating":"2","title":"God's kind of love","review":"Oh, this little book is terrific! It covers scriptures to meditate on concerning the God kind of love, and how we are to incorporate it into our lives. He goes on to mention the rewards of acting in God's love towards others, examples from the Bible and from his own personal life concerning the love walk, and why love the better way. I love this book for its forwardness,truthfulness, and its simplicity."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Know a Tree by it's Fruit","review":"You Know a Tree by it's Fruit and there is no question in my heart that Rev. Hagin loved the Lord and the Word of God.

The toppers are good quality, though I'm not sure how the straw seals will hold up over time. The toppers are dishwasher-safe, which is nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sacajawea Deserves Better","review":"The mythical status of Sacajawea is seductive indeed, and Diane Glancy attempts to fashion a novel that gives that myth a much needed rest, trying to get into the voice and experience of the \\"real\\" Sacajawea, but as always, language is the heart and soul of any recreation of historical voice, and here is where voice fails Glancy. The writing simply is not good enough. The second person narration makes the character a bit too literary, a bit to fashionable, leaving this reader bored by its simplistic syntax and unimaginative detail. Who knows what Sacajawea thought and dreamed! As Irish poet Eavan Boland suggests, one improvises when faced with this mystery. The improvisaiton here is uninspired. The fragments of journals from the expedition, rather than moving the novel along, impede its flow. This novel is considered experimental, I suppose, but the experiment fails. Why? Because the voice and language fail."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Teachers Heart","review":"The author really portrayed a poverty stricken school, where there are little funds & and little recognition. Tracy Kidder could have picked a top notch prestigous school to continue to pull the wool over americas eyes, but instead he gave us reality, which we needed as a wake up call. I enjoyed the way Chris handled her students. I felt like Chris did an awesome job in the ways she dealt with her students. I feel like every teacher could learn from her examples. She tried so hard to reach all of her students with positive attitudes, and hoped that she did her best in all that she did for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"The School Day to Day","review":"This book focuses on the day to day narrative on the life of a school teacher and her students, while here and there adding some comments about the larger picture of education in the United States. So this larger view comes in and kind of hints at what the author wants to express. All in all, it was a worth read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to Read","review":"I found Among Schoolchildren to be a very helpful and informative book. The way in which Mrs. Zajac handled each situation with a different perspective was inspiring. She truly saw the differences in each child and strived to approach them in that manner. I found the techniques she used to reach each student very interesting. I hope that I can be a teacher that doesn't ignore differences but rewards them in an appropriate way."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Eye Opener","review":"As an education major at Macon State College, I read Among Schoolchildren for an assignment for my education in a diverse society class. This book really opened my eyes to what teaching is like in the \\"real world.\\" Tracy Kidder supplied very detailed information about each student in Mrs. Zajac's class and about Mrs. Zajac herself. I took note of many excellent teaching strategies used by Mrs. Zajac, and I hope to be able to apply them when I myself am teaching. Kidder's awesome description and remarkable ability to recreate various events in the book made me feel as though I were right there in the classroom. At times this was scary, seeing as how the students misbehaved quite often, but at least I now know what to expect from my own students. Hopefully I can become a wonderful teacher as Mrs. Zajac is. If you are at all uncertain about what it is like to be a teacher read Among Schoolchildren! You will never look at teaching the same way again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it 15 times and will 15 more!","review":"This is a wonderful book! Probably one of the best I've ever read. I am becoming a teacher and this book was incredibly helpful. You cannot put it down. Tracy Kidder did a wonderful job writing about Ms. Zajac and her classroom! READ IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Among Schoolchildren review","review":"I had to read this book for my education class, and I did not like the book very much. The book was too easy to read and the teacher Mrs. Zajac is idolized through out the book. When writing about any person, including a teacher, there should be some demonstration of mistakes they made and how they learned from them. This teacher was just to perfect for me to believe. However, I did like some of her teaching styles and found them useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Among Schoolchildren is a terrific book.","review":"I am a college student majoring in education and I read \\"Among Schoolchildren\\" for my class. I really enjoyed this book. It was easy for me to get caught up in the class she was teaching. I wanted to know what was going to happen to Clarence and felt bad when he had to leave the class. I wonder if I would have done the same thing? This book made me realize all of the challenges I will face in teaching and also made me anxious to start teaching."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a wonderful book for educators","review":"This book can be very useful to educators. You can get a real feel of how teaching can be. It is not always easy. You have many conflicts that you may have to face. There may be times were you have to be a parent to your students by always having to discipline them. Teaching is not for everyone you really have to have your whole heart into the job. This book helps give the real picture for teaching."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellant book for anyone but especially for teachers.","review":"An easy book to read. Very interesting and motivating for someone entering the teaching field. The book is not biased. I would recommend the book to anyone. I enjoyed the creativity the teacher used in her teaching style. I think everybody can learn something from this book. It's great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Among School Children Says It Like It Is!","review":"I am using this book with my community college students who plan to be teachers. I have taught in public schools at the elementary, middle, and college level and I wish someone had suggested that I read this book long ago. Tracy Kidder really gets inside Mrs. Zajac's thoughts and feelings about the challenges elementary school teachers face every day in their classrooms. This gives a very realistic view of the profession for people who plan to become teachers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Among School Children: A review","review":"I am a college student and I had to read this book for an education class. Usually I do not enjoy and often I do not finish assigned readings. This book, however, I both enjoyed and finished. The author told the story of a year in the life of a fifth grade teacher. By the end of the book, I felt as if I knew her and many of her students quite well. Tracy Kidder did a great job of condensing a year's worth of school into one book and yet giving a thorough picture of the trials and joys experienced by both teacher and students. I would recommend this book to all those involved in education including parents and also to anyone who loves children and the human spirit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Education Student","review":"I am a college student at Macon State College, and I read this book for my Education 2000 course. Among School Children was a great book that focuses on the life of a fifth grade teacher. I feel that this book would benefit teachers who are teaching early childhood education. This book can also be read by other teachers because of the teaching techniques used by the teacher, Mrs. Zajac. I would recommend this book to anyone who was thinking about majoring in Education because it gives a good insight into the life of one teacher and her classroom."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book should be required reading for Ed majors","review":"Kidder eloquently and precisely addresses the struggles, triumphs, joys, and sorrows of being a teacher in America. I originally read this book 10 years ago, and it still rings true. I have given copies of it to all my teacher friends. This is a fascinating and delightful read. Mr. Kidder is a genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"Among Schoolchildren","review":"I am a college student at Macon State College. I was given an assignment in my education class to read a book. I chose Among Schoolchildren by Tracy Kidder. I enjoyed this book because it gave a great example of what it is like to be a teacher. I believe Tracy Kidder did a good job of showing how Mrs. Zajak got through her problems and how she dealt with parents, misbehaving students and the everyday problems of the classroom. I would recommend this book to anyone who is going to teach or wants to teach in elementary school."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trial of teaching elementry school","review":"I really enjoyed reading \\"Among Schoolchildren\\" it really opened my eyes to the reallity of teaching elementry school. The way Chris, the teacher strived to really teach her students was uplifting. I am now starting to realize how important teacher interaction with students are. Chris thrived on finding every students good points and treated every student with respect. She had high expectations for every student as well as for her self. I was impressed to see how she intergrated strategies she learned into her classroom. I think Chris did a fantastic job considering the obstacles she faced daily. Despite some her students bad behavior she still cared about each childs future."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book for anyone considering teaching as a profession","review":"This book provides an in-depth look at the activities and interactions that take place inside a fifth grade classroom. The book takes you through an entire year of school, in which you have a chance to read about the successes and failures that both the students and the teacher encounter. From students talking out of turn to students hitting and yelling at other students, you will quickly learn just how complex the job of a teacher can be. There are also several good teaching techniques that the fifth grade teacher implements in class that are successful, one such example is role playing during a history lesson. In closing, I would like to say that I feel the book would be of great interest to anyone who is considering or entering into teaching as a profession."},{"rating":"2","title":"NEOCATE","review":"THIS FORMULA REALLY WORKS.

Riedel is one of the tests that is easy for even beginning drinkers to see the difference in. The flavor is *amazingly* different when you compare the exact same wine in a Riedel glass vs normal wine glasses.Even if you buy inexpensive wines, you will get much more enjoyment out of them with this glassware compared to other options. If you are buying mid-range wines, the difference will blow you away. Think of the Riedel glass as allowing you to see what the wine in your bottle *really* was meant to taste like.Champagne and sparkling wine are traditional at special occasions, but they're also being drunk more and more as a 'regular' accompanyment to sushi and before a meal. It's great that people are enjoying this delicious wine any time, and these glasses help bring out the great flavors in sparklers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoy Your Chameleon","review":"Everything you need to know to care for your chameleon, from their nature, to housing, feeding, physiology including their color changes, moulting, training and first aid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love at first sight","review":"I actually picked this book up at a thrift shop a couple of years ago for my younger brother (for 25 cents) and here I am at 20 years old looking for a new copy.

It is a tremendously rich book, and contains a great deal of thought not reproduced elsewhere in his writings. He takes phenomenology in a different direction from that of Husserl, Heidegger and Sartre, though he remains in dialogue with all three throughout. Late 20th century philosophy owes much to Merleau-Ponty, and this is a key work in understanding his thought. In my own opinion, it is one of the great books of philosophy, and the translation by Colin Smith is excellent. I highly recommend it, as you may have guessed."},{"rating":"1","title":"supposedly his opus....","review":"....but his phenomenological concepts are much more alive and readable in his later material--his essays, for instance.

I watched it with no expectations and thats the best way to enjoy a film. I also didnt try to compare this film with any other vampire film.The male lead could have used a little more acting work.

Not only does it have atrocious acting, poor lighting, hammy dialog, badly choreographed lesbian sex, horrendously stereotyped characters, a convoluted and illogical plot and cheap gore effects, it was also rather sick in certain places as well! One scene in particular that I happened to catch shortly before I turned the film off involved the vampire dad literally ripping the unborn fetus out of his daughter-in-law's pregnant stomach!!! Why on earth did he do this?!?! Of course we never find out as is typical with these typse of films. Overall, I wish I could say that \\"Dark Town\\" was one of the few so-called \\"low-budget horror gems\\" floating around out there, sadly though it's anything but!

I oftened rated the performances of both Dustin Hoffman and the then \\"new-comer\\" John Voight as the best acting performances ever to be seen. It came to mind that the \\"theme\\" of the film for the period in which it was produced may have had something to do with why Hoffman never received the Academy Award for his superb acting performance. I recall when I first saw the film that I predicted that he would without a doubt be selected for the award. Needless to say I was disappointed when the award went to John Wayne for his performance in True Grit. Not to take anything away from Wayne, but in my opinion, this was Hoffmans best ever performance. The awarding of the film as the Best Picture easily substantiates my views.

What do you think?Of course Dustin Hoffman is pure gold here, helping me forget his most recent Focker's series. This is a must for DVD collectors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart-wrenching","review":"For years this was my favorite film of all time, and it may still be. Voight and Hoffman give the best performances of their careers, IMHO. This is the most savage yet poetic portrayal of post-50's Americana I've ever seen, and for me it is timeless. Every scene is masterfully played, shot, and edited; many are etched into my memory forever. The last scene is almost too powerful, and I'm destined to always watch it bleary-eyed, heartbroken, and profoundly moved. John Barry provided a wonderful score."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it","review":"I don't get it. Are they trying to imply that Joe Buck was sexually abused as a child and that the experience forced him into a life of prostitution?

Only the music and acting performances make it bearable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed after I finally saw it - Midnight Cowboy","review":"What a let-down. I had never seen the orginal movie in 1969 - finally bought it and was really disappointed in the overall movie. I really didn't see what the fuss was all about.

Some of the hot shards even melted my vinyl floor which clued me in that the other side was hot. Why dont they design one that will turn a shade of color when heated?

You can only import data files for your bank account if they're the newest type - the QIF format (named FOR QUICKEN) isn't allowed anymore except with a complicated workaround. My credit card can do \\"instant updates\\" - only the updates don't add any of the new transactions! And because I'm set up for instant updates, I can't download the transactions from my credit card account and then import them into Quicken. I have looked for three weeks just to turn the horrible sound effects off and STILL can't find the button. And the only thing that happens when I click \\"help\\" is my screen fills up with a dozen script errors. I had no idea a program could be this bad. AVOID QUICKEN 2007 - pen and paper is about a thousand times faster, easier and more accurate than this horrible program."},{"rating":"1","title":"Choose between bank or Quicken or hand input everything....","review":"Quicken requires use of OFX technology to input bank data. My bank does not use this technology. So, Quicken wants me to either force my bank to add this technology or switch banks.

I plan to return this product and buy Microsoft Money, which will at least talk to my bank!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Quicken - You will rue the day you bought it !","review":"Intuit has known for several years that their Quicken products are flawed. The screen flickers repeatedly during use, as it refreshes. This happens with all video cards in XP and is not computer specific. No one has identified a \\"fix\\" for the problem. You should Google \\"quicken screen flicker\\" to hear the complaints of many people. Quicken has not responded to this problem. Instead, it keeps putting out the flawed product for people to buy. The flicker is very irritating because the display shakes dramatically (I do not exaggerate) and because it happens every time you save a transaction and also whenever the screen is normally scheduled to refresh. The refresh speed on the memorized transactions page is very slow, and the screen refreshes slowly two times for every page down. If you buy this product, you will be very disappointed. Buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intuit finally drove me to Microsoft","review":"I've used Quicken since it first came out in a DOS version in the 1980s. For a while it just kept getting better and for years I referred my professional associates to it as an example of a great UI.Not any more. Since 2000 Quicken has been suffering feature bloat. So much functionality has been added that many times the basic features don't work. Quicken hasn't correctly downloaded and posted data from my Fidelity accounts in 2 years.I bought Microsoft Money 2007 Premium about 6 weeks ago and am very happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother to Upgrade","review":"I have been using Quicken Basic 2000 for many years and thought it was about time to upgrade so I purchased Quicken Basic 2007. I am seriously thinking about removing this software and going back to Quicken 2000. I only use Quicken for basic functions such as tracking each of our accounts, we don't write checks through quicken. Quicken 2007 doesn't provide any improvements to these basic functions and in some cases makes it harder to perform these basic functions. The Quicken homepage is entirely worthless to me, cannot be edited, deleted or hidden so it is just in the way.I thought there would be some improvement in the reports and more flexibility in formats and options, but so far it appears the reports and formats are essential the same as Quicken 2000. Unless I have missed something this upgrade was pretty much worthless and actually went backwards in ease of use. I would NOT recommend this upgrade if you are looking for an improvement in Quicken Basic"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quicken Upgrade","review":"I upgraded from Quicken 2002 to 2007 Basic.

This is Aug. 07 and Vista wasn't even listed as one of the possible operating systems.The written materials included with the disk were not very helpful. Overall, the package of materials seemed to be designed for someone who is updating from an older version to the 2007 version. I am neophyte to Quicken and found little to help me understand what the basics of this program are and how one goes about importing the data required from my bank accounts. The choices for this sort of software are few. Microsoft Money is the other big title. Now I wish I had started with it. Perhaps it isn't any easier, but at least it probably would have installed easily with Vista. There may even be free open software that would be better than what I got."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why are all the 2007 versions so bad?","review":"I've been using Quicken 6 since it came out and finally had to move up to an XP machine. The old V6 was easy to use, intuitive features, uncluttered and uncomplicated. 2007 is buried in extra features (which you don't seem to be able to turn off)a display that seems squeezed even in a 17\\" monitor and the feeling that it's going to switch off to investment or retirement or whatever without warning.

When I contacted Quicken about the problem, they gave me a fix that was too difficult for me to attempt without my running the risk of fouling up my printer settings for everything else I do.

Very simple problem, 2007 does not recognize the old account currencies and migrates all accounts ot US dollars atthe first installation. I called customer service and was on the phone for over an hour and they tried so many different attamepts and it did not work. I was left with next steps to do myself by re-installing the older version again and then do it in 2 steps using QW 2002 then 2007.

You are drawn in from the beginning and can sense that she is waiting for something special. I love how Madleine interacts with all those around her and how her relationship starts out with her husband. It is a true love story in marriage, even to the end. I was gratedul to read about the courage they both had to make it through all their trials and the love they had for one another through it all. It really helps you to reflect on your own marriage and how you can remain totally in love even after 50+ years of marriage. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A heart-breaking, triumphant story of courtship & marriage","review":"This book has become one of the ones that I re-read regularly. (I also lend it out regularly, which has become something of a problem--it never comes back to me!) Madeleine L'Engle's story of her courtship and marriage to Hugh Grant is one that everyone contemplating marriage--or divorce--should read slowly and carefully. Nothing is absent from this chronicle: not love, nor pain, nor laughter, nor sorrow, nor failure, nor triumph, nor doubt, nor faith,.

I believe those seeking guidance and strength for their own marriages would be better served. There is, in so much of what is written about marriage today, an abundance of techniques, tips and tricks to smooth the struggle, if not attempt to eliminate it altogether. L'Engle honors the struggle in this book. Her writing sings when she describes the most difficult times in her relationship.Life and relationship in marriage is about the details. L'Engle's descriptions of countless meals, sitting on her four-poster bed talking into the night with close ones, and of conversations held with intimate friends and family, are jewel-like stones laid on a fascinating and well-told tale of one path of marriage."},{"rating":"2","title":"this was a great book.","review":"cladia in a situation .she had to choise from staying or leaving the baby sitters club because she thouht she might hurt herself again but worse"},{"rating":"2","title":"Go Denver Broncos","review":"This is an excellent gift for someone who is expecting & a Denver Broncos fan!

I even bought a hardcover copy because my paperback version is dog-eared and bent in several places because of how many times I have read it. The heroine in this book is especially likeable as is the hero. Even the villian is somewhat likeable because of the talent of the author.

I'm sorry, but Midnight was probably the WORST book I have read. I'm still reading this series (Don't read this part, people who have not read Dawn yet) to see if Graystripe will come back (Okay, you can read this now) and if Firestar will become the main character and the heroe again (And I WON'T mind one bit if you kill off that idiot, Brambleclaw).

Not certain I will read this series with my grand kids.We are currently on book #3 (Forest of Secrets) of the first series (which I read all 6 books first before reading it with the grand kids)...While I prefer the one view point of the first series, there is no denying Erin Hunter is a Story Teller FOR ALL AGES."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Good Book","review":"This is a Really good book.

All Bramblepaw is is a even better Firestar without all his errors... He is just a goody goody freak. Why change viewpoints when you have already made your audience love the character you gave them in the first book. In this book Firestar is a dumb, old cat who is just mean.

The cats are not catlike - for example - they sleep at night and get going at daybreak. If you view them as people in fur coats with human emotions - jealousy, love, hate, ambition - it helps a lot.I found the first five books very depressing - just a series of unfortunate events without the humor - but book 6 is worth reading - a mix of courage and friendship, love and joy, as well as the terrible things that happen in life.

Yeah, that's not a message I need to reinforce with my kids anymore than they're already getting in the media.Whatever happened to books with actual ethics and true honor, instead of this pseudo-ethics \\"ends justify the means\\" stuff?

The original series was great, the characters were well drawn out and it made you want to read on. But this series takes a death spiral as copy cat (no pun intended) characters are quickly etched out of the original. Brambleclaw is basically a more perfect Firestar while squirrel paw is possibly the first ever bimbo like character that has been transformed into a cat. Not only is plot flat, the villians are as thin as card board. Firestar and the original characters turn into robotic kitties while his dim witted daughter and dead beat bramble claw destroy the forest. If you love warriors, don\`t read this. But if you must save your money and go to a library. Trust me, by the time your done you\`ll wish this white washed phrophecy gets ran over by a car."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was great!","review":"I got the book a day before I thought I would, and I read it in 24 hours, which is pretty good for a college student. I loved the book, I can't wait to see what happens with Brambleclaw and Squirrelpaw. I was a little bummed to read it so fast, as the next book doesn't come out till August. Great series all together, I recommend it to any cat lover out there. I liked it so much, I got my 8 year old sister hooked. She has read book 1, \\"Into the Wild\\", 6 times and she is working on this book now. she has read 18 chapters in just 12 hours.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Minight(HAS SPOILERS SO YEAH!)","review":"This book is ausome, but the first series was better sofar!SPOILERS:Midnight, yeah guess what, Midnight is a Badger and Firestar's two kits are Leafpaw and Squirrelpaw.

My views of The New Penguin History of the World are:(+)Covering all the major events and civilizations with the breadth that their significance deserves. Note that it is all done at an introductory level for obvious space limitations.(+)Very thorough and comprehensive(-)Mainly focuses on western history with less attention to the rest of the world so the title may be slightly deceiving.(-)A more minor issue but still of detrimental value: the publisher must have wanted to maintain this work as a single tome so cramming 1264 pages necessitated the use of a small font. The small font is less comfortable to read but as mentioned above this is a minor issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, If You Like Very Small Print!","review":"Beware! This paperback is 1200+ pages long and the font (#9) is very small. Even though I an old duffer, I just passed my commercial pilot's eye exam. After three of the Penguin's pages, I had a huge headache. Just to prove myself wrong, I handed the book to my Daughter and asked her to read a page or two. She said she neededa ruler to keep her place on the page. I returned the book the next day and ordered the H. G. Wells version of history for my kindle. it's like having a \\"heads-up\\" display for your car. Jim in Virginia Beach, P.S. You'll need a magnifing glass for the maps!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Eccentric South","review":"I guess I was assuming a novel about the gracious South; but no, its about the totally eccentric and whacky South and I enjoyed every minute of it. This book of quick and touching anecdotes is not your typical novel but a nice refreshing read between heavier material. I will be looking forward to experiencing more of Ms White's work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quirky and funny","review":"This is an amusing collection of short stories concerning a family in the deep South.The Mama of the family is an out and out eccentric but totally charming with it.Her house is a repository for generations of junk (and none too clean),but life with her is never dull.I found this to be a very likeable \\"little\\" read when you don't feel like delving into anything too heavy or involved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific stories about people you feel like you know!","review":"This book is one of those you just laugh with and feel a kinship to the characters immediately...especially if you are from the South! You either know someone just like the characters or someone that has many of the personality traits of these people in your own life. The author is so skilled at drawing word pictures your imagination jumps at the chance to complete them and you can just see the people and places she describes. This is a great book to touch at the core of the everyday lives of most people as the author deals with all types of home situations."},{"rating":"2","title":"funny, engaging characters","review":"I'm glad I discovered Bailey White; now I never have troublefiguring out what to get my mom for Christmas or birthdays.She's (Bailey White, not my mom) is wonderful at creatingportrayals of idiosyncratic off-kilter personalities thatremind you of someone you know.

Mrs. White is a great teacher and a great author."},{"rating":"2","title":"First-rate writing","review":"What a little gem this book is.The brevity of the essays belies the craft behind each one. Devoid of precious moments and smarminess, the book nonetheless paints a warm portrait of the author's world in miniature.I read a lot. This book is one of the best I've come across in ages. Bravo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful book of offbeat essays","review":"It's been a long time since I've read anything that made me chuckle, let alone laugh out loud - but Bailey White's \\"Mama Makes Up Her Mind\\" had me doing just that for several stories in this collection, particularly the ones in the first section, the one that deals with her and her life with her mother. There's a story in that section called \\"Instant Care\\" that had me rolling on the floor. I can readily identify with Ms. White's mother - she's a real character! There are other stories that are not as funny - but then, they're not meant to be - and they're just as good. I wholeheartedly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stories for days you need a good laugh","review":"The author and her wacky Mama live in the Southern home that has been in Mama's family for generations; where even the clutter is eccentric and many more wacky relatives live nearby. Most of these hilarious true stories involve one of Mama's escapades, and you'll laugh out loud at every one. At the same time, there's a heart-warming sweetness to the stories, and you may long to be part of Mama's eccentric, but loving, family.Once Mama makes up her mind to do something, there's no changing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full of wonderful laughs","review":"I was suspicious of the book, but as soon as I began reading I could not stop.

Johnny's best friends include Wobbler (a computer hacker), Yo-less (named because he never says Yo), and Bigmac (who lives in the rough part of town).Johnny Maxwell, while his parents are going through \\"trying times\\" and the Gulf War is getting going on the tele, was playing a shoot-em-up computer game when he found that the Mighty ScreeWee(tm) Empire had no interest in fighting back, and wanted to surrender. This becomes quite complicated.There are deeper meanings, etc, but don't let them frighten you off a book that is also very entertaining for adult Pratchett fans. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"What if the video game characters were real and need help?","review":"This is the first of Pratchett's two books about Johnny. The second is Johnny and the Dead. Johnny hides in his room playing his favorite video game, a game at which he has become an expert. When he receives a call for help...from the video aliens he has been blasting. Johnny ends up entering the game itself to become their defender, but how will he convince the other champion player to let them live?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Discworld, but an excellent Pratchett story","review":"The Johnny Maxwell trilogy is a great deal of fun. Pratchett's different perspective of the way the world works is thoroughly entertaining. It's not part of the Discworld series, but the same sense of humor pervades it. If you like Pratchett's other works, give it a read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great intro to sci-fi","review":"I read Only You Can Save Mankind with my 9 year-old daughter. We both loved it. Being a huge Diskworld fan, I was thrilled to find another line of books by Pratchett that were geared towards younger readers. This book is the first of a trilogy. The first thing my daughter did after reading it was check out the other 2 books from her school library!This book was a great introduction to science fiction for my daughter. The story is about the boy more than it is about the fantasy environment he is in. She was able to relate to him and be amused by the classic Pratchett descriptions of the video game alien world.Those who are already very familiar with historical sci-fi and video game culture will find the constant references entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The moral didacticism was tedious; the predictable PC plot twists made me wince. What is it about English wits that makes them think they can get away moralizing without a license? If you want an older and wiser Pratchett, read the Tiffany Aching books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Readable","review":"I'm a read-aloud Mom with a family of boys. We enjoyed this book: it was fun to read, the secondary characters were a joy, and it was fast.I get tired of main characters suffering through the divorce of their parents in children's books. I understand why authors put their Important!Thoughts!About!Divorce! into books, but it was so meaningless to the story.What we really liked were some of the puns and wordplay between the characters, and the insights into warfare and human nature. Why does war have rules? This is a uniquely human philosophy.I'm glad we read it, and I would recommend it for other families."},{"rating":"1","title":"EEAARRLY Pratchett","review":"Not Terry Pratchett's finest work. OK quick read, but far from the rich multi-level depth of The Wee Free Men and all the books relating to Tiffany Aching. Go there."},{"rating":"2","title":"a pleasant surprise","review":"As always, Terry Pratchett's work is charming yet profound and can be read on several levels. I had never read one of his \\"tweenie\\" books before (had never heard the word; someone had to define it for me). Since his Alzeheimer's was diagnosed and announced, I try to read everything that he has it print.His characters are real and fully developed, the entire video game mind-set is perfectly represented here. I was enchanted by this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Incomplete recording","review":"The worst thing about this recording is that Book VIII is missing the first 22 paragraphs(!), quite a chunk of text. Secondly, the translation replaces the names of the Greek gods with the Roman names, which is odd.This is a flawed recording, don't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Mystery of Creation","review":"For the intelligent person who has difficulty reconciling the findings of science with the traditional Christian teaching of creation, this book is for you. Well written by a true genius that brings to light the true Biblical account of creation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mystery of Creation","review":"I have read 10 or so of Watchman Nee's books, and this is one of my very favorites. I wish I had read it first. I found his analysis absolutely awesome, as usual. I never thought that I would care to know what happened on which day of the six days of creation until I read this book. Now, not only is it easy to remember, but it is absolutely essential for a believer to, for example, connect the separation of the firmament on day 2 with the work of the cross. This is a MUST read book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding and Timeless","review":"I am late to the party but this is a really great CD. Not one song makes you want to skip past it. I first heard Minstrel Boy Howling At The Moon on an Austin radio station so I bought this CD. That song is probably my favorite but they all sound great to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting take on happenings in the Wild West","review":"Okay this is a stray from my normal reading of chic lit. I have had this book for awhile, and I decided to pull it out because I wanted to read something different.I had actually never read Little Big Man or saw the movie with Dustin Hoffman, so this was my first experience reading about old Jack Crabbe.I have to say I was taken with his portrayal of history. Quite a nice entertaining story he weaves especially of his meeting different famous people such as Bat Masterson, Doc Holliday, Libby Custer, and of all people the Prince of Wales.I found myself laughing throughout the book, and I cannot recommend it enough for the comical element. I would say that anyone interested in history especially of the American West with a touch of comedy thrown in would really have great time with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's not as good as the first book...","review":"But it's still worth a look. The history is interesting; but, Jack Crabb's speech patterns get a little tedious. The sequel just doesn't hang together as well as the first one. That said, if you liked Little Big Man, you'll probably enjoy this one, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Time","review":"I got this book after reading the original \\"Little Big Man\\" which was nearly impossible to put down. OK, I'll put it in the words of Jack Crabb:I don't see why my author seen fit t' dig me up outta my grave when there weren't nothin' more t' tell. Yeah, I was 'sposed t' have died at the end of LBM, but they done dug up some crazy, convoluted way that I faked my death and done come back t' life so's I could go on and on and ON about pretty much nothin'. Even too much fer me t' swaller!I don't do nothin' in this new story but hobnob with historical figgers and we don't do nothin', jist talk and talk and talk. Seems like my author coulda figgered out SOMETHIN' fer me t' do!!Thanks Jack, back to the reviewer: I've been stuck on page 287 forseveral days. I start falling asleep after just a few sentences. There's no excuse for this book to be so boring. Little Big Man was a bonified gem!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A delightful romp through the late 19th Century!","review":"Berger has made us wait 35 years for more of Jack Crabb's story. It's tone is less active, more somber and slightly less fun than \\"Little Big Man\\" but the revisionist look at the events depicted in the novel are worth the time spent in reading. I suspect that Mr Berger will give us another volume, but hope he will put more of the original spark in the tome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't live up to the original","review":"I LOVED the original Little Big Man. The Return, not so much. Jack Crabb is still doing what he does, insinuating himself into the lives of famous people of the period and having wild, unbelievable adventures in the Old West.Unfortunately, in this case the adventures aren't all THAT wild or adventurous and there doesn't seem to be any real cohesive plot. It does a good job of giving a glimpse into various aspects of life in the late 19th century and that's about it.I wouldn't recommend this to anyone but hardcore fans of western novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome back, Jack Crabb!","review":"I remember quite fondly the movie \\"Little Big Man\\" with Dustin Hoffman, so when I discovered that there were further adventures of Jack Crabb I purchased this sequel. It reveals more tales of Jack's adventures with some of the Old West's most colorful characters such as Wild Bill Hickock, Buffalo Bill Cody, Chief Sitting Bull, Annie Oakley, etc.. It's a book that is never dull, and the characters, both real and invented, mesh seamlessly in the narrative. It's not the West that you might remember from the old cowboy shows on television, but it's certainly a more vibrant place, and definitely more true to life. The book only takes us up to about 1893, so I sincerely hope that ol' Jack has more tales to tell, and that we'll see them in book form shortly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Lovely","review":"Honestly, just because a singer is earnest and from Britain, it does not necessarily mean he is \\"the new Coldplay/Keane/Travis.\\" Let's drop that bone! Tom Baxter sounds thoroughly lovely and upbeat on this CD. His voice has a wonderful reedy timbre and resonance that reminded me more of Peter Gabriel, if we have to do the ceaseless comparisons, than anyone else. Mostly, tho, he has his own sound. The songs are joyful, romantic and honest. \\"My Declaration\\" is an affirmative documentation of a new beginning that rings so true it manages to avoid sounding soppy. \\"This Boy\\" is about the universality of failure and the ability we all have to overcome it. This is a consistent debut with nice accompanying piano, in particular. He is a rising star--definitely someone to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing like Coldplay, etc..","review":"I pisses me off that people are comparing Tom with Coldplay and British rock/pop bands. Go learn about music people!Tom is more in the acoustic singer/songwriter category. And I must say, although some of the songs are dull, a few of them gave me goosebumps and this is exceedinly rare! I buy 50 plus albums a year, and this one is definately in my top 10. This guy is a genius. Sounds a bit like Jeff Buckley, and that ain't no easy thing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"white feathers","review":"This album seems to be an exercise in trying to annoy people who like Jeff Buckley and Nick Drake. Or perhaps, a nudging, industry cash-in on people who like Jeff Buckley and Nick Drake. Meandering acoustic folky twiddles like 'The Moon And Me' bump Grace-lessly into sub-Lloyd-Webber showtunes, with surface-skimming lyrical self-analyses like \\"my smile won't smile and my laugh won't laugh\\"... You what? Perhaps the album should be called 'God! I am SO sensitive!'On 'Almost There' Baxter does his best 'Stars In Their Eyes' Buckley impression, imitating tone, vocal cadences, even the chord changes are grabbed from 'Lover, You Should've Come Over'... At this point, it seems kindest to advise Mr. Baxter to put on a white V. neck T.shirt, grow his hair long and start a covers act.There is no point in this album whatsoever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Family Movie","review":"Really enjoyed it full of fun and adventure a real good clean family movie.I love watching it over and over again.I have always liked Dirk Benedict great actor.Need to make more clean family movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great family adventure movie","review":"We have watched this movie probably 10 times over several years.

Both capture the breathtaking wonder of the north country.The bear is definitely the star of the movie. It's a good, family-oriented film, which sends the message of love's endurance and courage: and also that people don't always mean the things they say, at heart. A father's son tells him to his face that he wishes he had died instead of his Mom: then, when Dad's plane crashes in the wilderness, faces incredible odds trying, with his sister, to search and rescue him... all with the help of that polar bear cub.Nice picture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful Family Film","review":"In an awesome Alaska setting, two children, one pre-teen, one teen, take off on an adventure-packed trek to rescue their father, a downed pilot. On the way they encounter poachers, setting free a polar bear cub who becomes their beacon. Improbable? Undoubtedly. One might even say impossible.

Adding to that were the bank bailouts, which makes in harder to get credit.This book offers practical steps on first how to assess your credit problems, then how to fix them, including paying off debt and avoiding foreclosure. After that, a large section of the book is dedicated to things one can do to rebuild their credit. There is also a computer disc included to keep all this infomation.One thing I really liked about this book was it was written in a helpful, not judgmental fashion. many people today are facing these problems who never thought they would be and may find it embarrassing. Unlike some authors or TV commentators who think tough love is the way to approach this issue, this book is straight-forward, easy to read and strictly informative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great NOLO publication","review":"As someone who worked in the finance arena for years, including direct work for one of the major credit agencies, I was a little skeptical about getting this book. Things change so fast from one year to another and I figured that I'm not at the stage in life to make drastic changes on my spending. Plus I was happy with my budgeting. Was I in for a surprise! The book is indeed very up to date for this year, but what stood out for me are the ideas on how to handle budgets and existing debts - with specific options listed. The book has an array of forms you may need to repair your credit, and you can get free updates to keep up with current trends in the field. And in addition to that, you may find simple ways to improve your credit rating for the next time you need to make a major purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stop Hiding - Start Living!","review":"There is no quick fix when it comes to credit repair. It can take months and even years before you see results.

Life happens! This book is a wealth of information that will help guide you and assist you with the appropriate available forms on the enclosed CD.What ever your circumstances may be, here is your starting point.

The author's primary focus is on people who have bad credit are still carrying consumer debt. Fair enough. But the solutions offered could be found on any website. There's no in depth information on how credit reporting agencies work and the general advice is along the lines of \\"pay your bills on time\\". Hardly a revelation.I would have like to see a good deal more information on post-bankrputcy credit repair strategy. This is an area that the author largely ignores.Mostly, I just would have liked to get a more detailed look at the various factors affecting ones FICO score and how to better manipulate them.The included forms are perhaps the most useful part of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Letters were bad","review":"I felt like the dispute letters were plain and pathetically written.

Once on the road however the reception was poor. While riding along the Parkway, any trees would block the signal giving a patchy reception that was so aggravating I turned off the unit. This continued all the way from my home in Georgia, along the Parkway and Skyline Drive into Washington DC. I really can't recommend this unit due to it's poor signal. I tried contacting XM...

Shop around for the best price, that's all I can advise. FOLLOW-UP: Jan 2009 I later learned that this is in fact THE xm radio...not simply an XM antenna for the Garmin Zumo 550. Knowing that made more sense as to why it has an expensive price tag. I use it all the time in the car and on my motorcycle and I LOVE XM radio and the traffic alert and weather alert capabilities. Only thing missing is video!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to install and performs well.","review":"I bought this item after reading mixed reviews, because I wanted to get weather data via my Garmin 478 portable GPS.

And it is. But it was worth it because it's much better than changing stations every 10 seconds. And it tells my GPS route me around traffic and accidents.. which is amazing.I use the XM Radio, Traffic, and Weather services - they all work great except the XM signal goes whenever I'm heading North-West.

Having weather is great, however, this antenna has let me down 50% of the time. The USB cord is designed to fail. It's so fragile that under normal use you can only hope to see it last for a year or two. The cost to replace the entire antenna is $500. Garmin wants $110 to repair the cord. Just build a durable product in the first place and charge me once for it.

Although all four of the characters had a more or less equal role, it was Lloyd Haynes and Denise Nicholas who had the first two opening credits. It was also one of the first, if not THE first, show to address complex social issues. It was really one of a kind and gives a snapshot of what school life was like in the late 60s and early 70s. It's also great to see Karen Valentine (it was before my time, but she must have been the object of many guy's desire, especially those who like the girl-next-door type). And of course Michael Constantine is fantastic as Principal Kauffman. For anyone who loved him in My Big Fat Greek Wedding, here's a chance to see him in the role he was famous for before that. And it's great to watch the students to see actors who went on to become bigger stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Room 222","review":"After reading some of the recent reviews regarding the picture quality, I was getting worried.

The second dvd in the set had great picture quality. The color was vibrant and 100% better than the first dvd. I would bet that the third and fourth are equally impressive.Please don't be put off by comments from people who only saw the first few episodes and made up their minds. Give this DVD set a chance and you will be glad you did. Boy I sure love that theme song! The picture is just like I saw it when I watched it on tv 39 years ago, this doesn't bother me at all. Shout Factory did the best they could with what they had to work with. I rather have this show on dvd like this than not have it at all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good to See Again","review":"I used to watch this show in the very early 70s; liked it then and, I think, perhaps more now after viewing this box set.It's situations, such as long hair, parent-teacher conflict, adolescent angst,racial stereotyping,drugs, dating, nude musicals, were very much of the latter 60s, yet enjoyable as such. The characters are likeable, sincere, and very human: even the very even-tempered Pete Dixon occasionally get annoyed. This series was relevant to the racial integration that began in the 1960s-a phenomenen that has yet to be fully realized. But the ideals and ideas presented and even promoted in this show--tolerance, dialogue, mutual respect, and the value of education--are always relevant, and are nice to return to through watching \\"Room 222\\" again after all these years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lessons Learned","review":"I waited a long time for this one to make it to DVD!!! Yes the picture quality is a little scratchy, but the stories are of picture perfect quality.

Have only seen the first disk, but I am already looking forward to the rest of the seasons to appear on DVD.

It's even better than I expected. I cant wait for season two! I love the characters, and the story lines were ahead of the times.

In fact, I thought someone had replaced it with a bootleg copy. It doesn't look like any money was spent cleaning up the video or audio. Compare the video quality to other series that have been released that came out around the same time-Bewitched, Hawaii 5-O, Odd Couple, Patridge Family, and That Girl that have been released on DVD. Room 222 is not even a competitor. One episode on disc 2-Alice In Bluderland was so bad with an annoying high pitched buzz that I had to turn it off.

I can't believe that SHOUT Factory didn't take the time to clean up the source tapes more before releasing this set. While I am glad to have the Room 222 series being released on DVD, I hope they will give us better quality prints on future season releases. Comparitively, Shout Factory's That Girl is spectacular and that show was shot on film as well as Room 222. I hope that if SHOUT Factory remasters this first season they will offer a swap out to those of us who already purchased the poor quality copies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, my 15 minutes of fame!!!","review":"I worked as an extra in Episode 2 of this disc and never got to see if I made the final cut because our TV was on the blink! I recently purchased the DVD from Amazon.com and, as it turns out, I did make it in several scenes. This show was a joy to work on, primarily because of two wonderful and unique actors, Lloyd Haynes and Michael Constantine. I greatly admired both of them because they didn't consider themselves above talking to the extras, which is pretty rare. Both were excellent actors and, more importantly, human beings. The scripts dealt with some serious as well as fun issues and, although the quality of the film is pretty bad, it's fun to revisit those days. I was so pleased that Amazon.com carried this DVD.

Event hanldling was pretty much replaced in Java 1.1, yet this book refers to Java 1.0 even though this book is supposed to be about Java 2 !! It caused me a great deal of trouble, since I started writing programs using obsolete methods. Don't waste your money on this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reasonably Thorough for the beginner","review":"The material in this book is reasonably good. All the source is set out, (which is a big plus since other \\"teaching\\" books don't) Lemay and Cadenhead describe go through the structure of the java langauge so you get a feel of how things go together in a java application. The complexity is low but there is a lot of stuff (876 pages, that's alot of dead trees!!) The SDK (1.2( is upto date. Other current books with SDKs usually go for 1.1.5 or something earlier. These guys have really made an effort to show you stuff. But again like any educational books out there on the market there are no exercises with solutions to help you take java out for a drive by yourself.... But they give you an extra 7 chapters (the authors call it a bonus week) most of which is a bit more advnced. Overall it is worth the buy if your serious about learning Java...."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Comprehensive Amateurs Book","review":"This book gives a board, complete overview of the java language. From no knowledge of JAVA, really in 21 days you will be an adequate java programmer having at least an idea of all the capabilities of this language.

All in all, I enjoyed the book it is my first step in the long path of Java."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who is this book for?","review":"If you are a beginner this book is not complete and sometimes is very confusing. A lot of very important language basics just briefly mentioned. You will not learn java using this book. If you already familiar with java this book will not give you any valuable knowledge. I would recomend \\"java in a nutshell\\". For beginners \\"how to program in java\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice","review":"I just wanted to increase the rating of the book from the 3.5 stars it has. I disagree with the majority of complaints people had earlier on. This book is very good, and very friendly. It is broken into days, and each new day is a new section which builds upon previous days while improving upon the information you need to know. It repeats some information as you progress thru the 21 sections, but in a clever way. It may be a bit hard for a novice programmer, but programming is not an easy task to begin with. For someone coming from a background in C/C++ or .NET, you can probably get thru half of the book in a week. Overall, this book is very well designed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid book for new programmers or experienced in other languages","review":"This is an excellent book for anyone who is looking to get into programming for the first time or for programmers experienced in other languages looking to move to Java.

First, it does not give you any practice excercises that you can do on your own. Second, it does a poor job of explaining the lines of code. If I had not highlighted the first few pages of the book, I would definately have taken it back to the store. If I rated this book \\"one star\\" I'd feel ashamed for wasting $30.

However, it is clearly a barely updated version of the TY Java 1.0x book! They simply threw in some Caution! notes and changed a sentence here and there. Obviously, they were not diligent enough, because MANY of the examples contain deprecated code, rendering them useless. Chapters 12-14 are read-only unless you search for the appropriate JDK1.2 syntax elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably a good book for OOP literates","review":"I would not recommend this book at all for developers not exposed to Object Oriented Programming. It gives the feeling of suddenly being made to stand in the middle of an Interstate Highway. The concept of OOP has been very poorly dealt with. Before one realisizes, the terms like Classes, libraries, packages, instances are thrown at the reader. For beginners, there is a good book by \\"QUE\\" called \\"Using Java 2\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"too fast for the beginer","review":"I bought this book to learn Java, as a complete beginer to object oriented programming and a novice to programming.I bought it having used a sister publication - Teach youself Perl in 21 days.

I grew up with them, had them in my kitchen, and now I've bought a set for my son who's off at college. The 3 sizes offer all the versatility you need, from mixing the ingredients for brownies to making tuna salad. They also work as serving bowls, for everything from salad to fruit to tacos. They're heavy duty, sturdy, reliable and dishwasher safe. Really, a kitchen essential!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Second purchase","review":"We love these Pyrex bowls and when one broke we had to go online and buy another set. We use them all the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, cheap, and shallow","review":"If you need some wide, shallow mixing bowls, these are a nice choice. Their design is attractive and basic, and you know the benefits of Pyrex. Before buying, you should consider stainless steel instead, as it is lighter (these are a bit heavy) and won't explode into sharp bits if you drop it on your tile floor. Also, bear in mind that these bowls are shallow, so if you are a messy mixer (or use an electric mixer or a fast whisk), you may end up slopping ingredients out over the side.Their wide shape and clear material lets them do double duty as informal serving bowls, which a true (high sided) mixing bowl doesn't do very well.In short, these are nice to have around for certain uses, but choose high-sided stainless steel bowls as your main set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good no-nonsense set","review":"I spend a lot of time in the kitchen, so having this set of handy and versatile bowls is essential. I got them a couple of months ago and use at least one of them every day. I agree that a high-sided mixing bowl would be better suited for an electric hand mixer, but since I don't have one of those these shallow bowls are fine. They're great for mixing by hand, serving, storing, clean easily, and fit nicely in the dishwasher."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Product","review":"I wouldn't think of mixing and storing food in any material other than glass. I have these bowls and they are wonderful. I use them every single day, from everything to making biscuits and pie dough to mixing a quick salad. They clean up so nicely--never stain or hold odors from other foods. I feel that since plastic and other synthetic materials are made from petroleum, they can't be safe. Another safety factor is that plastic/synthetic bowls scratch and therefore bacteria and such can penetrate them. You won't go wrong with these bowls and they are an excellent value to boot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pyrex - Built to Last and Perform Well !","review":"Bought these for myself ~ couldn't pass up free shipping and sale price.

They are a bit shallow to use a mixer in, that's the reason for the 4 not 5 stars, but I've found they work carefully with a whisk. This will be our second set. I use the largest and smallest ones for prepping. The middle one (1 1/5 qt.) I use for our dog's doggie diner. Plastic's definitely out, and we've had problems with the stainless bowls. The lip on these bowls fit PERFECTLY in her diner - obviously the size of the bowl depends upon the size/type of the diner. She's even knocked the diner over onto our vinyl floor (she did the same with the stainless) to get underneath the diner looking for more food. They hit the wall and then the floor. They didn't break, chip, or crack. I know Pyrex has changed owners, so I was a little skeptical at first, but they've held up fine. As far as a dog bowl, I'd give it 5 stars. I'd rate them 4.5, but there's no half-star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbeatable value and quality!","review":"Although a little high priced, this has got to be the best value for this type of mixing bowl on the market.

Basically he has said in the past that God is the one that needs us and we are like mini Gods ourselves. Now I do not agree with that, I think its pretty blasphemous and when I heard/read that I decided I didn't want to read anything that might influence me in the wrong way. I will probably read this all the way through eventually, but at the moment it will stay on my shelf. I would suggest researching what Dr. Kent Hovind had to say about Kenneth Kopeland.

I'm so sick of them trying to milk people for every penny. God forbid, Zappa's discography is so huge anyway that you have to take out a loan to get them all or spend years collecting. These songs are all previously released material, and have been since the day they came out. The only purpose of this album is a sampler for people curious about Zappa, and also idolize Phish. Otherwise, who cares what Zappa tunes Jon Fishman(or Larry LaLonde)likes?

This is nothing like \\"Magical Girl Sasami\\" or \\"Sailor Moon\\", with their twee, happy-go-lucky stories and lovably quirky characters.

It's really unfortunate that the dub job is so terrible. The English-language acting makes even the more profound moments of the series melodramatic and trite, and lines of dialogue have been changed from the actual translation (which can be found in the subtitled version) in such a way as to be offensive in more than one instance. The subtitled version is phenomenal; I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys watching a brilliant work of art, with amazing acting in the Japanese language. Words such as \\"travesty\\" are appropriate in this case, I think, to describe the butchering that took place in the dubbing of this series. The only reason I give this two stars instead of one is because the anime itself is so great even the dub job cannot ruin it completely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money on this Anymore!","review":"While this Central Park Media released disc was the only way to get Utena for a very long time, it's not the case anymore.

It is one of the best acting performances I have ever seen. The movie is worth watching solely on his acting, even if you are not a Bacon fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"true story? not!","review":"This movie is a prime example of Hollywood taking a so-called 'true story' and completely twisting the facts to make it more entertaining. The producers attempt to justify this by saying it is 'based' on a 'true story'. This is like making a movie about Adolf Hitler and saying he killed a few people. If you do a little research about Henri Young, you'll find that he was hardly the innocent who in desperation stole $5. Also, unlike the ending in the movie, Henri Young did not die on Alcatraz. He was finally paroled from a prison in Washington in 1972 (!!!) after which he disappeared."},{"rating":"1","title":"-- Not a true ending --","review":"The extra star is for Kevin Bacon's performance. One of his best.Christian Slater's acting was good, but there was nothing remarkable about it.Some courtroom scenes just seemed downright ludicrous.If R. Lee Ermey is going to play a judge, he should at least play one that's been written realistically.Christian Slater's yelling and theatrics in the courtroom got really old really fast.And now the ending: Not only was it stupid to rewrite Henri Young's fate, it was morally wrong.Henri Young didn't die in prison. He lived up into the 70's.

It was not dropped or mishandled in any way, just broke off as though it followed a perforated line. Since I used it for a special occasion, this happended after Amazon's warranty period expired. I wrote to Riedel, confident they would stand by their quality but, astonishingly, they wrote back and said they do not allow customers to return product, and only warrant their stemware for two weeks, when returned by the vendor. Two weeks!! If the manufacturer has such little faith in the life expectancy of their product I wonder why any consumer should expect to feel any different? Buyer beware!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Fragile!!!","review":"My wife likes these glasses, but I think they are way too fragile. Be very careful with these glasses. The stems just don't break when you wash them; they can break while you are holding them full of wine. It has happened to me and my guests several times. Last night I was holding one full of red wine. The bowl broke off the stem, sending red wine all over my brand new leather couch. No amount of cool design is worth the poor workmanship that I have experienced with the Vinum line of glasses. The designer of this stemware should be ashamed of himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such a Beautiful but Defective Glasses!","review":"I just received my set. The glasses are so... beautiful! Yet, 5 out of 6 are defective!! What a big disappointment!

However, the design of the glass are beautiful!! I am still returning them! So sad!...... :("},{"rating":"2","title":"Now you can REALLY enjoy your wine - Start with these glasses","review":"If you don't already own a set of Riedel, and you're wondering \\"are they really worth the money?\\" - well, the answer is YES. Forget the snob factor. It's the \\"aroma\\" factor that makes these delightful glasses worth it. Unless your \\"wine\\" comes in non-grape flavors like raspberry, you will enjoy the \\"taste/smell\\" improvement offered by Riedel. I've compared Riedel to other (cheaper) large wine glasses, and Riedel still comes out ahead. If you're just getting started, begin by purchasing the Bordeaux glasses, as they offer the most obvious improvement over regular wine glasses.Oh, and all the comments about how fragile these glasses are? Well, yes, but they're supposed to be washed gently by hand and not in a dishwasher. We've had great luck with ours."},{"rating":"2","title":"It really makes a difference","review":"Many of my wine drinking buddies have been disgustingly euphoric over the Riedel glasses. So when Amazon started selling them at a discount, I took the plunge. My buddies are right. Tasted three wines in the Riedel Bordeaux glass vs. my regular decent glasses. The wine tasted better in the Riedel--markedly better. One reason was that the Riedel design enhances the aroma of the wine. But, in addition, for reasons I can't explain, the wine in the Riedel glasses seemed to be a mite less tannic/astringent than in the other glasses. go figure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the paper it is printed on","review":"Read the fine prints (read very carefully the description provided by the authors of the book)This dictionary is in fact only a French to English dictionary. It does have an English-French glossary at the end of the book, approximately 157 pages, but for all practical purposes it is so limited that it is nearly totally useless.The quality of the printing is poor to fair; at first I thought the book I received was a pirated copy.In my opinion, this dictionary is a total waste of time and money.

Maybe a little pattern recognition, some psychology, and some remarkably simplistic charts, haphazard in their application of technical analysis tools. I hate to be a skeptic, but I am extremely wary of books published by vendors. What happened to the thick, well-researched tomes of yesteryear? Writing a book seems to be more of an ego trip these days or a vehicle to sell one's services. Case in point: this book has a 1-page glossary with only a dozen entries. I consider that to be a lazy effort, which leads to my main criticism. The book is neither thorough nor complete."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"This book contains a great section on psychology and a good deal of examples on their perception of tape reading. I like the examples that dealt mostly with the capitulation and euphoria setups as I'm more of a contrarion trader. The volume and price combinations outlined in the book helped me to realize what I was looking at in these overeaction trades and why they were happening. I think traders will find enough information either in the first part or the 2 and 3 parts (or combined) to justify the cost for the book. I expect to go back to this one every 6 months or so as a refresher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very misleading title","review":"It's hard to believe so many reviewers gave 4~5 stars to this book and described this book as \\"best tape reading book\\". There's absolutely nothing about tape reading. It's a ridiculously misleading title.The first part of the book is about trading psychology. Lots of words, yet it's more about the author's own experience and just not particularly useful.The second part, if I have to find a category for it, is about volume spread analysis.Again, if you're looking for books about tape reading, stay away. I've wasted a few days on it. I hope you won't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fails to deliver","review":"I found there to be no actual tape reading. Instead I found a grammatically poor book and the resultant struggling to re-read sentences to pinpoint what the author was trying to convey.I did enjoy his personal background/history. Half the book is taken up by this and the rest examples of his trading setups. The setups I found somewhat informative but that was not the reason for purchase.Going back to tape reading or rather the lack of. Rather than specific examples showing tape reading he merely inserts e.g. '...here we use tape reading to exit a position...' or '...using tape reading principles we look to short here...'.I'm disappointed. 2 stars may be a little generous, perhaps 1.5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self Serving","review":"This book is about a vendor that wanted to tell his own story to push his products.

At least he gets the cholesterol message pretty much right, but basically this seems to be a watered down rehash of Ravnskov's material, used to bolster the author's New Age alternative medicine notions of transcendental meditation and vegetarianism. There may be something there, but the scientific proof is lacking. Ravnskov's book is as pure science as you will find."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mission Accomplished","review":"This book does what it says: (1) Explains why you should not fear cholesterol, and (2) Offers sensible recommendations for preventing heart disease. As a research scientist, I commend the authors' scrutiny of the medical literature. It is evident that they have done their homework. While I do not necessarily agree with each and every one of their interpretations, I find their assesment and conclusions well thought out. I was particularly impressed with their multifaceted approach to \\"Creating Real Heart Health\\" found in the second part of the book.

This is not a letter for a collector of epigrams and opens not with the abridged \\"Suffering is one long moment\\" paragraph but rather with the far more poignant appeal of a man wounded by and starved for the company and the society he in large part created -- \\"After long and fruitless waiting\\" -- and he wants to hear from Bosie (and never will).I have read this letter a dozen times -- each reading leaves me, like Coleridge's Mariner, a wiser and a sadder man the following morn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not read the kindle free edition","review":"The version included for the kindle is the 1905 publication - it is very incomplete and brutally edited.

They seem fairly well built and sturdy, but might be punctured or scratched easily. It took me about an hour to swap these into my 74 Jeep J10 pickup and it was a bolt and go installation. I didn't need anything other than tools and my existing bucket seat brackets. The result was a nice upgrade from a low back seat with a more conforming back rest. They are a fixed seat and a bit narrow, so take that into consideration. My truck isn't used very often, but the seats still look new two years on."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for!","review":"I just bought this item and installed it into my printer and all I get is a green smudge across my page.

Now if they made an atomic & solar version of this, that's what I'd prefer. The atomic solar versions either didn't display both date and day at the same time or didn't have a comparable countdown timer or a countdown timer at all, or the alarm had less features.

BLUES EXPLOSION!) tries to get mom and dad to respect them. The greatest live band on the planet serves up a bland and ultimately uninteresting and disappointing collection of Rolling Stones (circa 1974) would-be covers. Yeah, some of it might be catchy (\\"Blue Green Olga\\"), but most of it betrays the power and majesty of the mighty BLUES EXPLOSION live experience. The B-sides record, \\"Xtra-Acme\\", recorded at the same time, is much more representative of the the current state of the most fantabulous, rock & roll lovin' experience that is the BLUES EXPLOSION!

If you want something to fry your speakers and freak out to, or just to chill, buy this cd. This my first JSBX cd, and i can't wait to get my hands on another one. Songs like Blue Green Olga and Calvin are simply great songs, while attack litteraly is a freakish explosion of noise and base that's a substitute to caffeine and could really startle you if you're not ready for it. A few songs, like \\"do you wanna get heavy\\" kinda get lazy and boring. But the funk and bass of the album mixed in with some memphis blues and xperimental hip-hop are flat out creative and set a new standard. JSBX is, in my opinion, a pioneer band, and can't be imatated."},{"rating":"2","title":"BX rocks!","review":"Tired of the same old thing? Than buy this CD now.

It fails to provide the undergraduate student with the resources and background information that more highly touted books offer. There are a few examples that are somewhat helpful, but overall I found myself having to use reference texts to supplement this one. I am not a math major, but am continually searching for good math texts to help me grasp the fundamentals of more difficult topics. I did not find that help here. Too much 'math prose' and not enough to-the-point definitions and examples, which is the cry of every non-math major. Their treatment of the Laplacian is not even worth the bother of placing it in the book. The physical size of the book is small, (9 1/2 by 6\\") with 335 pages.

I have Strangest Places, and I think that this CD doesn't even come close in terms of energy. What drew me to Strangest Places was the guitars and the more pop-rock that many of the songs have. This CD, while it's good, is just not something that is easy to get in to. The songs are so melancholy and slow that they can almost depress you. There's none of the rock element in it, and it's just on overall quieter release.

There's absolutely no math (derivations) in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book, but not perfect.","review":"The author does a very good job explaining the fundamentals of DSP with some advanced topics. Materials are clearly, concisely, and logically presented with the exception of the section on FFT(Fast Fourier Transform), here the author's presentation suddenly degraded from excellent to (very)poor, and readers have to sort out the details of what the author is trying to say. Besides convolution and discrete fourier transform, FFT is the most important topic for people beginning on DSP, so this kind of spoils the book somehow. But then, this is still a very good book and the author has spent some great effort on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great diagrams","review":"Steven Smith does a great job of giving the reader a good intuitive feel for what is going on, especially regarding the mathematics of the convolution and the Fourier Transform.

The biggest problem I have with this lotion is the smell. It is extremely overpowering and lingers for far too long. A good example is a few hours after applying the product a friend of mine was able to smell it on my hands while standing 3 feet from me. The smell persisted after I had applied the lotion before bed, and woke up the following morning, and I'm not talking about I could smell it a little bit, I'm saying my hands reeked of cocoa butter 8 hours after applying it.I would only recommend this product if you really, REALLY love Cocoa Butter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cocoa Butter makes you feel like Butter!","review":"The search for the right lotion has always been a struggle for me, especially in the winter. So many of them are loaded up with water as the main ingredient that as soon as the wind hits you turn into a sugar crusted raisin. This lotion does the complete opposite. It truly does keep you moisturized for 24 hours. But the best thing about this product is that after freshly shaving your legs and taking a shower, smooth this lotion over your entire body and let me tell you...SMOOTH will be an understatement! My legs literally feel like a smooth stick of softened butter! This is great stuff. I don't know what else to tell you except try it one time and you'll see. Another great thing for those not fond of the cocoa butter scent, it does not linger at all. You just feel sexy, smooth, and smell fresh."},{"rating":"2","title":"I smell like a chocolate factory","review":"Normally I only buy fragrance free products since the smell of synthetic perfumes makes me sick. As a moisturizer it feels great on my skin, better than most other products I have used in the past. It absorbs very quickly into the skin and does not leave me with a sticky feeling. However, the smell of cocoa from this lotion lingers all day which those soulless chocolate haters will not be a fan of. As someone who does love the smell of cocoa this product is win-win for me. It keeps my skin from drying out while being aromatherapeutic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating look at the weak link in war....MAN!!!","review":"This is a fascinating and somewhat morbid humorous look at man's ability to kill himself in war......even if this means killing himself and his allies. The book reads well as a result of the author's interesting and humorous manner of writing. Sure it is not a humorous subject but sometimes one cannot help but laugh at the abject stupidity of mankind throughout history. This book proves that no matter how much technology advances there is always a weak link...mankind. Furthermore this book also proves that there shouldn't be such a fuss about blue on blue kills in the first or second Gulf Wars since this is nothing compared to the blue on blue in past conflicts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paper piecing","review":"After reading so many of the reviews that criticized this CD-ROM for printing out pieces that had to be cut apart, adding a 1/4\\" seam allowance, I thought I needed to say that these patterns are intended for paper piecing. In case you are not familiar with this, you sew directly on the paper, then pull the paper off the fabric when the square is complete.

I was so excited when I found the Animal Kingdom CD-Rom, which has patterns for most of the animals found in her books. Now I can easily print out what I want to make, saving me a lot of time. The added details make these animals come alive. In addition to bears and a delightful moose, there are many that I did not expect to find, including a puffin, several birds, owls, foxes, deer, a walrus, geese, and a sea lion.

Then I picked them up. Why would someone design such a beautiful glass (or anything for that matter) and insist on putting their name on it. Tacky. I don't advertise at my dinner table. As a professionally trained chef I recommend going for the official port glass, authorized by the IVP - Instituto do Vinho do Porto and designed by world acclaimed Portuguese architect Siza Vieira. <$37.

Songs like \\"fire forever\\" and \\"terror jungle\\" made the album definately worth the while. The changed their style to fit the new vocals slightly, and it actually worked. Iv'e found online that lots of people complain about the cover song \\"fame\\", saying it was too cheesy and not in adagio's style. But how about looking at it differently. Dont compare it to adagio normally, compare it to itself - the good, the bad, just because it isnt the same style as the other songs on the album doesnt mean its a bad song, yeh its cheesy, yeh its a cover, but it still sounds cool and a lot better than the original!

They tried to go darker, and it doesn't work. Adagio's first 2 albums will remain in my heavy disc rotation for many more years.

The reviewer before me said that it only had ringing sounds on the fun mode, but that's incorrect...the conversations that person mentioned is also on the fun mode. I DID like that it wasn't very loud and that alone is the only good part about this item which my daughter still plays with without the batteries (my cell phone is safe for the moment).

While I have no doubt that Adriana Dodge did indeed make the purchases that she talks about in the book and that she knows of other people that have used her method to buy real estate as a prospective buyer of this book you need to know that the method she promotes is not legal in all states.I am not saying that she is doing anything illegal just that the method used is not recognized in all states. Oregon, the state that I practice in, does not recognize land trusts according to the escrow officer that I contacted. Without the trust aspect of her method the existing lender will be notified by the title company when you attempt to purchase the house thus triggering any prepayment clause.So, if you buy this book be sure and verify that the methods used in the book are valid in your state or you might find yourself out a lot of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"This is the best instructional book on vocal technique that I have come across. I do a lot of singing at church and I already have many exercises that I do, but the manner in which the author describes how your vocal instrument should feel, the shape of your lips, the imaginary route that the air takes on its way out your mouth, up to the imaginary target for the projection of your voice is outstanding. I feel much more confident of my own voice when I have been practicing the easy to understand techniques that the author furnishes. Novice and pro alike can benefit greatly from this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Exercises","review":"The CDs that come with the book offer excellent vocal exercises that strenghthen and expand the voice and range. The book and the CDs are far less expensive than a voice teacher. There is also a poster with a diagram of how the voice is produced-how it resonates throughout the body. An understanding of this is helpful in learning how to \\"place\\" the tones.Also, Mr. Allen's descriptions of where the resonators are and what they will feel like if you are singing properly are very helpful.I recommend this book to any singer who wants to get her chops together."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Really Good Book for Beginners","review":"This book will help the beginning singer understand the importance of correct breathing, resonance, range, posture and focus. The book is complete with diagrams, poster (which I liked enough to hang on the wall in my voice lesson studio), vocal exercises, descriptions and demonstration CD. It follows a clear path of development and I think most beginners will learn a lot from this book. I suspect that most beginning students will have difficulty mastering any of these concepts or exercises without the assistance of a voice teacher. A more advanced student would likely have already covered this material with their private voice teacher. I would recommend this book as a good source of fundamental knowledge for the beginning student."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE BEST!","review":"If you are serious about learning to sing great from the bottom up, I will tell you the way this book is written will excite you to read it not just once, but over and over again just to make sure you haven't missed a word.

I believe it has enough hose to probably do a 24'. Ours is a 27' round pool and so we purchased 3 additional hoses.

It was a hard pill to swallow but we had to face the facts. When the bug stalled in certain places around the pool, it was not just cleaning the liner; its hard plastic edges had dug into it causing small holes and massive water loss. Calls to Hayward customer service provided little assistance so we decided to soften up the bottom edges of the bug by sanding them lightly and it seemed to work because we had no further problems with leaks. Update to this summer, we placed the bug in the water, its forth cleaning cycle, and it no longer moves. As I say, it is cute but it does not work.

So I contacted Hayward Pools, Intex Pools and the company I purchased the pool from. I was surprisingly told that these types of pool cleaners do not work in Intex pools.

I can tell you that I took my laptop out to the pool, played the DVD, and had him going in 15 minutes. The only thing that really stinks about it is priming the hoses (filling them with water) because you get a little wet doing that, but he is fairly easy to get going. The only drawback to him is we have a lot of bugs...Japanese beetles, June bugs, etc and they like hanging out on his hose. So after I take him out, I use my kids \\"dollar store\\" butterfly net and sit on the edge of the pool and catch the bugs. You will need the leaf canister, because all the pool debris goes into the pump filter because you are bypassing the skimmer filter since you take it out. He is slow but he does the job. Also you must turn the return (where your water comes in) to face down.

I called Hayward and Intex to see if they carried an adapter for the connection and they did not have one. I was not able to use this vacuum, because I could not get it to connect to my Intex pool pump.

The unit uses two \\"feet\\" that move in a round, vibrating motion and one of them stopped moving so the unit would just sit there on the floor of the pool sucking in one location. Even before it broke the unit worked okay at best. If there was even a little tension on the hose, the unit wouldn't have enough traction on the pool bottom to move about and would get stuck. After it broke, out of desperation, I took the hoses that came with the unit and installed them on a output water vent for the pool and secured a heavy weight to the other end of the hose. This then acted like a large snake blowing the bottom of the pool and stirring up any algae. The Hayward filter I bought with Diver Dan worked beautifully to then filter out the water. Frankly, that worked so well I kept the hoses and threw away Diver Dan! $100 for a 20' hose.

However, I do highly recommend the Intex saltwater system - great product that does work wonders."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a Toy!","review":"We saw all the good reviews on the automatic pool cleaner, but thought because of the price that it would be a cheap toy that would marginally do the job.

We HIGHLY recommend this product and guarantee that you will not be disapointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanda the Whale - not all it says it is","review":"I purchased Wanda to try to save time cleaning my pool - 24' round. I installed Wanda (which was very easy) and put her in the pool. Most of the prior reviews said to leave her there for 2 to 3 hours. I left her in my pool for about 5 hours and the pool was still not clean. Would love to return, but my husband got rid of the original box and not sure if I can at this point. Still had to vacuum the pool myself which defeats the whole purpose. Wanda stayed on one side of the pool the whole time and didn't move that well and certainly didn't get the dirt from the bottom of the pool up in any significant fashion. WOULD DEFINITELY NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Diver Dave does a better job than the kids","review":"For the most part, I would say that this product gives you the same amount of effort that you put into setting up your pool.

Overall, I like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke in less than a month","review":"I bought diver dave with great expectations, after one month it does not pick up algae and it stops when it hits the wall. called Hayward per the company I bought it from and Hayward informed me its up to you to pay for any work that you have done, parts MAY be included but not labor. The algae in question, is easily stired if you walk on it, and other vacuums pick this up fine, as it is not stuck to the bottom.

First one came with the pool, but broke after 1 year. When it was working, it did okay - cleaned the pool pretty well in about 2-3 hours. I got another one without spending time looking for alternatives, and this one works just okay also. I leave it in all morning, and when I go out it looks good except for some spots it missed. I always have to use the hand-held vaccum to finish the job. I'd like to find a product that would really do a great job, but don't want to spend over $100 to try any others at this point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Effective!","review":"Its nothing special, but it does an equally good job as if you were manually cleaning your pool (with the pole and suction hose of course)it does get stuck somtimes, but that may be because of the uneveness of my pool floorand why am i asked to rate this as a toy? lol"},{"rating":"1","title":"cheaply made","review":"The hose that comes with the Aqua Bug is in sections. They don't screw together they just nest inside each other. Which means they come apart at will. There is no easy way to get the thing out of the pool. If you pull the hose it pops out. If you pull by the bottom and put too much pressure on the black ring it pops off. There is what appears to be a handle on the top but it is not big enough to get a grip on a giant waterfilled bug.There are some spots on the pool floor that aren't perfectly level so the bug avoids them. I was desperate for a vacuum so I'll keep it but I feel like I was ripped off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as Described","review":"I have a 24 foot round above ground pool with a 52' inch depth.

After about 5 years we needed to replace it and I immediately without hesitation chose another Diver Dave! Our pool is an 18 by 32 above ground pool and it does a fantastic job! It is so convenient to hook it up in the pool and let it go for a couple hours and when you come back to disconnect it you have a clean pool!

Also, the connections have to be mickey moused to make Wanda work on an Intex pool. It can be done but after all this time and expense, I still have not been able to use Wanda.

It was all clear.Now I have a pretty decent hayward motor so power I think is essential to have this product run properly however only one problem you need to keep a eye on the hose especially where your filter water comes out it tends to push the hose away from that direction,but well worth the money!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best buy for our pool","review":"I couldn't keep up with storm season and keeping the pool clean.

Unfortunately, we have two oak trees right over out pool, so we get a lot of 'em. But if I can manage to suck the acorns up with just the hose first (a pretty tricky proposition) then Doodle Bug gets the leaves out nicely. We deployed her, came back in a couple hours and the pool bottom was spotless. I guess we'll just save her for summer deployment and use the regular pool vacuum while the damn acorns are dropping."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works","review":"I was a bit skeptical of this product when I purchased it. I have an above ground oval pool (12x24) and wanted something that could clean the pool without me pushing the vacuum around. This product actually works well. Its pretty easy to set up and once it gets going, it does a pretty good job of cleaning the bottom of the pool. I gave it 4 stars because its not perfect. From time to time, it may miss small portions of your pool but for the most part, it does a good job. I would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent pool vacuum!","review":"We received the vacuumed within a few days and immediately put it to work. It is awesome! It crawls very well on it's own and you can see the dirt and algae it sucks up on the floor of the pool.

Wanda does a great job even in our in-ground. It struggled getting out of the deep end at first but that turned out to be because our filter needed maintenance and was not providing the suction needed. I sorted that out and now it wanders through out the entire pool. I need to manually clean the sides and occasionally sweep the corners near the steps but this is a great starter cleaner it is already giving me back my summer to enjoy our pool. With two children I am over the top about a clean pool. We have many trees in our yard and this lead to cleaning the pool almost every day. Now I can just drop Wanda in the pool and let it go while I can do other things.

I agree it does not fully clean the pool as it tends to bind in certain areas of the pool and you must work to ensure the hoses are maneuvered around every so often. The water return does wreak havoc on hose placement as well. it does clean when you direct it to a certain area, but that is not the idea of an automatic pool cleaner.

The lyrical manner and quiet truth of its telling are a rich and delicious read. From the drama of the Black and Tan War to the romance of an Irish summers evening, Maurice Walsh gets straight into your head. Irish wit never underestimates your intelligence, and this book never does either. Hints and fleeting references always come back to haunt you, and the way each of these short stories seamlessly integrate, you will find yourself smiling in admiration. The Quiet Man really captures the flavor of the time, the idealism of the Irish Republic, the heroism of its defense and the realism of hard choices made for that idealism. This is storytelling at its Celtic best, you will not be dissapointed..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stories of the Irish/English conflict, circa 1920 ring true","review":"I was happy to find this book republished after years of searching for out-of-print copies. Every story is connected; every story gives a different point of view. Pick up this book and you will become enthralled with the stories of the men and women who lived, loved, and fought during the early years of Ireland's fight for independence. While I realize the book is a work of fiction, I found myself, nevertheless, rooting for each person as he or she struggled with the problems the author put before each of them: alcohol, honesty, familial obligations, moral conscience, the love of country. If you like to read of adventure with your romance(or vice versa), these stories are for you. The cover doesn't do the book justice. The stories are so much more than just John Wayne as \\"The Quiet Man\\". At the end of the book I found myself wishing that the author had written another collection of stories continuing the saga of this era and these people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good fun even if not highly regarded","review":"Well, this seams to be one of those albums that divides fans. Personally I like it. It has a good number of songs that are a bit 'take it or leave it', but there's a lot of fun songs too - both lyrically and musically. The 'extended version' of the album certainly bumps this up from a 3 to a 4 star experience for me. The original from the movie version of 'Papa Legba' and 'Radio Head' are particularly great additions to the original work. No doubt this album isn't Talking Heads at their best, but it's good fun and all the bonus stuff with this dual disc version etc. makes it worthwhile for for me and will be for many THeads fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"This will get you started.","review":"If you like a few of the Talking head's hits and you're thinking about picking up an album but dont know where to begin.

Now, fresh off Brian's triumphant \\"That Lucky Old Sun\\" (Sept 2008), I decided to get his re-recording of the never-quite-released \\"Smile.\\" Well, it is a big letdown. There can be no possible reason to re-do 'Heroes and Villians' or 'Good Vibrations.' The rest of it is pleasant and expertly played, but the songwriting is weak. I love Brian Wilson, but I don't need this pointless exercise."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Mystery Finally Realized","review":"I've been a Beach Boys fan for a long time. Having said that, I was ecstatic aboout hearing the now finished \\"Smile\\" project. In my humble opinion, the album was disappointing. I don't feel like it's the masterpiece that rock critics thought it was going to be. This is probably due to the fact that it was recorded a few years too late. I'd like to hear what the album would've souonded like in '67, with the original Beach Boys line-up. However, Brian can no longer hit the high notes like he used to. Brian now devotes over 1/3 of his live performance to the Smile album, playing the album in perfect sequence, which is something very rare. The audience reaction to Smile (i.e. yelling out \\"SMiLE\\" early in the show) demonstrates that somebody liked what they heard when they bought the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen To The Boots","review":"This recording is a great recreation of the original recordings, butlisten to the Beach Boys versions of these cuts and hear how superior the vocals are. This new version does not really satisfy fans of the Beach Boys or fans of the album. The only thing that will is for this to be released using the original tracks. While I am against buying boots, try to find one and listen to how superior the original is.

The music is jarring and discordant much of the time with self-conscious harmonies and chorus singing."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Emperor Has No Clothes","review":"I have recently poured through the remastered Beatles' CDs which naturally led to a revisit of the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds. Wanting more, I decided to purchase Brian Wilson's Smile, which I had never before heard. What a complete disappointment. As much as I want to love this album, it is a shell of what it would have been if released when originally conceptualized in 1967. But even imagining Brian Wilson singing at his best, the album is a poor attempt at outdoing Pet Sounds. Reminds me of Michael Jackson's release of Bad after the monster hit album Thriller--he was obsessed with outdoing Thriller but came up way short. The same is true of Smile; I find it unworthy of release, particularly with Brian Wilson's vocal range so limited. Why didn't anyone tell him? Clearly, Brian Wilson recognized this in 1967 and made the correct decision to abandon the project."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst CD ever!","review":"Based on numerous reviews here, I purchased this yesterday and was looking forward to a classic disc. Instead, I got the worst collection of \\"music\\" that I have ever heard. Driving home I wanted to drive off a bridge. When I got home, I thought, maybe I'm being too harsh, lets try it again and played it on my home system. I just couldn't take it, after about halfway through I was contemplating suicide. I removed it from the player and tossed it in the fire. Worst waste of money ever. If this is \\"genius\\", I'd rather be an idiot. This was contempuous and juvenile. The \\"talent\\" exhibited elsewhere was absent here. This just sucked. Save your cash."},{"rating":"2","title":"SMiLE - A must have!","review":"I only realised how good this record is when I listened to it (reading the lyrics as well) in one sitting - loud!. It is not so much a selection of discrete 'songs' rather a journey. So many complex textures, layers, melodies, harmonies, moods - spiced up with some discord, oddity and silliness, but the end result is pure ear (and brain) candy - not heavy going at all.The fact that it was conceived 37 odd years ago is mind boggling - it will be ageless in 37 years time too. It also shows just how ordinary the majority of modern pop is.P.S. This also reminded me how good some of XTC's stuff is too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning, beautiful, enthralling, wonderful","review":"Someone once called Brian Wilson the \\"Mozart of Pop Music.\\" I've always felt that \\"Pet Sounds\\" alone was enough evidence of this, but now he's completed \\"Smile.\\" I thought I had to be dreaming when I read that he and his band had completed his long-ago abandoned Teenage Symphony to God. There are many little moments on this disc that will have your jaw dropping open while you think \\"this is the most beautiful damn thing I've ever heard.\\" The swooping harmonies at the end of \\"Surf's Up\\" provide the best example, in my opinion. I would have loved to have heard the Beach Boys doing it, but Brian's band the Wondermints sound almost as heavenly."},{"rating":"2","title":"An incredible symphony. An album without parallel","review":"I haven't stopped listening to it since i got it on release day. It layers the mood with a thousand beautiful embelishments in a way that swings the mood to and fro' enveloping the listener in a pillow of sweetness. As a modern work it's a kick in the goolies to all espiring writers (like myself) showing the way in such an adept style that it inspires yet demoralises at the same time. As an original work it just would have blown the music loving public into the realms of the first cohesive album.The first modern symphony. IncredibleSome of the new versions lack some of the \\"heat\\" of the originals but we're talking slight mixing variations a problem Mr Wilson would have had to tinker with if the original had been released at the time.But let's rejoice in this modern release ignoring the history and see it for what it is; brilliant.And yes, plymouth rock vocal swings shiver the spine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!! and worth the wait!","review":"I just picked up this ablum a little over an hour ago.. its currently on my cd player as we speak for the second time through!

Brian Wilson has made a deliberate effort to divorce the 60's SMiLE and present his original vision in a fresh sounding, timeless, and indeed seamless work of art. From virtually every angle and aspect, from start to finish, this album illustrates aurally why Mr. Wilson is constantly hailed as a genius. For sheer musicianship, production, and vocals, this is his finest hour. Four decades later, this work is still ahead of it's time. Bravo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So, it IS His Sgt. Pepper after all!","review":"Remember all the years you heard the tall-tales that \`Smile' was Brian Wilsons response/retribution to \`Sgt. Pepper'? Then he went nuts, and unfinished it? Well, it seems that The Greatest Album That Never Was actually IS. Proving that there is life after the abominable \`Imagination', Wilson delves back nearly 4 decades to finish the unfinishable. This ain't no Beach Boys record - he knows that, we know that - and with his voice wavering from age and the Beach Boys legacy pandering in Kokomo with John Stamos, he vindicates his lost years by reneging the nay-sayers and sycophants both - his desire to please no one and everyone but to commit to his own dreamscape. And yes, \`Good Vibrations' was better before, but this will still make you weep in its sonic beauty and absolute joy - for the first time in many a decade, you could actually hear the rapture in his weathered voice - croaks and all. A revelation. My grade: A+"},{"rating":"2","title":"The most innovative album of any time!","review":"It's as revolutionary now as it was when it was conceived in the mid-60s. Brian Wilson, Van Dyke Parks and the excellent band have created an album that just flows like nothing else around. You shouldn't listen to just a single track or shuffle them around but absorb the whole thing in it's three \\"movements\\". Brian Wilson is just a genius!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Time to SMiLE indeed...","review":"This is just a fantastic record. It is easy to see how people may have not been ready for this in the 60's and, still at the turn of the century some people still may be not ready for it. This is a highly imaginative work that goes above and beyond what the Beach Boys accomplished and may isolate those expecting Pet Sounds part two. Thankfully, it is not and it is all the better for it. Yes, his voice has aged, but it is all the more gracious. Thank you for this fantastic and wonderful album!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hype,charity and the boomer effect","review":"There is a pronounced pestilent odor wafting from the hype around this release.

This could be because Brain is the only likable member of the original Beach Boys, or because he was the only real talented member of the original Beach Boys, but most probably it is because the Baby Boomers are still choking on the nostalgia of their youth only to superfluously worship any matter that is cough up.I am happy for Brain to see some of the credit for work, just don't fooled by the press clippings, there is much better music being made by people receiving much less press, so it just takes a little effort to find. Though the rewards equal the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"absolute mess!","review":"Very possibly the worst CD I have ever heard in my life.

It is stupid noise!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kulik got it right","review":"Thanks Jeff, your review was spot on. Don't get me wrong, I like the Beach Boys, otherwise this wouldn't have got a listen, but .... it is drivel. The whole album should be filed under Vaudeville! The barbershop quartet sound, the banjo, yes, there is definately a banjo in there somewhere. Gone are the crisp synths of days gone by, only to be replaced by a fairgound barrel organ. Each song sounds like the previous one and after 20 minutes it all became a sickening blur. I wonder if I can get a refund. Sorry Brian, your glory days were 40 years ago. I just hope this one isn't what people remember you for :o("},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"I was really looking forward to this CD. I have listened to it once, and once is enough to realize it sucks. I hate it. Be sure you listen to someone else's copy before you waste your money too. I threw the CD away because it was so bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Seven Stages Of Man","review":"The fact that anyone could listen to this collection of outtakes and half-finished ideas and deem it a masterpiece only underscores their own need for labels to be spoonfed to them. This sounds like the last gasp of a fading, deteriorating creative consciousness; a regurgitation of melodies that didn't quite make the cut back in Brian Wilson's formidable creative heyday which he now is reviving in a de-facto admission of the disappearance of his musical imagination."},{"rating":"1","title":"Masterpiece of crap!","review":"I love Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys but I guess now I know why they bailed on this project. Lyrically the project sucks. Parks Van Dyke must be the same kind of genius that uh... oh, yeah, is an idiot. The music was well composed, of course, but I doubt I'll ever listen to it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brian Wilson is now a joke.","review":"Brian Wilson once the man behind the Beach Boys has come up with a CD that is a big waste of money that I cannot understand a talent that is deep in the 60 and surf music is now dead Brian Wilson please RIP.

Thanks Brian for wasting my hard earn cash"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, but I just don't get it","review":"Number 9.....Number 9.....number 9....I ALMOST understand that 'song' as much as any on this CD.The fact that it got 4.5 stars on average from over 400 reviews only confirms my belief that drug abuse is still rampant in America.Seriously, other than Good Vibrations, every other song on the CD sounds terrible.If this CD is art, I consider it to be abstract modern art. You know - the kind where you can't figure out what the hell you are supposed to be looking at?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Smile didn't make me smile","review":"OK I've read all the other reviews, and listened to a lot of hype about Smile. I would be the first to say that Brian Wilson was amazing as a writer, composer and Beach Boy. This is yet another poor attempt to a post Beach Boy career. Perhaps this would have been better 30 plus years ago. Like Wilsons last solo project I was disappointed by the lack of depth amongst the lyrics and music. This would have been better with Beach Boys. I bought it and will sell my copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hype is the right word","review":"Pretentious noise. The editorial review has this right: \\"...alien to contemporary pop as it might have seemed in its intended '67 context....\\", but it omitted the rest: It is alien as music. This is not dance music, contemplative, rock-the-house, New Age, smooth jazz or any other genre. It is nothing. I am sorry that Brian Wilson's troubles delayed this thing for 37 years, but when the only interesting cut is Good Vibrations (yes, it is here), there is little reason to spend money on this. If you wonder why no previews are available on Amazon,re-read my remarks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-rated, dated, and boring","review":"Smile is a third-rate 1960's throw-back. The melodies are dated and not even up to Beach Boys standards. I do not believe they ever would have made the final cut when Brian Wilson was in his best form. He probably just needs the money so he can extend his forty year drunk. The Grammys that this CD have won are just a music industry suck-fest. The entire CD should have been left on the cutting room floor. If you buy this CD and regret it, don't say I didn't warn you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unlistenable","review":"Let's forget the folklore for a moment -- the 37 years, the genius of Brian Wilson, the \\"teenage symphony to God,\\" the best record never made, all that -- and focus on the music itself. It's unlistenable. A bunch of silly, goofy, \\"songs,\\" sung in funny voices and with lots of goofy background noises. This might be appealing to a toddler -- seriously, it sounds like something you might hear on Sesame Street -- but I don't see the appeal to anyone over the age of 3. In a lifetime of listening to music, there have been very, very few records that I couldn't get through at least once. I don't think I made it through the first 4 \\"songs\\" on this CD. Think of the worst CD you ever listened to. This is worse than that. Pure sonic agony."},{"rating":"1","title":"suprisingly mediocre","review":"I listen to Endless Summer (great) all the time at the beach.

As I ran through it for a third time, my wife stopped in and said, \\"It isn't very good, is it?\\" No kidding; Wilson trying to recreate the Beach Boy sound is both disappointing and a near-beer experience.I've been waiting for SMILE for a few decades, and finding pieces of it on SMILEY SMILE and SURF'S UP as well as other Beach Boy lps should keep Beach Boys fans happier than listening to the new Brian Wilson version. Is it me or does Brian Wilson sound like Bill Murray in Caddyshack? Alas, this long-awaited holy grail is more like a filled spitoon.The album was not, and never will be a SGT. PEPPER, and rock revisionists want this to be something greater than it is. Heck, so do I, but after all of the legendary status that SMILE has carried for around forty years, the final project is, sadly, more destined for the cut-out bins.Save your $15 bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the ...?","review":"One word: \\"cacophony\\". Three words: \\"try before buy\\". I bought this CD based on the reviews I had read, but had never heard it myself. After listening to \\"Smile\\", several questions come to mind like: \\"What was that?\\" and \\"What were those people thinking?\\" and \\"What were those people taking?\\" My advice: strike a match to that 20 dollar bill; it will be more entertaining than listening to this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful Listen!","review":"Aside from two short tunes that use animal noises (\\"pet sounds\\"?) and power tool sounds for maximum strangeness and another extolling the virtues of veggies, this lovely CD is a beautiful listen!The second \\"movement\\" of songs - Wonderful, Song for Children, Child is Father of the Man, Surf's Up - is worth the purchase price alone. Beautiful harmonies, interlaced musical themes and phrasing make this suite a small, very cohesive masterpiece inside a sometimes disjointed whole.Overall, SMiLE deserves accolades for its steadfast refusal to sound like anything else produced over the last 37 years!Buy it - you'll have no other listening experience close to it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Wilson","review":"These days words such as genius and masterpiece are used way too frequently, but in Brian Wilson's case it\`s definitely fully deserved. The ex-Beach Boy, who created the masterpiece \\"Pet Sounds\\" (1966), finally completed the wonderful \\"Smile\\" and blessed the world with a second masterpiece in 2004. Unique and enchanting. Love your music, Brian!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you so much Brian!","review":"This album is truly a masterpiece. I had tears in my eyes while I listened to it the first time. I keep playing it over and over, and will be enjoying this one for years to come.It is such a sweet turn of events in our musical history that SMiLE can no longer be referred to as the most famous album to never be released. It HAS been released and Brian Wilson has managed to get it just right. It meets all the hype and expectations head on and is true to the 60s studio sound which can be heard on your old Beach Boy records (apparently he even used the original 1960s mixing console for all the vocal tracks).This album contains fabulous song arrangements all weaved together into an almost non-stop musical journey. You've never heard anything quite like this before. And the songs are timeless and so beautiful.Everyone should have this CD.

If you were ever a Beach Boys fan you may remember multiple either released singly or on other albums.The greatest warmth is to be found in the assemblage as a whole - from track one right through the three movements to Good Vibrations as the finale; the 17 tracks weave together beautifully and draw upon each others themes to lucidly evoke the finest sixties music bliss.Treat yourself.

I have everything they have released, but this has been a glaring hole in my collection. I never had great hopes for this album, because the half-assed release of Smiley-Smile was mediocre for Wilson's level of genius. I have to admit I am VERY pleasantly surprised by many aspects. First, this has been completely redone from the ground up. This is not a situation where Wilson and the Beach Boys went back to patch up the original masters. As a matter of fact, the Beach Boys are nowhere to be found on Smile. This is a completely new band that learned the entire album, performed it live a few times and then hit the studios. It was still recorded in the same fashion as past Beach Boys albums, so the tone and feel is familiar, but the musicianship on this recording is beyond anything they had ever done. I have been asked if this album is better than Pet Sounds. That's a tough one. I'm not sure, but it is a worthy follow up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes me S M I L E -","review":"Wow - worth the wait.

Nothing profound here for sure. PET SOUNDS is the Beach Boys masterpiece that deserves all the adulation and hype one can bestow...it is truly a brilliant symphony of youthful hopes, dreams, and emotions. Recently I've gained a new appreciation for Dennis Wilson's songs before his demise, perhaps as heartfelt and deep as any Beach Boy explored. Forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"XTC rip-off","review":"Dude, this stuff sounds just like the \\"Apple Venus, Vol.1\\" album by XTC. The same vocal style and harmonies and the acoustic guitars/orchestra accompaniement. If you already own Apple Venus there's no need in buying this. Brian Wilson should change his name to 'Johnny Comelately'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smile--Not","review":"I think this album is a classic example of what drugs did to talented musicians like Brian Wilson, Elvis and John Lennon. Too bad Brian or some producer thinks this is good music. It's really just a rehash of Holland with different words and almost all the same melody. Sorry I got sucked into this black hole of Minor Key Madness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather sad to me, sorry Brian","review":"I saw a headline saying this was possibly a contender for the greatest rock album of all time so I bought it right away. I had seen the tail end of the documentary about the production and was amazed and happy to see Brian seemingly doing so well. My expectations were high I suppose but in all honesty I must say I found this album to be a sad disappointment. I must agree with a previous reviewer and say I find this to be a total hodge-podge of pieces of songs that probably should never have seen the light of day. The attempt to emulate \\"Sgt. Pepper's\\" is unmistakeable but woefully inadequate. If it weren't so sad it would almost be funny. There are some beautiful moments but they are few and far between and I doubt I'll even listen to it again anytime soon. Perhaps there are some things that are better left undone."},{"rating":"1","title":"surrender to dreck","review":"This self-indulgent exercise in musical flatulence gives dreck a bad name.

The Bad: Most of the songs are not very good, and \\"PLymouth Rock\\" is vomit inducing. The Ugly: \\"Mrs O'Leary's Cow\\" is noise pretending to be music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crock is a more appropriate title!","review":"With expectations high I was let down big time.If all the sixties smile sessions sound so good, and I have many in my collection, why do the new renditions sound so shallow and fallow?There is very little essence or spirituality in this attempt to recreate youthfull imaginings. The essence of youthfull creativity can not be reinterprited in old age!The original Smile is 1966 Brian Wilson Magic!!!Smile(2004) is not 1966!Almost everything seems to be lacking credibility and drive on this new CD.

Apparently if you slap the name Brian Wilson on a blank CD some fan-addicts will consider it to be comparable to the discovery of the Holy Grail.The \\"Our Prayer\\" track seems to be a particular favorite of some of these Wilson-worshippers. What they seem to ignore is that the original version on the Beach Boys 20/20 LP is infinitely better.

C'mon. This is pretentious, over-produced fluff that verges at times on incoherence, and is far inferior to the more melodic Beach Boys pop-rock in which Brian Wilson's weirdness was harnessed to the great power-wheel of rock'n'roll, thus producing music that could actually make people smile. I'm glad Brian Wilson's got his life together or whatever, but still and all, I would not recommend this CD. You know the old fable about the emperor, who it turns out, was wearing no clothes. The clothes were an illusion. On this over-produced album, Brian Wilson is the emperor that is wearing TOO MANY clothes."},{"rating":"1","title":"A nutshell review of Smile","review":"I'm a huge Beach Boys fan. Have been all my life. Huge Brian Wilson fan. Huge fan of the Smile songs from when Brian performed them 40 years ago. This CD is terrible simply because his singing, now, stinks.

Etc. etc. Certainly the best thing I've bought since Bob Dylan surpised us with Love & Theft. The legend of SMiLE is a terrific story, but don't worry, the album stands up on its own. His backing band is terrific, the music is a lot of fun, and it works as one piece. The best description I can give is its a \\"Beach Boys Symphony\\".We were fortunate enough to see him in Tampa a few weeks ago. It was truly a magical night. They covered most of the great singles, but SMiLE blew it all away. The band works really hard to pull it all off, and they do. Brian is stiff, and wonderful, and happy, and weird as he sits at his keyboard and reads the words off his teleprompter. It was a wonderful night, and everyone left thrilled.I simply can't imagine that anyone who enjoys Pet Sounds wouldn't thoroughly enjoy owning SMiLE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect and Timeless","review":"My favorite music of all time has finally become my favorite album of all time.

Ever think maybe it's more emotional to have an old man sing about eternal youth? To me it's more meaningful that way.........I am blown away by the concept and instrumental music. Vast for that time and even now. Lots of American or western themes like Aaron Copland, one of my favorite composers. So original, even now, to be so American. The trend was to incorporate Eastern sounds into rock, not our own heritage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Facing down the demon","review":"I thought this day would never come - the day that Brian Wilson finally puts \\"Smile\\" into order. I've heard enough versions made by Dr. Frankensteins of the bits and pieces that have been released or snuck out of the vault to be so thrilled at finally hearing all the music and lyrics Brian had created for this project. It is an amazing exploration of Americana. While other bands were grabbing the Blues or ripping off the English sound, Brian became kin to Stephen Foster. He was ahead of his time and even resurrecting a 37 year old record, he's still beyond the music of today.The record of the year."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Don't get it -","review":"My mother said to never criticize something you don't understand.O.K., I don't understand.I'll give this effort 5 stars for production, performance, effort and historical significance, and zero stars for personal entertainment value.I get more of a rush from Disneyland's Main Street Parade score.Congratulations to Mr. Wilson for purging his demons and resurrecting this odd fossil.

And when the long wait was over, it wasn't the Beach Boys. How sad that Brian Wilson thinks that the Wondermints can equal or even surpass the sounds of the Beach Boys. All the yes men surrounding him seem to tell him that everything he does is Genius. But as the great bulk of his last few albums shows with out Mike Love and Al Jardine, he's not really all that cool after all. Let's face it, all of them were mediocre song writers and musicians, but when you added them together, the whole definately was greater than the sum of their parts. I'm sad to see such a riff between Brian, Mike and Al. And the Smile album while good, was definately not as good as Pet Sounds."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Can Never Go Back","review":"Please, Brian, retire and enjoy yourself. I know it's tough.

Don't get me wrong I'm a big fan but this album wouldn't have worked even 37 years ago; it is fragmented, boring, devoid of rhythm and pace.

It was not what I expected and I was extremely disappointed. It is the worst CD that I ever heard from one of the greatest songwriters of all time."},{"rating":"1","title":"High Expectations Meet Underwhelming Results","review":"Like many music crazed boomers, I have heard of the great unfinished/unreleased masterpiece that broke Brian Wilson's spirit and led him into the dark, reclusive world of mental illness. Quite a story. Quite a myth. But the hero of this myth slowly gains his strength and not only resurfaces, but completely re-records his epoch work and releases it to his adoring public. Here the myth is shattered. When compared to the competitive masterpiece of Sergeant Pepper, Smile is unimpressive except for the three songs with which we were already familiar. The new portion of Smile is musically and lyrically simplistic and unworthy of even a fraction of the hype that accompanied it. I imagine Brian always knew this, but he preferred to reveal the truth himself, honestly, rather than have some record company do it posthumously. For that bravery, I give Brian my respect. But he always had that anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"smile lives up to the hype!","review":"whether you are just stumbling upon this album, or you have been waiting for it for your whole life...i assure you, it will live up to, and far exceed your expectations!"},{"rating":"2","title":"How good is Smile?","review":"How good is \\"Smile\\"? I think it was well worth the wait. I won't go much into the history of \\"Smile\\" except to say that it is no longer Brian Wilson's lost and unfinished masterpiece. It is completed and one of Wilson's best works ever. Perhaps it is not in step with modern pop, but then part of Wilson's charm was to take us places musically that we have never been. The completed project even with it's obviously recognizable songs such as the Beach Boys' classic \\"Good Vibrations\\" is unlike anything most people have ever heard. With none of the original 60's tapes used, it is an all new recording. I guess you could classify it as a cross between broadway and rock opera. I do miss the Beach Boys on it but the brand new harmonies are a feast for one's ears. Close your eyes and soak it all in. Thank God Brian has survived all that he has and has finally completed his masterwork for us. We ourselves are the truly lucky ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous!","review":"David Crosby was right when he said that Brian Wilson's song writing was quite beyond what was in Vogue in the '60's among the Rock and Roll artists.....that he used chords no one dared to use... and i would simply agree...his harmonies and melodies are so unique and sublime!...and in this recording...one finds such a diverse set of songs that are just simply fabulous!...to me, Brian Wilson represents what a true musician should be...artistry, talent and daring individualism, always bringing something new to the fore...what a Troubadour indeed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Soundtrack for an Insane Asylum","review":"I read lofty reviews for this in year-end \\"best ofs\\" and after checking it out of a library (thank god I didn't spend money on it) I have to check in as one of the many here scratching their head asking why on earth this received so many plaudits from the music press. It's a mess. I can't imagine anyone wanting to listen to this more than once. Several of the extended pieces will have you wishing you had a gun to kill yourself with as they are maddening. THIS is what the U.S. military should blare over loudspeakers next time it wants to depose one of its tinpot, puppet dictators out of their bunker because it is simply awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hopeless","review":"People should listen to albums and not rely on what is \\"Hip\\" or what the \\"Intellectual\\" Community has to say about certain \\"masterpieces\\". It is amazing to me that people take it on word that this album is genius work. Of course Brian Wilson has done some outstanding and timeless work, but that being said not every note he has written is brilliant. This album and its saga have become some sort of legend, its even been said that had it been released when originally written Sgt Pepper would have been eclipsed. I am so glad that I am not alone in being so overwhelmingly disappointed by this album. That people ever thought of bringing the Beatles into any form of comparison with this mess is mind boggling. I loved Pet Sounds and in fact all the Beach Boys stuff, But this is a disaster.A lost masterpiece? I think not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not believe the hype, this is a stinker.","review":"The only thing that can explain why Brian Wilson's Smile has garnered as much favorable press and hype is how bad the music industry has gotten and how we consumers long for period of musical creativity that was the late 60's. Unfortunately, had this album been released then it would have been relegated to the bargain bin pretty quickly and long forgotten by now. This is not a good album, period. It's a mediocre album that Wilson wisely shelved in the 60's. Putting it out now smacks of crass commercialism.Vocally, Wilson has lost quite a bit from his Beach Boys days and musically this album sounds like a bad Broadway musical. I can actually imagine the actors running around on stage while listening to it. I suppose if you are a Beach Boys fanatic or Broadway musical fan this might be a good buy, but otherwise avoid it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I expected","review":"This cd is not much more than Brian Wilson's musical ramblings that seem to go on forever. As much as I like Brian Wilson I'm glad I got this cd used and cheap. It's awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smile makes me frown","review":"This is just a big, fat, pretentious bunch of bits and pieces. There are only 3 \\"hummable\\" songs on it, and I already have two. Brian Wilson is/was a master, no doubt. But this is not a good example. I'll take the recording Holland (my favorite) anytime. The Beach Boys sum is definitely better than the sum of any of its parts. Too bad they can't get back together."},{"rating":"2","title":"a masterpiece","review":"i LOVE this recording! the songs and the performances, and the recordings of the music are breathtaking! there is much MAGIC here, as well as SPIRIT, AND GOOD VIBES AND WONDER-FUL arrangements!!!! one of the best albums of our life-time! i love all the percussion( bells, chimes, windchimes, woodchimes, great vocal harmony, but especially the songs and BRIAN's singing. an AMAZING project!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"As a long time Beach Boys fan who is in his 50's, I was rooting for Brian Wilson to pull this off. Unfortunately, this is a very mediocre album and in places really grates on me. My wife made me take it out of the player in the car. \\"Good Vibrations\\" and \\"Heroes and Villains\\" realize the potential of the 60's versions and shine as the albums best cuts. Most of the rest of the album is unlistenable. It is Pet Sounds progressing to the next level (not a good thing) and almost sounds like a Pink Floyd \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" wanna be, only 35 years too late, and not as listenable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smile!","review":"I hadn't listened to much of Brian Wilson's solo works until I listened to this album, and I liked what I heard : ). This album sounds nothing like The Beach Boys, but it has a unique sound to it that makes it wonderful. I also loved that this album included \\"Good Vibrations\\" since it's one of my favourite Beach Boys songs. I also very much like \\"Heroes and Villains\\", \\"Wonderful\\", and \\"Vega-Tables\\". The album I got included a bonus track, \\"Heroes and Villains (Instrumental)\\", which doesn't seem to be on this CD that I'm reviewing : /. I enjoy instrumental songs, so I'm glad that it was included and it's definitely worth listening to! Even thought it doesn't sound much like Beach Boys, I would recommend this album anyway!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I have been listening to the beach boys since I was Five.","review":"Iv'e waited and waited, while listening to the Beach Boys everyday of my life. I was prepared to be disappointed and then I listened. It is the greatest Brian Wilson Production hands down. At the age of 42 I still can't believe its here and every bit as beautiful and perfect as I could have imagined."},{"rating":"2","title":"SMiLE","review":"Whoa! I will spend a lot of time in the future listening to this work of genius, and it will be time well spent. This album is way way beyond anything else that is out there right now, and honestly kids, just one listen is not going to do it. This is beauty--aural beauty! There it is. You don't really have to say anything about it, just take it in and love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching","review":"This is an outstanding album. I have been listening to it constantly and I have only owned it for a few days. It's a little sad to me though. Brian's voice sounds good, but as has been mentioned is courser. That doesn't detract from the album, but grounds you in the reality that the album was released this year and not 37 years ago. It also reminds you of the unrealized potential of Brian Wilson of 1967."},{"rating":"1","title":"You should have this album","review":"I am a huge Brian Wilson fan. I love what he has done and respect him very much.Putting aside all this folklore and history assocaited with the album, this record is just ok. I used to listen to it thinking it was so good. Having heard the old soundbites and seeing Brian in concert. I slowly stopped listening to it. Then I decided to pop it in recently and I was very surpised to find that I really didnt want to hear any of the songs. I find them very silly and goofy, they dont need a girl singing on the album, and the vocals arent great."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it, but...","review":"again, it's not really what i expected from all the hype surrounding the release of the album in it's entirety. it's enjoyable, but might be better to burn off a friend"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Emperor Has No Clothes","review":"Really? This took 40+ years? Ok for all you fans/collectors, but I found this just odd and lame. There are some nice moments, which I kept hoping would develop into something, but was disappointed every time. The reworked version of Good Vibrations at the end just highlighted, for me, how the rest of the effort doesn't live up to its potential. There is a lot of hyperbole in some of these reviews- rather than being swayed by them I strongly suggest you give this a listen before you buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it.

Enjoy it for always."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable","review":"This music induced in me the most profoundly emotional reaction to sound I've ever experienced. During \\"Wonderful\\" I actually sobbed like a child.This is a magical album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Very short review. This is one of the most brilliant pieces of work in pop history. It sounds amazing. It begins on the East coast with Roll Plymouth Rock, goes to Chicago with Mrs. O'Leary's COw; travels to hawaii with In Blue Hawaii and Finishes on the WEst Coast with Good Vibratiopns. All the while it builds and comes to a creschendo with a re-vamped Good Vibrations. Its almost sounds like one song.HANDS DOWN, THEY BEAT MCCARTNEY AND LENNON IN ARRANGEMENT AND SHeER CREATIVITY. I'm just glad I'm around to hear it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brian Wilson and Van Dyke Parks are awesome","review":"This is an album which wears well. It is filled with wonderful melodies and lyrics. And the shere musicality of the whole thing is great....I have never been moved to review a record before but this one is unique. At once it sounds familiar yet it is so edgy and contemporary. Parks, the musician's musician, wrote the most wonderful, quirky and yet profound songs. Wilson proves his genius with compositions and orchestrations which are wonderful today and are mind-blowing to think of as having been in a vault for decades. This combines the good-time feel of Wilson's Beach Boys with the most intelegent lyrics and compositions imaginable. If they make this suite into a DVD be sure to buy it. Brian Wilson is back! Kick back and enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece","review":"It's all been said before about Brian Wilson and the album that never was. Well . . . here it is, in all of its majesty. One of the few things in this world that actually lives up to the hype.But I have one question. When can we expect the release of the mono version?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply essential","review":"C'mon. You knew this would be great.It had to be great.Brian Wilson creating a SMiLE that was anything less than totally effing brilliant would incite riots in the streets. It would be like changing the flavor of classic coca cola or trying to convert America to the metric system.The people would not have it.Since the death toll at the hands of SMiLE is currently zero (to my knowledge), it's obvious that the album totally dominates.SMiLE is a pure, absolute joy from start to finish and warrants roughly six billion repeat listenings. The sound is childlike, yet sophisticated, experimental, and yet immediately accessible. Words can't really do it justice. I hate to single people out, but if you hate this, you're probably the world's biggest scumbag (or a jealous Charles Manson).SMiLE is easily one of 2004's best albums and most pleasant surprises, even if we did all know it would be great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smiling as I type this....","review":"Absolute GODHEAD! If you don't like this album you just haven't listened to it enough times...it will click...and when it does you'll understand why this is an important entry into the language of American Music..Popular or otherwise...Therefore, RUN don't walk, to pick up a copy of this masterpiece...you'll not be disapointed...even if you're apprehensive because Mr. Wilson et.al has started from scratch, worry not...It's better than anyone would have expected...Mr. W's sidemen are professionals of the highest caliber, and this document is evidence of an amazing aural excursion...Highest Recommendation!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Brian Wilson is Done","review":"I bought this CD expecting some lost gems. Sorry Brian Wilson lovers and Beach Boy lovers.....too late. Brian's heyday was in his teens. His doctor cannot resurrect his lost, destroyed talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"You're kidding, right?","review":"Even though I'm only a marginal Beach Boys fan, I ran out and bought this album based on the hype -- incredibly disappointing. If it was released in 1967 it might have had the advantage of being something new, but in 2004 -- It is so inferior to Sgt. Pepper, Magical Mystery Tour, and countless other music in the almost 40 years since (even Freddy Mercury is rolling over in his grave)-- all in all, self indulgent nonsense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you nuts","review":"I went to CDNOW to get an idea of how this CD is before I bought it. That will be the last time I beleive any of you. This is very close to the worst CD I have ever bought. I'm still trying to figure out a way to return it and get my money back. the only highlights to this CD are, #1 some of the music is great (Heros & villians is a stand out track) #2 the Beach Boys sound alike vocals are good. My problem is the lyrics. They sound like they should be tracks on a childrens show (Roll Roll Plymouth Rock, Barnyard & Workshop to name a few). In closing, Don't beleive the reveiws you read here. Borrow the CD before you buy it. You'll thank me."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's clear our dear old friend Brian Wilson...","review":"It's clear our dear old friend Brian just doesn't have it any more.I am among the first to applaud a unique artistic effort but this one should have been left on the shelf.This is a self-indulgent collection of meaningless noise and perhaps a sad conclusion to a once brilliant songwriters career.These are not songs, they are sequential dabs of disconnected sounds, some of them pretty sounds, but certainly not music. Certainly not entertaining. Even the seminal 'Good Vibrations' has had the vanilla treatment here.Music at the very least, is something you can recall after you hear it."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of the Same","review":"If you are like most people and don't know what to make of Pet Sounds, stay away from Smile! It's just more of the same only worse. Pet Sounds was the most overrated album of all time until this thing crawled out of it's crypt to bore future generations. Of course Wilson is considered a Genius so the critics are raving about Smile, but the truth is the Emperor has no clothes! It's just pointless, weird and stupid not to mention really dull!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank God","review":"All of us can thank God for something. I thank God that I did not spend any money for this cacophony of babel.The song clips provides great laughter at the office. We can not believe how horrible this crapball of CD this is. No wonder Mike Love was bitterly opposed to Smile. He probably envisioned himself on stage trying to sing that toilet of song \\"barnyard\\".I wish I could get negative stars to cancel out some of you [...]who claim that this CD doesn't suck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as his previous material, but an extra star due to his hometown hero status","review":"Brian Wilson comes from the town where I live, so that's nice. In fact, I met him a few times, and I have to say, he's down with the streets. But I prefer it when he takes the time to, you know, RAP. I mean, he didn't call himself 'MC Beatlessuck' for nothing. Here he sounds like an old dude trying to make a pop album, which is totally not the homie that I'm familiar with. Here's hoping he gets back on the chronic, G."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some things are better left unfinished...","review":"Admittedly I'm not the biggest Beach Boys fan, but I'm writing for those of you on the fence. I read someplace this recording should be considered in contention for the greatest album of all time(we'll for me not so much).If your a Beach Boys fan you'll love it, but if not and are curious it will be the addition to your music collection you wish you hadn't made. Your better off buying \\"Pet Sounds\\" better yet find a used copy. The songs are bit lacking. I mean that at least for me there's not a showstopper in the bunch, except for \\"Good Vibrations\\" (which was already one of there greatest hits.) I think with out a doubt if this album had actually been released in 67' like it was supposed to. The Beach Boys would not be nearly as popular as they are today...If you need a reminder or yester-year I'd recommend John Lennon's \\"Acoustic\\". That collection of tunes will bring a tear to you eyes, for the loss of who was the \\"true\\" greatest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dance, Margarita...","review":"Some good fragments, to be sure. But that old Brian Wilson magic--that mix of haunting and exuberant, that swirl of youth and summer--is mostly absent. Parks' lyrics are a match. There are few bits of genius, and you can see he was reaching for something epic--but he never quite gets us there: \\"Blue Hawaii lay beyond the sea\\" -- and just a bit too far off. For a Beach Boys fan, though, it's still worth the price: there are parts where the old brilliance--musical and lyrical--shimmers through, and you can feel it in your gut, like when you were a kid."},{"rating":"1","title":"You call that Music ?","review":"Unfortunately the lowest grade , here, is one star , so I am forced to highly overrate this childish \\"music\\". I gave it , therefore , one star , when in reality it deserves nothing more than a plain 0 ( zero) . Biggest crap I ever heard in my life ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lying Hype","review":"I cannot believe the raves about this album. I bought it as I thought that there might be some integrity to the ratings. I would not be surprised to hear that Brian Wilson's family, friends and everyone at the record company wrote the good things about this album. It stinks! The only two bright spots were the reworked (not for the better) versions of Heroes and Villains, and Good Vibrations. Any song writing talent Brian Wilson once had is long gone. I want my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cacophony","review":"I wouldn't normally write a negative review of a musical work because what's noise to me may be inspiring to someone else. But in this case I feel like I've been duped by a brilliant marketing scheme. I'm annoyed I spent $15 on this drivel and embarassed I gave it as Christmas gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"It depends on what you're looking for","review":"Some of these reviews are as entertaining as this (or any other) title. Is it a cacophony, a disaster or is it a masterpiece...? That has to depend on what you expect from this release. If you expect this to be a faithful reproduction of what a teenager wrote almost fourty years ago you'll be disappointed. Brian Wilson isn't a kid anymore and personally I'm happy that he isn't trying to sound like one on this album. That would be really sad. He does however do a great job of reinventing, refining and reinterpreting his own personal vision of a long time ago and putting together a very entertaining and insightful musical work. I'm really glad Brian Wilson got around to making this CD both for him and all of us.On the other hand if you are one of those fans who can't get by the fact that this album never happened back in the sixties look around for the Purple Chick boot of SMiLE with the original BBs. You won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Flawed Masterpiece","review":"This album is a great revisit to a time gone by, when psychedlia was still in formation. Smile is not Sgt. Pepper, or even Bee Gees 1st (which makes good companion listening to this album), but there are flashes of true brilliance here. What really killed this album for modern audiences was the decision to release \\"Heroes and Villans\\" and \\"Good Vibrations\\" on Smiley Smile back in 1967. Had those songs been withheld for all this time, we'd all be giving this album 5 stars. As it stands, the best parts of the album are already part of rock history. This album is certainly worth owning and listening to a few times to truly appreciate it, though. It is very complex and rewarding to the discerning listener."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Album","review":"Biran Wilson is One of Pop Music's Greatest Songwriters&Musicans. he truly captures so many Moods&Moments with His Style of Playing&what He brings.how many Acts can have a Follow Up Album waiting in the Wings for almost 40 years but yet maintain the same intentions&Textures? this is a Very Good sounding album that still sounds fresh.I enjoy the Arangements&overall stylings throughout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest hits of their early works!!!","review":"This album was originally put out in 1991 prior to pink bubbles go ape on noise records, the old lable of hellowen to finish out their contract. It is by far one of the best greatest hits compilations available for any band, much like alice coopers greatest hits in 1974. This album has the harder to find tracks \\"livin ain't no crime\\", \\"Save Us\\" and re-recordings with michael kiske's vocals of \\"savage\\", possibly the definitive version. Kiske re-recorded many of these old \\"Walls of Jerhico\\" tracks on this, which can also be found on the Pumpkin Box, or the album 2006 re-masters. Kia Hansen was a good vocalist, but I am glad he stepped aside to focus on guitar, because he is one of the best thrash/power guitarist around. This is well worth adding to your collection, and likely a great introduction/solo disc if a person only wants to own one helloween disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful Film!","review":"This film was based on the real life of Francis Farmer.

Uneven script is overshadowed by truly great acting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jessica Langes best performance","review":"Frances Farmer was ahead of her time.

She wifully speaks her mind and becomes the centre of attention and becomes a star. However comsumed with alcohol and fear to commit she suffers from her own undoing. This is a tragic film and would be very difficult to sit through and watch no matter how well it was made.

Lea Thompson and Victoria Jackson are great, some tacky scenes but still worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable, Dumb and Moronic","review":"I can't believe a star of Lea Thompson's caliber or such a controversial comic like Andrew Dice Clay would agree to star in this film. It tries to make a dark humorous statement about AIDS in the 80s and fails. Dice-Clay's character is likeable, but your stereotypical Jersey guy, and I can't believe he agreed to recite such idiotic lines.While the beginning of the film is ok, it quickly disintegrates into mindless dribble. I get this impression this film was targeted at the adolescent male audience, with lots of sex and some nudity thrown in for good measure. Predictable and formulaic, this tacky little film is not worth your money. What a shame that the talented cast of this film had to utter such stupid, inane dialogue. How amazing that such a ridiculous, badly written script was made into a movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it as a teen","review":"I read this book as a teenager. To address some of the comments, first it is NOT their storybook so the kid that found it just okay may have been put off by the lack of a story. The person who gave it to a 7 year old needs to understand that this book was made for TEENAGERS and not small children. I am sure that a 7 year old would be bored to tears with detail on how to become a detective. This is what this book is about: how to follow a suspect, how to know if you are being followed, how to dust for prints, etc. It is a great book for someone who wopuld like to go into law enforcement in the future to whet their interest!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too detailed on drug use and terms","review":"I got this book for my 7 year old daughter who loves reading the Hardy Boys mysteries.

For starters, the sound quality is abysmal. The guitar parts are largely undermixed and sound like Du Cann was playing in the building next door. The drumming sounds all muddy. Part of this may be due to the fact that the Marquee is a relatively small venue and they were probably playing at maximum volume. Vincent Crane's usually heavy Hammond chops are totally uninspired, perhaps a consequence of his knowing that the best years of the band were behind him. Du Cann's vocals are terrible, consisting largely of unintelligible screaming that would be better reserved for some speed metal band in the 90s.

The \\"Vinum\\" series is their \\"affordable\\" line. (I would not call it \\"second tier\\" because Riedel has at least two other series with price points above this one.) Riedel is the preferred choice for wine connoisseurs and enthusiasts, not to mention the port and single-malt scotch aficionados. The artisans of Riedel have designed stemware to accomodate grape-to-glass, as is perfectly demonstrated in these beautiful 3-Ounce Grappa Glasses.This set of six stems will wow you, your family, and your friends, as you savor the potent Italian brandy, grappa. One's first taste of grappa is almost a rite of passage in an Italian or Italian-American family. But you certainly don't have to be Italian to appreciate the enhancement of this grape which these Riedel glasses bring to your senses.

Made up stories, inacurate details and dramas. No one could possibly have this much information about someones life, especially a Beatles private life. I find it hard to even justify writing this review. I am doing so only to warn others that they will be very disappointed if they read this book. Please do not purchase this book.

Hopefully coming out in the fall of 2002."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZERO STARS","review":"This book is a work of fiction, a sad display of the authors fantasies and exaggerations. If Geoffrey wants to write fiction, why does he have to plaster a real person's name on it. In another country, he'd have been ordered to make retribution for his slander, and this sorry excuse for a book would have been pulled off the shelves. It's very sad that he feels a need to make his living this way. I encourage him to go write about Bigfoot. That is the only subject his skills are suitable for. George lived with quiet dignity in an insane world. No one deserves to have lies and exaggerations of this kind printed about them, least of all George Harrison."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very little new","review":"Written and not updated 8 or so years before his death, this rock bio dwells too long on George's mystical fascinations. Very boring. In fact, George really wasn't that interesting either, as he long insisted. He was so right.

Harrison isn't interviewed by the author, but is quoted throughout from clips and other interviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Quiet One","review":"I thought this book was interesting at first, when he talked about Harrisons early life, but after that, the book just dragged on and on, about half the stuff on George's beliefs could have been cut out.

Instead of being a serious and comprehensive biography, I found this work to be little more than innuendo and hearsay. Mr. Guiliano tends to rely heavily upon cliches such as \\"the Quiet One\\" and gives a very surfacy overview of the man's talents and musical contributions. He does not provide substantial facts and many of his statements appear to be more of his subjective opinions rather than objective, factual (and hopefully) informative statements about his subject.Read the Beatles' Anthology instead. You will be glad that you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure gossip","review":"If you want more information about the life of George Harrison, this book is DEFINITELY NOT the place to get it. It reads like something out of the National Enquirer. As is the case in most of his books, the author injects himself into it, in this case, making the most of a very short association with George, which his wife Olivia once described in a letter to a British newspaper as lasting \\"about 10 minutes.\\" Because of that, the book has little in the way of solid information on George and actually deserves less than a one-star rating. How about a zero?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"This book is not worthy of being in any store. Complete rumor.

It reads as idle and sometimes nasty gossip. There are glaring inconsistencies, and clumsiness with dates, which, considering it's many reprints, is simply unforgivable. The book concludes with a catalogue of dates that shed extraordinary light on the writer's egotism and ludicrous attachment to the subject of the book. I am grateful to the author at least for curing my interest in biography. From now on I'll just stick to the music. To say the book does not do justice to this immensely talented musician is a gross understatement. I am embarrassed that I bought this book.

When George Harrison himself said of the author that \\"the guy knows more about my life than I do,\\" as is quoted on the jacket of some editions, I don't think he meant it as a compliment. Rather, I think he meant that some of this stuff isn't true, which it may not be.

I have had the old Novalogic games forever but never really played them because I have never had a joystick. What a difference it makes playing these games. On the games that provide force feedback the stick performs well also. With the included software the stick is totally customizable allowing you to configure just about everything. The stick is big and bulky so you need some space to set it when not in use. The base is 10\\" wide by 9\\" deep and it is pretty heavy.

The first thing I noticed is that it seems to be well made. It is quite heavy, but not too heavy to hold. The force feedback is the #1 reason anyone would buy this, and this feature varies from game to game. On some games, it felt totally unnecessary and didn't add anything to the game. On others, it complimented it nicely. The feedback response seems to be strong on this controller.I would recommend this controller to anyone that is *really* into gaming. Otherwise, forgo the feedback and just get a regular joystick. If you play console type games or shooters, get a gamepad!One thing to note - whatever you do - do NOT lose the CD that comes with this. It contains the drivers needed to install this joystick. Microsoft does NOT have them on its website. Windows XP will not auto-detect and install the joystick."},{"rating":"2","title":"MS Sidewinder Force Feedback 2 works good with Windows XP","review":"I have seen some of the negative reviews on how the Force feedback 2 works with Windows XP. My experience has been just the opposite. The joystick works very well with Windows XP. I followed directions and installed the software first. This took about 15 minutes, if you don't include registration. Then, I plugged the joystick into a USB connection, tested the buttons. They all worked, and then I plugged in the power.

As a whole, the series is thoughtful and mature, yet passionate, without losing the sense of wonder that draws the reader to romance novels. The hero and heroine of the story are strong-willed, compassionate, and prideful ex-lovers, who after many years of separation and tragedy, must learn to forgive each other and themselves. The background for the lovestory is the political intrigue that took place during the peace talks following the Napoleanic Wars, and the story introduces the hero in Ms. Putney's later novel ANGEL ROUGE. This novel deals with mature themes while being entertaining, and without becoming morose or preachy. This one is well worth keeping, and reading again on a rainy day, particularly as part of the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful!","review":"This book was terrible. Right from the beginning the characters seemed wooden and lifeless, and they remained that way right throughout the book. The story was too complicated and confusing, and too much emphasis was put on political issues instead of the two main characters. Reading this book, I felt as though I was reading a history book instead of a romance novel. The whole idea of a romance is that it flows easily and that you can relax and enjoy reading it - but for it also to contain a bit of intrigue and suspense, and of course, passion and tension and humour. This book lacked all of the above. A romance book is supposed to have you wishing you were one of the characters. Not this book.

This album only touches the surface of the doom metal scene. The overall feel of the album (by about song 5 or 6) is boring. There are some songs that are definitely worth the listen such as \\"Sweet Tears\\". The album starts off fairly strong and quickly lapses into a boring repetition of the exact same melodies over and over again.

When it worked it was OK.First problem was with the handle. You are supposed to use the cover as a handle extension. The seam of the cover had a hairline fracture in it so the thermometer tended to fall out into the BBQ if I tried to use it that way.Periodically the electronics would just go on the fritz. It would read in Celsius and there was no way to go back to Fahrenheit short of removing the battery.After a year it died and I tossed it.

A decent cast supplements a weak story about a hitman with morals, a prostitute with rules, a drug lord who should have been dead years ago, and a recently orphaned child all crossing paths in Amsterdam.To try and describe all of the small world subplots of sex, drugs and double crosses would stagger even the interested, but needless to say they all gave a valiant effort under the direction of an unknown crew. It might be worth the investment for some of the fans that follow these known actors in their respective environments, but this film is a minor compilation for them. The writing seemed so confused at times that the characters become unfathomable.No extras on the DVD, and the ending was wholeheartedly irritating and contrived.

Those who believe that they taste things more sweetly on the tip of their tongue have merely created a convincing mental picture.

And I tried. But try as I might, and as beautifully written as it was, I could not identify with the characters. We are given only the tiniest glimpse of the first encounter between a young woman and a cold male doctor, and from this un-rememberable encounter, we are supposed to believe that they are so wildly obsessed with each other that nothing can keep them apart. And yet - the doctor yells at the girl, insults her, chases her away - but feels sorry later, and tells his friend that he cannot be happy without her.

The neotropic remix of 'love in vein' is probably my favorite. Autechre is 100% all-them until the end when you hear some samples from the killing game in longer than 0.25s loops.All of that said, this is not a skinny puppy album, it's a derivative 'greatest hits remixed by artists you like/may like - please buy this, sincerely, Nettwork)*it's not a cd, it's been borg'd to mp3s from the cd along with all other cds 12 months ago)"},{"rating":"2","title":"OUTSTANDING REMIX ALBUM","review":"I've had this disc for over a year now and it gets BETTER every time I listen to it.

These aren't good remixes. Worlock {ed} off of The Singles Collect was a good remix. Killing Game (Bent Mix) is five minutes of noise. None of the remixes are anywhere close to as good as the originals. The only two remixes on this album I like are Ogre and Mark Walk's Smothered Hope remix and Guenter Schulz's Addiction (Opium) mix. Skinny Puppy is one of my favorite bands, but it just hurts to listen to this album. I would steer clear of this and get ANY other Skinny Puppy album.

Bands such as Superunloader, Steve Poltz, Wise Monkey Orchestra, Mower, P.O.D. and Unwritten Law (to name more than a few), although very different from one another, sound much much better than this.

This may be his most under-stated, easy listening album yet. It really grows on you. All the tracks are pleasing, several with searing lyrics. Shangri-La, the track, is a great romantic tune to put on with the sun going and your honey next to you with wine and cheese.

I know this to be a very well recorded album. Imagine my surprise when I heard the lead vocal in panned fully into the center channel and clearly too hot on a couple of tracks and, therefore, causing audible clipping in the associated DA converters in both my home and car players. It's not a problem with every track so I'm wondering whether the mixes were all done by the same person or this was done ad hoc to take advantage of the audiophile segment of Marks' fan base. The experience has been disappointing to say the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"Instantly Forgettable","review":"I have been a huge fan of Mark Knopfler and Dire Straits since the late 1970's and this, in my opinion, is perhaps the worst thing he has ever put out. The entire cd (with the exception of \\"Boom, Like That\\") is mellow to the point of it being boring, with no sign of Knopfler's signature guitar work. I bought this cd based on the Amazon review that said this was Knopfler's \\"most rocking album since his days in Dire Straits\\". What were they listening to? This is untrue and misleading. I would give anything for new material that even comes close to songs such as \\"Telegraph Road\\", \\"Tunnel Of Love\\", or even \\"Once Upon A Time In The West\\". Maybe Knopfler is just getting to old to really rock anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing! A horrible dud!","review":"Loved Dire Straits, I was very much looking forward to this album. Hate it, it plods and there's a dearth of interesting guitar work. The second-worse album in my entire collection! Bad enough to have kept me from buying any current original album for two years.If you're still interest in Mark Knopfler solo, try the Dire Strait/Mark Knopfler \\"Private Investigation\\" - the second of the two discs is all Mark Knopfler, and a lot more interesting than this dud, although I'm still not a fan. Better yet is the first disc - classic Dire Straits!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Letdown","review":"I really didn't pay much attention to Knopfler between his Dire Straits heyday and the 21st century. But I bought \\"Ragpicker's Dream\\" on a lark two years ago, and thought it was fabulous. There were four or five instantly memorable songs that just jumped off the CD. Sorry I can't say the same for this one. The pacing is slow, the writing is mediocre, and the guitar work doesn't make you go \\"wow.\\" Maybe Mark should wait a little longer than two years for the next album. This one is likely headed for oblivion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Le grand maestro est de retour !","review":"Un retour réussi pour l'ex-leader de dire straits.

I've been listening MK since very young and he is the best guitar musician of all times to me. It took me some time to discover the essence of every song and the concept of this amazing album.The best song for me is \\"Everybody Pays\\". By its music and great lyric, it reached to me very deep. Other hits to me are \\"5.15 A.M.\\", \\"The Trawlerman's Song\\", \\"Back to Tupelo\\" and \\"Our Shangri-La\\" of course, but every song is a masterpiece of music and have its own sense.This is a \\"must have\\" album for everybody who likes music, but you've got to give it some time to hear..."},{"rating":"1","title":"where is the lead guitar?","review":"The music of Mark Knopfler has always been most interesting for the lead guitar. More so than for almost any other musician, it has always almost seemed that he was doing a duet with his guitar, and often times the guitar tells as much of the story of the song as do the lyrics. But, sadly, that is for the most part missing from this album. Many of the songs on this album are \\"nice,\\" but (except for a few short passages) I get the sense that he is holding back with the lead guitar, and it is relegated to the supporting role of providing melody rather than the prominence of his most-loved songs. I just kept waiting for him to break out with his well-known guitar solos on so many songs, but they just did not come, and the listener is left feeling that something was missing. And without that lead guitar taking off, these are just a bunch of regular old songs without anything much special."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not His Best Or Worst","review":"I give \\"Shangri-La\\" four stars, because I believe there's no such thing as a bad collection of Knopfler music. However, I still believe that \\"Golden Heart\\" is the high mark by which I will always judge the rest of his work, and I doubt if he will ever hit that mark again. \\"Shangri-La\\" certainly displays the same songwriting genius that is evident on past Knopfler collections, but the lack of any real guitar solo work left me wanting a little bit more. As always, his lyrics almost force the listener to paint a vivid mental picture. This CD is no throwaway, for sure, but I'd like to hear Mark's guitar do a little more talking on the next collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"still going strong","review":"When I first listened to this cd, I was somewhat disappointed, especially given how much I have liked Ragpicker's Dream. But I think this music, and particularly the lyrics, take several listens to really appreciate. This is another really fine work by a great musician. He has certainly earned our respect over the years with consistently creative and meaningful artistic productions."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Amazing Album for the Intelligent Listener","review":"Mark Knopfler is not in Dire Straits anymore. Many people need to learn that first. This is a fantastic album with well-thoughtout melodies and amazing lyrics. The entire album seems to have a certain groove to it, that keeps you wanting more. It just seems to flow throughout the album, something that many albums today lack. This album shows Mark's vocal range more than any other he has created (including Dire Straits). Don't get me wrong, because I love listening to my old DS albums, but this cd shows how far Mark has really progressed. It is a cd you can keep playing over and over again, and not get bored."},{"rating":"2","title":"He's mellowed, but he still sounds as good as ever.","review":"In my personal belief i always thought mark knopfler was the best guitarist in the world with eric clapton being a close second. I've read that mark would always use his guitar to make it sound like it was singing for him and it sounded like he didn't want to sing until he got to sailing to philadelphia. Now with one album of experience down his second one is just building on how strong he can sing. I think \\"our shangri-la\\" is the best song on album. I don't understand \\"don't crash the ambulance\\" but it's got some funny lyrics."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE this CD - I play it over and over!","review":"I heard \\"Postcards from Paraguay\\" on the radio and just had to buy the CD. Of course, it's always a risk to buy a CD based on one song - chances are, you'll like that one song, and nothing else.In this case, I like the entire CD, with of course special preference for \\"Postcards\\" - when it comes up in the rotation, I listen to it twice! It just makes me want to dance!The overall CD feels mellow, but not such that it will put you to sleep. At times sly (\\"boom, like that\\"), at times funny (\\"sucker row\\"), it's also very sweet in places. \\"all that matters\\" is such a pretty love song: \\"my darling girl/my darling girl/you're all that matters/in this wicked world\\"....Technically, I would give the CD 4.5 stars, but of course that's not an option."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shangri-La","review":"Some great songs on here.

This guy could produce the all time best instrumental guitar album if he wanted to but instead we get this kind of junk.

I am a fan, Sailing to Philadelphia is still one of my favorite CD's and when I heard there was a sequel I of course wanted it.This isn't the sequel and it's not what I wanted. This is one of the most boring albums I have ever heard. If it weren't for the distinctive voice and guitar I wouldn't have believed it was Knopfler. What a disappointment.I tried, I really did. I listened to it three times but it's no use. It's times like this you really wish you could return music. You get a better idea of why some people steal it so often, at least you don't get ripped off!If you are a Knopfler fan stay away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"every mark knopfler cd without the straits needs to be 1 star","review":"without dire straits, mark knopfler doesn't do a very good job.he did 4 great songs without dire straits, they are imelda fromgolden heart, what it is from sailing to philadelphia, coyote from the ragpicker's dream, and boom like that from this albumshangri la. but people don't have to listen to your latest trickfor some reason because it is so god damn slow and the saxophoneis really terrible! haha! anyway, buy this album along with onevery street or making movies today because heavy fuel, skateawayand expresso love rock!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"vague noodling","review":"Knopfler has once again fallen far short of the promise inherent in those long ago days of Dire Straits. Perhaps he is attempting to be Mr. Atkins reincarnate, but if that is the case then he should buy the white shoes and move to Florida. Simply put, a terrible album with little to recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"All of this guy's stuff is great","review":"I of course love all the Dire Straits stuff, they were perfect for the time. Now that Mark Knopfler is doing his own stuff, he's free to do what he wants, play beautiful music and sing whatever he wants to sing about. Some of it is the most poignant music you'll ever here, some of it you wonder why he bothered. However the really great songs are worth hearing, and often. I'm afraid to miss one of his albums, because there are always songs that hit you in the gut, make you laugh or cry or both. Let's face it, the guy keeps getting better and better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low energy","review":"Sorry Mark, I'm a big fan of your guitar style, but this CD isoften boring, if not depressing. I can't understand the tone,it was recorded in California, the land of sun and fun. I hadtrouble getting through the bonus DVD: too serious and somber.Great musicians, but no sparks in the playing. Where is thejoyous sound of \\"Walk of life \\" or \\"Cannibals\\" ? Gone, it seems.Well, hope your next effort brings more joy. Until then, I willstick to \\"Golden heart\\", still your best."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best work of a genius","review":"Nothing to say except the title, knopfler is a musical genius and this one is his best solo work. A MUST HAVE!!!!!Dont expect large solos of acrobatic licks, because knopfler has nothing to prove to the world about his playing, he is the best and now is trying to bring us his own experinces from a new point of view.It is really difficult to an artist with such succes as a band to reinvent himself as a solo artist, and Mark has did it once and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb!","review":"I'm a big fan of Dire Straits, and have recently started listening to Mark Knopfler's albums. The Golden Heart album is as good if not better than any of Dire Straits' releases, although the music is of course somewhat more mellow than the rock bank. Shangri-La is the second of MK's albums that I've purchased and it ranks close to Golden Heart in pure listening pleasure. Needless to say, I'm sold on Knopfler. With 14 songs and over 60 minutes of great music you get a lot for your money. Postcards From Paraguay, 5:15 A.M., and The Trawlerman's Song are my favorites, but all 14 of the songs are good. As a songwriter, I think Knopfler is as good as Lennon/McCartney, Elton John, or Paul Simon, but like Dire Straits, he's underrated and unappreciated."},{"rating":"1","title":"The bezel isn't silver.","review":"The picture makes the bezel look silver and it's not.

However the next day after a full day of sun the LED light only came on for less than 1 hour. Being an electronic engineer I decided to troubleshoot the problem and discovered that one of the two solar cells was only putting out .5 volts. .5 volts is not enough voltage to charge a 1.5v battery.

However when viewing it at home, it's really a less than average underwater documentary. Right from the beginning line when Depp says \\"These are not visitors from an alien planet...\\", you can pretty much tell this is aimed at a very young audience. It tries to be 'cute' a little too often, and really doesn't present information in much detail. Not sure what to expect though when you're covering all aspects of the ocean in 41 minutes.It has nice cinematography and realistic colors, but nothing groundbreaking. I've seen better documentaries on discovery. This is only worth watching at IMAX."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Did This Come Up?","review":"well i recently bought this dvd thinking it would be imax 3d.... because i searched just plain old 3d in the searchbar and this was the third on the list... the problem with this is, amazon copied what deep sea 3d had on the summary for ImDb...

I know your supposed to sit while watching these, but I could not help standing 2 feet from the TV and feel like I was totally surrounded by the ocean life.

The footage is up to the usual breathtaking IMAX standards. Crytal clear and with vibrant colors even on the small 19 inch set I watched it on. If you've watched any number of undersea documentaries, you're probably already familiar with most of the sealife that is covered, but again it's the visuals that make this so breathtaking as well as the message that much of this life is being destroyed by man (as usual) and most be conserved. I highly recommend it. The only reason I rate the DVD with 4 stars rather than 5 is that it's not even an hour long and there are no bonus materials what so ever. But the 40 minutes are well worth the a rental."},{"rating":"1","title":"patronizing","review":"I watch a lot of nature documentaries and none have seemed so patronizing as this.

The film seemed short to me ,although well done. Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet do a good job narrating but in end is message to save our seas , which makes more a documentary than entertaining film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice photography, terrible commentary","review":"Absolutely cringeworthy commentary from Mr. Depp and (especially) Ms. Winslett. People who write this sort of thing ought to be taken out and shot for their own good. Poor music score too. The pikkies are nice, but not a patch on the BBC's magnificent \\"Blue Planet\\".

Its definitely a disc you bust out to show off the 3D capabilities. Some of the shots were beautiful and the depth of the 3D had me in awe. As for pop outs, not many, but I find them gimmicky anyways, I like the depth of 3D that really drags you into the film. As for the commentary, eh nothing great, not bad but not great either.

It was probably very entertaining and exhilarating in 3D. But, I'm sorry to say, it's very ordinary in 2D. There is nothing more annoying than watching a 3D movie in 2D. All the carefully staged 3D shots, pardon the pun, stick out like a sore thumb.And the narration, while performed by the two outstanding actors Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet, is completely one dimensional. Or should I say 1D? Not only is it dull, it's annoying. It sounds like they both read the narration for the entire film and the director, Howard Hall, had buttons for both of their recordings and randomly switched them on and off with no rhyme or reason. There were times, and I'm not exaggerating, when Depp would start a sentence and Winslet would finish it!And as for the title, \\"Deep Sea\\"? Not once did the film journey deeper than the coral reefs.There are a lot of excellent documentaries about the ocean to add to your library.

I am 52 years old, and found the music very appropriate for the film. The drug/alcohol abuse seen in the film was disturbing. The sexual acts - depending on what part of the film you want to speak of - go from one extreme to another.

Mr. Kent chose to totally disregard his friendship with Richard. I was so disgusted I donated the book to my local library. Adam is a whiner. The women in Kent's latest novels have the men wrapped around their little fingers. Geez! Where's the fabulous comraderie of the earlier novels, the triumphant battles and the agony of defeat?

This book might have about 25 pages of actual action at sea, along with 340 pages of emotional entanglements, social injustices, and general moaning.

It feels as if this movie was a college project made by 15-year-olds not buy adult professionals. The sex scenes were ridiculous, for example, how was one meant to have sex while having pants on?

I also was unable to input them manually as the field length was too small. I upgraded to 2007 (based on a customer service call) and it too cannot save long passwords, though you can input them manually now.

More frightening though is how much SLOWER the new interface (or at least the software) is. It can take over a minute to record one stock transaction, versus seconds before. I literally have to do other things and come back while the transaction finishes getting recorded.I don't have the latest and greatest computer, but it's a P4 with a Gb of memory running at 3Ghz, with tons of free space, so it's not a hardware issue (and it's the same hardware I was running the prior version - 2005 - on).

Per Quicken there is an easy conversion. This is not true. You have to download a conversion program and it does not successfully convert a money database. After spending three hours manually entering all of my data, I found this version of quicken slow and not easy to use. To Purchase stocks the software can not even compute the amount of shares given the purchase price and amount invested. All fields must be manually entered. Funds must be transfered into the softwares cash account even if a direct stock purchase is made, and then the second step of purchasing the stock has to be made. Even though the software has the latest stock price, you have to look up and manually enter it. I found the additional time and multiple steps to perform simple transactions are not worth the time.

HSBC now says the only way I can get the info is manually download from their site. Tonite, for some odd reason, I no longer have a password vault with passwords and pins for all my online accounts. In addition - the upgrade/hiccup seems to have deleted all my online payees that I will now have to manually reenter, since my last backup brings the data back, but not the payees.

What a rip-off. Quicken is forcing me to buy someing I don't want or need to replace something I alreay paid for two years ago. What kind of company stops supporting their product after two years just to increase their profits? This leaves a really bad taste in my mouth and I'm going to be looking for alternatives to this prodcut.

Plus, the software is full of tie-ins to Quicken's ancillary services that clutter the interface and feel like advertising on the inside of a fully-priced product. Customer support is perfunctory and poor. The interface is ugly and uninspired.

This is especially problematic because the software company is also aggressive about insisting that you send them ALL of your financial information as an \\"online backup.\\" Since they cannot be trusted with such basic information as name/address/phone/email they cannot be trusted to keep-secure more sensitive information. If a business will not respect customer privacy with regard to advertisements, how can one trust them to keep bank account numbers, credit card numbers, bank account passwords, etc,?

The improvements from year to year, usually minimal, aren't worth the money. The main reason to upgrade is to be able to continue to download. Intuit obviously realized this too as this function ceases to work after 2-3 product cycles. I think one has to view it as a subscription to a service and decide if it's worth $15 to $25 a year.

This new tactic, though, of forcing people to buy an upgrade whether they want it or not, trying to sound as though all the improvements made it necessary and that it's just too much trouble to go on \\"supporting\\" the older version, is pure bullying. I pay 6.95 a month to do my banking through Quicken and that should be enough. It's like, after you buy your car you get an email that your car isn't going to start next week unless you pay us.

I have a large Money file, so the \\"reports\\" in Money I was ordered to create took over 15 minutes to run. The individual transactions were imported properly, but the accounts were miscategorized. Auto-update from financial institutions could not be configured. The maddeningly slow paced chat direct from India suggested that I create new accounts and then copy and paste transactions from the imported accounts to the new ones. A manual first download was needed for each institution. The conversion instructions said I would have to reconcile every account over again. I estimted this would take me several hours, given the number of accounts and transactions. I returned the product. Despite the good reviews, Quicken could not be that much better than Money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quicken quickens its decline and death","review":"I've been using this program to track my spending and investment. I'm mostly interested in the investment tracking features. But after using Quicken for 3 years, I am more and more disappointed with it. It cannot even deliver the most basic math I need: how much my investment has grown, that is, my current account total (cash + stock + whaterver) minus all my cash deposits. Simple right? There isn't a thing in Quicken can give my that nuber. I have to go to my investment account, dig out the history, add up my cash deposits, and substract that from my total account value.How hard this can be? Don't they have some real programmers over there, not just incompetent managers and high-school drop outs? I wrote them several times about improving their products. Nothing really chnaged. Quicken, after so many years in the market, and an old group of audience, is dying quicker than I thought.

It has many problems and is very unstable. I cannot validate my datafile, and quicken intermittently displays blank screen and hangs at startup. I finally figured out that there is some bad interaction with Norton Conf. and un-installed it.Overall, I am not happy with Quicken and am seriously considering switching to MS Money for the first time in 15 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intuit forcing customers to bad choices","review":"From the Intuit Support Web site: \\"To continue using QIF, you must continue to use an older version of Quicken (2004 or earlier).

Intuit does not have a direct answer to fix this; it is a series of \\"try this & if that dosn't work try this\\", many of which are uninstalling & chaging existing printer drivers. All of that sound risky when my printers work fine for everything else I really don't want to \\"mess around with existing drivers\\".

I'm glad I did. Since Quicken is a mature product, I didn't expect earth shaking changes. It's the little things that make a difference. I like the fresher user interface with the new home page that shows projected cash flow. To me the home page didn't seem as busy as in prior versions. I like the improvements for scanning checks and receipts into the program. The register entry and buttons (enter, split, edit, attach) are displayed in a color that contrasts with the rest of the register, making it easier to see what I'm entering.

Someone should commence a class-action lawsuit for all of us who bought the product expecting it to continue working (i.e., to continue being able to download bank data, credit card data, etc. into Quicken) and who were subsequently surprised to learn that its fundamental features would be cut-off after a mere 3 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"A politician you can root for","review":"I was pleasantly surprised with my introduction to the Jimmy Flannery mystery series. Flannery is the type of mystery hero that is easily likeable. He's politically incorrect enough to say ain't and to embrace people from all walks of life, but he's got enough culture and smarts to outwit any foes who might cross him. The characters are well-rounded and Campbell uses snappy dialogue that makes his characters seem to jump right off the page. Campbell does a nice job of placing the reader in the city setting of Chicago. While shaping his mystery,Campbell gives you a real sense that you are right there in the middle of Chicago with all of its diversity of characters, ethnicity,and the down to the detail grime and dirt of politics Chicago style. Flannery may have started his career as a sewer inspector, but in this 11th installment one can see why he continues to rise in Chicago politics and why this mystery series is sure to serve multiple terms!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Creepy & Disturbing... and I mean that in a good way","review":"This is a wonderfully written book that does what really good fiction should do: it stays with you and makes you rethink its characters' motives and actions over and over.I write this in response to the reviews which call this book irresponsible and/or perverse and/or glorying in immoral behavior.

Icurse like a sailor and am tired of PC. I try to give everything its fair shake and try not to make snap judgements about things, especially literature, until I have all the facts. That being said, this book ended up thrown against my wall when I finished it. I felt violated, not only by the disgusting and horrible actions by the characters in the book, but by the book in general. I was generally unimpressed by the writing, the characters had little to no redeeming qualities. You can see this in the detailed descriptions of various sex acts, most of which are extraneous to the already muddled plot. What about that Bunker Man? How incidental was he? There is the question of whether or not he exists and is just a part of Rob's psyche. I don't know, and frankly I don't give a damn.

Iain Bank's \\"The Wasp Factory\\", Irvine Welsh's \\"Filth\\")who seems to have mastered the art of entering the head of a total psycho and writing about it all in a very unsensational offhand way so that the tension sneaks up on you. This is a very short and quick read, and I don't want to give anything away, but I'll just say that it's a pretty disturbing portrait of a man's decent into paranoia. BTW, there's lots of sex--much of it pretty unpleasant. Not everyone is going to like the ending, but I thought it was effective and the best resolution for all that preceded it. A good example of economic, yet evocative, writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Paper","review":"Painful to read (mentally, physically, and Psychologically), Bunker Man is one of those novels you keep reading in hopes it will get better only to have your hopes battered mercilessly. Rob's disregard for everyone, the students he is supposed to protect, and even for his own wife makes him a very unsympathetic character. You almost wish he would be institutionalized if not killed by Bunker Man, as the novel's cover sets you up for. Despite being the title character, Bunker Man is barely present in the novel. This is one of the most offensive novels I've ever read. It overflows with crudity that sinks the weak almost non exsistant plot. It seems at many times that MacLean doesn't care about any of his characters which I find lacks discernment. I fail to see how anyone could praise this fault ladden novel, yet alone publish it. If you could rate this book for what it deserves, I would rate it a black hole."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time.","review":"This was the most appaling piece of literature that I've ever read. Rob, the main character, is never presented as remotely likeable or sympathetic due to the terrible and unremorseful ways in which he acts. Ultimately, Rob hurts every other character in this book (especially the females) both physically and mentally. The worst part for me was that never once does the prose stop to consider the consequences of his actions on the rest of the characters. I realize that creating such a mentally ill character such as Rob so craftily may be viewed as a real literary feat on the author's part. On the other hand, I don't feel as if the plot and the repercussions of the character's actions were dealt with responsibly by McLean. It was a struggle to get through the entirity of this novel due to Mr. McLean's sadistic and misogynist imagination. I felt as if it all went from bad to worse. I would also give Bunker Man the negative star rating if it was an option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your hard-earned dollars for more worthwhile works.","review":"If you read for \\"entertainment\\", Bunker Man will leave you with a feeling of resentment at having blown the purchase price on a less-than satisfactory exercise in writing. Mr. McLean seems to have such a low command of his language that he cannot compose a paragraph without lacing it with profanity. His novel is sick in content and does little more than cheapen us as a society. Only purchase this book if you have a fascination with the behavior of perverts. My copy now resides in the trashbin.

This power pack works well with this train, and the lights in the cars only dim slightly as it slows down. The top speed is not super fast but if the train went much faster it might leave the tracks.

Maybe it's not the commercials that did it, but rather Dr. Seuss. After about the third page, this book switches from fish to other creatures. This really confused me. From the title, I expected the whole book to be about fish, and opposites, or at least different descriptors. But not only is it not just fish, after the third page, the whole thing falls apart.

Not only does this book help young children to learn colors and numbers but there is more meaning to this book if you read between the lines.

After a little over 6 months of pampered use, the autofocus on this lens just stopped working altogether for no apparent reason. Being the first Nikon product I have owned, I was not impressed. The image quality however was quite nice and very wide at 12mm. I never experienced any vignetting, but lots of flare when pointed anywhere near the sun. I got the auto focus fixed under warranty and ended up trading it in for a little over $500 dollars considered in EX+ condition. So I'm learning. I'm done wasting my money on overpriced equipment. Unless you are independently wealthy or get free gear from Nikon I would get a Tokina or Sigma instead. If anything good comes out of this, it is that I used this lens in trade toward a Mamiya RB67 body and back, which looks like is going to be a lot of fun :) enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Built","review":"I love Nikon lens but this one is a crack in Nikons armour!

I used it with my D80 and took several shots at with it over a weekend. The exposures were perfectly exposed,contrasty and saturated but simply NOT SHARP.

If you think you want this lens, carefully examine the return policy of the company you purchase it from, if it's not from Amazon. Some of the Amazon retail sellers have a restocking fee of 15%. At approximately $900, the restocking fee will cost you a hefty $135 plus shipping if you change your mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy as a clam","review":"I am building a lens collection for my Nikon D90.

It is fanciful to have a dashing type pirate descendant doing the \\"derring do\\" stuff,the plot is too predicatable and the characters so cliche. The reviewers listed on the book jacket include Clive Cussler and Nelson DeMille who I guess must be drinking buddies of Mr. Bell because they certainly didn't help him with his fiction writing!

We all have seen the characters and story line before. I find it hard to believe that the book was published and that the series is still around.Bell would have had a better series if he took the rich hero and have him battle financial crime.

The author hates government,hates the French and the Chinese, and has an overdevelopedsense of sadism.

Thehero is infallible, independently rich, and invariablyattractive to beautiful but dangerous women, which onlyadds to the dullness. There are much better books out there.It is a sign of trouble when the gushing inside-the-coverreviews are from Booklist, Library Journal, a few paid sources,and the Shreveport Onion-Harvester Monthly.

The first was \\"Hawke.\\" Perhaps I should have cut my losses. Bell's writing and research have improved but \\"Pirate\\" is still burdened with hollow characters and jarring implausibilities. In providing fast-paced action and a lively plot, Bell has sacrificed all else.Bell's target audience would seem to be 18-year-old military enlistees with time on their hands. As for myself, I cannot suspend disbelief long enough to enjoy a Bell novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow and Pale","review":"This book is a book written as a \\"formula\\" book.

Is this Science Fiction?Another case was when Jet was about to be set upon by a frothing at the mouth Doberman, Jet says release the dog. It turns out the dog was a long lost pet of hers named Blondi. Riigghtt!

With a wide assortment of interesting, complex characters and situations, this book is anything but dull. It spans several continents and jumps back and forth from various story-lines which are all clearly connected. There are twists and turns galore and the ending will not let you down!Ted Bell is an truly exceptional writer which is so refreshing in this genre where most authors tend to be creative yet not particualrly talented. The book is intelligent, the characters practically jump off the page and the diaglogues very well-written. I HIGHLY recommend this to everyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"My God this was horrible.

While the storyline was really good, the writing was not - there are too many attempts at \\"clever banter\\" along with details that contribute nothing to the plot. Additionally, some areas of the story are passed through very quickly while others go into long, unnecessary detail - I ended up jumping through several sections of pages without missing anything. I also did not care for the abrupt ending - I actually thought my Kindle download was missing pages.

There's potential there but it rarely lives up to the hype. I was amazed that Hawke let himself get so stupid over Jet in this novel. And I really couldn't understand why Jet would all of a sudden be in love with Hawke and willing to betray everything for him. There was no real development of that story. It felt like there were too many side plots in this novel - Ambrose falling in love? That was hooky. Hawke almost dying in that new plane? Really what was the point of that. I keep reading his books in hope of him finally getting it ALL right. So far it hasn't happened. So I'll probably wait until the next Hawke book hits my library instead of wasting money on it here."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a bit of a Potboiler","review":"If you enjoy a fast-paced adventure story and you're not critical about details, there's a good chance you'll enjoy this book.Bell has created a decent yarn with fairly interesting characters.

I like the spy/thriller genre, and I like the premise of France and China collaborating to counter the United States. But I can't stand it when an author doesn't even take the time to check his facts. If he had reviewed his manuscript with any number of 14 year old military buffs, he could have gotten some easy improvements. Not to nitpick, but Lear Jets can't land on aircraft carriers. The Navy doesn't fly CIA agents and their rich British friends around on prototype fighter planes. Harpoon missiles can't be launched from yachts. Etc, etc. None of these things is really central to the plot, so why didn't Ted Bell do just a little extra work to get things right? Laziness."},{"rating":"1","title":"james bond it ain't","review":"I know that Bell and James Patterson are friends and neighbors in Palm Beach, but still. If Patterson continues to praise fluff like this, he''l lose all credibility. Where does one begin? A laughable plot line, cartoon characters, and dialogue unfit for remedial English class. I especially enjoyed Bell's one black character, whom he so cleverly named Stokely. After a few lines of Stokely's dialogue, it seems pretty clear that the only black person Bell has ever spoken to is the guy who serves him mint juleps at the club. Bell's back cover bio tells us he used to be in advertising.

But then the book begins, you have a decision to make.. 'Do I keep reading or cut my losses?' This is by far one of the most poorly researched and unrealistic \\"thrillers\\" I have ever read. His editor should also be taken to task in allowing whole chapters to remain in the book which serve no purpose other than to raise his word count. (The now infamous F-35 carrier scene being exhibit A in the indictment) The miraculous outcomes at every turn give new depth to the term daux ex machina.

Now don't get me wrong, I like steamy love scenes as much as anyone. But not every single page! The characters: Rainek, along with his dragon Denith, and the witch Tiana are so busy having sex that the plot is seemingly forgotten. I found myself skipping through the sex scenes (which were numerous!) to get to the plot that really didn't happen until the last few pages of the book. The love scenes just seemed so superfluous and unnecessary for the most part. If they had been integrated more into the storyline, and the plot more developed and detailed, this would have been an excellent book. As it is the book is just a love fest with the story being secondary. Which is truly a shame because if it was written better this book would have been great. Unless you like constant love scenes with little to no plot, this book is not for you.

Most of all I missed having my scroll wheel in the middle. I have over the years become very accustomed to that feature and did not like the way this device works around this button. It was however sensitive with its tracking and felt comfortable except when I had to use it.

Mind you - that would be tough going! It's still a very good record and track 9 - Shir Ha'Keshet - is probably worth the album cost alone. (Although I'm not quite sure what Rodrigo would think about the use of his concerto melody...) I think that one of the problems with this CD is that it is not as holistic as the first.

Even if I find that I'm not intrested in her romance novels, when I am asked who is my favorite author, my answer will undoubtably be Julie Beard. The help and confidence that she offered me in this book were well worth the price. I'm not sure that I'll ever be an author, but if I fail it won't be due to anything that was lacking in her book.

The spirit does appear, but it becomes apparent to the one who brought the Ouija board that this is an evil spirit that is impersonating his spirit, and despite warnings not to use the board alone, a woman uses it alone, and becomes harassed by the evil spirit, his goal to possess her so he can walk the earth again.So, as a child I was exposed to many great horror movies of the 70's and 80's, and Witchboard was one of them. It always stuck out to me from all the other horror movies from that era. I couldn't really put my finger on it, but I always made a point of watching it when it was on TV. Now that I own Witchboard on DVD, I watch it all the time. If you're a fan of 80's horror movies, this is a must have movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Witchboard DVD","review":"When I received this very quickly in the mail and it was like new!

It is really a shame that his works are not more widely published, because his writing is on a par with Patrick O'Brian. What is more: Fullerton was in the Royal Navy during the Second World War, having served on both surface ships and submarines. He knows well what he writes.This particular work gives the reader a flavor of the dynamics of the naval war in the Mediterranean and a view of life in wartime Egypt during 1941. There's also romance and intrigue. So, if you're looking for a novel that has a richly textured plot, and is also fast-paced, look no further. \\"LOVE FOR AN ENEMY\\" is it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Smart, witty television from Paul Gross (again)","review":"Having Paul Gross write, produce and star in any production should be like having a licence to print money. I hope the reason he has not gone completely \\"Hollywood\\" is by choice and not lack of opportunities.This film is a riviting piece of work.

Best three hours I have spent in months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing purchase","review":"Item was purchased through Amazon from an outside provider (Kylakins). When watched, two thirds of the way through the movie the disc would not play any further. Discovered the disc was defective. I can return to Amazon for a refund, but not directly to the provider for a new copy. In order to reorder this movie, I would not be able to get it for the same price I had purchased in October(approx.. $23.00) but would now have to buy it for $39.99. I definitely do not want to pay this amount for any movie but would like to see how the movie ends. I will have to reconsider ordering items from Amazon, through a second party source in the future.

If you're familiar with Los Straitjackets, and their first album in particular, you'll find Viva! to be a more than worthy companion to that album. A very good selection of rock instrumentals, not one of them skippable. Like The Ventures, Los Straitjackets are on the books as a surf rock band, but they play around with so many different styles, that to simply call them a surf band isn't entirely accurate. If you happen to be new to this group, understand that along with some catchy surf tunes, you'll get songs that'll make you feel as though you're in your own spy flick or western. Making Viva! your first Straitjackets album is anything but a gamble."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Surf Guitar Band since the Ventures!","review":"The first time that I heard Los Straitjackets was at a live concert back in 1996, in Cleveland, Ohio (of all places). I was totally blown away! Great surf guitar music, and the band performed in Mexican wrestling masks. Their first album has more raw surf-guitar energy than this one, but the sounds on this \\"Viva\\" album are more sophisticated. My favorite song is the Lonely Apache. Try to imagine the Marlboro Man hanging ten on a surf board. Besides, if you love surf guitar and already have Los Straitjackets' first album, you'll just have to have this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"An old-fashioned thriller","review":"I might have titled this review location, location, location. Harry Black and the Delphi Conspiracy takes place in Egypt and in Newport Beach, California and the writer obviously knows these locations because he really makes you feel as though you're there. The harsh brutality of the middle east, where money, power and religious zeal mingle to make life unpredictable is portrayed in the context of rich descriptions of the locale. Simlarly, the opulence of upper-class Newport Beach is accurately portrayed, yet the desperate greed that underlies the lifestyle of the rich in Newport leads to the same kind of brutality that occurs in Egypt.McGraw's characters are well-drawn, the plot to hold the world at ransome, so to speak, is believable in the context of today's terrorism, and the end, with Harry coming up reunited with his daughter is satisfying and leaves me hoping for a sequel"},{"rating":"1","title":"Original or fake?","review":"A previous reviewer has described this as \\"quite simly the greatest concept album of all time\\"...and I agree. Unfortunately this is not that album it is simply a compilation of some of the tracks off the original album. Imagine my disappointment to discover Stanley Unwin's opening lines \\"Are you all sitting comftebole two square on your botties?\\" wiped from the album's opening ....given that this was a concept album this seems to me to be the ultimate in arrogance...as is placing an extra track (which is extremely mediocre) in the middle of the album. The original narrative weaves the songs together to provide a complete work of art so I don't think this album should be sold under the title of the original. This kind of artistic vandalism is akin to overpainting the Monalisa's smile!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best health book around!","review":"This easy to read book has got an amazing amount of very practical information. It's written in such a manner that you can easily find an ailment with it's corresponding therapeutic program (specific foods, supplements, herbs etc.) Dr. Airola also gives in my opinion the best lacto-vegetarian diet around. I've never been ill and feel great every single day since implementing this diet and his other health-boosting recommendations in my life. Bluntly said, this book covers everything you need to know to get healthy or get healing - the natural way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"I wish what this man says would really cure all the ailments he states despite the fact that there are some good suggestions that if one followed, would feel healthier. He mentions these clinics in Sweeden, and let's face it, are we really going to be able to afford them let alone if they still exist from the time this book was written. A friend swears by this man so I am going to give this book to him as he gave his copy away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor packaging","review":"Both Amazon and Riedel did a poor job in packaging these glasses, so two sets arrived with broken stems. Riedel merely wrapped the glasses in paper and stuffed them in a sauvignon blanc box. Amazon placed this poorly packed box into another box without adequate padding. They did this twice. Amazon declined to send a second replacement so I never had the pleasure of testing them out. I love my other Riedel stemware bought at brick-and-mortar stores."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book to introduce children to the joys of research.","review":"I think the best part of the book is that it shows children the fun and excitement of doing primate research in the wild. It shows why Alison Jolly hasreturned to the same piece of forest for the last30 years. It balances that by displaying some ofthe sorrowwhen you cannot help a dying animal.And of course, it describes Lemur catta social organizationat a level which should be entertaining to children,and mentions briefly some of the other lemurs foundin Berenty reserve.The book is nicely illustrated with photographs onevery page."},{"rating":"2","title":"TRACKS","review":"DISC 1:1.

I think I've used the snifter twice, usually when I ran out of the Hennessey glass, and then I gave it to people I don't like. The subtlety that this glass brings out of liquors is truly amazing, far from the straight-forward burn I associate with the snifter. I use it frequently for Armagnac, Cognac, and Calvados. I've even taken to using it with Tequila and single malt Scotches. It looks highly specialized (and is named after 1 brand of Cognac, which seems odd), but is actually extremely versatile, and will soon be one of your favorites.

This EP consists of two \\"suites\\" (the term \\"track\\" or, worse, \\"song\\" is definitely inapplicable), both of wich build up terribly slowly, so slowly that in fact after a while you'll end up wishing they adopted a faster pace but that, again, brings us back to the pretentiousness business. The instrumentals are wonderful, sometimes they have an epic flavour, other times they're both soothing and evoking. Well, needless to say, this is music that shouldn't be listened to before 8 PM, you wouldn't get in the mood otherwise... if you love ambient pop and post-rock you can't definitely miss this release (also try their latest effort) !P.S.

Although being only a half-hour in length, it shows great strength and great execution (especially on BBF3.) The build up sets the mood of the climax and is a picture of what is to come. The climax is my favorite part, first with the sweet drums and then going to the violin-swipes. You can almost imagine what is happening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Epic","review":"This album has two songs, one approx. 11 mins, the other is approx. 18 minutes.

Floyd?","review":"Must confess to disappointment; this sounded like a record I would like. Well, they have a great name, and the artwork on the CD is really cool. However, the music itself, while tastefully done, is surprisingly unremarkable. Just because this type of thing has been done before doesn't mean that makes it bad. What makes it bad is that it has been done better and more compellingly before. Pink Floyd, Mercury Rev, and to a degree the Flaming Lips have created much finer \\"orchestral\\" soundscapes. The antisocial rantings that float through the music grow very tiresome with repeated listenings, and do little to inspire any feeling whatsoever. I appreciate the attempt to make a statement about millennial paranoia/angst, but would like more than one statement per record, you know? Not worth the money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who cares?","review":"I am very disappointed by this record. It is incredibly boring! It is a lot like Mogwai, but doesn't engage your attention.

This music combines the pretentious attitude of Keith Jarrett with the musical inventiveness of The Backstreet Boys. You see, on this album the chords and melodies take a back-seat to volume fluctuation. Their music is extremely boring, and not because of my inability to listen to lengthy pieces of music, but for their inability to make those lengthy pieces of music interesting. Bands such as this think that they can create emotion and elevate bland, simple music to the level of greatness by adding distortion or lots of volume. They can't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fuse, benzene, sand and soap","review":"It's almost fitting that Godspeed You Black Emperor! should adorn their second record, Slow Riot For New Zero Kanada, with a sketch of an incendiary device. The record opens with the touchwood that is the reverberant guitars and strings at the beginning of Moya and builds, via their kindling and fuelled by the benzene of hopelessness and paranoia, to a mighty rage.There's precious little music that I find to be as awe-inspiring as this. It's sad, apocalyptic and overwhelmingly cathartic and, when played loud, can make me forget everything else."},{"rating":"2","title":"TOHOU WAVOHOU","review":"Just in case any body was wondering the writing on the front is Hebrew and says TOHOU WAVOHOU which means \\"empty and desolate\\" or in King James english \\"without form and void\\". Its from the creation account in Genesis. I knew a biblical hebrew class would pay off in the end.But as far as the music goes I really like it. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the spoken dialogues in the background on the second track. Their (the dialogue's)artistic value is great but after hearing them a few times I got tired and wished I could just listen to the music which is wonderful and always keeps my attention the whole way through, which says a lot because sometimes I get anxious with good short songs and skip tracks after a couple minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tune Transfer","review":"Product shipped would not even install on an Intel Mac Pro.

If there is one drawback to this ferocious disc is the production. It severely weakens the disc in overall power, but the band manages to rise above it with their sheer rage and destructive velocity. \\"Toxic Trace\\", \\"Behind The Mirror\\", \\"One Of US\\" and the moshpit classic \\"As The World Burns\\", obliterate with riff after riff of blazing ferocity.

If you like the new Kreator material the band has recently been putting out and don't have this one yet, you DON'T know what you are missing: This IS Kreator!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OK if you like poor modem connect speeds","review":"Xircom modems seem to be reliable but have poor modem performance. It's not unusual for the modem side of a Xircom Combo to refuse to connect above 28.8kbs, even after all updated drivers and Firmware have been installed. I would avoid Xircoms if you are buying it for dial-up use, especially if you want to use it for dial-up use while traveling. There are better products available for less money."},{"rating":"1","title":"P.U.","review":"This is a terrible CD.....PU.

Their school had instructed them to buy this book, so we began by using it as a reference and workbook. We quickly discovered that the book was filled with poorly written exercises, obviously wrong answers, and systematic labeling errors. Please do not buy this book! It is so badly written that it may actually do more harm than good, and the authors should be ashamed of foisting such a flawed work on unsuspecting students. If you're going to take the COOP, there is a perfectly serviceable book, published by ARCO, that we found to be a much better resource."},{"rating":"1","title":"Careless mistakes frustrate the reader!","review":"This book might give you good practice on high school entrance exams, but the careless mistakes make it frustrating to get through even one subtest! They don't even know their alphabet! This is the first book I have seen which has a language test with the options (A), (B), (D), and (D)! It is an outrage to know how poorly this book has been put together.

It's refreshing to find a book where someone doesn't show you a (poor) form with 2 basic applications and claim to the the God of Tai Chi.If you really want something to sink your teeth into, hit the tai chi classics.PS- The best laugh in the pages of the book are the pics of Yang Chen Fu in \\"action\\". For a master, he had sloppy form."},{"rating":"2","title":"Annie, you go, girl!","review":"Annie has always been my favorite character in the CIRCLE OF THREE SERIES. In this book she gets her chance to shine, even if she does get into some trouble along the way. Her transformation from mousy bookworm to femme fatale is hysterical. I especially love how she shows up Sherrie, surely the nastiest literary bad girl ever. Isobel Bird must have been in a good mood when she penned this one, because it's really funny while still being filled with lots of good info about Wicca. It's good to see her let loose, especially since book 6 (IN THE DREAMING) was so serious. The wedding scene alone is worth reading the whole book for. This series just gets better and better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolute Gem","review":"I have the shorter 1926 edition,(334 pg) it bears the name of a long ago student (Annie Denison) on inside cover boardI am presently reviewing old math principals I learned a long time ago, and when I opened this book which I got as part of a lot from an ebay seller, I was amazed at the clarity and wonderful examples given for a student. The chapter end exercises are challenging and I wonder why they constantly revise and reinvent the wheel each year with new books on an old subject. The book is perfection and a classic in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWSOME DEBUT","review":"I bought this disc new in \\"02\\" & have been dying for a follow up disc ever since. if you like rockin' blues guitar, this is for you, every song is a jamm fest.

They had fun bathing the pets and catching the fish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sends the wrong message","review":"Unfortunately my niece has one of the Barbie Sweet Sounds Pet Shops, and I would advise against purchasing one for your child. As someone who has worked for an animal shelter, I know first hand how bad real pet shops can be. A majority of the animals are raised in horrible conditions such as puppies born in puppy mills. Pet shops also cater to impulse buyers who have not fully thought through the long-term responsibility of having a pet. Those pets are often surrendered to animal shelters. I think this toy sends the wrong message to kids. Mattel should make a \\"Barbie adopts from a shelter\\" toy instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Resource and Service Manual","review":"I had this for my 1999 Volkswagen GTI.

Don't expect to be able to service your own car with this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soap Opera Quality, Low Production values","review":"After watching Downton Abbey, I was looking for another period piece from the UK. This one disappoints.The premise is a good one, and the first few episodes fine--although production quality is not very good. (somewhat grainy and washed out)As the series progresses, the travails become increasingly melodramatic and unreal. One particular story line involving a baby goes beyond stretching your imagination....On the positive side, it is good to see English society....although the \\"upstairs\\" folks are routinely portrayed as weak, without morals and in some cases, extremely cruel.Overall, I give it a 2 for the beginning episodes that showed young girls coming to London as Nannys. As it progresses, it becomes a soap opera in all senses of the word--overly dramatic with constantly escalating situations, characterizations that are black and white and almost comic, and resolutions that are too pat. By the end, I was glad it was over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smashing!","review":"Fantastic series. Well worth watching. If you don't want to buy, Netflix has the series for rent.I will say that I felt the last episode was a rushed one trying to tie up all loose ends and finish the girl's stories. It almost seemed as if the writers were thinking they were going to do Season 2, and then were told at the last minute they had to wrap it up.I suppose since this is over 10 years old there is no hope for Season 2, but I sure wish there were. Great acting, interesting plots, hooks you in and you care about the characters. Highly recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent series","review":"Berkeley Square is one of the best series I have ever seen.

This one has it all - drama, suspense, & romance. It also satisfies our need to see justice served which doesn't always happen.The basic plot revolves around the lives of the residents of the prestigious Berkeley Square especially the you ladies who work as governesses. The story skillfully weaves together the lives of the 3 main characters who are unknown to each other in the beginning but become intertwined by the end.If you enjoy the class wars of Victorian England, this movie is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"That's All Folks","review":"Thanks for the reviews, I'm glad some of you enjoyed it.

Bought this as a Christmas present for my mother who loves English entertainment. Shipment arrived when expected and was properly packaged. Great price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story","review":"This is a great story if you don't mind it not having an ending. It comes to a screeching halt and you are left with a feeling of having missed something. You keep looking around trying to find out where the rest of the movie is. You just know there is another disc that you overlooked. It's like a 3 act play where the cast never bothered to put on the 3rd act. It would be rated 5 stars if not for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent miniseries but incomplete ending","review":"I am a fan of all the BBC period pieces and in particular this one was engrossing but it lacked in an appropriate ending. The three nannies' stories are equally interesting and in general the entire cast's performance is superb, but the series left too many loose ends. I cannot understand why this series was not continued. Overall I definetely would recommend it to all viewers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why did it stop???????!!!!!!!!!","review":"I bought this dvd sight unseen after reading so many great reviews and I am not sorry that I did. It is a wonderful mini-series! I enjoyed the story and the characters. All very catchy. What I don't understand is why it stopped! I want to know more! Is Matty pregnant???? What of Lydia and Hannah? And Jack, does he get a girl? I enjoyed it so much that I sat there for the whole 8 1/2 hours (excluding the 5 minute breaks here and there) to watch the entire series! I couldn't stop. I wanted to know more and now I am stuck still wanting to know more.This is a very good movie with likeable and attractive characters, good story lines and believable events! I highly encourage anyone who likes perdiod mini-series films to watch this one. It is more like a t.v. mini-series than a movie type of mini-series though so be prepared to take it slow throughout and want more at the end!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"Having seen a great deal from the BBC made available on video, this is one of the best! The stories of three British families and their respective staffs are magically interwoven - in fact, there are remarkably smooth transitions as these tales unfold piece-by-piece in each of the houses. You'll find good insight into British attitudes about their own class system and social behavior of the early 20th century. It's refreshing to see an American wife in one house: her \\"Yankee\\" frankness and outspokenness adds a nice twist to the otherwise very British cast of characters. This is a wonderful dramatic series, which leaves you wishing for more stories like it. The costumes, the props, the settings and scenery, the pace of and variety of plot within each the stories themselves, AND the acting all add up to make this truly one of the best I've seen. I agree - this one is NOT to be missed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Berkeley Square","review":"If you enjoy British television productions this will be a good addition to your library.

Regretfully, and after a good start, the plot in the series becomes so painfully ridiculous that you just can't overlook it. The acting and sets are so-so, obviously due to a lack of budget, but what is especially annoying is the poor lighting. It looks like scenes were shot quickly with \\"run and gun\\" sun lamps, like the cheap-o American horror movies of the 1950s.I won't give away plot details, other than to say Hannah's remarkable action in the middle of the series is so implausible that any reasonable viewer will lose that \\"suspension of disbelief\\" that fiction relies on.Great idea, just poor executed, and mostly in need of a good story editor. The actors who played Ned, Ned's mother, and Nanny Collins were the few bright spots."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just BRILLIANT","review":"Loved every minute of this DVD.

I watched this whole thing and then had to make assumptions as to the end of every storyline. What crazy person would put so much time and money into making such a series and not create an ending???

I watched it over one weekend (couldn't wait for each installment), and then watched it again at a more leisurely pace over the following week. The second watch revealed small details I had missed the first time around, the hallmark of a good series.The characters are those whom you really come to care for. I was sad to see the series end ... wanted to know what happened in their lives next.Get this series. It's worth twice the price. You will laugh and cry and wish it could continue on as I did. Good family viewing as well. I look forward to sharing it with my 14 year old niece this coming summer.Thanks to Berkeley Square, I have now accumulated quite a library of BBC DVDs. Many, many hours of very pleasurable viewing thus far and to look forward to in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"I've enjoyed watching this many times--my daughters have enjoyed it as well. Although not suitable for younger children, I feel that it is appropriate for 12 and older. Yes, it contains adultery and an out of wedlock birth, but this is done in such a way to show how both of these choices lead to heartache and a hard life. The only situation that didn't quite ring true was the resolution of Ned's crime. This film is very good at portraying the interweaving of the the lives of many characters. All are imperfect, many very unlikable, but just as many to love. I definitely thinks it's one to own and share."},{"rating":"2","title":"TOP-NOTCH PERIOD DRAMA","review":"I own about 40 period dramas on DVD,and this is one of the top 5 in my opinion.My top 5 favorites (not in any order) are:Berkeley Square (1998 BBC, 8+ hrs)Our Mutual Friend (1998 BBC, 6 hrs)Pride and Prejudice (1995 BBC-A&E;, 5 hrs)Sense and Sensibility (1995 Columbia, 2+ hrs)North and South (2004 BBC, 4 hrs)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"My only wish would be ....that this wonderful series would be continued for several more seasons!

It is totally engaging and I wish there were a second series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Berkeley Square DVD","review":"I paid $26.99 for this DVD. I feel when I pay that much for a DVD, I expect to receive a quality DVD. This was unbelievable. It was so grainy, it was hard toview.

I buy a lot of DVD's (and other items from Amazon) andhave never felt like I had wasted my money like I feel on this one. I did call and the person I spoke with apologized and sent me another one. Imagine howsurprised I was to see that it had no better quality than the first one.

Everything about it is perfect, EXCEPT that the ball pops right out of the top every time you drop it or even if it just gets turned over while moving (in a laptop case for example).

This is the second one that I've owned. I still use my first one at work and it's at least 4 or 5 years old and still working fine. I just have to pop the wheel out and wipe it off a little more frequently than when it was newer (probably due to eating lunch at my desk more often, gotta use those napkins).I'm using the new one in the home and it is working fine. Much, much better than a mouse in my opinion. The cursor stays put if you take your hand off the device and the wheel feels more precise in it's movements than a mouse. It's very comfortable to use. Try it, you'll like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing Better on the Market!","review":"Bought this mouse at least 9 years ago on a friend's recommendation to releave wrist pain.

I've been using it for a few weeks with no major issues. My thumb is still not as precise with moving the cursor around the screen, but I imagine my control will improve with time. One small thing I don't like is that since the two buttons and wheel are relatively close together on a slanted surface, my fingers bump into each other when I use the wheel. On a normal ambidextrous mouse, the fingers are well separated and the wheel is clearly in the middle with plenty of room. I can't really say this is a design flaw, since the surface of the mouse if very ergonomic, but it might take some use getting to. Overall, I'm happy with my purchase. It is easier to move the cursor over large distances with the flick of a thumb."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good trackball but not for carpal tunnel","review":"The trackball needed to be lubricated and then it worked great. This trackball did not help my carpal tunnel syndrome as I hoped. I found a problem with Logitech's driver for OS X 10.4.8 in my Core Duo Mac. The trackball's scroll up button didn't work when I reached the bottom of an HTML message in Apple Mail, similar to the up arrow on theApple USB Keyboard - Whitewhich has never worked there in Mail either. With the 10.4.9 update, the keyboard's up arrow still won't work there, but the mouse will scroll up. I used anApple Mighty Mousefor a year before buying this trackball. It scrolled up OK in Mail but it didn't help my carpal tunnel either. Instead of this trackball, I just stopped using a Logitech Marble Mouse with my left hand. It's given me the same symptoms so I'm back with limited right hand use of a Mighty Mouse, trying to use more of Mac OS X keyboard shortcuts and the Universal Access mouse keys feature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"Easy to use, good for my hand.

Only One Minor Flaw","review":"As you progress through the learning curve and re-coordinate your reflexes, the TrackMan Wheel becomes very ergonomically friendly to use. The ball movement is extremely smooth. If the \\"Web Wheel\\" menu option is selected, a convenient navigation dial is displayed when the scroll wheel is depressed. The response to rapid scroll wheel movements is normal, but the response to paused 1-click movements is sporadic. The most recent driver download, selecting different menu options, and trying both USB and PS/2 port connections failed to correct this very minor flaw. A full one second pause between 1-click wheel movements is required for a uniform response.12-24-02 Update: A recent download from the Logitech website (9.75 build 302) has eliminated the 1-click scroll wheel hesitation with Windows XP.

I bought this one as a replacement due to similar ergonomics. What a relief to use a silky smooth ball instead of that moon rock from Microsoft. I would rate it five stars if it were a little larger and had a button for fwd and one for back. As it is, the scroll wheel can be set to activate the \\"back\\" command, but I would like an instant \\"forward\\" command like the MS had. That would cause me to give it all five stars.

It shows a silver trackball, but when I got it in the mail it was gray and red (not quite as cool looking). The trackball is way too small to be a comfortable fit for a grown up male. I guess less plastic makes it more cost effective (cheap). Anyway, it needs a complete redesign.

My wife wanted to try a trackball and I had always been curious.I liked it at first but I found I had trouble clicking on buttons. When I would push the primary button I would almost always pull my thumb over at the same time and roll the cursor off the button.Then I started noticing the little 'hitches' in the ball movement--especially when moving to the left. Those hitches became more and more obvious, until it became almost a constant drag. Eventually, the ball became too difficult to move without strain.I ended up hating this mouse and now I love my new Microsoft Explorer Mouse.Add to that Logitech's almost non-existent support and you have my review."},{"rating":"1","title":"It will not work for small hands","review":"This mouse is simply too big to work properly for smaller hands.If you are a woman and have small hands, don't wast your money.

Despite using the same ball and mounting scheme, they decided that they could make this new version without a ring to remove the ball for cleaning. I loved my old Trackman, even though I had to clean it every few days; I keep my hands clean, but I used it an awful lot. Less than a week after I bought two of these new Trackmans--one for home and one for office--I've had to tear them open to clean them to restore the ball action to a smoother out-of-the-box feel. Another problem is that the mouse wheel and right button are badly placed and do not correspond to normal 3 button mouse finger placement like the original did. Finally, a lesser issue of taste is that the mouse wheel roll is too discrete. It's nice that it's not completely smooth and featureless, but there's a little too much resistance/feedback."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best all around Trackball ever, used to sell for $25, WTF ???","review":"This is the best, most comfortable mouse for regular Desktop & Laptop users, gamers may want something with more featuresI don't know what happened but the last time I bought one of these it was $28 NEW, the price now seems outrageous at over $100for that price you can do better IMHO.I've had 3 of these and they all lasted over 3+ years of heavy duty daily use & still worked OK but the socket gets a bit loose after years of use which is no problem for most normal users.I don't like wireless mice or keyboards, they all have a slight delay & the charging is a pain.Stig.

If you have a big hand, you might find this a bit smallish, but I have a small hand and it fits me perfectly. It has been super easy to clean and care for, and never given me any trouble at all. I had to go to the Logitech website and download the driver file to work with Windows 7, as the file that comes on the CD is an older version, but the site is very user-friendly and I had no trouble finding what I needed and downloading it.

The problem is, I play a game that I need to press the right mouse button down a lot of the time.

After a month, there is no spring in the right button and my right button commands \\"stick\\". At $30 minimum, this is a horrible value for me. Yet it's the best trackball I can find.

It is much easier to use!!!This product in particular is very good. Works perfectly right out of the box and even though you can install additional software for it (a driver), it is no required as works well with the windows generic one.The only 2 cons are:- You'll need to clean the lens every now and then cause the dust acumulates inside.- Although the picture shows the ball in grey, it comes in red."},{"rating":"2","title":"Typin' Wheelies w/Logitech Trackman","review":"Nice resting feel for the hand, but the BEST thing about the Logitech Trackman is the smoooooth roll of the wheel -- makes computer work a real pleasure.

I have a Trackman Marble+ (with a scroll wheel) at work, and I love it. The one I have at home does not have a scroll wheel, so I thought it was finally time to upgrade.Unfortunately, this next generation of Logitech's ingenious thumb-operated trackball does not live up to the promise of its predecessor. They have made it both taller and narrower, neither of which are positive changes for people with anything but the smallest hands. And in an effort to keep up with the foolish decisions coming from Microsoft, they chose to provide translucent windows around the ball itself, allowing the red laser light to escape and light up the entire room.Overall, I cannot recommend this device. I do however strongly recommend the earlier rendition, if you can find one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Of Mice and Trackballs the best is TrackMan","review":"This is the best trackball I have ever found. I buy one for each computer, a spare to keep with my laoptop and an extra just in case. It is that important to keep them available. The thumb ball gives you super control and I mean micro fine control over the cursor. I use it for photoshop work all the time. I have many friends that also swear it is the best trackball and none of us like going back to a mouse when using other computers. With this trackball you never feel like it is clunky, you never run off the edge of a mousepad. I have had one for 5 years, I open it up and clean out the gunk just so I can keep using it.

So I assumed that Logitech's newest optical trackball would be a sure-fire solution. It was not. I set up the software and set all of the options (I know how to do this) and fine-tuned them again and again. The result was totally unacceptable. This trackball is so inaccurate that even when expanding graphics to 200% it is almost impossible to click on a single pixel."},{"rating":"1","title":"A total design failure","review":"The ergonomics of this trackball are just plain awful.

It failed slightly after the two year mark because right where it plugs in at is not re-enforced at the connector and tends develop a open in the wiring where it flexes often. This is a poor design feature by Logitech. You can find \\"refurbished\\" ones identical to this one all over the internet because they all develop this problem due to faulty cable. I do not know if Logitech ever fixed this problem or not. It involving replacing the defective cable from the plug leading into the mouse. I did this to mine and it is back working as it originally did new. Logitech had to know this was a problem and yet mass produced and sold these, shame on them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good mouse BUT . . .","review":"I have bough serveral of these mice. The are good mice with accurate movement and everything one could ask for . .. except once extremely important problem: if the ball pops out of the socket, the slightest impact against another object produces a small scratch or dent in the ball. I ask you . . . even though a mouse is supposed to stay on a desk how many times does it fall to the floor buy accident. Well, with this mouse one time is enough to render it almost unusable.This small scratch or dent in the ball catches against the three plastic guides in the socket producing a small hitch to the movement to an incredibly annoying freeze of the ball moving anywhere.Small as this may sound, even one dent in the ball will catch dozens of times and hour if you move the ball a lot as in during game play or heavy editing of a text.Despite the advantages I love in this type of mouse I will never buy it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"The second best trackball","review":"This mouse is very durable, comfortable and easy to clean.

Man, I love it. It works so well, and it's so easy to clean (you just pull the ball out and clean the little wheels and such). It feels very comfortable in my hand. It's thanks to this that I'm now a bit clumsier with a regular mouse (I'm not good enough with the trackball for FPS games and I'm definitely no good with a regular mouse anymore) since I don't use a regular mouse anymore if I don't have to.I'd definitely recommend this for trackball lovers or for anyone that wants to try it for the first time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Logitech Trackman","review":"I really like this trackball and wheel product.

My hand no longer hurts when using the trackball, but it does as soon as I go back to a traditional mouse, which I use at home. I just bought the trackman yesterday for home use, but did have to search all over before I found a store that sold them (BestBuy).

It's easy to learn how to manipulate the ball, easy to clean it. I'll never go back to a traditional mouse."},{"rating":"2","title":"First time track ball user","review":"I love the track ball. Easy to use, fast to get use to. I used to for my first year in college for 2 reasons. I didn't have a lot of desk space or a mouse pad and I had a drafting class. This was the perfect solution for me. It is perfect to make percise clicks without worring about the pointer moving. I also used the track ball in the car and played games and took it to coffee shops. Works perfect on a bed too or any suface that is pretty much impossible for a regular mouse. I've had mine now for almost a year and the only think that I do maintence on it is to take the ball out and clean the 3 little balls of like the old days with the old mouse that had the ball on the bottom and the reals inside got dirty. Another con is that it doesn't have a lot of buttons which would make it perfect if it had like 2 more for online game play and regular browsing for like a refresh button and back."},{"rating":"2","title":"love this mouse!!!","review":"I replaced my old standard mouse with this one, and boy is it worth every penny. Makes running windows so much easier. The mouse worked perfectly after plugging it in; no problems whatsoever. Now, whenever I am on the computer, I find the experience so much more enjoyable, and I am still running win2000.I also think I will save a trip and a lot of dollars I don't have going to the orthopedist because of mouse related injuries to my wrist.This is a great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best \\"mouse\\"... ever","review":"I have to say that I have been using this product (and it's previous version) for 15 years now. Starting as a student with a messy desk, and now a professional with a messy desk, it is great not having to make room for a mouse. Being in an office for most of the day and playing computer games at night I have had no problems with wrist or arm pains. I have had to buy a few of these over the years because the buttons stick or stop working, but I think that that is normal for mice. When they do I just go down to a local store or order one online.The only drawback I see with these is that logitech hasn't updated it in years. The standard these days with gaming mice is to have more buttons for gameplay options. I have 2 fingers that could click buttons to the right of the normal mice buttons."},{"rating":"2","title":"hardy & comfortable tool","review":"There's no doubt that this is the best mouse I've ever used! I especially like the design of letting thumb handle all the moves, instead of moving the whole mouse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"This is my third one of these. I purchased the first nearly 15 years ago. I love them, others hate them. Great if you have limited space to work with (or space unsuitable for a mouse - like glass, bumpy surface, etc).For the most part I have no real issues using the product. From time to time I need to do precise graphics work. Too much of this very fine control and my thumb can start to ache.The internals do get dirty and need periodic cleaning. The old models (like old mice) had wheels that got very dirty. This product is simpler, so less places for the dirt to hid and easier to clean. If you use handcream, or eat while working, then be prepared to clean more often.Full disclosure: I replaced the first of these because it had an old connector that was incompatible with the new computer I had purchased. I replaced the second because it got lost in a big move. So I may be on my third, but that is not due to a defect or due to the product wearing out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the energizer bunny","review":"My wrist absolutely loves me for switching from a traditional mouse to a Logitech Trackman. I switched almost a decade ago to reduce wrist strain; it did the job.

I feel that with a better quality button or a different buttn design, the device(s) would last much, much longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trackball a good, but not thumb trackballs","review":"I've been using trackballs for decades now, but this was my first thumb activated trackball.

However, I am very sad to say that this mouse \\"died\\" after 7 months. It is a bit too pricey to be so \\"disposable.\\" Terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trackball too light, does not roll smoothly","review":"I am kind of disappointed with this product considering the great reviews I read before purchasing it. I had a Logitech stationary trackball mouse in 2001 that I loved but this one is no where nearly as good. Another reviewer mentions that the weight of the trackballs have been a lot lighter in the recent models. That is exactly what is wrong with this product. When you roll the ball with your thumb it tends to bounce around within its socket instead of rolling smoothly. The older trackball mouse I had was very smooth and had a much heavier ball.I am a web designer and like to work quickly so adapting to this mouse hasn't been easy. But I am getting used to it so it isn't horrible. It helps with wrist pain and is functional but it definitely is not a 4 or 5 star product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Veyry nice mouse !!!","review":"I already owned a Logitech Optical Ball / Wheel mouse but it was the other type of mouse that had the roller ball sitting in the middle on the top of the mouse. This mouse is great but I am still trying to get used to the right side function button. I really like the position of the roller ball on this mouse and I was able to get used to just using my thumb on the Optical Ball. I do some CAD Drafting so it takes some time getting used to this design. Excellent product."},{"rating":"2","title":"WTF?","review":"I bought my Logitech trackball back around 1995 for $40. Meanwhile, I see the wireless version of this device is $40 So why is this $249???The buttons on my original are finally wearing out after 17 years of use. I need a replacement, but c'mon. In the wireless version the radio, dongle, and components to make it accept batteries all increase production cost beyond this wired version. Yet the wired is $200 more?I'll give you $24.90 for this. That's right - the price of this thing is an ORDER OF MAGNITUDE too expensive. Jumping Jesus on a pogo stick I've never been more surprised or offended by what is very clearly gouging. I mean seriously, even the sensors in this thing don't hold a candle in resolution to something like a Razer mouse and it's only $80 bucks. So what makes this worth the price you're asking? I seriously want to know!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A work horse","review":"I originally purchased a Logitech track ball for work (the model is no longer made) years ago when I started to get pains in my hand using a conventional mouse. The pains went away almost immediately and I've been hooked on track balls ever since. When my original finally died a while back, I bought this model and it has been just as good, but much easier to clean. Circumstances have me working from home a lot more, so I bought this model for my home office as well. It's especially useful at home where I don't really have room for a mouse pad and a roaming mouse. The Trackman sits in one place. I also use my computer to switch between Windows XP and Kubuntu Linux. The Trackman is recognized automatically by both operating systems. It's flexible (you can use it with either a USB port or PS/2 port), it's reliable, it's durable, it's easy to clean, and much better for your hand than a conventional mouse."},{"rating":"1","title":"trackman wheel optical","review":"was easy to set up but doesn't work properly keeps freezing up when trying to move the cursor around and have to wait a long time for it to start working again or shake the whole mouse.

The \\"old\\" size was a perfect fit for the hand, but the new size is just too small. My hand cramps up after about an hour of use; I would actually rather use a mouse than this little thing. Also, the trackball does not appear to be removable for cleaning as the white one was (and it needs it about once a week).

It cuts down on wrist strain and tendonitis that can often occur for me with heavy computer use. I am a designer working many hours on the computer and have bought several of these over the years to have one ready at each work station that I may use.

Maybe about a week but afterwards once you get the settings to where you like it is pretty easy to use. My biggest problem is training my hand to relax on the side of the trackball instead of holding it like your normal mouse on top.It is not as precise as the trackman marble mouse, I guess because the ball is bigger. And the first couple of tries on the trackman wheel your thumb starts to get tired.

Go figure. It was the only trackball they had. It was to replace my beloved Logitech Trackman Marble Mouse - the one with the ball in the middle in which you use your index finger to rotate the ball, not your thumb, like this one.While I've always thought the thumb quite an anatomical achievement in human evolution, it still does not have the steadiness and dexterity of the index finger and therein lied the frustration and inability to control the mouse's direction on the page in the effortless way I was able to when using my index finger. I felt like I had nervous disorder when using this mouse as it does not have the accurate movability for me when using my thumb.I know this mouse got great reviews, that's why it was purchased. But it turned out to be ergonomically inferior to my previous trackball.

I give this record 2 stars in total.1 star for the title, cover art, layout, production and the band's attempt with\\" Babylon Fell \\".The second star is given for \\" Inner Sanctum \\", the only song on this album worth the actual time spent recording its entirety."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beginning of the end of Celtic Frost","review":"This is the album where Celtic Frost began to get \\"experimental\\". By \\"experimental\\", I mean they began to incorporate classical instruments, opera, and worst of all incessant whining, crying and blubbering instead of vocals. The lame experimental electronica and hip hop beats don't help elevate this album either. The fact that the previous two albums were metal masterpieces is what really makes this \\"experimentation\\" a real shame. Not only is this album boring and pretencious but its also REALLY REALLY ANNOYING to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"About time too.","review":"I read up on these cartoons at college several years ago and this is the first time I've been able to get to see them - it's fascinating to watch these as examples of the best and most popular cartoons of their time, in the years immediately before Mickey Mouse - primitive as they appear now, this only serves to highlight the impact that Disney's work must have had soon after these cartoons were made. They're still witty and entertaining in their own right, predating the insidious idea that cartoons are a kids' medium, but it goes without saying that they should not be judged by today's technical standards. The few minutes of film of Otto Messmer in his later years is a nice extra, but a page or two of text on the historical background, either on-screen or in a leaflet, might have been a good idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for Extreme Felix Historians Only","review":"This DVD has attractive packaging, well designed menus and good background on the animations....BUT viewing the shorts is difficult. They are mostly grainy, dark in contrast, and some are so damaged they are painful to watch. There has been no attempt to restore these films on any level and the prints are as rough as I have seen in ANY silent era film on DVD currently available. The music score makes no attempt to compliment the action, but it's just honkytonk piano playing random songs in the background. I give this DVD 1 star for content and historic value, but for viewing enjoyment, its a dud."},{"rating":"2","title":"Felix the Cat - Felix!","review":"Great stuff! Felix the cat is of course classic animation at it's best.Crazy stuff that has obviously been a big influence on the animation that came later... and still influences. This DVD is great news for any animation lover, although they could have thrown in a few extras."},{"rating":"1","title":"There Are Better Options","review":"I decided to get this thinking that since it shows color artwork on the cover that it would reflect upon this DVD having some of the cartoons by Felix that we come to know and love. Unfortunately only the last 2 cartoons were in color and, the rest were really really old and primitive black and white animations that only either a die hard fan of Felix or someone old enough to actually remember these cartoons would enjoy. If you are looking to buy any Felix DVD for the fun, entertaining and colorful cartoons that made Felix as popular as he is today I think you would be far better off instead buying the 1958 or later cartoon series."},{"rating":"2","title":"great value","review":"This is a great value...

However, this edition is impossible to navigate. There is no table of contents (that I can find anyway) and not even a way to move from one story to another. I found the same problem with the smaller collection, La Muerte y Otras Sorpresas (Yes, I am obviously a slow learner) and patiently went through the whole thing, making notes at the story points. That doesn't seem acceptable in a collection this comprehensive.The publisher should be able to rectify this. I'd re-buy in a heartbeat.

Save yourself time and money and skip this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many assumptions","review":"I was disappointed with this book. Although it is structured reasonably well, the text often seems to assume prior knowledge - ie it talks about elements/actions as though the reader is already familiar with them.Then when you look up the reference in the index to see if there's clarification later on, the item cannot be found.As another reviewer says, there is much better information available both on the Internet and in other books.There's also a lot of irrelevant padding - like pages of quotes from the program developer about the......development of the program. As if it matters.I read it in a few hours and immediately put it up for sale. No takers so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I hadn't spent the money","review":"I wish that I'd read the reviews before I bought the book.

It's the one album by listening to it over and over you come away with it being better than before. Urban Hyms is great as is Northern Soul.

Scott, Tx"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous in places","review":"'Star Sail' is great: starting off with dreamy chorals and near-whispered opening lines... then in with the cascading power guitars... thundering bass clipping like the audio on a Saturn V rocket launch... the murmered lyrics melting into the guitar feedback until the whole song is about to collapse, then... a magnificent resolve. It's amazing. 'Slide Away' and 'The Sun, The Sea' are very strong.Some reviewers object to the 'wall of sound' and atmospherics of this album, while others seem to object to the fact that it's not 'like' Urban Hymns. I think this album has the same place in The Verve's and Richard Ashcroft's solo catalogs that Unforgettable Fire does in U2's: yeah, there's a lot of effects going on, in in many songs the lead singer's voice is held behind the instruments, but at its best still contains some gorgeous songs and moments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music for late-night psychic sailing","review":"I first heard \\"Slide Away\\" on the soundtrack of an obscure movie called \\"The New Age\\" (well worth a look, BTW). Obsessed,I scrutinuzed the end credits until I could make out the name of the band and rushed to my used record store and bought A Storm in Heaven. I was stunned, mesmerized, lost in a state of reverberating bliss. I could not stop playing this disc, and it has remained my favorite rock record for 8 years. Among the reviews here, I've noticed a similar trend -- listeners who were so captivated that they played this disc every day for years.Some rock is beautiful, some rock is powerful -- but this album achieves a fusion of beauty and power like no other I have heard.Listen to it at 2 AM, on a good stereo, very, very loud -- or soak it up in on a midnight drive through the moonlit desert.

Number one, the sound quality of A Storm In Heaven is just plain horrible. Ashcroft's vocals are just about nonexistant, as McCabe's guitars steal all of the glory throughout nearly the entire recording. Even some of the guitar work in this album is atrocious. As one reviewer said, parts of this album sound like a 'bad bootleg'. Another reason why ASIH gets two stars is because of the poor songwriting by Ashcroft. Before I bought this album I was expecting to hear thought-provoking, heartfelt lyrics and some decent guitar work. Well, the guitars deliver somewhat, but there were no lyrics that brought out any emotions whatsoever. \\"I must be feeling alone...I talked to God in a phonebox on my way home. I told you my answer...I left you my dreams on your answering machine.\\" These are the kind of lyrics that you'll find on Urban Hymns(check out A Northern Soul too). Giving this album two stars is very generous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating!","review":"This book leads you to believe that you will get instructions on \\"What to do with your brain injured child.\\" I found it was more like one man's personal story of the development of a therapy program and the his institute.

I agree with the principle but what DO I DO?\\" There are some sketchy instructions, but I found myself at a loss for how to carry them out since my daughter doesn't understand spoken language.

These are children who are unable to talk, walk, see or hear. They have cerebral palsy or were injured after birth in an accident.

The Torrents of Spring is so funny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Torrents of Spring","review":"\`The Torrents of Spring' is an early novel from Hemingway that was written during his time Paris. It is relatively short in length and is a satirical parody of the literary style of his fellow expat writers at that time. This follows Yogi Johnson and Scripps O'Neil as they go about their lives in a small town in Michigan. It is quite funny and although stylised, easy enough to read. It is unlike any of Hemingway's later novels and although his style is evident throughout, you can tell he hadn't quite found his voice yet. I found this to be a short, but entertaining read and whilst it doesn't have any great depth or substance, it is still well worth a read if you have enjoyed any of Hemingway's books in the past.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."},{"rating":"2","title":"SMALL BUT MIGHTY","review":"This little 90-page novella/short story was written in 1926, and is very representative of Hemingway's style and sense of humor. It is a parody of the early so-called vogue of a writing style, that all writers were expected to follow; but Hemingway broke the mold and wrote an entertaining story in his own way and style. He wrote in short, declarative sentences and was soon recognized for his tough, no-nonsense prose. This is a quick read enjoyed along with a glass of sherry or sogu on a cold wet evening - he mentions winter and ice quite often - so a warming toddy would be perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classical, Jazz & Exotic \\"Surf\\" Guitar","review":"This is NOT your \\"typical\\" surf guitar album.

There's a sense of humor to go with the immense talent on display, as heard in \\"The Madison Time\\" (is it an in-joke I'm not getting, or just an obscure tribute to The Bonzo Dog Band's \\"The Intro And The Outro\\"?) and seen in the 3 cover photos that form a silent photo-comic strip of sorts.

About a tenth of those are illustrated in nine thematic sections. Many are icons, but there are a few surprises, especially among recent acquisitions, where the inventive use of materials supplants functional beauty. Paola Antonelli, MoMA Curator of Architecture and Design, describes the collection as presenting a history of ideas and realizing a part of Alfred Barr's dream of a unity of the arts. She explains how the old selection criteria of truth and beauty have changed while retaining some of their old authority. It's comforting to know that relativism does not yet extend to firearms, making MoMA's collection a gun-free zone.

His (anti-)hero John Rebus, an Edinburgh cop, never fails to fascinate. Like the other books in this series, the mystery is edgy, tight and suspenseful, the secondary characters compelling, and Edinburgh--almost a character in itself--looms in the background, grim, shabby and poignantly dignified. What makes Rankin so good is the moral dilemmas he throws Inspector Rebus into and the choices he forces his character to make. Rebus is cynical, world weary, irreverent, alcholic--a loner who has failed at his personal and professional lives in all the recognized ways. And yet we like him immensely and sympathize completely, even when we don't agree with the choices he makes.Somehow, Rankin keeps producing great reads, each better than the last, and \\"Set in Darkness\\" is no exception. I just hope Rankin never tires of Inspector John Rebus, because I won't."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Voice of Dissent","review":"After reading the other reviews, I wondered if I read the same book. Slow, complex, convoluted. Honestly, Edinburgh does not present the alure that it apparently does to others.Plot focuses around simple greed of land developers and double crossing by the dark side of a seedy lot of players.It took me much too long to connect any of the dots and when I did it was a disappointing picture. First and last visit to Mr. Rankin's world. Buyer Beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreary stuff","review":"I consider myself a major fan of detective fiction worshipping the likes of Carr, Stout, Queen, Christie etc.Ian Rankin has been touted as one of the finest crime writers around but after this maudlin item I am left wondering why. Rebus is in my opinion a poor quality detective spending too much time mooning around the wrong end of a whisky bottle and giving us insights into his tortured personal life. Let's have more detection and less social conscience salving. I give this book 1 star only because zero doesn't appear to be an option!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit of a mess","review":"Set in Darkness seemed like a jumbled mess to me. I enjoyed most of the previous books but this one was not a good read. First it was difficult to get into. The plot then is like a tangle of multiple balls of yarn. First a body is found in an old fireplace. Then a tramp throws himself off a bridge leaving behind a lot of money and a politician is murdered. It is clear of course that it will likely all get connected but in the meantime Rebus will pal around with Big Ger, drink too much, possibly hit the sack with an aging celebrity, antagonize colleagues, experience incredible strokes of luck, only to tie it up neatly in the end. Good yarn is usually enjoyable but this seemed like a mess to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kindle Version Needs an editor...","review":"I'm a long-time fan of Ian Rankin ... and enjoyed this book. My comments are not about the book, however, but about the Kindle edition. This was my first book experience on my new Kindle. I was dissapointed in the digital edition since there are obvious errors that are, I assume, introduced by the computer creating the digital version. For example, hyphens appear incorrectly throughout the book; some words are incorrect. While it may not be a \\"big deal\\", I found it very irritating and it did take away from the enjoyment of the story. I think a human editor may help."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read for a cloudy cold day","review":"Ian Rankin writes a good book which will keep you interested without giving away too much. He also keeps one interested in the characters and how they react with one another. I would recommend this as one of the better mystery novels that I have read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific and Comprehensive Cycling Book, But Equipment Section VERY Outdated","review":"This is probably the best overall book on cycling ever written. Very comprehensive and detailed about any and all facets of cycling, including training, diet, bike fit, equipment, and even LeMond's own Tour de France drama, when he battled teammate Bernard Hinault for the crown in '85 and 86. Great read.Only major drawback: the section on equipment is HILARIOUSLY out-of-date. LeMond debates the merits of six-speed freewheels vs seven-speed, for example. Hey Greg, might wanna re-write that chapter sometime, we're up to eleven-speed cassettes these days, at least on Campy.Aside from the equipment section being about 20 years out of date, it's well worth getting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written, easy to use","review":"I've used this book quite a lot and I have to say that it is very user-friendly. The graphics are nicely done and everything is explained in detail.

If your reading this you probably know some things about his drug/alcohol problems. I won't bother you with those details. The book was brilliantly written.

I had NO idea!! Donald Maggin does a fine job of reporting the events as they occurred & lets us formulate our opinions about this incredible \\"Life In Jazz\\".

To think Horowitz was days before death when he recorded this makes you wonder if he was indeed human! The musical smoothness and nuances of bringing out inner notes is a joy to listen to. The Haydn is amazing and each Chopin proves to be a new, fresh experience. The Liszt is remarkable from start to finish. There's something about hearing the \\"Liebestod\\" (brilliantly played!) and knowing it was Horowitz's final recording and he poetically would die shortly thereafter. The inner response you'll feel upon hearing each piece is a religious experience! I listen to this CD over and over!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Man who lost China","review":"This is an excellent and well researched biography of Chiang Kai-Shek.It provides insights to a man who in many ways remains an enigma, but this book brings the reader to a much closer understandingof its subject and the politics and political culture that was and perhaps still exists in China.The Princelings of today seem to have learnt much from their Elders.

You'll find the typical marketing advice, typical Web site advice, and typical advice on writing a buisness plan.The virtual-assistant Web sites listed in the \\"You're Not Alone!\\" section are mostly outdated, although I realize the author has no control over that.There is some useful information in the book, such as the sample marketing letter and the sections on choosing services and setting fees. There also is some useful advice from other virtual assistants. However, I'm not sure those things make the book worth its cost. It may be worth the cost for someone who is totally unfamiliar with business practices.Frankly, if you're interested in offering writing services through your virtual-assistant business, I would recommend reading the book titled \\"The Wealthy Writer\\" by Michael Meanwell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value","review":"JWIN JX-CD7150 CD AND AM/FM STEREO RADIO.I have been looking around for a small unit when I found the JWIN.

It is very colorful and has great animation. The characters were great. I liked the moose. They were almost as funny as Timon and Pumba!(Timon and Pumba are the best, though.)There also wasn't any real \\"bad guy\\" is this story. Denahi was chasing Kenai, but he wasn't really bad. I also loved the special features. I loved finding my totem, like the wolf or the bear. I also liked the autio commintary. It was funny. And with the moose directing it, it has to be funny! I would rate this move PG. This movie is better for kids that can undersand the plot quickly and that can understand death. Ignore all of those reviewers that say the movie was bad because their 3 year olds were scared of the movie. This is a family freindly movie. I would rate it the 2nd best movie in the world(The Lion King is the 1st). Get this movie, believe me, you won't regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I simply loved this movie: emotional story, great characters, unbelievable animation/art.....what is not to love? It is a shame that this film bombed in theaters. Though it was advertised as a silly (a.k.a. stupid [and probably the reason for its unimpressive earnings]) funny movie, I would say this has to be one of Disney's best. It is definitely a movie for all ages, except perhaps the very, very young. Read the other reviews if you need more convincing. You will also notice that most of the negative posts come from parents, who picked the movie apart because their young child was frightened or imitated something a character did.

It's a cheap Bambi remake for the 40 somethings who cried the first time Mummy Dear got plugged, sneered the second time and then, finally on the third showing, cooed over their offspring when Thumper revealed the inner beauty of life.Similarly, this film is all about death, and America's continuing inability to come to terms with the 'big one'. Apparently we're to be comforted by the knowledge that dead relatives can always stroke our chin when we're at our lowest ebb and that Grandad is now an eel.To be fair, my five year old son was delighted by the cub and then thoroughly confused (but not upset) by the ending...why did his mummy come back from heaven and then leave him...again ?

The story and the characters are very well developed, the music is very good and the hand drawn animation couldn't be better. Let's face it, it's not Finding Nemo, but it is the best traditional animation movie (not counting Lilo & Stitch) since Tarzan.

It is probably one of the funniest movies! When I saw it in theaters, I was surprised when I saw that Sitka had the same voice as Aladar from Disney's Dinosaur! I didn't quite recognize the voice at first; I read the credits. Here are some of the funniest parts: after a stampede of caribu (which I thought were Megaloceras before) Kenai says, \\"Never try to milk a caribu.\\" When Rutt and Tuke are riding a mammoth, Rutt wants to \\"drive\\". Tuke says, \\"just relax and enjoy the ride!\\" Rutt says, \\"oh, okay,\\" and spreads his legs out and says lazily, \\"whee!\\" Rutt and Tuke are walking in the mountains, and Rutt says, \\"I can't believe you totalled a mammoth!\\" In case you didn't catch it before, one of Rutt's antlers are broken in that scene."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Movie is a MUST SEE!!","review":"I was skeptical about the premise of this newest Disney release...

I have to admit I was enthralled throughout!Phil Collins' soundtrack is amazing - I catch myself humming the tunes throughout the day - the artistry is beautiful, and the message is one we could all stand to be reminded: the power/importance of love & family!

But there's something special to me about a movie that can entertain adults and children alike. We saw it with our 6-year old son. Brother Bear will now rank as one of my all time favorites. It will no doubt be a classic with its focus on mutual respect, family pride and love. The \\"battle scenes\\" between adults and humans may be a tad too intense for some toddler age children, but I thought the directors handled those scenes very age appropriately. I found the spiritual component very compelling and not too over the top for those of us who are just simple, church going folks and not into out of this world new age beliefs."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best movie ever!","review":"My mom was dragging me to the movies to see some stupid movie with my little sister and her friend.

This movie enchanted me from the very beginning! At first, the story was so sad and I was crying. But soon after, the story had changed into a funny and light middle. By the end of the story I was crying again, only this time because it was so sweet!I have seen so few movies as great as this one and have encouraged all my friends to see it.

As a Christian mother I was warned that this movie was full of spirit worship and bought it for my 3 1/2 year old son anyway. Well, the spirt worship is one thing but the movie is just plain BORING on top of that. The moose use the word \\"stupid\\" to the point is not humorous and it teaches our children to use inappropriate language as well. I am sorry but Disney should be a name you can trust and when a movie is written for children such language and inuendo should not be present. Disney just pushes the envelope too far with some of their stuff and they seriously need their wrists slapped for some of it.Again, take out the religion and word \\"stupid\\". The movie is just dull and boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"hm.","review":"Great Walt would rotate in his box, if he saw that movie.The music sounds exactly like >Tarzan< (same composer and song performer), the animation is'nt smooth or anything and the backgrounds are - except a few - just there for the reason.

The example of how brother bear came to care for Koda2. The animation and graphics were visually appealing3. Humorous moments with the two mooseNegative aspects:1. The scene where one brother tackles another and proceeds to spit on him. This scene was totally unnecessary. Our three year old started spitting on other people after seeing this movie. The last thing parents need is a movie teaching them bad behavior.2. It presents the killing of the mother bear as a bad thing, yet the bear seemed to bear no responsibility for being a factor in the death of Kenai's brother. Although Kenai started out tracking the bear as a result of his anger over his brother's death, in the end he killed the charging bear as matter of self defense.3. The scene where the two rams keep yelling \\"Shut up!\\". This scene also causes small children to repeat this phrase in an inappropriate way."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Disney Film, Same Taste and Style","review":"The movie is new but the taste and style is the same.

Finally leave out all of the trademark Disney magic and you basically have the recipe for Brother Bear. Lets hope that Home on the Range is a little more original and entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tereribly sad!","review":"This movie is probably good for very little kids who don't understand death, but for everyone else it is very sad.

Not this!\\"That's the review my 3-year old son gave Brother Bear after about 15 minutes, not counting several minutes of previews we sat through before I gave up and fast forwarded through them.To be honest, I was a bit relieved. The animation was lush but unengaging, the narration was overly preachy, and the Phil Collins music was, well... Phil Collins music.It wasn't a total loss -- we spent the rest of the evening putting puzzles together and coloring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brother Bear is the BEST!","review":"While the animation is wonderful and the colors and beautifully vivid, it is the story that makes this a classic.

The dialogue is preachy.The changing of the aspect ratios 24 minutes into the film is gimmicky and lame, downright annoying in fact.Buy practically anything else made or distributed by Disney and you will be better off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for Kids Only","review":"Movies like this is the reason why Disney as a company is doing so badly. It is not a bad movie, but the story is VERY predictable. This means that the only people who will enjoy this movie are very young kids. There are some really laugh out loud moments involving the mooses, and one scene with the newly transformed bear were reminisce of those old Disney shorts about the bears and the park ranger. Unfortunately, those were the only good things an adult will find amusing. Whether about 10 mins of laugh will make this a good movie for you is a matter of personal choice. I find the movie wanting. You know the movie is in trouble when there were SO many songs. There was simply not enough story to fill up the screen time. Of course, kids may like this, but if you are an adult, the only reason why you want to buy this DVD is that you have a bunch of rug monkeys that you want to distract with this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad","review":"when i got this movie, it was scratched and only the 2nd disk was in it. It skips all threw the movie too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for my kid.","review":"I don't quite understand other reviewers' comments that this is a \\"family-friendly\\" movie. First, one brother got killed then later the cub found out that his mom is dead; not to mention that throughout the other part of the movie, the other brother is ruthlessly hunting a bear (who's actually is the other brother). Why is it that most animated movies always killed off a family member? Bambi lost his mother, Simba in the Lion King lost his dad, Nemo's mom got killed, Long Neck in Land Before Time lost his mother. If animated movies are to be for kids then they should make it fun, entertaining, and perhaps even be silly for innocent minds, not filling them with fears of losing a family member. While watching this movie, my 3-year-old kept on asking where is the mommy bear, why is the hunter after the bear. She started to cry when the hunter was fighting with the bear. If the point of the movie is to teach compassion, I wish they would have done it differently."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spoiler alert....This movie is LAME!!!","review":"I bought this based on all the positive and even enthusiastic reviews on Amazon. I was wondering why I never heard of it. Knowing nothing about it, I assumed by the cheap graphics and cheesy Tina Turner and Phil Collins music that it was made in the 80's. Was shocked to find that it was released in 2003. It's filled with new age spiritualism that basically interjects the thought into children's minds that animals and humans are all One, along with the forces of nature. The lesson is that all hunting or killing of any animals is wrong, it's like killing a human. Plus it was boring and lame. We did get a few laughs while getting a load of how terrible it was. Finally.... it goes straight to the garbage can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Preachy and boring","review":"This has got to be the worst large-scale animated film I've ever seen. I don't know how a child could sit through it; I'm not one to get bored easily, but I found the film mostly boring.The story is preachy and predictible. Much of the music was annoying. Overall, it was just...dull. The only bright spots were the few moments of comedy, mostly coming from the Canadian-accented Moose, which Disney featured heavily in their advertising. No wonder! They are the best thing in the film...but they take up only a few minutes in the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an exellent mind and body experience...

Hey, work in your garden, wash dishes, live life, but don't do if without some great tunes, and turn it up! The work is flawless, and Dennis employs the best of the best to back him up. After one listen you will know what I mean. You'll be humming one or another of these songs in your head.

It was replacing a decent Casio GW-800 Tough Solar Multi-Band 3-4 year old watch that the rechargeable battery stopped holding a charge. After (2) attempts by a Casio watch dealer to change out the battery, the watch functions totally stopped working. I can't even change the time, so I bought a new GW-700A Tough Solar - Wave Ceptor. The watch is 1 month old, and if it isn't in the direct sunlight for 1 day, it is dead with a \\"Low-Dead\\" battery. Casio seems to have a serious problem with \\"ALL\\" their solar watches, just read a lot of the reviews and you'll see what I mean!!

The brushed aluminum is a nice touch. The watch is big, but I like that about it. The atomic feature is very nice, noting that it stays in tune with my time on my computers at work. How nice to never have to set it again! The charge remains at full without any additional intervention upon arrival other than some exposure to sunlight or a bright internal light. The only issue I have with the watch is the need for a count down timer. This is a feature I have always had with Timex watches in the past and have already found my self searching for it even though it isn't there. I would definitely consider this watch again and/or recommend it to family and friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointment","review":"I would love to wear this watch. When it works, it gives accurate time and the display is clean and nice. However, unless it is perched on my windowsill soaking up the rays, it quickly loses charge and dies.

No matter what we tried, we could not get the cap off the strainer. This is coming from a man in his 30s with average strength. The cap is incredibly tight. In fact when we pulled on it, the metal sheath pulled off and left a black plastic cap. Hence, no straining capability.What dropped the review to two stars was the non-existent customer support.

Works great as a regular shaker though, but if that's what you want, just buy a regular shaker and don't spend your money here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recipes don't line up with the outer sheath","review":"Great size shaker. Solid construction. I received one of these as a gift, and noticed the recipes don't line up completely with the openings on the outer sheath. No problem, returned it, got another. Same issue.

It was impossible to move defeating the main purpose of me buying this type of shaker. The second flaw was that the text for the recipes were smudged in several spots to the point of illegibility.I can only assume that this was grabbed from the stock room after someone else returned it and shipped out to me in this damaged condition.Completely Dissatisfied"},{"rating":"1","title":"QUESTION.PLEASE ANSWER","review":"Ok...so this isnt a review,but a question I have on this product.

The after-work, wind-down cocktail. The pre-party, warm-up drink. The after-dinner drink. Even the weekend-long bender (just kidding of course).The dial is easy to twist and turn and the drink recipes are easy to read. Even over time and repeated use. The built-in strainer can't be beat if you've got citrus and ice in the mix. The drink recipes run the gamut from the standard (martini) to the weird (the aforementioned between the sheets). Heck, it even works for drinks whose recipes aren't on the side of the shaker.My only buying advice would be to buy two of these. Depending on your thirst, frame of mind or company this'll only do for two drinks at a time. For the party person in you, you'll want to be more flexible with your drink mixing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to open!","review":"This shaker is impossible to open.

Granted, it's a fairly cheap version of the sheet music for this song, but I still don't think its worth the price if you want to use it to read the text of the song or even play it on any sort of instrument.

As stated, it's the early 50's shows, not in any order but still consistant. The only problem for me is that the episodes were just not that good. It was more of a transfer from the old radio program to the screen and while there was a noir look to the series, it was kind of bland after a while. The 60's episodes were much better. I found that the show became better developed later on. Still, it's one of the few \\"Public Domain\\" releases that I would recomend.

Fortunately, Pacific Digital customer service worked with me and got me NTI CD-Maker, which worked well enough for burning CDs but not as well for printing labels. Once everything is up and running, putting together a disk is fairly straightforward, albeit time consuming for music CDs.

As for the product, since I tend to use quality synthetic oils in my 2008 Honda Civic I guess only time will tell, but I do seem to have more pickup that has a firmer feel. My Honda is slightly modified, but the other day I out ran a BMW that was attempting to cut me off as I merged onto the free way. Was it the oil?

It's as if the internal memory card needs to be reprogrammed or re-initialized. Unfortunately, SONICBLUE's CUSTOMER SUPPORT (...)!!!! Who wants to wait 20+ minutes on a long-distance call?

My annoyance only increased, when the battery compartment lid under the pressure of the spring (below the battery) broke the small hooks holding the lid. Such as a costumer service or technical support doesn't exist, it is inpossible to contact via e-mail or phone.The only good things are the push-buttons, they have a good design, the body is light, but the display is primitive.

Ironic that she glosses over evidence and proof that are necessary for clear and critical thinking while at the same time attempting to describe the phenomena that often cloud our thinking rationally!

But those devices are devious and deceptive, and reading about them is deeply unsettling for the picture it gives of how completely at the mercy of this deviousness we are. We end up feeling that nothing is at it seems, that nothing is quite what we believed it to be, not our thoughts, not our idea of ourselves.

The wind was relentless, which made setup a little more time-consuming, but it had no problem withstanding the gusts. Head-room is wonderful, and the cyclone vents are a great idea.

I am diligent about drying the tent before restoring it. This year, we were pumped to get out on our first camping trip and all the line in the poles had frayed and broke. It was very hard to set up the tent as the poles simply kept coming apart. I was not a happy camper at all. Ultimately we got it up and it was fine. The rain fly was an issue too.It rained on us all weekend. Rain kept catching at the entrance so any time I went in and out the tent, the rain collection on top dumped on my back. We had a few leaks too as the rainflap touched the tent in a few places.So I am debating, order replacement poles or call it a waste and move on to something else. Really makes me mad.

I enjoyed the ease of the tent's assembly (you need two people, though,) the way the air circulated on warm evenings and the way it stayed dry through lots of rain even though I had the lower air vents open and the windows unzipped at the top. However, I planned on all 4 of us using this tent during next year's family camping outing, but I don't think it's big enough to be truly comfortable for that. I used a queen sized Coleman air mattress which only fit in the middle so it wouldn't touch the sides. There was plenty of room for my duffle, but not for another air mattress of any size. Without the air mattress, I think three people (maybe four if two were children and nobody minded being close) could fit comfortably if they didn't keep luggage in the tent. I should note that that the door's zipper did catch on the surrounding fabric rather easily, but it was easily freed without causing any damage."},{"rating":"2","title":"High country","review":"When I ordered this tent I was needing a tent for 3 people to hunt out of.

I believe you could comfortably put two people camping in this tent for more than one day. Three people if you had to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good purchase","review":"I've used this tent twice for one night each time. It's pretty painless to set up, although having two people definitely helps. It's difficult to find the sleeve in the rainfly for the rainfly pole. Other than that, not too bad.The tent has held up well. It ventilates nicely and those doors on the side of the main door are great for the dog to go in and out. I love the fact that I can stand up in the middle of the tent. The storage bag that comes with this tent expands so you needn't roll the thing precisely to pack it up.On the down side, I found the rainfly difficult to line up over the tent so that it would be completely snug. Also, the stakes that come with the tent are a little flimsy. I bent the first stake that I tried to push into the ground (using my hand, not a hammer). Since then, the rest of the stakes have been OK.I bought the tent for $120 or $130 and I was very pleased with that price. it's a steal at $100."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Tent","review":"Only used this tent once since purchasing and it performed well. Set up was a breeze. Tent accommodated two adults and two kids with ease. Second night of camp came a downpour for an hour or so and we stayed dry.

The former was good, but I was wrong on the latter. The whole back wall of this tent is mesh, and I just couldn't tell that from the picture or the description(even after going back to look). I think this will work out ok, but i'm going to sew over the mesh for my purposes, which will be a pain. I was able to set this up by myself, though it definitely went slow and would have been quick with 2 people. I couldn't figure out where the triangle 'dividers' went, though they seem to just cover the small shoe corners. I haven't had an opportunity to actually go camping in this yet, but I look forward to it.

It's a small book, so if you're looking for a basic introduction to the art of counterpoint, this book does a great job."},{"rating":"2","title":"highly recommended for beginner through advanced levels","review":"After reading through this book, I think it would be suitable for students of all levels. It contains everything you need to know about modal counterpoint and is completely comprehensive and easy to follow, as long as you do the exercises. The dialogue mode in the book provides some levity (though maybe not entirely intentional) in a subject that has a proclivity to become dry. Highly recommended if you are looking for something to start or further your study of counterpoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Grail of Counterpoint ! ! !","review":"Yes, you should buy this book! The book is short, succinct, and to the point. It is quite thin and reads easily. One of the things that I truly admired about this book was the fact that Mann preserves the dialog between the Master and the Student. The book was obviously written from a spiritual perspective by the original author, cautioning the student that to undertake this particular course of study is to eschew the material and pursue with the utmost humility the art of musical counterpoint with God's help! I was as inspired by the dialog of the text as I was by the content of this little manual! Get it! You will most certainly not regret this decision if you a serious about music composition !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Counterpoint is this.","review":"This is a really fun book. It teaches counterpoint, yet I could read it for leisure reading.

The first 150 pages are pure background, half of which is absolutely irrelevant to the story. The author drones on about the religious epiphanies and work history of the victims and their families.As for trail life on the Appalachian Trail, I detected some gross factual errors that made me question the author's research. Damascus is not a week from Pearisburg on the AT, and Chestnut Knob is not, under any circumstances, a day's hike from Wapiti shelter, the scene of the crime.Although the narration of the crimes and subsequent manhunt are page turners, the book again needlessly boggs down in courtroom proceedings which are rehashed verbatim.I only recommend this book if you REALLY want to know about these murders...."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book to put you asleep","review":"Boring,boring,boring!

I have read many many books on the Appalachian Trail, but this one was a real snoozer. I bet this book would have been better if it had been written in about 300 pages less and possibley written by someone else. Of course the victims were nominated for sainthood because they never did a bad thing in there life. Just to much. You'd think the author was with them every second even in there intimit moments.

You really can feel the difference. Their return policy (60 days, used) also reassured me that if they did not work out, I wasn't stuck with them.*UPDATE* I've had the shoes for a few months now (well passed the 60 day return period) and the rubber at the bottom is starting to become unglued (towards the sides of the shoes). I most definitely don't run everyday so this is quite disappointing to see happen already. Substracting some stars..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great shoe","review":"I recently bought a pair of these, and they've been excellent from the first time I wore them out running. A long-time fan of Asics, this was my first pair from the 2100 series, and it seems to be a wonderful choice. Before this, I had one pair of the Gel-1070 and two of the Gel-1080. This shoe has a really nice design on the heel, and the mesh on the rest of the shoe gives it a light, yet sturdy, feel. When I first tried them on, it felt as comfortable as some of the other running shoes I have that are already broken-in. I've got fairly narrow feet, and these fit me well, although I've read a few reviews in running magazines that say they'd be good for folks with wider feet. Plenty of room in the toe box. I typically wear a size 7 (womens) and ended up going with a 6.5 for this shoe; don't know if it others would run into this issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Pair of Asics - Will Never Go Back!","review":"I tried on a bunch of different brands of shoes, trying to find the most comfortable. I usually wear New Balance, but thought I would see if there is anything more comfy out there. I fell in love with a pair of Asics. Before buying, I decided to go to a shoe store and tried on several different pairs of Asics: GT-2120, GT-1120, GT 2110, and some others. Even thought the GT-2110's are not the newest on the market, they were by far the most comfortable for me! I love the cushioning! There was no \\"breaking them in\\" either. They have been comfortable since the first time I used them. I don't run alot, but I take a lot of exercise classes and these are perfect. I don't think I will ever buy another brand of shoes. I highly recommend them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great shoes!","review":"I love these shoes! My personal trainer recommended them, and I purchased them from Amazon. They come in some cool colors - when she saw them, she said \\"Where did you get orange?\\" :)My only problem: be aware that the mesh over your toes REALLY keeps your toes cool, and if you wear these in cold weather, your toes will freeze! However, if you wear them in warm weather, you're all set. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Running Shoes","review":"Great shoes. This is the fourth pair of ASICS that I have purchased.

I would highly recommend it to people who are constantly switching between ink and stylus. It was a perfect pen for me.Now for the review. The weight is about the same a normal Parker/Cross pen. The ink is no way the same. Don't get me wrong, the ink is good but, it doesn't compare to those of a higher class. With a simple, and I do mean simple twist, the stylus appears. Excellent mechanical design. Platinum Pen Company put a lifetime guarantee on it. (Under normal condition)The stylus is probably one of the best on the market. Add that with the weight and feel of a real pen, I am now cruising along on my Palm Graffti. I was good before, now I am better.The rubber cushion a nice when you are writing for a long time. I have a Dooney and Burke pad for my Palm. The cushion is kinda big for the pen loop, but it will fit with a little push.Very nice Pen/Stylus combo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best value for your money!","review":"The comment \\"fits in the stylus slot of many PDA cases\\" as stated in the \\"Features\\" section of the description of this item is, in fact, correct. Unfortunately, the previous reviewer misunderstood this to mean that it's supposed to fit in the stylus slot on the PDA \\"casing\\" (where the original stylus is housed).PDA \\"cases\\", such as bi-folds and trifolds offered by various manufacturers, incorporate a separate slot or elastic holder for your stylus (except in \\"pouch-type\\" cases). If you read other reviews further down you'll see that the description actually pertains to the stylus slot in a \\"PDA case\\" such as a bi-fold, not the housing.I gave this pen/stylus 4 stars instead of 5 because the grip area does not allow it to be inserted effortlessly into an elastic holder, as would be the case if it would have had a smooth barrel.

The books are hardcover and over sized, which present the color and artwork in amazing detail. Volume one is signed by both Niles and Templesmith, volumes 2 and 3 are not signed. The slipcase is really sturdy and handsomely illustrated in black. The individual volumes are hardcover and contain added features like the original script, sketches and storyboards.

He always seemed to have such a lyrical insight. Poetic, passionate with an excellent rhythm and style. Not truly understanding WHY he left the world of music, I packed away his albums, assumed he was involved with some sort of \\"cult\\" and always rolled my eyes and shrugged my shoulders, if his name should come up as it had occasionally, in newspapers and general conversation.Now I know all thanks to his comeback and this DVD which gave me a lot of insight as to why he did what he had.He is older and very wise and philosopical - voice has a rougher edge to it now as Yusuf, but the Cat has returned. I have pulled out his older material, now on CD of course, and am relistening to everything he had to say back in the 70's. Wiser than most of us at such an early age, I believe he just had to take that break and rediscover himself more on a spiritual level.

The songs 'Get With Me', 'Clap Your Hands', 'Superstar', 'All Aboard', 'Type of Mood', and 'What Would It Be Like' are more up tempo songs that seem to be written to touch the fan bases of some of their contemporaries.

I don't know why the engineer did it, but even on a pair of $4000 Infinity Renaissance 90 speakers it sounds like the bass is coming from a cheap pair of Cerwin Vegas with floppy 15\\" woofers.

Now the battery life is 1 hour or less! The only good thing is that the battery is replacable but still who would like to replace the battery every 4 months. I highly recommend that you just get an Ipod even if this thing is cheaper. At least wait until Creative does something about their battery life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incompatible with most operating systems.","review":"This product is compatible ONLY with Microsoft Windows XP. Creative has really fallen short on what could have been a nice product by choosing to offer drivers for only one operating system.If you have Windows 2000/ME/98, don't waste your time with this product. There is absolutely no way to transfer files to it. I had one, tried it, and sent it back for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"headphone jack [...]","review":"we drove an hour to get the best deal on this player. got home. unpacked everything and found that they packed headphones with a jack that is far too large for the port.

Sound is way below the quality of my iPod 6 GB mini. My iPod is charging constantly while I play it in my car with my Monster cable, and it is also charging while I work with my music files.Maybe the new, yet-to-be released Zens are better. One can always hope. I don't have anything Apple, except my trusty iPod, and I will gladly replace my Mini with the 30 GB iPod when I run out of space. You can't beat the clickwheel navigation of iPod either...awesome for those of use who work out while using our players, awesome for using while driving.

The ear plugs were of good sound quality. I am very technically challenged my kids and husband have to help me with any thing technical. I found the dial on the Zen Micro Photo to be impossible to operate. It is VERY SENSITIVE to the touch, I could not even raise and lower the volume. Finally, when it began to freeze up on me regularly I did return this and Amazon kindly refunded all my money even the cost to ship it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zen Microphoto Good Buy","review":"This player is definately worth the money, i didn't realize how small it would actually be. I bought it as a gift for my girlfriend since i have a zen touch 20gb nd she didnt need something quite as big. Works great, the only thing i don't like about it that i prefer on my zen touchis that on the microphoto, the scrolling bar for music and volume are the same, so sometimes you'll adjust the volume when you're searching for a song or vise versa. Also to charge the player it has to be connected through the usb cable and won't charge unless your computer is on or you have a laptop and the laptop is being charged. But besides that, if you can get one for $150 like i did, its def a good player for someone that doesn't need to have a ton of songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better pray yours works out of the box","review":"Mine failed within 3 weeks--the software just hung.

Now (3 weeks later) they are asking for a $25 \\"diagnostic fee\\" before they'll look at the unit, along with a note not to reply to the e-mail. Instead they give you a hyperlink back to their Customer Support web page, where you need to fill out an e-mail form and plug your RMA number in. (I'm assuming that the request for a \\"diagnostic fee\\" is a mistake.

For the for the first week it showed no sign of it being corrupted, but after 9 days of using it, it stoped turning on. When i finally got it to turn on it gave me weird messages and pictures.

He claims it filled his expectations. Good quality sound. Liked the personally customizable background. Didn't give the 5th star because you can't see photos and listen to music at the same time, plus it classifies groups with \\"The\\" as part of it's name(i.e. The Beatles) all under \\"T\\" which makes this one a rather large category difficult to search through. Which in the end is not such a big deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product... better than Ipod?? At least its different","review":"If you want an alternative to the omnipresent ipod, then the creative zen microphoto might be for you. It works well, seems durable, and comes in a wide variety of colors. The only area it might suffer in an ipod-comparison are the menu controls; the controls on the ipod are tighter and less easily triggered on accident. It beats the ipod in that it offers FM radio and ummmm did I mention the wide variety of colors?? Definitely a good product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most unreliable MP3 Player on the Market","review":"I have been through 4 Creative MP3 Players (2 of which were Zen Microphotos 8GB). All 4 have eventually \\"frozen\\". I personally visited the Creative Corporate Headquarters in Singapore to have the player repaired since the US repair center in Oklahoma would no longer repair these Zen Microphotos; (I was in SG on a business trip.) Creative Singapore would not repair it either, but sold me a refurb unit in March 2009. This latest unit has frozen as well in October 2009 (only 7 months later).The Creative website and \\"customer service\\" (LOL) are all unhelpful and not customer-focused. I have tried the \\"Format All\\", \\"Reload Firmware\\" and \\"Reboot\\" modes, as suggested. Nothing works. Even Creative knows they are selling junk, as they will no longer repair these MP3 players.Up to now, I have resisted becoming an Apple customer (my mistake...); I will never buy a Creative product again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst purchase ever...","review":"At first I was really pleased with my Zen, it was great. It had enough storage space for everything I needed. Navigation was simple, though it took some getting used to. The one problem I ever had was it's final problem. I was listening to music and all of a sudden it froze. So I figure it's not a big deal and I restart it and it rebuilds its library. And it froze again within 3 minutes, so I restarted it and it starts in \\"Recovery Mode\\". I had used it several times before just formatting it and starting over. So I tried that. However it refused to connect to the computer at all. I tried any number of things to connect it. The creative website offers no support for issues that aren't simple. So now I can't use it. And quite frankly I wouldn't use it again, too many problems. So I went and bought a Zune. I couldn't be happier, so thanks for sucking Zen!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk; poor customer service","review":"This product is a piece of junk. Within a month the display started going and I had to reload the firmware. Just after one year, the player wouldn't work (kept starting in recovery mode). The online Creative knowledge base was of no help, and they would not help me further without charging me. Overly sensitive touch controls. Won't buy a Creative product again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Mp3 player","review":"I bought this Mp3 player over an ipod nano over a year ago and still use and like it. It doesn't compare with the new nano's but is better than the previous generation of nano's. It's well built but still should have a protective case for the obvious reasons. The touchpad was a bit tricky at first, but I figured it out in a few days just like everyone else.The things that keep me from giving it a 5 star rating are the following; it takes awhile to charge and the wall chargers are hard to find, plus they're over $25 without shipping, if you find it. But maybe this is just me since this is my first Mp3 player of this sort. Maybe the ipods take hours to fully charge as well. The other thing is that I have an apple macbook, and so their is only one freeware program that lets me use this on a mac, but it commonly requires that I replug it several times to have it detected.Bottom line is that the thing works very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't last","review":"I was really happy with my Zen Microphoto until it stopped working after less than two years. Creative offered me a new one for $150 (which is half what I paid for it), but I'll probably try to find one without built-in obsolescence. I think that a $300 device should last longer than that, and I wasn't impressed with Creative's after market support. My other big problem was I could never get it to work with Windows XP, although Vista seemed to support it OK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Went Through Two In Less Than a Month","review":"I chose this player over other similar mp3 players because of its removable battery. No battery lasts forever and I didnt like the idea of having to send it to the manufacturer just to replace it when it goes bad. For the most part, I was satisfied with the player until it stopped working after two weeks. It actually \\"worked\\" but it stopped letting me add/delete music. So I sent it back and got a replacement. I just thought that I must have got a faulty one but then my second one started randomly turning off during the middle of a song. It didnt matter if the battery was low or fully charged, it would just turn off for no reason. I sent it back and Amazon gave me a complete refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good features, poor quality and horrible customer support.","review":"Functionally (when it works) this is a great product with just the right feature set. Unfortunately, it is made by a company with horrible policies and service. My first player had a screen defect. I returned it the first day. Then the second one stopped working only 80 days from purchase. I called and described the issue (10 minute boot time, no longer recognized by PC), and they said I can pay for support. 80 days out and I pay for support?

Secondly I spoke to my brother who has lived in Silcon Valley and has worked in the computer industry for over 30 years, he said you never should change anything in the registry in windows XP.

This means that you can hook this puppy up to a potato or apple and get CLEAN, RENEWABLE and TASTY electricity anytime you want to!

My advice to anyone interested in the Zen Microphoto is to check their forum under the search \\"player not connected\\" or \\"player not recognized\\".

I'm extremely pleased that my public library, Walmart and numerous suppliers of music and audiobooks provide a wide selection of materials that work on it. It's a sturdy piece of equipment and it's known to take a few bumps (or drops with a rubber case). It is easy to navigate through the screens, and I love that you can preset a maximum volume. No damaged ear drums with this baby! I have long fingers and I'm pleased that the Zen MicroPhoto fits in my hand comfortably. I don't like extremely thin devices. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Customer support sucks...","review":"Thought I'd go with an iPod alternative, big mistake. Player hangs during transfers, then crashes, rebuilds the library and all the song titles are a mess. Tech support was rude and condescending, no one would deviate from the script, which recommends \\"small transfers\\", less than 100 songs. So in order to fill the player, over 20 transfers would be required. When I said I was trying to transfer 7 GB the woman laughed at me.

It read VERY slow, and it was extremely boring. Right at the beginning of the book, the girl, Trisha, gets lost in the woods.Then you spend the rest of the book following her around. She's tired, shes sick, she's hungry, she's frightened- SO WHAT?! I saw no point to this story whatsoever. I was waiting for some big climatctic ending, and there was nothing at all. Again, I am not familiar with his works, but the whole thing seemed way too bubblegum sweet to be written by a person with the frightening reputation Stephen King has. Maybe his other stuff is better, but I thought this book was boring. I couldn't stand it by page 20 and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Monotonic","review":"Story is about a 9 year old child who is lost in a forest. The story is very monotonic and did not excited me. I only liked the last chapter and after reading that one i got near to cry. All the story passes in a forest and contains some references to her past experiences. She is a little shysophrenic becouse most of the time she \\"saws\\" Tom Gordon (also she know he is not there :)).Book may be can be used for a reference book: \\"How to survive in a forest\\" bot not for getting excited.Kings little \\"excited\\" tellings did not made me feel so. It may be a great book but did not gave me what i had waited for. May be was not my style."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Book Review","review":"This book was like a breath of fresh air after reading Dreamcatcher. The plot is very simple: a survival story about a little girl lost in the woods and she is looking for her parents but doesnt find them til the end of the book. King manages to avoid the psychological babbling of his recent books but still pull you in with well developed characters.In this story a little nine year old girl must battle the elements, her fear of a stalking creature, and the deterioration of her body and senses.This book is not meant to scare you into the wee hours of the night but it will keep you turning the pages just the same. King makes you care about this girl and whether or not she will survive, which makes it a given that she will (this isn't a Bachman novel). Knowing this doesn't take away from the intensity of her struggle.I highly recommend this to Stephen King fans or anyone who loves a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is just bad!!","review":"I like Stephen King. But this book was a waste of my time and money. I wanted to stop reading mid-way because it was so predicable what was going to happen at the end. So many endless pages about the forest/wood. It just dragged, on and on. I have to rate this at 1 star, because I have no other choice. But is should be a -5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't believe he wrote it!","review":"Wow, not at all the usual King. Just scary enough to keep the kids from wandering off the trail. I forgive you Stephen, your're entitled to one loser now and then."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite Possibly his worst book ever","review":"I don't know what he was thinking when he wrote this. Not scary, not frightening, and not even any good. There isn't a hint of suspense in this book. The whole book is just disappointing. It's about a girl that gets lost in the world and lives off of berries. She's scared the whole time and if she had just stayed on the trail, I wouldn't have had to read this garbage for two hours. Leave this be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally not what would you expect!","review":"The title is deceiving, but gets you thinking. I got mosquito bites(Or seemed to) When I read the book. You feel like you are in the woods with her!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT STORY LINE!","review":"I thought that this book was told very well. At times you thought that it was going to be hard for Trisha to get out of the woods. King told the story great by using many things throughout the woods that were helpful to her and harmful to her. The book ended quickly but other than that this book is great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oops!","review":"It is a good book but certainly not \\"hot horror\\" as categorized above.Unfortunately, I fear there will be people who choose not to read this book as a result of its headline here.As avid King readers know, some of his books simply do not fit the stereotype that exists in many minds. This is one of those books."},{"rating":"1","title":":weiver ruoy rof eltit a retne esaelP","review":"This book didn't do it for me. And while there are obviously many people who love books where nothing happens and there's really no big point to be made, I'm not one of them. I could have spent the time it took to read this snoozer doing pushups, but instead I'm a scrawny guy with a super-dull plot crowding his subconscious. Thpppt to you, Stephen King, for stealing my muscles."},{"rating":"1","title":"King's Worst Effort","review":"Though I have been an avid fan of Stephen King's for 15 years, I must say that this work is completely unworthy of his talent. Rather than a novella, it should have been written as a 10-12 page short story so its readers would not have to have suffered for so long. I have read almost every thing King has ever written, and for the first time, I skimmed the majority of the book. After about 5 chapters it was no longer interesting what might happen to the young heroine, who, for whatever reason, believed Tom Gordon would see her though her ordeal. It was a more arduous journey attempting to read the story than it was for the girl to be lost in the woods. For anyone who is a true Stephen King fan, this book will be a huge disappointment, and anyone who isn't a huge fan should not judge his writing prowess on this piece of trash. This is by far the worst piece of literature King has ever published."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was one bad book!","review":"I can't believe Stephen King wrote this book. There wasn't one bit of horror in it. I kept reading hoping that it would get better by the end but it didn't. What a waste of time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't a writer be multi-dimensional?","review":"From reading all these negative reviews, I have to wonder if a writer is permitted to stretch his talents and try new things.I can hear the assembled cries now, \\"Bring back the guts and the horror. Bring back psychopaths and dripping eye fluid and cateclysmic apocalypse.\\"If that's your attitude, read some Brian Lumley or something...You can like Salem's Lot and like this too. It's OK. Really.And, no, this isn't the greatest thing he's ever written, but I liked it. I thought it was fascinating and sort of sweet, yet always suspenseful.Give the guy a break. He is a savvy observer and chronicler human behavior. He writes interestingly.I guess it comes down to the fact that no matter how good Elton John is at writing musicals, people will always clamor for Don't Go Breaking My Heart.Sort of sad, really."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Disappointment","review":"Y A W N.

I'm embarrassed that I spent the time on this junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Stephen King I have read","review":"If I hadn't gotten this one in an airport, and then was a captive audience, I would never have finished it. I suppose if you were a big baseball fan, it would help your enjoyment of this book a lot. The end leaves you wondering, in fact years after reading it, I still wonder sometimes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stephen King, revisited","review":"I've been an avid reader of Stephen King's works for quite some time, reading everything of his I could get my hands on. I stopped about 4 years ago, however, when it seemed that everything he wrote sounded alike.I bought \\"The Girl Who..\\" on a whim; it was on clearance at a book store, and when I read it, I fell into it. There was no stopping until I finished it. I could almost hear the buzzing of the mosquitoes.I recommend this book to absolutely anyone. I think this was a very exploratory novel for King and he did a wonderful job of incorporating a simple lost-in-the-woods tale with a spiritual revolution for one young girl and many readers, I'm sure.No, there is no gore, it won't haunt you at night, but it is worth reading, every word. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll wish for more, so you'll read it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have You Ever Been Lost?","review":"I have. It was only for a few hours, in a dark forest, burned by a recent fire. The terror was immeasurable against anything I've ever felt in my life. I thought I would never find my way back to humans. It was only for a few hours, though. And I was in my early 20s. Imagine the fear of a child. Imagine it.This story made my heart pound with fear. It will make yours do the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing-a yawn","review":"After enjoying King's lyrical prose and some of the best storytelling I have ever read in 'Bag of Bones' and experiencing the final walk along the Green Mile, 'Tom Gordon' failed. King used the idea of being lost in the woods to try to evoke fright but never does.The best of King's new works consist of original plots mixed with remarkable dialogue-both of which are absent here.King's attempt seems to show that even the best writers have their off days-better luck next time. Any King afficiando looking to be enthralled or excited should not read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Walk Through the Woods?","review":"This was an excellent book! I am not normally a big reader of Mr.King because I usually kinda get lost but when I started this book I could not put it down. He does such a good job in relaying her adventure and her feelings...I mean I felt I was going through everything right along with her. I have never felt like that. You have got to get it, it's excellent. When I was done with the book and ran up to my room to get another one of Stephen King's books. Now I'm reading Skeleton Crew. I love this one too! You just gotta get it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"I collect Kings books in hardback only. I hate to say it but this book and his last 4 are boring. He used to write scary to where you were griped in the book while reading. Now Dean Koontz is kicking kings butt. I keep buying them out of habit but don't enjoy reading them any more. I always drift away from Kings books.They just don't have that hold on you like they used to. Sorry I don't mean to be cold. I couldn't write a book if i tried.Lynnae"},{"rating":"1","title":"Low on horror and adventure","review":"This book is great if you need instructions on how to survive in the woods. There are very few scary moments and it is hardly suspenseful. Go for Bag of Bones instead!"},{"rating":"2","title":"King's survival instincts were graphic","review":"Great book without all the gore he usually writes. I'm having my 12 year old daughter read it for the sheer survival aspects!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to the King of Horror??","review":"Being a TRUE fan of Stephen King I was disappointed by this book. His readers depend upon his writting style! This book seem hastily written and thought over. What was this bear thing in the woods and Why was it following Trisha? Nobody knows and will never know. I thought after his last \\"bad\\" novel, \\"Bag of Bones\\" He'd return to his good writing, his style, the horror he's known for. Let's get back to his true form and stop wasting our time with this dribble."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best, but not the worst","review":"Mr. King has given us an interesting new character who isn't so besieged as yet with adult horrors as to be beyond her years, but is just beginning to be adult enough to understand that the world is not as rosy as \\"grown-ups\\" would have us believe. Fascinating character study, and again (as in Gerald's Game) the themes of isolation and what the mind will do when left to its own devices. The \\"villain\\" in this story is not as horrific as usual, which was a welcome departure from previous works which have had a little too much \\"fantasy\\" in them. Almost believable, which I have to say is a fabulous quality in a Stephen King novella."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not quite a Stephen King classic. But still a good read.","review":"I read The Little Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon, with great expectations. Hoping for another classic like the Shining or The Stand. While i considered it quite good , it just left me wanting a little more at the conclusion. I think Trisha spent too much time in the woods, but not enough at the fringe of the woods where she encounters the beast who has been preying on her."},{"rating":"2","title":"King Believes in God!?!","review":"I have read a few Stephen King books, but admit I only read the ones I feel have potential to reflect Shawshank and Stand By Me qualities. Most don't but this one does. King presents a wonderful story of how baseball and God often drag the outcome to the last pitch of the last inning. As a youth pastor two things ring true, God often makes us wait until next year and then answers in the bottom of the ninth, and we don't always like the final score."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unusual Stephen King","review":"I enjoyed the book very much. Stephen King is one of my favorite authors. I found this book to be intriguing and captivating in a totally new and different style. I couldn't put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"A King story worth the crown","review":"This book was Stephen King doing what Stephen King does best: making readers squirm. The story was more realistic than many of his other adventures--The Dark Tower Series, Pet Sematary, and Black House, to name a few--and because of its more practical backdrop the main character (Trisha) was truly able to shine. There was comedy, albeit gross humor, and a true sense of danger in this tale. One felt as if what happened to Trisha could, in fact, happen to him or her, which was a terrifying prospect. That King also used hallucinations (caused by the starvation felt by the little girl) to create elaborately horrifying scenes with his monster was, again, very smart and scary. All in all, it's a good read, it's definitely worth your time, and it's a great introduction to the works of a master storyteller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book.","review":"I read it all in one day. I couldn't put it down. I had to know if she survived her ordeal or not. I would highly recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is fascinating!!","review":"If you are a collector of Stephen King's books, this is a must have. This book is well made and entertaining. I have it on display in my living room. Absolutely not complaints and I would buy it again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"predictable plot","review":"I can't believe that readers were \\"touched\\" by Trisha McFarland....how could you care when it was SO obvious that she would make it out of the woods?This story( please note: I say story, not novel!) would have been more suspenseful had the child molester in fact been in the woods...hiding from him would have seemed more plausible than being stalked for days by a bear! As to the ending, how about Trisha's parents arranging to have the real Tom Gordon come to meet her @ the hospital? Her disappearance had been publicized, so it would not have been unrealistic for a major leaguer to respond after hearing of her devotion. Now that would have been a big finish to an otherwise lame book!P.S. Believe it or not, I am a Stephen King fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stephen King knows kids and scary things.","review":"He did it again ! Stephen King knows kids and what scares most people. This time the moster is in our minds until we're half waythrough the book. Then the tension builds, while we wonder when the first confrontation will happen. The end is both suprising and exhilerating."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOOOO!!!!!","review":"hmmm....how does one say this?? this book is not very good. there was a time when this good man we all know as stephen king could put life into the dead. he took dracula and made him into a town. he brought the devil back to life in an antique store. this is the same man who reinvigorated telekenisis at a high-school prom. but those days may be over now. if this novel is any indication of a new direction, a new form, a new genre, a new anything that may be permanent, than society may have to kiss those heydays of interest a sweet goodbye. this book is as boring as most any ancient classic and without the major literary merit. i'm sorry mr. king, but if u intend to go down as one of america's greatest writers than something must be done, for to go out like this would be far from great."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great one day snack!","review":"This is not The Stand, a feast for several days, but it certainly is a very tasty snack when one's personal reading time is limited.

A wonderful lose yourself for a day book."},{"rating":"1","title":"????","review":"What happened to Stephen King and his writing style? After BAG OF BONES, I started to read this one. Very dissapointing indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is not a typical King story...","review":"nonetheless, it was extremely good, give it time, and be patient. It's one of those books you just have to let devolop. Fans of King's \\"bloodbath\\" stories won't enjoy this one too much. Enjoyment hinges on your identification with the feelings of the main character, an 8 year old girl... if you are not the empathtic type, I'd suggest finding another King book to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE \\"KING\\" HAS DEFINETELY LOST THE CROWN!","review":"After \\"Bag of Bones\\", another novel that testify the new writing style of Stephen King. I don't like it at all! The plot of this book is simple, there's only one character. In short: just a good tale for kids, nothing more, nothing less. A REAL fan of the REAL Stephen King can't to anything but missing the novels that consecrated him the King of Horror."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHERE'S THE CREAM FILLING?","review":"A good surface plot but nothing underneath.

The story is terrible, and does not even get scary until the end. It is mostly suggestion. Suggestion can be more scary than truth, but in this case, it is not. Dont buy this book, it is not worth the small amount of money that it costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Before reading this book - make strong coffee","review":"I found this book very long and drawn out, with absolutely no suspense to keep the readers interest. King's format of organizing the beginning of each chapter with baseball \\"Lingo\\" was very inventive. However, I did fine that forcing myself to finish reading his novel was close to a self-torturing act. Just ask my husband."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of Kings best...","review":"okay i LOVE stephen king.. but this book stinks.

This book is all just suggestion. It is just a big obsessive thought of this lost little girl who is only having an argument with her id (Fruedian Psychology). The god of death, who is supposedly a huge monster, without giving the ending away, is not that much of a monster after all. He is not even that strong. King also tries to include some theme in his novel. He tries to say that God does not help anybody, and is to busy to answer her prayers. I think Stephen King is running out of ideas. This book was probably more for teenagers than for adults. My advise, don't buy this book.

At night, she takes comfort in listening to her portable radio that is airing baseball games featuring MLB pitcher Tom Gordon. Eventually, she starts hallucinating and sees Tom Gordon, among other things, manifest himself into her psyche.As a Steven King fan, I can confidently say that The Girl who loved Tom Gordon is not his best work. King has written non horror type stories before and I have found them very enjoyable. This one, however, just didn't do it for me. The story went flat early on and the plot wasn't strong enough to keep the pace. All in all, the story was decent. There were simply too many gaps between points of excitement."},{"rating":"1","title":"If not for the author - this book wouldn't have been noticed","review":"The author has a big name and I love his books.

It really did move too slow. There was no attention getter at the beginning, or the middle now that I think about it. Nothing really happened. The characters were poorly developed.

They just aren't my genres. But I wanted to read something by the great Mr. King. This looked like my one option.What a beautiful book! The \\"horror\\" parts were gratuitous. Trisha's ways of coping with steadily losing her grip on reality are the heart of this book.

The whole story starts promising with family twists and so one and then suddenly we find ourselves in an enviroment which is not so scary..

A young girl lost in the woods with nothing but a few items and a great imagination. A must read for anyone who has ever been lost as a child, even if just for a hour.

I'm not a baseball fan. That aside, I always enjoy Stephen King's descriptions of people and things. He has a special, sometimes disgusting, knack for describing things that we can understand, but rarely have the ability to adequately put in writing. This book includes wonderful King descriptions; however, I think the story itself falls far short of fascinating. I expected the book to have some climactic moments, it didn't. Scary? No. Looking for a surprise ending? There isn't one. Maybe you must like baseball to appreciate this book? I finished this book and immediately felt compelled to look for the missing pieces.

It really held your interest throughout the entire book, however, I kept expecting the supernatural to be involved when she felt she was being chased by some \\"thing in the woods\\". This book has nothing to do with the supernatural, yet has more to do with the very thin line of reality and hallucination. If you go into this book knowing it has nothing to do with the supernatural, then you won't be let down and it is a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short and sweet","review":"Being a Redsox fan made this book very enjoyable for me although it would have been just as enjoyable if it had been the Yankees that the little girl fell to sleep listening to every night (well maybe not AS enjoyable) However, the story is beautifully written and although it's short, it leaves nothing out. The way King describes the landscapes makes you feel like you're right there in the woods with the little girl. And i promise that you WILL cry at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't be mislead because it's not a thick book!","review":"I will admit that with the thickness, or lack there of, of this book... even as an avid King reader... I was truly hesitant to pick it up. I am sorry I waited for those few months!Trisha, the heroin, showed remarkable bravery when she gets lost in the woods... all she wanted to do was teach a little lesson to her Mother and brother. Armed with her imagination ( sometimes the worst weapon and defense of all) and her walkman, Trisha kept trying to find a way out, only to get in deeper and deeper.This is one of the very few times that I actually hoped for the bad things NOT to happen...I wanted nothing but sunshine and butterflies for Trisha (trust me, I can't explain it either, lol)but nevertheless I was very satisfied at ALL the occurances, details, and depth of this book...I can say only one thing more... don't shy away because it's not a thick book... you'll be very pleased with your purchase!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Like the Red Sox, the reader loses again....","review":"Since the postcript mentions that this story of a young girl's trek through unknown woods was written in Florida, one can assume that it was hurriedly scribbled on the backs of notescrap after an inspired romp through the sports pages while sitting on the beach. I'm going to read this again (when I can find 30 minutes)just to make a true count of the falling down/bodily function/bug swatting/gurgling stream references. Stephen King - meet Thomas Harris. Please!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with King","review":"What happened? I finished this book and was still waiting for it to start. Storyline: Girl wanders in woods for days. That's it. No twist, no excitement, and the climax was a letdown. King must have had a contract commitment. I'll bet he wrote this in one afternoon without much thought. Don't bother with this book"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to the old Stephen King!!!","review":"Never having been a fan of mass popular fiction, I restricted myself to reading Stephen King. The old Stephen King who produced masterpieces such as IT, Misery and Bag of Bones. Wading through The girl who Loved Tom Gordon was just that; a struggle to finish it. The novel read like something cooked over the weekend to meet a publisher's deadline. It was offensive to my intellect as a reader both in its naive portrayal of the issue of religion and also the crass treatment of a teenager's nine days in the wilderness. The novel is suitable for teenagers, not adults fooled enough by the other works of King to buy this particular book. I hope that Mr. King will seriously ponder his latest novel and attempt not to fall into the trap of commerical productions whereby you had to produce anything once a year irrespective of the quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unusual, but Good.","review":"Stephen King's, \\"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon\\" was not the usual Stephen King book. However, this fairly slowed paced book turned out to be pretty good. The story of a nine-year old, Red-Sox fan, whose favorite player was the closer, Tom Gordon, touched your heart. Trisha gets lost in the woods and summons courage and maturity that many adults don't posses, to find her way out. This book took me about a week to read, however, everday that I picked the book up, i began to like it more and more. When I finished the book I new that it was a good choice to read it. Also, i would reccomend it to anyone looking for a quite-thriller."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Fall Classic","review":"King is still sharp, yes, but what is young Trisha thinking? Clearly this heroine has misplaced loyalties. She clings desperately to Gordon and the 43 straight he saved last season, but what of the post-season, Trisha? Where was that string against the hated Cleveland Indians? Where's the promised land? The fact that the streak survived another clumsy Boston October doesn't make ME feel any better, young lady. YOU need to reacquaint yourself with what it means to be a winner. The Sox don't need this kind of pre-playoff nostalgia. The ghost of Babe Ruth still haunts Fenway. Two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"I was pretty dissapointed with this book. I was expecting much more, but I did come to love the poor lost girl. It was, however, a very drawn out story--- it's only 200+ pages.

Crank out some more like this one, Stephen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best...","review":"I think this is one of the best Stephen King books I've ever read. Don't start reading this thinking it's going to be a horror story; it's more like a Stand By Me story.

The old and middle writings of King were my cup of tea! Then he changed. I no longer have any desire to finish the Dark Tower series (apparently nor does he) and what his current writing has become no longer interests me. This book deals with a nine-year-old who gets lost in the woods. Yeah, and... And that's the point. There's not anything to it. Skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"I have been a faithful Stephen King fan for as long as I can recall. This book was sadly a dissapointment to me.

Stephen King has written many good books and a few greatones. But he has also written plenty of bad ones. Bt he is human and sometimes just does not deliver. If this book had been written by Michael Nobody everyone would have a differnt opponion of this book. IT IS VERY BORING.There is nothing scarry about this book. And it is not very entertaining. Very little happens over the course of 260 pages. I can understand some people liking the book but it just is not very good. But I I give it an extra star out of sympathy. END"},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get into this book...","review":"I usually like everything Stephen King pumps out of his book writing mill...but occasionally one of his books just doesn't catch my attention. I found this book very hard to get into, it was extremely slow and I didn't even finish. My husband read it and said it does get better in the second half of the book but he agreed it was hard to get into the storyline."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE PATH!","review":"I agree with some of the earlier comments that the plot is simple & the entire phenomena can just be attributable to a kid's creative imagination combined with the pressure of being alone & lost in the woods. Afterall, who would not be driven insane if you're starved, scared, alone in a god-forseaken place. But you have to hand it to SK who was able to twirl the story & took the readers along for a walk into the woods...seeing what Trisha was seeing, hearing what she's hearing, feeling what she's feeling. Also, I noticed that despite the usual SK trademark of supernaturals (ghosts, apparitions, etc.), he seemed to point out that there is only one True God --- whether it be in the woods or not, late innings or not, baseball fan or no baseball fan --- if you truly believe & pray in Him, YOU'LL BE SAVED!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big dissappointment","review":"Compared to Bag of Bones and other Stephen King greats, this book let me down. The writting was good but the story did not seem to go anywhere. When I finished the book, I didn't feel that much happened since the second chapter. I love Mr. King's books and will continue to read them. However, I do not recommend that this be one of his books that you buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This book was too long and boring.

I was surprised it wasn't thick but it was Stephen King so I bought it. I read this book in 1 day, I think I kept reading because I was waiting for the \\"good part\\". I'm still waiting. I've read some of the other reviews and Stephen King is labeled a \\"horror\\" novelist because that is what he is and for all of you who say this is a nice change then you are not true Stephen King fans. I'm hoping his next book is like the old stuff, I'm sure he has grown as a writer but that doesn't mean he should change what he writes--just like the saying--\\"If it ain't broke, don't fix it\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"great book... but not his best...","review":"I'm a long time fan of Steven King, even though I found this book deeply involved. it's not really his best work. that's why I give it four stars. dont' get me wrong I loved the book but if I had to pick a favaorite of his this isn't it. the best book of his I've read would have to be Dorliors Clayborne. Which I found to be a break from his normal \\"Scare the Hell of you!\\" style which I do love. but this book defineitly shows King's abilaity to be so much more than just a horror writer. in fact I'm in his Libary and I can't wait to get every book he's ever writen."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Stephen King Book I've Read Left A Good Impression","review":"This was the first book by Stephen King I've read and it made me want to go straight to the bookstore and get another. It tells the story of Trisha McFarland, a 9 year old girl from New England who is hiking along the Appalachan Trail with her mother and brother. She gets separated from them and wanders through the woods getting herself lost deeper and deeper in the forest. At first, Trisha thinks she is alone but soon she discovers she is not. She senses she is being followed.

I could not put this book down. It captivated me and made me keep reading just to see if the girl survived. His descriptive details and feelings of a nine year old lost in the woods was outstanding. I love King's books and this one just added to his spark that he possess when he writes. He is truly a masterpiece writer. Thanks for writing such a real and intense novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZZzzzzzzzzz","review":"I have heard from many people that The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon was one of Stephen King's best books. I strongly disagree. Like most King books, TGWLTG had a promising start, but it just dragged on and on and on. The villain in this story did not even affect me in the slightest. The reason I am giving it 2 stars instead of 1 is because I truly cared for Trish McFarland. This 9 year-old girl had a lot of spunk, I give her that. But in the end I was thoroughly disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's tough to be a kid","review":"Just remember your childhood. Remember all of the things you had to struggle with just to make it from day to day. Remember your fear, so strong you could taste it. Now take those experiences and turn them into a parable. King has described all the things we face as kids in a lyrical story. Tom Gordon is the refuge we all sought when we were picked on at school, called on to read outloud, face our parents discord amd possible divorce. The courage and determination she shows in the face of such odds is the stuff we dreamed we could have done as kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to par.","review":"I like Stephen King, but this book was not up to his usual standard. It had the feel of a throwaway effort; maybe he wasn't really in a writing mood. It's a quick read and not boring, just not top-of-the-line King."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointing","review":"The book was allright it was very dissapointing for a Stephen King novel. The story was very lame and farfetched. Don't waste your money. Wait till it goes on a bargin book table at you local book stores!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not brand-name Stephen King","review":"While fans of horror author Stephen King may be disappointed with this mainstream novel of wilderness adventure and survival, fans of Stephen King, just plain author, ought to get a big kick out of it. Taking off his Master of the Macabre hat and taking a more than healthy dose of Gary Paulsen pills, King delivers a short, sharp tale of suspense without resorting to the usual genre trappings. No killers, no spooks, just a nine year old girl pitting herself against the environment. I loved it, and couldn't put it down. It's the first King novel that could be made into a really good Disney kids movie with almost no alterations (maybe cutting some of the language), and it's great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Try To Put This One Down!","review":"Stephen King tends to wander from every day reality in most of his novels, however \\"The Girl That Loved Tom Gordon\\" is a thrilling adventure of a circumstance that could happen to any one of us.

Skimmed about 20 pages more, then gave it back to the library. No dialogue, just thoughts going through a little girls head while she get lost in the woods. Big disappointment..."},{"rating":"1","title":"P-lease!","review":"Suddenly, King is churning out his writing. His latest work is a 20 page short story that was extended into a 200 page \\"hardback\\" for a few more \\"greenbacks.\\" The story has no real plot or even a purpose. A few of the ideas are good in the book but its mainly just plain boring. How many times can he describe the forest to the reader. Its just plants, plants, and more plants. King, stop trying to milk your readers and start producing good fiction again. By the way, Storm of the Century was another ill-conceived flop. If not, you'll turn into just another Dean Koontz and look at him now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, Stephen King never ceases to amaze me.","review":"Great book, interesting idea. This was truly a good book, would definately recomend to a person looking to start into the world of Stephen King. He has such a way of pulling you into the story, I was constantly wanting to look ahead to see what was going to happen next. The only thing it lacked was length."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great, no where nearly as good as classic King","review":"I have read almost everything Stephen King ever wrote and loved it up. This time however, I was quite disappointed. The book is (YAWN) really very slow and the plot is too simple. It would have been a better 50-70 page short story - maybe that's what it was originally and it was just stretched out to be a (very short) novel.For example, my wife asked me what the book was about and I was able to explain the plot, characters and climax to her in about 2 minutes flat. Not what I expect from Stephen King.In short, not worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A refreshing change of pace for the author","review":"This is a \\"can't put down\\" book...the story grips you from the first & won't let go. The suspense of what would happen next, and the very human nature of survival was so real. Didn't want to see the story end. One of King's best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A King Novel for the Rest of Us!","review":"This isn't a horror novel and shouldn't be construed as such. What King has done is to pen a great tale of adventure, courage, and coming of age in the story of a 12 year old girl lost in the woods. While gone, the girl comes to terms with her parents' divorce, learns to appreciate her family, including her surly older brother, and discovers a spirituality of sorts along the way, all with the help of her favorite Red Sox pitcher, Tom Gordon. Don't be driven off by that \\"thing\\" in the woods though. One word...bear."},{"rating":"2","title":"A walk in the woods will never be the same again!","review":"This is not a typical Stephen King book. But the adjective 'typical' should never be used in reference to Stephen King. There are enough vintage Stephen King sayings sprinkled throughout that give you that uneasy feeling that something is up and that the something is not good! If you ever had second thoughts about taking a walk in the woods and straying from the path, you will rethink that plan 'right fast and in a hurry' as I know Tricia wanted to do. The fact that the chapters were divided up into innings left you wondering if the 'game' was going to end in victory or defeat. It was worth the wait as all of his books are to those that enjoy a good story and a good scare."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is more like it","review":"After my total disappointment with the format of Storm of the Century, I was a little leary of buying another Stephen King book. This is more of what got me turned on to his writing style. He takes a real life situation and then weaves a story around it-made me feel like I was there in the woods with her-read the whole book from start to finish in one Sunday afternoon. Great book-way to go Steve"},{"rating":"1","title":"An underachieving novel.","review":"I understand the debate among King fans as to whether this lives up to his talent, but having read only IT and THINNER, I prefer to compare this novel to other non-King novels on the market. As such, I just don't believe there was much effort put into writing this one. It seemed like lazy writing. The plot plodded along and some of the phrases left me wondering if he could have done better. Not bad, but not great...."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD BOOK, BUT NOT ENOUGH OF THE \\"MASTER OF HORROR\\" KING!!","review":"This book was not what I expected. It wasn't as scary as all the other King books!!! It started out very slow for the first 60 pages or so, then picked up to a semi-suspense for the remainder of the book. I'm not saying that this book is boring, or not good, but that it is just different. If you want to read a King book or any book that has a little suspense and it's intense moments, but is mostly drama, this is the book for you!!! If your looking for that kind of book I promise you will love this book!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Short and sweet,wonderfully detailed. KING RULES!","review":"King amazes me with his ability to write from the point of veiw of a woman(Geralds Game, Rose Madder etc.) This book comes straight from a 9 year old girls mind! If you want to be young, scared, and lost in the woods with Stephen King, read it. It is not a gripping horror, yet it manages to put you right there with young Trisha. Dealing with the breakup of her family, she finds herself facing deeper life issues as she survives days in the woods imagining her favorite ball player is with her, giving her strength. I dare not tell more, I read it in one evening. This book is full of truths and revelations!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A little beauty","review":"This little beauty stands by itself as yet another incredible example of how King can take an ordinary situation and turn it into a cracking good read. I was initially suspicious of the length of the book, but was delighted to relish again in Kings great ability to write about a character so different in space and time to himself and still come up with something that feels completely genuine. One can genuinely identify with Trish Mcfarland and its always a constant source of amazement that king can seemlessly express the thoughts feelings and emotions of his characters-even a 12 year old girl.Kings characters are believable and interesting.Best read all at once on a cold afternoon on the sofa.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't really care what happened at the end","review":"I bought this book because my realtor's name is Tom Gordon and I was selling my house. I like a lot of Stephen King's work, but this one just didn't keep me interested. I did finish the book, so it wasn't awful, but I didn't care about the main character at the end. I could tell there was plenty of research done, and some of it was interesting, but my overall take is that somebody can have my copy. Unfortunately, the realtor wouldn't take the book off my hands!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This one reads as if someone put a stopwatch on King & said, \\"You have 24 hours to write a story. Setting: girl lost in the woods. Ready, GO!\\" 24 hours later, this is what we get. Hard to believe there are so many errors in a piece this short. It is still an engaging read -- Steve can spin a yarn. The other thing that kept me going was the knowledge, gained from reading King for almost 20 years now, that he has been known to kill off the kid and end the story tragically (see Cujo). That knowledge left the outcome uncertain, right up to the end. But this is a disappointing work, considering that King had gotten back to producing at least a few worthwhile pieces (Green Mile, Desperation, Storm of the Century) in the past few years after years of complete crap (Insomnia, Delores Claiborne, Gerald's Game)."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of King's Best !!","review":"The title sounds like some kind of love story. But no, it's the story of a little girl lost in the woods. Begins innocently enough, and before you know it, you feel as lost as she is, and just as helpless. Near the end, the character has captured your heart and you can't pull yourself away because you so want her to survive her ordeal. Her imaginary friend is Tom Gordon who appears to her and helps her survive her loneliness. Imagine a nine year old lost in the woods and trying to survive. Now that is horror. This is the 17th SK book I've read and it's one of his absolute best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Power of Belief","review":"This book was a good quick read. Made you think about how important it is to educate our children on survival. I enjoyed this story. Reminds me of things that go bump in the night. Enjoyed the girls resourcefulness and how mind over matter can make a difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Manager should've yanked King from this game","review":"Thin plotting makes THE GIRL WHO LOVED TOM GORDON minimalist Stephen King, reasonably decent entertainment for a night but without the kind of imagination this writer normally displays. Coming off the far superior BAG OF BONES, it is a very slight effort indeed and, as it is actually only novella-length, it might have been wiser to save this story for the King anthology coming out later this year. The five-star raves for this rather ordinary book are typical of undiscriminating King readers; to suggest this book is as good as THE STAND or THE DARK TOWER series or even MISERY is simply ludicrous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Atypical King -- not one of his best but a good read","review":"Although it is not the usual Stephen King book, The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon is not without its pleasures. Trisha is a spunky young heroine; you can't help but care about her. \\"Supernatural\\" aspects of the story are limited but effective. The ending is a little bit of a downer, as I would have preferred some more resolution. I think the readers who panned this book were expecting a Carrie or a Pet Sematary; to me it's more like Gerald's Game or Misery. Incidentally, I am also awaiting the next episode of The Dark Tower."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is the best book since \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\"","review":"Thank you, Stephen King. You are the best writer since John Steinbeck. I really appreciate what you have done, and how you have effected this world. I advise everyone to read this book, and every other book by him, because he is a book genius. He deserves all five stars for this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"OH WHERE, OH WHERE HAS MY STEPHEN KING GONE","review":"What happend to Stephen King when Stephen King was good. Pet Sematary: now that was a great King book. The Bachman Books are hard to beat. Rose Madder was excellent. But then comes Bag of Bones and this. King has lost his old charm and writing skill in the persuit of something more literary, and it is causing me to stick with his old stuff and other authors. The only reason I finished this book was that I listened to it on audio, and even then it was a struggle. I am a fan of Stephen King, not Jack London. ... it belongs in Young Adult Adventure. Well, I guess I am left to reading the old King and hoping that some day he'll come back in his former glory."},{"rating":"1","title":"The woman who was disappointed","review":"I haven't read a lot of Stephen King's books, but from the few I have read, I can honestly say he's capable of better than this.(I believe even Mr King admitted as much.)There is very little character development, which gives one little reason to care if Trisha escapes the woods, in fact you pretty much know she will."},{"rating":"1","title":"Representative of Recent King Dropoff","review":"I used to be a HUGE King fan. However, his recent stuff simply pales in comparison to his earlier works, and this book is a prime example. Little girl lost is NOT what King does best, and using that as his premise doomed the book from the beginning. King is at his best when he does sprawling semi-supernatural, semi-horror thrillers like IT and the Stand(two of the best horror works ever written). He is not at his best with short puff pieces. Just like Tommie himself is breaking down as a reliever, Steve is, unfortunately, breaking down as an author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Boring Boring","review":"I bought this book in an airport, depending on Stephen King to get me through a multi-hour plane ride. Imagine my disappointment. Trekking around the woods with a young girl being chased by a not-particularly scary monster. She keeps falling down, running the wrong way, etc. The allusions to the family's experience while she's missing were the strongest parts of this novel, but they are momentary. If you're a diehard Stephen King fan, get the book for your collection, then go back and read The Shining, Salem's Lot, or one of the other classics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book.","review":"\\"The Girl who Loved Tom Gordon\\" was a pretty good book. I only gave it four stars because I got lost alot in the book and could'nt figure out what he was talking about. Otherwise it is a great book. And it really isn't King's normal blood and gore book, it has a small part with a monster. But the book seemed to center more around a girl getting lost in the woods and struggles for survival."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed immensely","review":"I really enjoyed this one by Stephen King. It was one of his more logically writtn books about survival and love. A young girl with the strength and courage some of us could only wish for. I enjoyed this one immensely."},{"rating":"1","title":"An entertaining disappointment","review":"As a huge and long-time Stephen King fan, my first warning was the shortness of this book. Stephen King books are generally in excess of 400 pages, and this is a lightweight in comparison. Although some of his short books are excellent, such as Misery or Gerald's Game, I have found most of them to also be short of his standard.I found myself caught up in the story, as always with this author, with the vivid imagery and excellent character insight drawing me into the novel. I felt a real sympathy for the girl child heroine, and her thoughts rang true. However, I was left with a feeling of incompleteness. Perhaps he had to make a deadline so did not flesh out the story as he normally would have.If you're a big King fan, go ahead and get this book, but if you're looking for true horror or suspense, this does not deliver it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Book I've Ever Read!","review":"This is absolutely the worst book I have ever read. It takes TWO THIRDS of the book for something exciting to happen! And the ending is the biggest non-event I can remember. If you think that a girl walking in the woods listening to her Walkman is a great story, buy this book. I was the world's biggest Stephen King fan, but that man is riding on his name now. I'm literally offended that he would put this rag up for sale and take my hard-earned money. Save yourself the four bucks and buy some Nytol instead - they will both have the same effect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stephen King Light","review":"This is a great book that differs a bit from King's usual horror-fiction. Eventsare told from a single character perspective and we are left at the end wondering whether they actually occurred or were a figment of a young girl's imagination. The book is fast-paced and short making for a quick read. It should appeal to younger readers and those who like a suspenseful story with horror elements without a lot of 'blood and guts' killing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ever wade through an endless swamp with flies eating you?","review":"Well, if not, you should read this book and see how heroic Trisha is. Trisha is a 9-year-old with an active imagination, but if you've ever been lost in the woods, her imagined monsters may seem just a bit more real to you. By the way, the Tom Gordon reference alludes to Trish's facsination with a professional baseball player. Fortunately she go lost in the woods while carrying a radio in her backpack, and despite being miles from civilization, she can still listen to baseball games at night. These keep her company, and they also help her stay connected to her dad, as Trisha and her dad share baseball as a common interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite S. King novels","review":"This is one of my all time favorite of Stephen King's novels. Everyone should read it.I read it many years ago but still remember how much I enjoyed it. I don't always enjoy his novels, but this is one I kept to re-read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best King to Date","review":"I'm not a big fan (ok, but still a fan) of King's, but this book was excellent! Ya, not so scary as some (just finished Desperation a few weeks ago - more scary!), but a well crafted novel about a small girl lost in the New England north woods. No drooling, dissolving monsters in this book...just the kinds of \\"things\\" that any of us - adults included - could imagine if we were lost in the woods at night (or many nights in the case of this book). Highly recommended and a fast read as it is fairly short for a King novel. Good work Stephen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"OK","review":"even though i was disappointed when i realized that this book is a pshycological thriller and not Kings classic horror and bone-chilling books i got over it fast because this is a good book. Im glad that King kept it short and got straight into the plot, unlike many other of his books where he takes 200 pages to introduce to you his characters. I thoroughly enjoyed this book up until the ending because after King took you to such peaks and realizations about Trisha's state of mind i would have preferred a more appropriate ending or way in which the outcome occured, but then again who am i to critic King, a master writer? I would recommend this book because King kind of toys with Trisha's mind, and the readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WORST BOOK I'VE EVER READ!!!!!!!!","review":"If I could, I'd give this book NO STARS!!! It was absolutely the most boring, nothing book I've ever read....and I love Steven King. Poorly written (I swear, he wrote it in the hospital while under anesthesia), no story, no suspense. I kept waiting for something to happen, for some suspense, for an interesting story, but this book bored me to tears. In fact, I speed read the last half of the book just to get to the end to see if something interesting would happen, but nothing did. Was this written for a 9 year old????? It sure seemed like it. Please, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!! I can't say enough awful things about this awful book. STEVEN KING, WHAT WAS WRONG WITH YOU???!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted this book to be special...but was left wanting","review":"I simply felt the story had alot of potential but never got off the ground. There was a number of moments when I thought \\"ok, here we go, it's \\"King Time\\"\\", and the moment went away. The drive of the writing was something of a Stephen King who seemed uninterested in embelishing or even finishing the story at his usual level of excellence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this Stephen King?","review":"If you have read the other books by King, then you don't find his ability to create a 'cosy, creepy' athmosphere in this book. Also there are no characters he has elaborated (not even the girl). Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was Stephen King?","review":"I finished to read this book yesterday... 2 days after I bought it... I found it like a tale for teen-agers!

On a hiking trip Trisha wanders of the trail to escape another session between Pete and her mum then becomes lost.This is an amazing tale of a little girl's survival in the Maine wilderness. A big fan of baseballer Tom Gordon she tunes into his games on a radio with fading batteries for inspiration and hope. This is not your typical King novel and will appeal to both horror fans and those who do not like that sort of thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aburrido","review":"Empece a leer este libro con la esperanza de verme sumido en los placeres que solo el sentir miedo nos da.

This is only the second novel by him that I have read. I found it a very simple and very exciting novel. It's about a girl who gets lost in a forest, but she realizes she is not alone. It's very excellent and it will take you only a day to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Ending","review":"When you pick up the book and read the first page, it looks like a pretty good book. You keep reading and like it, it builds up to an ending,suspense,suspense,suspense, stupidity.It is the worst ending Stephen King has ever written. It seems a good book about a girl lost in the woods, with something after her, it gets you excited about the ending, then disappoints you. I don't reccomend it at all, just skip it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just when you thought it was safe to go back into the woods","review":"After reading Jaws, my carefree days at the beach were ruined forever. Likewise, after listening to The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon, my camping gear was sold at the next yard sale. While I can laugh off vampires and resurrected pets, getting lost in the woods could happen to anyone. Trisha's indefatigable courage was awe inspiring. I don't think I would last nine hours alone in the forest, much less nine days. Anne Heche's child-like voice as nine year old Trisha is perfect and the story is wonderful. Please, Mr. King, give us more books like this.

But what else is new.","review":"The man writes like it's an obligation (which, contractually, it probably is). Perhaps if we stopped buying his drivel (face it, he's written nothing since The Shining/Stand/Salem's Lot era), perhaps he would be content to sit down and write one good novel ever two years or so rather than one bad one ever four months. And with this latest...man, finishing his stuff lately is a chore. Little trisha isn't the only one lost in this \\"novel.\\" Forget it. Wait for the TV movie. And then don't watch it, either."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Thrill is Gone","review":"I just love reading King, I think 90% of what he's written is pure genius, but this one falls short on many levels. No excitement, no thrill, not much of a plot either. Maybe this might satisfy juveniles, I don't know. I didn't find the young heroine particularly interesting, although she is clever enough to stay alive. But the book died somewhere early on. I can't say pass this one by since King is a great writer and there's always something to admire in how he writes, but not all his stories are worth the energy to read. I admit I like King's crazed psychopaths best, but I also appreciate his tamer stuff, usually. Not this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great storytelling and chapter titles, lousy story","review":"This was a great disappointment. This had a lot of posibilities. There was no supernatural, unless you consider Trisha's imagination. Placing yourself in her situation, it was frightening. However why didn't Trisha observe the first rule taught to all who are lost in the woods: \\"hug a tree.\\" After all she did learn some survival techniques from school and her mother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Stephen go back to writing horror.","review":"This is another example of Stephen King writing well but not writing his genre. The writing is first rate and the characters are good but the story was certainly not up to snuff. So I say again, PLEASE STEPHEN KING GO BACK TO WRITING HORROR!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"I was quite disappointed with this one. I usually love Stephen King, but I have to admit this was slow going. A girl is lost in the woods......with a lame ending. If you're looking to be scared about being in the woods....rent \\"The Blair Witch Project\\" and watch it by yourself at night. I'm just glad I borrowed this book and didn't purchase it. Stephen King has MUCH better books. Maybe next time.........."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Dull Cliche","review":"A young girl is lost in the woods. Period. A reader waiting for that great Stephen King plot twist or suspense will be utterly disappointed. King's book starts out with an intriguing first chapter, but everything afterwards is a tedious account of Tricia's prolonged nature walk. No surpises here, but plenty of lost-in-the-woods cliches."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Reading for the continuously evolving \\"King\\" reader.","review":"Let your imagination run away with this one and you will be right in the middle of the woods (bug bites and all)with this wonderful 9 year old girl. The thought that this scenaro could actually happen is what makes it truly scary. The \\"thing\\" in the woods was a little disappointing at the end but otherwise a very good read!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Disappointment!","review":"I've been a Stephen King fan for years, but this one takes the cake. It was a boring and predictable story. This book would be good for pre-teens who are interested in beginning to read science fiction. A horror book it is NOT. I barely stayed awake to read the end which I had already figured out in chapter one! The only good thing about this book is it was SHORT."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL","review":"This book was a waste of time and money!There was no character development, the story was weak and predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"He can't write and his fans can't read","review":"Kings best work is still the two weeks of Guiding Light episodes he wrote in '77. All of his books run together in a mush of slippery allusions which read more like aspersions. Yeah the woods are scary and McDonalds is too and so is the fact that Stephen King sells more books than Jimmy Carter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stephen King Flopped with this book.","review":"I am an avid reader of any Stephen Kings books and expected much more from him then this book offered. It was very slow and had a very boring, repetative plot. The book is based on a little girl who gets lost and does the same thing day in and day out, over and over again. If you would like a excellent adventure..check out some of Bently Little's books."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was a short story gone long.","review":"Stephen King got long winded with this short story and had to publish it as a book. Don't waste your time reading this boring story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not typical King, but a very good read","review":"I finished this book a couple of nights ago and I found it to be wonderfully written and with a very good story line. This is not typical King, it does not have the intense shock value of books like \\"The Regulaters\\" or \\"Pet semetery\\" {\\"Pet Semetery\\" being my favorite King book} I can understand how some found the book slow and lacking in the shock department, I will admit that the girl acts and thinks in a way that is older then a nine year old but this is a great read non the less. If you are new to King, check out \\"Pet Semetery\\" and \\"Cujo\\" before you read this one and I think you will be able to enjoy it more."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Girl who loved Tom Gordon","review":"Out of all the horror novels I have read, this is the only one that really scared me. It was very well written, and it kept you wanting to read more, and more, and more...I would think that anyone that likes to read horror fiction would like to read this book. Also, anyone who likes to read about people overcoming their fears. This is a thrilling novel and anyone scared easily should NOT read this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZZZ","review":"First, let me say that I am a huge fan of Stephen King, but I did not like this book. I was utterly bored and couldn't force myself to finish. It was so slow and the story wasn't compelling at all. Such a disappointment after Bag of Bones!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well I liked it anyway","review":"It took me one night to read this- even if the plot did seem to 'drag' King has a way of making you (well some people) need to know the outcome. His clever use of language as a tool of suspense was a major drawcard. Even though I am Australian and have know idea (and don't really care) about baseball, it didnt matter to me- I still found it an effective little novel. I dont think anyone else other than King could get way with the dodgy 'monster' or 'God of the Lost' or whatever it was. It was a scary being until the end when it revealed itself. Still, I kept on reading because King has this knack of making you want to find out what happens. I can see where some people might find it lame- its not everyones idea of a good scare, but I really did enjoy it for the simple fact that King has that effect on me- even in some of his really lacklustre novels (Regulators, Thinner)he still has a way of leading you to the end of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A King is back","review":"First I can say that King has returned to the better stories. A girl, nine years old, loosing her way into another world, trying to survive, and \`something' following her trying to get her, it can only be a King story. In my view it can become a story that easily fits in some like Robinson Crusoe and Lord of the Flies."},{"rating":"2","title":"A treatise of faith.","review":"This book was an incredibly compelling and wonderfully moving statement of faith: \\"It is God's nature to come on in the bottom of the ninth.\\" This book was almost torturous at times, seeing desperate levels of hardship blurring the lines between human and animal. Yet it never gave up hope, rooting the human (American) spirit in the game of baseball. This book called to mind another book, early evidence of King's insight into the human condition. Those who are disappointed by the book are probably the same who thought that \\"Cujo\\" was a story about a dog. I kept thinking of the \\"monster words,\\" and the realization that there are monsters in life. This time however, the monster shows itself and faith throws the curve ball in the bottom of the ninth. A fabulous story!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wake me up when its over...","review":"Not since Gerald's game have I been so dissapointed in a King novel. I'm still waiting for something to happen and I've already read every page. Am I missing the point??? I'm not one of those readers who believe that King is only good when writing horror, but this book really failed to reach me. I'm surprised that the other reviews are so glowing. I think King should spend a little more time thinking about his next book before sending this out to his adoring fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable and childish outing","review":"A very disappointing novel; the pre-adolescent narration was painful to read, and the plot was predictable on every occasion. Save your money and reread The Shining or Misery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I thought Storm of the Century was an aberration but this is way worse. This is a book about abolutely nothing. Nothing at all happens. Red Riding Hood is a better story and I'm truly disappointed in 'The Girl who loved Tom Gordon'. When you compare this book to some of the masterpieces King has written such as 'Salems Lot' and 'The Stand', you realise this was written very quickly and maybe just to fulfill obligations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and Intelligent Look at Being Lost in the Woods!","review":"This book exemplifies King's ability to thoroughly develop and interact with his characters. By the end of the book, King had brought me to the point where I really cared about what became of Trisha. The story was not as exciting or imaginative as some of Stephen King's other tales, but the book was still very entertaining considering it was 90% monologue. I definitely recommend this book to anyone looking for a great character novella (also it is easy and entertaining reading for the beach or poolside)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine addition to King's fine work.","review":"This is one of the most restrained and tasteful of King's books. This story is great for a few hours reading. It is short and one of King's most together plot lines. It's full of testament to his writing skills and a good break from his over the top works for his constant readers. This is not a brain buster. The simplicity and the perfection in which it plays out is masterful. Kid gets lost- and this is what goes on in her head, how she keeps it all together without letting the dark creepy forrest get the best of her. A few scenes away with the relatives and police... Kid gets into trouble and nobody knows how real the trouble is or if it happened at all. When something bad happens to her you may feel a slight knot in your stomach and when something nice happens to her you feel a little bit relieved yourself. It's all in good fun. A really perfect short read, great Sunday evening material. A great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Typical King But Pretty Good","review":"This book was as I said in the title not typical King but not all that bad. The only thing that really bothered me with this book is the lack of dialogue and writing that would hold the reader throughout the whole book.The book is about young Trisha McFarland that gets lost in the woods fromher mother and brother. Bascially the book is a story of self survival and she does this by imagining that Tom Gordon, the relief pitcher for the Boston Red Sox, is with her. Using this and her radio, she finds the strength inside of her to go on. She finally makes it and has a final showdown with the \\"thing\\" that was scaring her.Although not horrible I wouldn't recommend it over any other King book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor attempt at something new (New is Ok, poor is NOT!)","review":"I hate to jump on the band-wagon of negativity, but let's analyze the book. Probably a great book if you're a young teenager. However, the plot, storyline, and characters do NOT receive the intricate development that SK is so well known for. The anatagonist is weak to say the least (what's up with this bear). Put aside the issue that this is not a \\"horror\\" book. Authors should be able to expand their topics. However, I have followed SK since the mid 1970's (since Carrie), and this book does not live up to his talent. I believe he's resting on his name on this one. As a collector, I had to get it anyway, but unless you collect SK, don't waste your time. I only hope his next work (available 9-14-99) is better. Horror, or otherwise, SK is an excellent author, but this is not worthy of the tree that died to print it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you say, \\"Boring\\"?","review":"This was the worst book that I've read in a long, long time. It was so predictable and definantly was a boring ciche. Even if you do like baseball there was only like three games that Trisha listened to and they weren't all THAT exciting. I don't recomend this book to anyone, unless they need to fall asleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"The worst book I've ever read in my life.I can't believe this book ever got published.Don't waste your time like I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is just a book about a little girl lost.","review":"I am an avid fan of Mr.King's but this was not one of his better books.

I put this in Stephen King's \\"uh-oh\\" list!"},{"rating":"1","title":"get lost! 0 stars","review":"The main character is totally off the wall unbelievable. There is no real story. I mean you can only read so much about the flora and fauna of the woods.

It gave me a headache, as did Storm of the Century."},{"rating":"1","title":"An added thought...can one give zero stars?","review":"King can't write children...his kids always have the sensibilities of a 40-year-old....and he can't write women. Beyond that, he no longer can write. Period. Pity. He used to be so good. Last hope...dark tower. Should have packed it in a long time ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Girl Who Hated \\"Tom Gordon\\"","review":"(I apologize in advance for my baseball puns)What happened to the psychological thrillers of the 70's, or even the cheap dime-store paperback slash-gore novels King has produced in the past? The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon is basically driven by the general American standard: a young girl lost in the woods who loves baseball cannot die. So right off the bat, you know that anything that happens in the novel has to be about her struggle, meaning the meat instead of the bread of the book has to surpass. Unfortunately neither really step up to the plate. The finale, the grand unveiling of our monster du jour is so anti-climactic, disappointing and dull that it leaves one wondering: is King even trying anymore? If you want to wash out the bad taste Gordon has left in your mouth, pick up \\"The Dead Zone\\", by far a superior novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst King book I've read","review":"I am a huge Stephen King fan. I have read several of his books and have loved them all. Then I came across this horrible dissapointment. The entire book is centered around one girl who I found extremely annoying. Stephen King has written so many great books, so don't waste your time with this one. Instead read Four Past Midnight or The Eyes of the Dragon...those were great books."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book Was Not Even Scary","review":"This is one of the worst Stephen King books I've ever read. It wasn't even scary and it took me two weeks to read it. If it was better I could have read it in two days. This book did not keep me on the edge of my seat, and I would never reccommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book ever by Stephen King","review":"No doubt this is the worst book by Stephen King after Geralds Game. I forced very hard to read this book but after 200 pages, once again: 200 pages I dont found any suspenseful paragraph even words! Dont waste your money buying this book. Except you are a teenagers who love adventure genre (lonewolf,etc.) and not like a disturbing book, like IT, PetSemetary, THe Shining,etc. If you like to comment this review or just want to discuss with me about SK e-mail me at: indopsycho@yahoo.com"},{"rating":"1","title":"jazzer","review":"This was one on the least interesting books I've read. Didn't anyone else notice how absurd the so called \\"monster\\" bear was?

It would have been more interesting if he had used a \\"real\\" monster instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horror? I don't think so.","review":"This book should not be in the Hot Horror section of Stephen King's novels. There is nothing horrific in it. It's about a little girl lost in the woods, period. I kept waiting for something to happen. It's a good thing I was listening to it on a CD when I exercise and just kept on listening until I was finished, otherwise it would have been one of those books you get a few chapters into and never open it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not King's best","review":"I originally bought this book at Sam's when I saw a poster that said they had the new Stephen King book. I bought it and began reading it instantly. I loved the description that Mr. King used and was brought in by the tale of Trisha becoming lost in the woods. However, I was soon disapointed because of how very little action began to happen. There were many pages of flashbacks that didn't fit into the story that well. I became lost about two-thirds of the way through and lost interest due to the \\"supernatural\\" events. The ending was quite a disapointment as many of Mr. King's books are. Now, you are probably wondering why I gave this book 4 stars with all of these complaints. Well here are the good sides: A. It is a good story B. It is vividly descriptive C. It was written by Stephen King!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn...what a bore!","review":"I borrowed this audiobook from a relative and found it to be so boring that I had to give it back without finishing the story. From what I can tell, the plot consists of a mother, daughter, and son who fight constantly yet end up going on a hiking trip. This trip is supposed to consist of some quality family time, but ends up in another mother/son fight. In the middle of all the fighting, the daughter (Trisha) ends up stopping to go pee in the woods, which ends up with her getting seperated from her family. And the rest of the story is about her being scared and lost in the woods. It just wasn't very interesting to hear about how scared she was and how she couldn't find her way back to her family. There wasn't a scary twist to it...just a girl lost in the woods."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it time for Stephen King to \\"take a hike?\\"","review":"Another over-hyped disappointing read by S.K.

The story plodded tiredly along, just like Trish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Being both an avid Stephen King AND Red Sox fan, I loved it!","review":"Being a Stephen King fan from the beginning and a Red Sox fan for forty years, I couldn't put it down. Stephen King's ability to make you \\"see\\" his characters is truly amazing. Having been to Fenway Park, I could see what Patricia was seeing.

Only someone from the East would probably know right away she was putting \\"chocolate sprinkles\\" on the ice cream. Keep writing, Mr. King."},{"rating":"1","title":"Collectors value only","review":"Well, the last few King works have been less than appealing. This one in particular takes a new low...boring. It was an easy read, but what horror is it to us (presumeably adults) that a little girl is lost in the woods. I would have liked to have read more about what was going on with the family of the little girl during her misadventure. This one is best left to the collectors (myself included). Please Steve, more horror like what I read in 'IT', 'CUJO', 'SALEM'S LOT', etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, but I wanted more.","review":"This was truly a great book that amazed me because it certainly wasn't his usual work. It kept me interested, but I wish it was a bit longer! I can't believe it ended when it did. There were a few situations that weren't developed enough (caller with misleading info about Trisha). Otherwise, I really liked it. Suspenseful, and exciting, no doubt!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a book for the younger set.","review":"I think this book should have been marketed or labeled to the correct readers, 15 and under. This was pretty tame, pretty lame and just plain boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"King strikes out with \\"Tom Gordon\\".","review":"\\"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon\\" was an okay novel. As an avid reader of Stephen King, I bought this book with great expectations. Being lost is one of my biggest fears and if anyone can put this into words, Stephen King can right?....WRONG! This book would have been so much better if it was written as a short story. King spent too much time with lame explantations and not enough time on things such as \\"The God of The Lost.\\" The book was too reality based, although it picked up toward the end. My suggestion for any potential readers of this book is to skip the entire middle of the book; read the very beginning and the very end (Top of the First and Bottom of the Ninth). The middle of the book could best be described as \\"The Girl Scout Camping Survival Guide.\\" A definite disappointment Mr. King."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a Quickie to Make Money","review":"AHHHHH!!!!

I really can't believe, that this once wonderful author of shockers like \\"It\\", \\"Pet Semetary\\", \\"The Shining\\" or \\"Salem's Lot\\" has written down such a lame story. I must say, that I knew this story would be boring, but I bought it just for the baseball scenes in it - and these are pretty good. But could one honestly say that this novel has something like an interesting \\"plot\\"? No! A girl, struggling for survival in the woods - or: wandering around -, that's not a story I would want to read a second time. That's barely enough for a short story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Being a Red Sox fan helped...","review":"After being to a couple of Red Sox games this year, and seeing the flashing red banner talking about Tom Gordon being a character in Steven King's new book, I had to read it. I started it Saturday afternoon and was done Sunday night. I got to a point where I felt that I had to speed up reading it or else I was going to give in and read the last page. I don't know if that is a compliment or not! But, I did enjoy it and it certainly kept my interest. It was not up there with Misery, but it was certainly well written. Unfortunetly, I had just finished it when I heard on the news the tragic accident Steve was in. Thank goodness he survived and will recover! My thoughts are with him.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enthralling, a new departure for a master.","review":"Stephen King is a master storyteller and proves it again with The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon.

Although the premise sounded quite good, the book isn't. It fails on the most basic point: You do not care very much about the little girl, she is utterly unengaging. She talks like an adult (and I don't refer to the four-letter-words she uses) - a beginner's fault for every writer: You don't just say that a character is nine years old - you also WRITE him/her as a nine year old. Furthermore, the incedents that happen to her aren't particulary interesting. The only joy in this short novel is King's writing style - which still shines in some places. Even though the book is quite short, I would exchange it with Mr. King's brickstones any day.

Stephen wrote of his methods in \\"Danse Macabre\\" and now it's time to move on.\\"The Girl...\\" is not without some fun (in the King sense) but why try to shoehorn the gimmicks to fit the story.Someday (soon I hope), King will drop his compulsion to shock and gross-out and simply write a good story.

I found it boring, the main character was okay, but I found it hard to believe that a nine yr. old girl would say some of the things that she did. All in all, when I was finished reading it, I thought what Trisha thought at the end, \\"That's it? That's all there Is????\\" Very disappointing.(Especially for $16.00)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"As a rule I love Stephen King...but not this time.

And what was up with that wasp guy? How wierd did he get?No offence to Stephen King but I think that he is flat out crazy!He needs to write a novel that actually makes sence! Who cares what a descriptive writer he is, if you dont have a decent plot, than the story in ruined.I give Stephen King credit for at least attempting to write a decent novel.He is an exellent writer wiht great potential.All he needs to work on is a better plot and story."},{"rating":"1","title":"unappealing","review":"i took up this book because i expected something much more than the book actually has.I has very little to give the readers.Its just BORING.This was the the first Stephen king that i read and i was really dissapointed.But the desciption of the woods is very well written in the book.That is the only plus point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad try stephen.

The book was a great dissappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inexcusable","review":"This book is so horrid I don't even know how to convey it. Like Gerald's Game, this book doesn't have enough of a plot to keep you interested. It is basically just this little girl wandering about the woods, and trying to survive. King is an enigma because in latter years he is trying to write diffently than his successful ventures! He needs to stick with what he began with-horror, suspense, etc. This story should be labeled young adult. I think teens might enjoy it. Maybe."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK.

It was not up to the author's usual standards. It wasn't boring, but it was predictable. It was obvious the big, bad monster was going to turn out to be a bear.

The controls were a no-brainer to figure out and it was just about impossible to screw this game up. It doesn't allow you to go anywhere or do anything that isn't required to finish the game.

The recording is of outstanding quality and both Brook's and Gasparyan's playing is first class. The album blends two very distinct musical styles - the simple sound of Gasparyan's duduk with the sweeping, otherworldly sound of Brook's \\"infinite\\" guitar. Gasparyan also sings on a few tracks and his vocals are mesmerising. All in all, a wonderful album. My only disappointment is that it is too short at just over 44 minutes. At the completion of the album, I was left hungry for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"East meets West in the wide blue yonder","review":"I confess I am a sucker for anything put out by the maestro Djivan Gasparyan. How does one explain the sound - the emotions - conveyed by the duduk in words? Impossible! It's like trying to describe the glory of spring blossoms to the blind. Okay, enough poetic license. What makes this album worthy of repeat plays (besides Gasparyan) is the extremely rare musical sensibility of Michael Brook. His past collaborations with musical greats like Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan (Night Song) and U Srinivas (Dream) have been outstanding. He does not disappoint us this time either, although the use of some hackneyed guitar riffs on a few tracks precludes a 5-star rating. In found the songs \\"Freedom\\", \\"Dark Souls\\" and \\"Take My Heart\\" in particular, positively haunting. Overall, a welcome addition to any discerning collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"blaahhk!!!","review":"I'm a fan of Gasparyan's work, and an avid Realworld follower, but this collaboration with Brook is the worst album I have heard by these artists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the Purchase","review":"I had long wanted to see \\"Winchester 73\\" for quite a while, due to the storyline and Jimmy Stewart headlining. I rarely buy a DVD before viewing it first, and when I do decide to purchase , it usually requires even more debate. I took a chance and bought it because I love westerns and I love Jimmy. Not only was I satisfied with the main plot, which was only a back-drop for the film's multiple sub-plots, but every scene was interesting which is difficult to pull off in any film. The movie was well paced and had good action sequences. I won't delve into any one scene because I don't want to give anything away, but I will say this: check out a young Rock Hudson in a small but memorable role as a...well you'll just have to see it for yourself. The best extra in this item is easy: the commentary by the one an only MR. STEWART. This DVD was well worth the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie review","review":"It was an old old movie, but I liked it because the actors were so good. The story is credible and at the time the movie was made it was very realistic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Western, Incredibly Poor DVD Transfer","review":"It's a real shame how badly this film was transferred to DVD. Much of the DVD is fine; some sections of it look better than I've ever seen in any other format, displaying the excellence of the black-and-white photography. But other sections are grainy and marred by distracting visual noise, and that isn't the worst of it: In several places during the film, the DVD \\"jumps\\" from one scene to another because obviously the source material was so poor! It's like watching a worn-out, popping film in a run-down theater! This is something I can't ever recall on a DVD transfer of a film as exciting and important as \\"Winchester '73.\\"The interview with Jimmy Stewart as he watches the film with the interviewer is interesting, but the \\"Winchester\\" DVD overall ranks as a *MAJOR* disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great western","review":"This is an awesome Western starring James Stewart as a man trying to get his Winchester that he won. This movie also stars: Shelley Winters, Dan Duryea, Stephen McNally, Charles Drake, John McIntire, Jay C. Flippen, Rock Hudson, plus others and featuring Tony Curtis as a union solider. This movie runs for about 92mins (1hr 32mins), is in B&W and is in Fullscreen format. Overall this is a must have for Western fan or fans of these stars. I would recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable","review":"I love westerns, but to me Jimmy Stewart is just \\"OK\\". But this movie is very good and Jimmy while the main character, is probably only in half the scenes. Quite an interesting gimmicky plot, especially when Jimmy first walks into the saloon in Dodge City. Very cool. Wyatt Earp and Jimmy's sidekick are good too. Fun movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Western","review":"I fondly remember watching this movie when I was a kid, and it was fairly old then. I don't believe a single scene was filmed on an indoor set or with fake backgrounds. The outdoor feel of it adds to the realism. Jimmy Stewart aside (what can you say about him?), Dan Duryea, Will Geer, Millard Mitchell, and Stephen McNally (and many others) assemble for a great cast. For me, this movie has definitely stood the test of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!!","review":"My all time favorite western!! I remember watching this movie with my dad, and now that I'm an adult, I own the DVD and bust it out whenever I'm in the mood to see the good guy win!! The first gun I ever bought was a lever-action Winchester because I wanted one after watching this movie!! Do yourself a favor and watch this movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic in the purest sense!!","review":"This is a \\"don't miss\\" classic that is fit for family viewing (my 10 year old is hooked on old westerns now). Being a Western junkie I was surprised I had never heard of this one - I was missing one of the greats! James Stewart is unforgettable as a man determined to set the record straight. Cameos by Rock Hudson and Tony Curtis were surprising to say the least. This film has my highest recommendation to anyone who has enjoyed other westerns such as; Stagecoach, Tombstone, or Unforgiven. Do not be disswayed by the fact that it is in black and white. In fact, the B&W attitude adds to the overall drama of the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"A western to remember!","review":"Winchester 73 is - at first sight - a simple story around a man who loses his beloved rifle to a thief , and his ceaseless pursue his priceless weapon as it passes from hand to hand.But Anthony Mann recreates the plot with significant insights that compensates by far, the whole script Fine direction and superb cast make the rest in this brisk - paced film."},{"rating":"2","title":"so much quite drama!","review":"I couldn't believe all the quite drama in every single character in this movie despite its slow pace!!!! It may take you awhile to get into it, someone may even find it boring....but I ended up watching the whole thing even though I like faster paced movies. Made me think.....drama is crazy though, almost tears you up inside."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great cast cannot save a horrendous film","review":"Despite a cast that ought to be a recipe for success, \\"Between Strangers\\" is a plodding film that recycles cliche after cliche after cliche. The characters are one dimensional; the dialogue is amateur, and though the cinematography is rather good, the editor should have been fired. Films that deal in human relationships need to be directed with an eye for nuance and subtlety. It is as if Ponti had fashioned whatever point he was trying to make into a spike and then drove it into your head with a hammer.Lacking the sophistication of \\"Lost In Translation\\", the loving and poignant melodrama of \\"Far From Heaven\\" and the sense of urgency of \\"The Hours\\"--a flawed but very worthwhile film--\\"Between Strangers\\" is not even adequate. There is, alas, really nothing good to say about this film. That is a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two Smart Girls Grow Up","review":"I would have rated it three stars if it would have had all three girls from the Original but since it didn't two stars. The plot drags and while Deanna gives a good performance it was hard to see Helen Parrish as Kay Craig. Kay grew up all right she grew up into an entirely different person! Nan Grey's presence is nostalgic as was Charles Winninger reprising his role but it lacks what Three Smart Girls had-fun! The songs however are very good. An uneven sequel that proves that even during Hollywood's Golden Age sequels have never really worked."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of the Disney's Dinosaur books","review":"This is the best of the Disney's Dinosaur books to date. It contains numerous wonderful photos from the movie, all reproduced on good quality paper and in good quality tones as is characteristic of DK books. It is not written in storybook format, so if you're looking for a read-aloud narrative this would not be the best choice. However, if you're looking for the most thorough and comprehensive way to re-experience the details and nuances of the film, this is the book to get."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"The tubes were half empty and the consistency was odd for a gel...almost liquidy.

Fallen on it skiing and it still hasn't broken. For an active 20yr old kid it can't be beat. I haven't had problems with indoor pictures as others have said.

It was the letting of the blood that converted them into morons. This film runs with that premise as did \\"Simple Plan\\" and \\"Blood Simple\\". Two deputy sheriffs come across a crime scene that seems too good to be true and within fifteen minutes they become thieves and murderers. From that original activity, all hell proceeds to break loose. This film also has a good natured sense of humor about it and you will find yourself at times laughing at the two leads and their descent into criminality. Well done.

(I could have bought a shop vac for each of my tool for the price of my installation).After reading more litterature on the subject I realized that this book contains a lot of errors and describe system that are appropriate for hooking up 1 or 2 machine sitting next to the dust collector.The numbers describe to estimate the power of your dust collector, the size of your pipes, the CFM requirement of your tools are very underestimated.Some illustration are also showing stuff not to do like having long run of flexible pipe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Enough","review":"There's just not enough in this guide to competently set up a system.

Not any more! Since William Gaines passed away and Barbara Fairchild took over, it's become a love letter to yuppies who frequent gourmet markets. Like the Aug. issue: under Every Night Cooking they suggest Portuguese Clams with Linguica and Tomatoes. Not at my house! And the people they profile are not down-to-earth every day people, but wealthy yuppies at their summer home in the Hamptons trooping to the beach with their Sancerre and couscous. Give me a break!

Gourmet is nice but focuses more on travel. Food and Wine is OK, but focuses more on wines. I like all the other cooking magazines for different reasons, but I think that Bon Appetit does a great job publishing fantastic recipes the best. The recipes are not usually quick, easy ones, but, then again I enjoy cooking somewhat complicated dishes that take time to prepare.

You will find that they are not redundant but rather complement each other. Bon Appetit is really much more heavy on the recipe side and brings a wider variety of day-to-day great cooking ideas and techniques. It is also a fabulous magazine as far as the restaurant reviews go. All the recipes are well researched, and I have never had a problem cooking or baking anything from Bon Appetit, on the contrary: most of the recipes I have tried, have been great successes and lasting favorites. The holiday special issues are always wonderful, each year the editors find new and wonderful ways to create that extra special holiday gathering. The overall quality of the magazine throughout the year is very high, in both writing, research and photography/grafics. This mag is worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Make a lady happy with a subscription","review":"Amazon sometimes makes it hard to say \\"no\\" to spending money.

This year, however, will be my last.The magazine has been overhauled. It used to be full of fabulous recipes, travel stories about food, wine information ... everything you needed to really get to know and create food. Now, it is no better than a 30 minute Rachel Ray show. In other words, you'll get something to eat but it won't be special and you won't learn anything if you are already an accomplished cook.The design used to be clean and simple. Now, it is cluttered and might as well have a feed running across the bottom.Instead of it being a magazine for people who love to truly embrace the culinary arts, it has become just another magazine about food.

What few recipies they do have don't explain why they chose the ingredients used or give much detail at all.If you consider yourself a 'foodie' who likes to go to fancy restaurants and likes to know what's hip on the latest gourmet food and wine, then this magazine might be for you.

They are like one of those bands you would see at the Continental or CBGB's every weekend. They started in 2002 and now this is their first full-length album. The songs are short and simple. There is a sketch of them on the cover of this. At least the Ramones let us have a photo. Every song like \\"Future\\" only has three or four chords. All the songs are verse-chorus-verse. There are no guitar solos. The vocals by Noor Jahan. Her voice is very quiet for a punk band. There are many of these types of bands in San Francisco and Los Angeles, and when I see them, I usually hate them. Mob Stereo doesn't really have any catchy tunes. They seem being comfortable being this tame band. I wish there was more energy on this record. When you get the song \\"Revolution\\" you wish for something faster with more excitement, not a ballad.

Then add the backdrop of the Duke of Monmouth's return during the reign of King James, so there's rebellion, insurrection and treachery on all sides. That's pretty much what this title gives you, along with a healthy dose of Sabatini-style chivalry.It's a rollicking read--you never know what's going to happen next, but suspect it'll keep getting worse and worse for our hero. Yes, the characters are a little unround and not far from 'types', but for tense plotting and a very Victorian moral code welded to history, you can't beat Sabatini.

The older edition (the one with the brown turtle) was pretty informative, and made most concepts pretty clear. Diagrams were helpful, and it got me through the class.THIS EDITION IS NOT THE SAME. This edition contains none of he useful diagrams, none of the information, and seems like they took out half the knowledge found in the old edition. This book is so heavily edited that most students will be struggling, even if they're trying to learn. If a student doesn't care, they have no chance of passing with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous in every way","review":"This is by far one of the worst textbooks I have ever seen in my life. The writers put no effort into making it clear for the reader to understand, and the multiple choice questions that my Biology teacher makes us do at the end of each chapter don't even nail key points, many of them are random. Not to mention I can't carry it in my backpack as my it's heavier than any book I've ever held.If you're an educator and are considering to buy this book for your students, don't.

However, when we tried to set the day, date and time, the watch was out of sync. The automatic day of week setting did not agree with the date and year we entered. Huh??Also, the temp guage did not agree with our thermometer and when we reset it, it would not calibrate temperture changes properly. The altimeter also resets itself based on air-pressure, which did not seem to work well for us here in the high desert. We returned the watch to Amazon and are now a little gun-shy of buying another watch with these features."},{"rating":"2","title":"little big but fantastic watch","review":"I liked this watch because of its features...Compass - Barometer - Thermometer - Altimeter. Its a little bit big on my wrist, but looks great. all the features work perfectly, only the thermometer shows your body temperature when its on your wrist else gives perfect reading. Specially the Barometer shows nice weather prediction (downwards graph deteriorating weather, upwards graph improving weather). I bought it for 110$.Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"What I think of this watch - Pathfinder Triple Sensor Watch #PAG40B-2V","review":"When I received this watch it seemed very nice. It comes with a manual that is about 1 inch thick! I read through all of it. This watch can do a lot of things. Simular to other reviews have said, the temperature is off a little when you wear it on your arm. It is accurate when it is not on your arm. Everythings works the way it is supposed to. The altimeter is not very accurate. I keep getting different readings when I ckeck it at the same location. This is not a watch for the average person! To do different things with the watch you will need the manual to remember how to set things. The manual is written well but take it with you when you wear the watch so you can learn all the different functions. Overall I like the watch and will probably get another one when I need to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad for $70","review":"I wanted a low cost watch to take with me on my next trip and came across this one. That way, in case I loose it, I am not too upset. This one has the compass feature which will help me find my ways. Then there are the barometer and altimeter features that will be useful trivia info for my records. I find that Casio has come a long way since they started with watch offerings and will likely do more in the future. This does not have the solar power feature, but I do not expect to use this for 20 years anyway. I do look forward to a future low cost model with GPS for Lat/Long as well. Thus, for a sale price of $70 at a local Costco store... it was a great deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great product, poor service","review":"The watch is great, but if you ever need service, FORGET IT! You would be better off buying a new watch. Casio service apparently has not grasped the meaning of \\"customer service\\"; tried to charge me ANOTHER $45 after servicing my watch and having the buttons fall off"},{"rating":"2","title":"Early Review","review":"The watch is very nice, but sometimes from my physical activities when I look at the watch for the time it's on a different screen which is easily remedy. I need to set the temp. for accuracy since it seems a little off. Love the light. I recomend it at this stage. Thank you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Watch","review":"This watch was a Christmas present for my husband. He loves the watch. It has so may great features for him since he never takes his watch off, even showers with it on at times. He is a hunter and loves the compass,thermomter and barometer for when he is in the woods and being a big weather buff makes it even better. It is a nice looking watch also. The only con, as some have said, which I read in the reviews but did not stop me from ordering it for him,the thermomter is not the most accurate, you do have to take the watch off to get a good reading but he is ok with that. I am very happy with the watch and so is my husband."},{"rating":"1","title":"Semi accurate with a defective compass","review":"I took this digital watch with me to Bhutan and found it semi-accurate with altitude readings (within 50' of actual altitude) but the compass was completely worthless. The compass reads off bearing by 15 to 20 degrees. No small error. I followed scores of time to to reset it but nada. Each time I check it against other navigational compasses it was always off bearing. Thank God that I had a magnetic compass too. Always bring a back up! Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Cumulative Ascent, NOT.","review":"I am a road cyclist. It is helpful to know a few things about a given ride: the distance, the speeds, and the total cumulative ascent. The total cumulative ascent (TCA) is the summation of the hill climbs for that day. For example, a ride of 100 miles on the flat is a whole lot easier than one of 10,000 feet TCA. I had a Casio watch which readily gave the TCA in 1998, unfortunately it was lost in Italy. I called Casio prior to purchase of a new one and was told that the Casio Pathfinder PAG40B would do the job. The watch does graph the altitude. However, after hours of trying to obtain the TCA using the instruction manual and a phone call to Casio it would appear it cannot be done. It is a shame; it is a good watch otherwise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliantly crafted urban fantasy.","review":"From the Ashes is the kind of book that makes you want to go out and find the charecters and places in it when you have finished reading it. Everything is so real, so alive, you can't help but want to seek it out for yourself. Pendragon Faire offers more magick and adventure than you could ever expect in a few short weekends. The peasants kept me laughing, and the gypsies made me want to hit the road as a full-time rennie. The author shows a maturity that I find lacking in most books in the genre, I can't wait for the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"refreshing","review":"This is a wonderful book that reminds me of one of my favorite Renaissance Festivals. It's quite uplifting. When I'm having a bad day, all I have to do is open the pages to laugh along with Ryna and Bea, and all of the other life-like characters of the Renaissance Festival family. The concerns of the characters are real and down to earth. It's quite easy for the reader to identify with many of them. This book presents a side of Rennydom that most patrons never even know exists, aside from wild stories that they hear passed on by urban legend. The book lets the imagination soar with how life could (should) be with just a bit of Magick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas Gift","review":"This was a Christmas gift for my niece who specifically requested this DVD.

It explaines so much about why he is the loving caring man that he is and why so many people care about him. I couldn't put it down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The first and best Tenchi series","review":"The first Tenchi show made. Tenchi Muyo is about a 17-year old boy named Tenchi Masaki. When he was young, his grandfather told him stories about his ancestor Yosho slaying a demon. The demon rested in the cave by the Masaki Shine. Tenchi got the keys and went in the cave. Tenchi wakes up a demon name Ryoko(she looks human...oh well!). Then Tenchi meets 4 other girls and they all want his love. And thats how it all started(well, sorta).There are three discs in this box set. The first disc has the 1st OVA & the second one has the 2nd OVA. The 13 episodes are uncut & bilingual(English & Japanese)with English subtitles. The third disc has a Tenchi Encyclopedia(Version 3) that has character bios, trailers, & more. The only thing they didn't put on was The Mihoshi Special, but that's available on a separate DVD(with the Pretty Sammy OVA)."},{"rating":"2","title":"My savior!","review":"The show that saved my 7th grade scores and let me pass math and science! It may not happen to you but it did for me. Who ever saw Tenchi Muyo on Toonami this is a must buy! If you have only seen the edited version you gotta see this! There was just too much edited out to really enjoy it. My favorite thing about this box-set is the inside art! The Choushin!!!! All in their proper places! If you havent seen the show, and you like the one guy and six girl thing this is all for you. I will never stop loving Tenchi Muyo.... EVER! Or in plain English: It's worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I would reccomend this for anyone over the age of 13. I'm only fifteen and i just started watching anime about a year ago. Tenchi Muyo is the first anime I started to watch, and from the start i thought it was stupid and then i started to like it. The Tenchi Muyo boxed set I got is really good. It is different from the cartoon network version because now i can see every thing that they cut out and most of them are really stupid things that they cut out of it. I would reccomend this to any anime lover. Who would guess, one day a 17 year old boy is living a normal teen life and all of a sudden 6 space women are at his house. Weird, but awsome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tenchi Muyo OAV-goodness","review":"Tenchi Muyo is probably not for everyone, but those who love it, adore it. It has tons of elements you could want in an anime: intense action, comedy, romance, wacky characters, and a good, involving storyline.It all started when high school student Tenchi freed the demon Ryoko from captivity, all because he was curious. Soon enough, Tenchi finds himself surrounded by alien women: Jurai princesses Ayeka and Sasami, mad scientist Little Washu, scatter-brained Galaxy Pirate Mihoshi... Poor Tenchi!To me, the best thing about the OAV series is that most of the episodes are like feature anime films! Because they're such good quality, animation and story-wise. The OAV is just amazing, hands-down. I love love love it!Okay, I'm gonna stop raving like a mad anime maniac now. ;P"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good experience","review":"This boxed set was most pleasurable, the best work I have seenever.I have almost every tenchi muyo dvd known to man.I thoughtthe first tench movie was good the only thing that [was bad] was the music composed by that... christifore Franke who couldn't compose sheet music to save his life. All in all I give this thing a five star rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weird but yet very Intresting","review":"Tenchi Muyo! OVA box set is one of these series that is really pretty funny. Even if you have never seen it before or any anime, its one that for some reason you find your self watching just to see what weird or out of place thing is going to happen next. The plot as far as I can tell is quite simple it's based on character development and the subplots are the weird goings on that happen around the shrine. One suggestion for anyone thinking about this DVD and the reason I gave it 4 stars out of five stars. Is for the knowledge or to be familiar with Japanese culture, a lot of it will be confusing and weird or even offensive at times. If you keep an open mind and like an anime that's light on plot and heavy on character development this one is for you, ENJOY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Tenchi Series","review":"This is the best Tenchi series by a long shot. The only complaint is it doesn't have the Mihoshi Special so that's somewhat disapointing but they have a lot to make up for it. If your one of those classic anime people, you can watch the series in subtitles with Japanese voice. Or if your like me and don't like to read, you can do regular english. Another thing is that this DVD series is uncensored so kids might want to stick to the shows on Toonami. This DVD set also comes with a nice little Tenchi encyclopedia for all your Tenchi facts and needs. ^.^"},{"rating":"1","title":"Childish but not really for children","review":"I was a bit disappointed with this series. I'm a huge fan of Japanese animation but I found the story telling, with all the goofy love triangles, trite. The idea that all the women in the house (even the mother of one of his admirers.) are in love with this young man is male ego in its purest form. The whole thing is too silly for adults to enjoy and there are too many sexual references for small children. The animation was good but certainly not ground breaking. Given the exorbitant price I would recommend missing this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tenchi Muyo, best series ever","review":"I have watch various series of Tenchi and have seen all of the movies. Now this series is the funniest out of the entire collection. The ending is a little odd because you think there is more to the muyo collection, but besides that the jokes and story line is the best. The only thing is that Reyoko has a little trouble keeping her clothes on for some of the episodes. Crazy Reyoko."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just can't say enough good things about this!","review":"Since I can't say enough good things, I won't bother.

I instantly bought it, without thinking at all, plunging in all my hard earned cash. Seriously, you can't miss this...you just can't. This is one of the best anime I have ever seen.

I think it should have come with the Mihoshi special, but you can't always get what you want.

The sound quality is top-notch, picture quality is perfect and the dubbing is almost word-for-word. The only gripe is that it's a region-encoded disc, meaning that anyone who doesn't live in the US or Australia is out in the cold (chalk up another point for huge, greedy corporations), unless they can obtain a region-free DVD player, but look hard and you'll probably manage to get one. The Encyclopedia is a nice touch, but none of the trailers/previews on it have subtitles, so they're pretty much lost on me. Buy this set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tenchi Muyo! is the best!","review":"I began wathing Tenchi Muyo! on Cartoon Network when it aired. At first I that it was stipid and strange. I started watching more of it. I found it to be funney, cute, and full of action. Then I realized that it was all censered! I thought that if it is this funny censored, it has tto be great. This is not recomened for little children who watches the show. If you are a parent of young children that watches this show, buy the edited version on VHS at Walmart. The uncensored version has sexual inuindos, such as in scenes where Little Washu tries to get a sprem sample from Tenchi, Ryoko being happy of being a saddist, a baby breast feeding and playing with Mihoshi's breast, ect ect ect. For begining fans, save your money up and get this Tenchi Muyo! series first.

I've watched most of the mainstream manga, such as Akira, Ghost, and Freeman, but this series betters all others in many ways. The quality of the sound and picture are excellent, it's the best quality manga I have seen thus far. The story, following classic lines is also excellent, with a wide variety of characters and an evolving story line. I recommend this to any manga fan, don't let the fact that this title is maybe a little less known then others put you off, this is by far the best manga available. Since purchasing the OVA, I have also collected the Tenchi in Tokyo series, and will soon collect the Tenchi Universe series. If you only buy one manga DVD this year, make it this one. If six stars were available this title would get it! Hit that button, Buy it NOW!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Good Anime Series","review":"Pioneer finally put the entire Tenchi Muyo! series into one collection, which is good news for fans of this great series. All of the things that make this aime so good have already been listed, so I'm not going to repeat them; the main reason is the characters and their interaction with each other however. I am glad to find the entire series in one collection, as I only saw the first 7 episodes before this. I just hope that more episodes are created for the OAV series in the future, rather than having more spin-offs made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Editorial correction","review":"First off let me say that this is an awesome DVD set. Great animation and cool characters.I would like to make a correction to the Editorial Review. The OAV was FIRST. I was made before the TV series was produced, and is considered by many Tenchi fans (myself included) to be the \\"original\\" story line. There were 2 TV series created after this that are completly different storylines.One other thing...the translation of the title is wrong. When Pioneer first picked up Tenchi Muyo! and marketed it they mistranslated on purpose to make it sound like \\"No Need for Tenchi\\" (i.e. the main character). Which doesn't make a whole lot of sense since almost everybody seems to need him. The actual translation of the words are---\\"Tenchi\\"=\\"Heaven\\" and \\"Muyo\\"=\\"useless\\" so--\\"No need for Heaven\\". Which makes a little more sense. Who needs heaven when you have all of the these beautiful women in love with you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally Useless","review":"This product uses none of the thousands of user friendly improvements now available -- few right-click menus, few keyboard shortcuts.

It's got office short cuts, F-keys that double as additional short-cut keys, and it's even got a scroll wheel on the left edge. Why? And the worst design decision of all: the hibernate key is just to the left of the escape key.

I waste a good 30 seconds during bootup just to get my mouse to work!The other frustrating part is that Logitech, despite all the complants on their website, hasn't done a thing to fix this problem. I've had this combo for about 5 months now, and Logitech still hasn't come up with a fix!In summary, don't buy this product if you have Windows XP SP2!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sorry I bought this","review":"A lot is made in the product description about how the mouse and keyboard can communicate long distances to the hub at the computer, and do so accurately. Well, the communication is spotty at BEST. I have the receiver hub RIGHT NEXT to the keyboard and the mouse and their response often goes into fits where they are both totally unresponsive! It is amazing how useless a computer is when neither the mouse nor keyboard respond! At other times they are only slightly responsive. What a headache to use! Also, I can't figure out why this product is so expensive. You can buy a bluetooth hub for $30 and wireless mouse and keyboard for much less as well. I would recommend going that route. It can't be any worse than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't work with dell bluetooth card","review":"Bought this product and discovered (after hours with Logitech and Dell tech support) that the keyboard will only stay connected if you are using a Logitech Bluetooth hub.After discussions with Logitech, and telling them I would write this review, they asked me to point out that this problem will occur with any hub other than a Logitech hub, and that they have hammered Bluetooth to solve this compatabilty problem to no avail.So unless you want to spend 5 minutes reconnecting the keyboard every time you reboot , don't buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"When it works, it works","review":"I bought this keyboard because i have had good luck with logitech products. when this keyboard works, it's nice. i'm running under windows xp home sp2, and every other day or so i need to unplug the usb cable from the back of the computer to get the mouse or keyboard to work. this is after a cold boot. and also everytime i boot the connection wizard wants to restart my mouse. it's annoying, i also purchiced the microsoft product that goes for around the same, and installation was easy and haven't had any issues with the microsoft product. the Logitech on the other hand, i'll think twice before i buy another. I'm using the microsoft bluetooth keyboard to write this review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left a bad taste in our mouths","review":"My boyfriend and I are 20 and 19 respectively, which is probably right on for the audience this movie was targeting. While some parts were amusing enough to elicit a chuckle, the flow of the movie was very awkward, the jokes disgustingly predictable, and the screenplay definately left something to be desired. Ashton and Brittany were stellar actors that will probably wince later on at the sight of this movie on their résumés. While it is honest and to-the-point, it's certainly not a movie to rent and snuggle on the couch with, much less buy. Wait till it shows on HBO, guys, you're not missing much."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a movie","review":"hi,i've seen this movie 6 times so far and i can't stop laughin about it. it is a great movie with a lot of very funny scenes.

I think it would have been better if the whole story had stayed in a chronological order, but on the other hand this movie so god [darn] good that i MUST give 5 Rating!I can advice everybody to see that movie.

He gives the movie the added substance it needs. Britney Murphy, on the other hand, is a wonderful actress, yet she knows how to entertain the average household without it being Oscar worthy. The screenplay writers know how to deliver a unique comedy. However, some parts are repetative, but it still fits the storyline. If I tell you anything else specifacly, I'd be revealing the whole movie, and that will ruin it for all first time viewers."},{"rating":"1","title":"it stinks it stinks it stinksss...","review":"i just wrote that title cause it sounds funny, im not saying the movies good im just saying i dont normaly say it stinks. i say peace of crap. well i dont say crap either but i dont know if i can say s***, i dont want to get sued by Bush. this movie is a chick flick, only 2 chuckles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saw it opening night!!","review":"I have no idea why people say this movie isn't funny, I saw it opening night and I laughed my head off as did the entire theater, I am a 23 year old guy and I really loved this movie, So if I was you i would go see it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blahh","review":"I personaly thought that this movie was not awsome , but it didn't hit rock bottom either.

So when I say this DVD on the shelf at the video store, I was skeptical. Then I remembered all the trailers I'd seen of the movie, and thought it would be pretty good. It started out OK. Then somewhere along the way, it stopped being OK. There are maybe one or two good parts in this entire movie. It was just plain bad the rest of the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny","review":"I enjoy this movie too much!!!! It makes me laugh every time. Great movie for everyone. It reminds me how strong of a relationship my husband and I have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anyone under 16 will enjoy this","review":"If you have the brain capacity of a squirrel, which most people who gave this more than 1 star. Then you will enjoy this horrible movie.There wasnt anything funny about this movie except when I handed my $5 to the guy at Hollywood video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honeymoon from hell","review":"I think Ashton Kutcher and Brittany Murphy are two of the brightest actors around today. And together on screen they share a wonderful chemistry for all to see which makes for a very funny, well written comedy directed by Shawn Levy (Cheaper By The Dozen, Night At The Museum) who does a fantastic job directing these two around picturesque Europe.Kutcher and Murphy play newlyweds Tom and Sarah who come from entirely different backgrounds and share apparently nothing in common, and are about to learn some hard and hillarious lessons in love and loyalty whilst honeymooning in Europe. Throw in an ex-boyfriend who appears to be stalking the couple everywhere they go, and you get some very funny moments as we find out if opposites really do attarct.One of the best comedies I have ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful.","review":"My wife and I rented this movie (I'm so glad we didn't buy it). We watched for about an hour; neither one of us laughed a SINGLE TIME. We turned it off at that point.I've given this movie one star; others have given it five. How can you decide whom to believe? Easy; I'll give you an example of the level of humor in the movie. If you find it to be a riotously funny gag, buy the movie. If not, stay far away from it. Okay, here goes: The nickname of the bride's mom is \\"P---y\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 Stars instead of 1","review":"I gave this video two stars instead of only 1 because of my own stupidity in buying it. The seller did a great job - it arrived quickly and safely. It's just the movie itself is too stupid for words. What was I thinking?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah","review":"I tried to watch this movie several times because I like Ashton Kutcher. I tend to like him in comedies with a larger point (\\"Guess Who\\") or dramas with major points (\\"The Butterfly Effect\\"), but if I could watch \\"Punk'd,\\" then I should be able to watch this movie. However, I was bored with this one. I'm not a fan of Brittany Murphy. She was OK in \\"8 Mile\\" but I thought she was trying way too hard to be cutesy and sexy. It never seemed to come natural. Her acting is cool. She does the vulnerable scenes well, but it's everything else that didn't convince me. I did like Ashton's character. But the guy who kept following them around on their honeymoon just seemed to be more of a stalker than a concerned (and still in love) ex. I fell asleep through this movie several times before I barely got to the end. Can't say I recommend it but I wouldn't say it's terrible either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie, but not the best","review":"This was a really fun movie, although i have to say i was expecting more from them than that. But i did like it and i would give it a watch again if it was on. I dont know, maybe you have to see it twice to really like it...or maybe not"},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie smells worse than its bathroom gags","review":"Don't waste your time, not to mention money, on this stupid and pointless movie. I borrowed this from the library and still considered it a waste of money driving to the library. The movie is loaded with gags that we've all seen countless number of times in other movies. Not only are these tired cliches but they are poorly performed. What was the director thinking? Kutcher's character is a complete moron without any idiosyncratic quirk to endear him to the audience; he's just stupid without being funny. Murhpy's character is not much better. Watching them fight each other is like listening to fingernails on a blackboard. One only wishes that they were in the car when the old lady rams it off the cliff. What a turkey of a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing in this film to like","review":"The supporting cast of the movie largely consists of one-dimensional stereotypes (WASPs have silly pet names! Chinese poeple talk funny!) -- but, sadly, they're more amusing than the lead parts.Ashton Kutcher's Tom is an uncultured dimbulb -- but he makes up for that by being petulant, whiny, selfish, and short-tempered. His wife says that she loves him, but it's hard to understand why -- apart from a nice smile, he has nothing to recommend him.Most of the gags in the movie are third-rate retreads of other Americans-in-Europe movies (They have tiny cars! French people are snooty!). Amazingly, this is actually a worse entry to the genre than \\"National Lampoon's European Vacation\\".The best metaphor for the movie is the tiny car the couple drive when they arrive in Europe. It's slow-moving, underpowered, and you'll wish you hadn't rented it. (Oh, and it's not a place you'd like to be trapped with Ashton Kutcher)."},{"rating":"1","title":"why did they even make this movie","review":"this movie sucks so bad if you want a comedy go rent legally blonde 2 but if you want a boring sleeper this is the movie for you. this movie made me sleep the first 3 times ive tried to watch it. i have not ever got threw it not yet. so miss this movie please do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"This is probably the worst film I have seen this year. There is no romance and very little comedy it's pretty pointless. A rich bimbo falls in lust with an idiot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Movie","review":"This is a truly awful movie. There is barely a laugh the whole long long way through. Ashton Kutcher has to be the world's WORST actor. His idea of acting is to move his eyes from side to side. A cardboard cutout shows more emotion. Britney Murphy's not nearly as bad but there's no way anyone could shine acting with such a stiff. How a total no-talent like Ashton Kutcher became a star has got to be one of the great mysteries of the age."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not entirely bad, Not great either.","review":"This film is bland. There are some funny parts, but some of the humor is low. The movie could have used more of a drive for the plot other than the love life of the two main characters. The movie can get really dull at parts. The film struggles to get you to laugh, and has to fight even harder it seems to get you to laugh again. The ending, is, well, you can guess what the ending will be. Overall, the film doesn't seem to move in any particular direction, so you might want to pass this one up."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very well-written, touching romantic comedy.","review":"I was completely surprised to read so many bad reviews about this movie. It's high up on my list of favorite movies. It makes me laugh every time I see it, and it has some incredibly romantic, touching moments. Ashton Kutcher and Brittany Murphy did a fantastic job of portraying newlyweds. I adore this movie and hope people will read this and think about buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain stupid!","review":"One of my least favorite films ever made. Story is just pointless. Sarah & Todd have a disasterous honeymoon & thats basically it! Although it is not funny at all. Ashton Kutcher & Brittany Murphy at their worst performances ever! Painfully boring & least funny movie. 2 thumbs down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Ignore!!!!!!!!","review":"This movie has got to be one of the worst films I've seen in a long time!!!I love simple comedies revolving around nothing in particular, but this movie was bad. I didn't laugh once, or chuckled for that matter. Ashton Kutcher should just stick to the 70's show. I don't find him funny anywhere else (remember, Dude, Where's My Car??). Just Married lasted 1/2 hour in my DVD player before I pulled it out due to EXTREME boredom. If Kutcher wasn't such a big name, this film would've never been released otherwise.Avoid, even if you're just going to rent it!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"~Funny and Enjoyable!~","review":"This movie was an enjoyable film with two hilarious actors! Brittany Murphy is such a likable character in this movie playing Sarah, a rich girl who falls in love with Tom, played by Ashton Kutcher.These two get into some hilarious situations while on thier honeymoon after getting married \\"too young\\" as their families and friends think.It is very funny and the actors are very very convincing especially Brittany Murphy!It may not be an award winning movie but it's full of fun and laughs!I reccommend this if you love comedies and just watching movies to have a good time!The DVD extras are pretty good with a couple of deleted scenes and commentaries.This movie is really funny and just a fun, feel-good movie!Give it a try! :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst film I have ever seen.","review":"Just Married is quite simply the world's worst movie that I have ever seen. It was completely unfunny, with an incredibly bland storyline and a cliched, pointless ending. In fact, the entire film was utterly pointless and utterly merde (pardon my French). Boring, boring, boring...why spend so long screwing up two people's marriage in an insipid humourless way end with a low-grade, standard plea by the bloke about love. I won't give away the ending, but take a wild guess as to what happens. Okay, so rom-coms aren't my favourite, but this had no comedy (apart from having two brothers called Dickie and Willy- and it says something about the film that THAT was the funniest aspect) and a romance that sparked no interest in me.SO IT WAS APPALLING AND STUPID AND RUBBISH AND AKIN TO MENTAL TORTURE AND 100% POINTLESS!WORLD'S WORST FILM! EVER!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A sad, sad, sad excuse for a movie","review":"I'm not sure what's more pathetic: the fact that this film got made in the first place or the fact that so many people have rated it so highly. This is a sad, sad, sad excuse for a movie. Has today's movie-going audience really been dumbed down to the point where they consider anything in this movie funny? I sat down not expecting much from this film but at least expecting something I could smile at every now and then. Instead I was subject to 1:37 minutes of what could, at best, be described as dull. If I wanted to kill this many brain cells in such a short period of time I'd start drinking again."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst \\"Movie\\"(?) of the Year","review":"Is this a comedy?

So what, it's fun to watch. And for a romantic comedy, it delivers: It's cute, touching, enjoyable, often funny, and portrays just how good and bad young love can be.I was impressed with the 2 leading stars performances. Murphy is convincing and adorable. Kutcher is a lot funnier than I would have expected, usually a comedian has to be less attractive or have a more goofy look to him to be funny (ie, adam sandler, billy crystal, jack black, ben stiller, etc), but Kutcher has a funny style.This film won't make a top 10 list of greatest films, but it's one that I can enjoy watching now and then, because it reminds me of how good life and love can be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont hurt em Kutch!!!!","review":"This is the best movie I've seen since I got the scope at the proctologists office.............this morning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck! this was the worst","review":"Whoa, this wus the worst eva.

I love Ashton Kutcher and Brittany Murphy, so I was looking forward to see this so much. I had seen the previews numerous times, and it looked like such a great movie. I was wrong...First off all, they ruined half of the movie by showing the funniest parts in the previews. So when those came along, I didn't even laugh. They also showed too much in the previews, like half the movie. Their honeymoon was boring, it was just about them looking for a place to stay mostly. I can't even make this review long because it would be to boring to explain it.Don't go see this unless you're absolutley desperate.

And that is how we lump people together--not based on what they really believe, but on the superficial side. So this book is not racist; it just points out (accurately) the unpleasant truth.

There are virtually no articles in it; the writing is complete dribble (written with the alliteration and slang of a blog i.e. \\"Beat the Bedtime Blues\\", the near constant use of the second person, and whenever possible you will see lists in lieu of actual writing). Many of the subjects covered are poorly substantiated i.e. \\"According to one study...\\" They make so many large claims based off of the results of singular studies I feel they are just being irresponsible.

It took a while to grow on me, but there are several reasons I like this album. One reason is the band returned to the polyrhythms of their best work and added a Latin quality to most of the tracks. There are quite a few good songs here like \\"Blind\\", \\"Totally Nude\\", \\"Ruby Dear\\", \\"(Nothing But) Flowers\\", \\"Mommy Daddy You And I\\", \\"Big Daddy\\", \\"Cool Water\\" and the bonus track \\"Sax And Violins\\". The digital remastering sounds great.This album does lend itself to the 5.1 surround mix on the dvd side, and it blows away the cd stereo mix. The videos for \\"Blind\\" and \\"Sax And Violins\\" are good. The booklet doesn't have any lyrics and as with the other remasters, you get a small discussion by Jerry Harrison about the remastering process of \\"Naked\\".The Talking Heads went out on a pretty solid note with \\"Naked\\" and it's one of their better albums overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Icing On The Cake.","review":"This has to be the most under-rated Talking Heads album. Their final studio album, it sees the band return to the effortless grooves and neurotic worldview that marked their first 5 albums. This album has grown on me over the years. Today it sounds years ahead of it's time and delights those younger members of my family who take the time to explore it. The inclusion of Sax & Violins is the icing on the cake. Possibly their best song ever. One can only wonder what work is hidden on the shelves from that session yet to see the light of day."},{"rating":"1","title":"beo wolf","review":"i read the book but i need to check out the cliff notes so that i can study for a test tonight cause i turned in the book early and some one else checked it out of the librairy"},{"rating":"2","title":"How every bird book should be.","review":"In the early pages, the author thoroughly discusses the various sparrow genera, and mentions how the genera are distinct from each other - remarkably helpful for learning sparrow identification!

The species accounts are thorough and well written, and include sections on similar species, amongst many other sections.

I copied it from a friend. The thing I don't understand is that I never was a fan of Tank's voice from the beginning, so I don't know why I thought I could bear this CD. There is something about Tank's voice that annoys me. He sounds extremely monotone to me, which is evident on the first single \\"One Man.\\" He always sounds like he is afraid to let loose and have fun with his voice. He always sounds restrained. That's the reason why I wasn't fully able to enjoy this CD or anything that Tank has released in the past. Another bad thing about this CD is the wannabe \\"r&b thug\\" -ishness that CD takes on after about the 10th track. \\"Let Me Live\\" and \\"Party Like a Thug\\" sound like R. Kelly reject songs. I'm so tired of all the \\"bling bling\\" in today's hip hop and r&b? Can anyone tell me exactly when r&b left the voice and the heart and went to the mall?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Assumes you are a know-it-all","review":"Ok, this book is incredibly useless. The chapters themselves do not actually cover the material very well, then asks questions at the end that assume you know every last detail of anything. For example, it asks a question about how many tires are in a dump when they do not tell you the size of the tires. It asks you for the volume of a garage and it gives you no dimensions or anything to find the dimensions. What was the editor smoking!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"If you are in a class that uses this book, you have my sympathy. This is a worthless excuse for a textbook.

The plot twists kept me going and the minimal profanity was a breath of fresh air. Thanks, McGarrity, for a clean book that was fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book... Simple but keeps you in the action","review":"Finally, we have a writer that gives you the flavor of Hillerman with the smoothness of Cussler. A very enjoyable read.

McGarrity knows how to bring forth the story in an enjoyable and believable plot.

I endured 1 hour 45 minutes of this movie when my wife said \\"I hate this movie; it's the worst I have seen\\". I completely agree.It is not funny, not entertaining and not interesting. I really don't understand why anyone would rate it 5 stars.I like Fred MacMurray and Jane Wyman, but this movie is a total bust. There isn't a humorous scene in it. It's not good family entertainment because there is adult drinking throughout the movie which is completely out of character for Mr. MacMurray's movies.It just goes to prove that no matter how talented you are, you can't be a winner every time. I will continue to search for movies with Fred MacMurray and Jane Wyman because I like their movies, but this one is definitely *not* recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Fred's Best","review":"I usually love movies starring Fred MacMurray, but this is an exception. The plot is very slow to develop and did not hold our family's attention very well. BON VOYAGE was surprising because most of our dvds with Fred MacMurray are our very favorites (Follow Me, Boys; Absent-Minded Professor, etc.) I ended up donating this one to a local charity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is cutting off picture information \\"Family friendly\\"?","review":"Oh, Disney! Disney! Why do you stab me in the heart so often?This company seems to think that avoiding black little bars at the top and bottom of 4:3 television screens makes families happy and content. Why not consider us grownups instead, who are very saddened indeed to watch movies like this with the sides cut off?Besides, what child or teenager today would tolerate viewing this movie anyhow, cropped or in letterbox format? This is definitely a film for people BORN in the fifties and sixties. Yes, it's overlong! Yes, it's corny a lot of the time! Yes, it's often dull and even boring! And yes, I still enjoy it for all its faults! But I would be ten times happier if Disney had given me this film on DVD in the correct aspect ratio of 1.78:1 - with anamorphic enhancement, of course! WHEN WILL THEY LEARN?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Was this trip necessary?","review":"Draggy family comedy about Americans on vacation abroad wasn't anywhere near top-drawer Disney when it was first released back in 1962--trite, unfunny and decidely kid-unfriendly with its tiresome bickering parents, dreary teen romance subplots and several bizarre un-Disneylike scenes involving drunkeness, a bidet, a French hooker, public urination and even a few mild four-letter words.It doesn't play any better today in an uncorrected color DVD transfer that frequently makes MacMurray, Wyman and other cast members look like corpses.One of the biggest live action misfires to be personally overseen by Walt Disney, this DVD edition (with no extras) is a bum trip. Stay home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another cozy Southern mystery by Charlaine Harris","review":"This is my second mystery by this author in this series and I liked it as well as the first. Harris does a great job of making you feel like you're right there in this small town in Georgia (I think Lawrenceton was modeled after Covington). Detective-character Roe Teagarden, formerly a librarian, is now a lady of leisure, since she unexpectedly inherited quite a bit of money. She's looking around trying to find herself, and is trying out being a real estate agent in her mother's firm. Just as she's deciding this is really not for her, she discovers a body in a house that she's showing. When another body is found in an empty house, people begin to wonder if someone is going around killing real estate agents.The plotting was good and I was a bit surprised at the killer. But mostly I enjoyed the cozy atmosphere of this small town and interesting inhabitants."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't spend the time or money!","review":"This was one of the worst mysteries I've ever read. The writing was sloppy, the story bland, and the romance unrealistic. And without reading too closely, I caught two errors that an editor obviously neglected to correct. Ms. Harris refers twice to fixing a female cat as \\"neutering\\" and later in the book she sets a party up to begin, in one conversation, at 6:30 and in the next chapter at 7:30. This is a huge mistake in a mystery story! It leads the reader to expect something will happen as a result of someone getting the time of the party wrong. But it was just sloppy writing. Do yourself a favor and avoid Ms. Harris's novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful blend of plot and humour","review":"This author is a real \\"find\\". It's great to stumble across an author who really manages to balance humour, plot and character development. I'm looking forward to reading more of these books because Ms. Harris obviously intends for her characters personal relationships to change and develop. Hope she writes more (and soon)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Three Bedrooms, One Corpse /Aurora Teagarden Book 3","review":"Enjoyed reading these books so far. Interesting story lines and a quick read.

We recently got an 11 week old Cavashon puppy (Cavallier King Charles Spaniel and Bichon), who is badly in need of training. She's a sweet dog, but was given to a shelter because she's too wild. We can deal with this.My wife bought the magazine, which promised on the cover: SIT, LIE DOWN, STAY, COME, etc, etc. The article concerning taining had NOT ONE WORD about the above subjects. After encouraging the reader to find a class, it gave (paid?) directions for several self-described trainers associations.Obviously the publication was filled with ads for various must-have products.

This is just great for me because I can now charge the phone straigth from my laptop when I'm out and have one less cord to drag around. The adapters for the wall or cigarette lighter accessory outlet in a car make it all the more convenient.

I believe this book could be used as suggested reading in an American History class, as it shows one facet of the development of the west. Also, it shows in places, the goodness of these largely unsung women (and even a few Harvey officials who were men), the goodness this country is rightly proud.

In contrast I find Michael Jones to be soothing - it keeps my interest constant and when I'm focused on the music I can forget other things and relax."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite sandal ever","review":"You can't go wrong with this sandal.

Ugh.","review":"Having seen almost all of Christopher Coppola's movies (even the uncredited \\"Clockmaker\\"), I can say I would be considered the closest thing to a fan he has. That being said, this movie is torture. Even with the addition of Martin Sheen (the Sheens must owe Christopher a favor, Charlie appeared in his masterpiece \\"Deadfall\\"), and finally a speaking role for Christopher Coppola staple Billy Floyd, this movie is dreadfully bad. Watching this movie, a friend and I cried out to the heavens begging for mercy, and another friend left rather than finish watching it. However, if you do foolishly decide to endure this trial, do not give up. At the end of the movie, Robert Carradine delivers the most unbelievable look, outside of a beer commercial, ever captured on film. It's like the punchline to 90 minute joke. The bad thing is, the joke's on you."},{"rating":"1","title":"The good, the bad, and the truly awful","review":"Since watching Gunfighter I have been desperately trying to think if I have ever seen a worse movie. I dont think I have. I once stood in the town of Truckee,Ca, and watched a group of middle aged men dressed as cowboys putting on a street show, which, at the time, I felt was excruciatingly embarrassing. Having seen Gunfighter I know what happened to those 'cowboys'. Christopher Coppola signed them up for his movie.How on earth did Martin Sheen allow himself to be dragged into such dross?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lets not mince words.","review":"This was the stupidest movie I have ever seen! Period.Starts pretty strong, eerie and mysteriouslike, then in walks Hopalong Cassidy, who looks like he just stepped off the set of Full House and a Black Bart character that looks less menacing than he looks like a complete idiot. Save yourself from this flick. Martin Sheen makes a good cameo appearance for about 5 minutes, the rest of this thing sucks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it","review":"After all the harsh reviews, I was a little worried about watching the movie, but I ended up really liking it. If you knew how small of a budget there was on this movie, you'd be impressed at how resourceful the director was. I found the movie inspiring because it showed you don't have to have millions to make a good movie. And it was good. Strong plot and great visuals. Watch and let the movie paint a picture for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"This \\"pen\\" does not change easily at all.

Eric Carr was a stud when it came to banging on the skins. If KISS could have captured the sound of this album back around the time they produced \\"Dynasty\\", they may have never had the huge slump they wound up having. This is probably the heaviest KISS album there is with \\"Revenge\\" following a close 2nd. COTN never got the attention it should have because at the time, KISS was pretty much old hat. I hate Ace did not play on this album, but it probably would have sounded completely different if he had. Overall, it rocks.

Tracks like \\"I Love It Loud\\", \\"Rock N Roll Hell\\", \\"Danger\\", and \\"War Machine\\" are so cool. I cannot say a bad thing about this classic album. This album opens with the thunderous title track which is a good concert opener. \\"Rock N Roll Hell\\" is a real catchy number with building pressure and cool guitar. The most well-known song off the album, \\"I Love It Loud\\" has a solid bass drumbeat which makes it a great footstomper. The best song on the album is \\"War Machine\\". This track is absolutely amazing! Gene is really growling on \\"War Machine\\". This is a classic album that should cannot be ignored."},{"rating":"1","title":"ATTENTION: ACE IS NOT ON THIS ALBUM!!!!!","review":"I am a huge classic (original lineup) KISS fan. However, this album fails in comparison to the other previous gems. As a kid and as an adult when I updated my collection to cd I thought Ace was on this album. But when I read the liner notes and part of the KISSTORY book I found out Ace had nothing to do with these sessions!!!!What a scam to consumers and fans to put Ace on the cover and in the \\"Love it Loud\\" video in the 80s when he wasn't even a part of it!!!!! False advertising!!!!!Don't waste your time or money with this album!!! Not worth it!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the most disturbing records I have ever listened to","review":"Goodness, gracious. If this music didn't come from the darkest pits of hell, then I don't know what else did. This music is from KISS, a band that praises Satan and blasphemes our Lord. Music like this makes me agree with Tipper Gore.

Even though Ace Frehley is pictured on the album cover, he didn't contribute anything to the album. The two lead guitarists on this album are Bob Kulick and Vincent Cusano (Vinnie Vincent). They both did excellent work, and Vincent even wrote on the album. The album only has nine tracks, but all of them ROCK! Listen to all of them, and be prepared to be blown away."},{"rating":"2","title":"KISS at their heaviest!","review":"KISS took back the title of \\"The Hottest Band In The World\\" with this album. \\"Creatures Of The Night\\" is a thunderously heavy title track which opens the album with a punch. \\"Rock N Roll Hell\\" is a tune where Gene really sings on, his voice is exellent. \\"Danger\\" is a fast song that really gets the blood flowing. \\"I Love It Loud\\" is a take no prisoners anthem that shows how Gene likes his rock. \\"War Machine\\" is a narly, tough song that is my favorite off this record. Altogether this is one hell of an album. I highly recommend this album to any KISS fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"METAL KISS","review":"I CANT REALLY COMMENT ON THIS RERCORDING BECAUSE WHEN I RECIEVED IT ALL IT DID WAS SKIP ALL OVER THE PLACE I WAS VERY DISSAPPOINTED BECAUSE I HAD THIS ON VINYL AND LOVED IT!

Pop Rock/Metal catchy songs. Pleasantly surprised when I heard the opening track, \\"Creatures of the Night\\". I'm really growing to like these guys, as I'm not a huge Kiss fan. I will certainly look in to others by them. I do like Paul Stanley as a front man and singer. The overall sound and music is really good given the time period. Good production and a very good album. I feel that it sounds more modern and doesn't seem to have that Classic Rock-ness to it. It's not heavy, buy I'll say heavier than their older stuff.

For example, it tells you who SB's neighbors and friends are, what they like, where they live and where SB works! Why they couldn't make a fun trivia book with the answers at the end is incredible.

Animalize?","review":"A year later after Lick it Up's release KISS returns but this time with a new guitarist who's name really isn't worth mentioning. Why is that, you ask? Well, this guy was only with KISS for about as long as the Album last's. Anyway, I only really like 3 songs from Animalize and they are:\\"I've Had Enough (into the fire)\\" RULES! I love this song, Paul's vocals once again make this song. 5 stars.\\"Burn Bitch Burn\\" My 10th favorite KISS song EVER! Gene RULES and the backing vocals do to. 5 stars.\\"While the City Sleeps\\" I really like this song even though alot of people don't. I think Gene delivers on this one and it could've very well fit nicely on Creatures of the Night or Lick it Up IMO. 4 stars.Buy \\"Animalize\\" for these tracks ONLY or if you're a KISS Fanatic like myself, you must complete your KISS collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"New guitarist still incredible band.","review":"The sound of this CD is so great and their music is such hard heavy metal but with style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost mediocre - a few good songs","review":"The mid eighties was not the best time for Kiss records. Especially Genes songs were terrible, just listen to the ones on this record (\\"While the city sleeps\\" is an exception, a pretty good song). Paul also struggles, but he's got some decent songs on this one. I liked this record when it was released, but would not listen to it today. Thrills in the night is a very cool song, but it is too slow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Animalize is raw","review":"Some very raw rock here;that's why the 2 rating instead of a 1.The opening song I've Had Enough is actually one of the best album openers Kiss has ever had and Under the Gun is not a bad tune as well BUT the rest of the songs fail to impress bigtime.Thrills in The Night has to be one of the most annoying Kiss singles ever and all of Gene Simmons' songs sound so bad he must have wrote them while he was counting his money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stands the test of time","review":"Animalize is worth buying just for track 3 alone. Burn Bitch Burn is the ultimate Gene song(besides God of Thunder) complete with a killer riff and great lyrics. How can you argue with the line \\"I wanna put my log in your fireplace?\\" Overall, this is a vastly underrated Kiss album, tracks like I've Had Enough, Heaven's On Fire, Murder in High Heels, and Thrills in the Night attest to the fact. Paul's vocals are in top form and Eric Carr proves he was a major talent on the drums. Mark St. John may not have been Ace Frehely but he's more than adequate on this record.

In a nutshell all of the songs are easily forgetable except for Heavens On Fire (which you could easily find in a ... Rock folder in most Napster libraries). I have been a loyal KISS fan ever since 1988, have listened to most of their music. This and the preceding 80s album are terrible.

That's the other thing, the gun shots to the players and enemies are not realistic. Most people, when shot, bleed more and die in much more painful ways. The game's AI and weapons are the only reason I give this game two stars. If you are a Die Hard fan like I was, then you'll like this. But sooner or later, you will be fed up with this ficticious game. If I were you, I would try Soldier of Fortune. As realistic as can be. It's explosive realism makes it difficult to tell the difference between it being a game or real life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good add-on mission pack","review":"The add on pack for Rainbow Six Rogue Spear is a good deal at this price.

They can handle quite a lot of volume without distorting the sound whatsoever. The only thing I would caution is to make sure you have a receiver with an adjustable crossover frequency, because if they do distort, it's because of the low bass being sent to them. If you raise the crossover frequency, the problem disappears. Also, don't even think of getting these speakers without either having or planning on getting a powered suwoofer.

Our family has relied on it, time after time, and through every imaginable crisis. I agree with the comment below that the flow charts and graphic arrangement make this an especially user-friendly book: zip-zip-zip through the chart, and you'll have either an accurate diagnosis, or a sense of comfort about what illness you're NOT dealing with.

When a patient or family member comes down with a new diagnosis, most people want more information to learn more about it. I use this book as a teaching tool so that they can start to learn about their health and personal illnesses. It lays a good foundation for initial health information. I personally like its emphasis on preventive care. It can also help you decide whether an ache or pain you have is serious enough to seek medical attention or not. This book is especially useful to anyone who is not in the medical field and needs immediate information about health or is just interested about health and disease. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Special","review":"This is a cd that won't disappoint anyone that loves a good voice (phenomenal voice), deeply moving music, and, a very good technical recording to enhance the whole experience.

It is music worth owning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something Different","review":"The novel's title attacted my attention. I didn't know how to react. The first page was enough to keep me reading. Gayla's story is an eye opener. I didn't know my people had such a depth and variety of experience. The stereotypes we are always given are broken in this novel, reality in fiction.I hope the author has millions of readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Growing Up...","review":"I saw this while browsing the library shelves, so I had to check it out. Once I started reading, it took me a minute to realize that this is fiction and not the author's life story. That darn picture on the cover totally fooled me. Once I got that straight, I just muddled through until the end. I can't explain it. I usually find something appealing about stories about Black southern life, but this one did not move me one bit. I didn't even become slightly more interested until I got toward the end and the situation with Gayla's husband. I still am perplexed about how growing up 'nigger rich' was germane to the story. The main character still had to endure the prejudices that were prevalent during her childhood. The wealth her family had only seemed to allow for more material possessions, if anything. Maybe it was just too deep for me. I did like the writing style, though. Oh, well. Back to my usual fluff. 2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dude Awesome","review":"Well, you have to have read the first one to really sink your teeth in this one. Oh, were do I start. The story is fabulous and builds so much on what was gleaned in the first book. There's lots of intrigue and little subplots. Ooh, this book just packs a wallop of a story. The pictures are amazing and just draw you into the world of Abarat. You've just got to read this book to believe it. Warning the ending will have to begging Clive Barker to produce the third.

It is for a younger group of people and that is why the story may seem simple compared to Barkers older works. This word is full of colors and fantastic chacters like Imajica but writen for teens. This means no sex and little gore."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Second One Is As Great As The First","review":"This book was so exciting. I just simply loved it. It is the second book in the Abarat series and furthers Candy's adventures in the Abarat. Old characters return, such as: John Mischief, Malingo, and all of the other characters, as well as awesome new charaters: Finnegan Hob, Letheo, and some others.

I love ABARAT."},{"rating":"1","title":"No payoff","review":"This book lacks essential pieces of a story. The world is beautiful and very well-described. Side characters are vibrant and catchy. Some scenes are even poignant.Yet the main character is a mess. There's no consistent motivation, nothing interesting about her, she's special for no reason, does stupid things that aggravate and annoy the reader instead of being understood, and she even is the reason for random flashbacks to why she's so special (this happens more than three times).B 3/4 of the story, you barely know what the villain wants, you have no idea why the main character is worth caring about, and no idea why it's about her instead of the more interesting ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barker: A Phenom","review":"I'm not sure how I discovered Clive Barker. Maybe a student told me about The Damnation Game or I stumbled onto Imajica, but when I saw The Abarat, I knew I had to delve into the fine paper, art and writing. The book was hidden away in the basement of a book store on a special rack all its own, but out of the way -- by the bathrooms. I was struck by the cover, struck by the lucidity and waded in like I'd never read a book before (believe me, I've read plenty). When I saw Days of Magic, Nights of War proudly displayed up with the other new releases last month, I was just as eager as I was the first time I saw the artwork of the Abarat. I'd have bought it no matter where it was lurking. Thank you, Mr. Barker, for creating this world of hours and dreams. I am transfixed and moved by your imagination. If you haven't stepped into the world of The Abarat, do yourself a favor and ride the Izabella with Candy Quackenbush et al.

When I recently bought some of the new \\"white container\\" Lavilin, and applied it, I soon found out that this was not the product I was familiar with. After only one day, the odor came back. After reapplying a few times I got the same negative results. Normally, this time of year (spring in MN), I get at least 1-1/2 weeks out of it (3 weeks in the winter). I was told by a local retailer that the original formula was no longer available (they had removed the talc in 2001). I am guessing that they changed more than the talc since this is a non-functional product for me.

I researched this product and read the reviews here (among others) and decided to try it with a positive attitude. To be fair, Lavilin is better than nothing in that it offers very, very minimal protection against odor as opposed to using nothing at all. However, after weeks of use I have come to find that eight to ten hours is as far as any real deoderant protection lasts, after that the least bit of excercise, etc., causes a significant increase in underarm odor that is very noticeable. Daily application is necessary, and that coverage is marginal at best. Yes, I followed the application instructions TO THE LETTER. I think the rave reviews for Lavilin are mostly due to wishful thinking. My recommendation is do not be taken in by this modern version of Snake Oil."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was hoping for a smaller container","review":"Big box, small container.

I decided to carry on for a few more hours and the smell worsened. Tried applying again being more careful to spread evenly and more widely and still the same outcome so I've given up.

It made me sweat, and sweat mixed with this product is hell. But still I decided to give it one more chance. I used this for more almost 2 months, noting really happened. I guess this is one of the products that is not meant for me. After all this, I have never used any anti-perspirant/deodorant at all.

I showered again and reapplied the Lavilin, this time quite liberally - only to be greeted by the return of odor by the next morning.

It is a little too small for a Palm V on the Ministrel (Omnisky) model which I was hoping it would also fit. For the IPAQ, this case has lots of padding and stiffness over the screen area. The inside pouches should be eliminated because it is unlikely that you can use them without taking a chance on scratching the screen [the smaller size which fits a Palm V without the modem has the same problem]. The large case in a slicker graphite fabric looks better than the smaller neophrene ones.

My son loves to see things go, and this does move around the racetrack, but he gets bored with it as soon as we get it out.

We have not, however, had any problems with durability."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun while it lasts (5 minutes or less)","review":"My son got this for his 2nd birthday. He loved playing with the car. The racetrack itself is somewhat pointless as it does the same sequence of actions & noises every time around and gets old after just a few laps. However, he enjoyed playing with the car a great deal. Unfortunately, it broke after only about three days. One of the very tiny plastic gears inside lost half of it's teeth, so the toy would only move about an inch before needing to be pushed. We returned the toy and got a replacement only to have the replacement break in a completely different manner after only a few minutes of play. I haven't taken this one apart yet to see exactly what broke, but I can tell it's something electrical this time. We'll return this one for a refund.

You will, however, get to see Ned Beatty's nipples *without* hearing him squeal like a pig. What a treat! HUH?!?!Having said that, it's still better than Liquid Sky. (Worst acting, worst sets, worst plot... I take that back. Liquid Sky had no plot.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"nice material but no instructional photos","review":"The material of the item was very soft but there were no instructional photos that came with it. It is very hard to figure out how to get this item to actually look like a shirt.

It was great to see cute boys clothes as well as girls clothes. The instructions include the pattern outline and dimensions which I find extremely helpful - these are not usually included in patterns from the US.The only draw back on this book is that it calls for specific yarns by specific manufactures (which are not all available in the US). It does not give equivalent yarn weights, such as sport, worsted, baby, etc. to substitute. You can figure it out with a little math work - it does give stitch gauges.The patterns are clearly written and easy to follow. The photography is wonderful. I recommend this book as inspirational and a must for a pattern library to make clothes for kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"A RARE BOOK, Indeed","review":"Wonderful children's clothes--if only there were more and for slightly older children...I have made 4 items (including the adorable cover dress), and I couldn't be more pleased with them. The patterns are easy to follow and they work up \\"professionally.\\" My grandchildren love the clothing, and much of it can be made with Luster Sheen, an easy care yarn, as well as with cotton. My next project is the little bear on the cover as my granddaughter wants it to \\"go with\\" her dress."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another of my favorites!","review":"This book is another of my favorite books for baby and toddler clothing. I have made the stuffed zebra (in sky blue and white stripes for something a little out of the ordinary) and the girl's floral sweater (in tan with peach flowers).This is one of my favorite books for finding great baby items. I've made many for other people's children, and I am now thrilled to make these patterns up for my 4-month old daughter.A comment to the reviewer who feared placing buttons on baby clothes ... they are everywhere. Carters, Baby Gap, Gerber, and so on ... you'll see buttons on baby clothes of all brands. It is the parents' responsibility to make sure that the buttons are secured safely and that the child cannot rip them off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crochet for Babies and Toddlers","review":"This is a very nice book, with patterns that range from easy, for the beginning crocheter, to the more complicated work. As well as the written instructions there are diagrams for the various stitches used, making this book a bit of a primer for those who might wish to learn to read diagrams.The photography is beautiful - lots of cute babies and the designs are first class. The book has stitch instructions and lots of useful tips for the less experienced crocheter. I particularly liked the christening shawl and am now waiting for anyone of my acquaintance to produce a baby so as to give me a reason for making that one!A lovely book for any doting granny."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment !","review":"After reading previous reviews i got this book and found nothing nothing! what would inspire me in it , no new patterns nothing exiting about the designs( lack of them), waste of my money ...

If you don't know much about Lake Placid or why so many people love this little town, you will after watching this production. It was very well done and I don't think you'll find any other good source about Lake Placid. You get the feeling that you were right there while these events were happening. The Rev.

BUT...it was first published in 1986, introduced in the USA a few years later. Many illustrations of tools, parts, room design info are d-a-t-e-d. Books like these don't get better with time, they just make you fustrated. Time to MODERNIZE. The 2000 version (if there is one) will be a great \\"How To...\\" book for the new millenium.

Hardly!","review":"I found Jeffrey's Ian Ross' book very useful for my own research dealing with criminal regimes in Latin America, notably the Fujimori dictatorship of Peru, which I examined in a recent work. I use Ross' book when dealing with state crime in my criminology classes. I also regularly recommend the work to the gradute students from International Development Studies whom I supervise on state crime in developing societies. While Ross' book is ethnocentric his assumptions can easily be modified to analyze political crime beyond the so-called First World. I would therefore strongly disagree with the claim by a previous reviewer that the book is at best useful at the high school level. My major criticism would be that the author does not sufficiently distinguish between administrative and political corruption."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Magazine","review":"I really enjoy this magazine....

Every issue now has the obligatory interview (or several) with a present/former Top Chef contestant, his or her ideas on what makes food tick or what they think the next trend will be, etc. If I cared at all what these people think I would watch the show. I don't care and I don't watch and I don't want to pay to have their opinions delivered to me every month. Although each issue does showcase new recipes and ideas (as well as wine & beer, of course) it's irritating to be constantly reminded of their connection with \\"Top Chef.\\" While some readers may think this a great plus for the magazine, to me it's nothing more than heavy-handed advertising and just not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would be nice if it would come in the mail.....","review":"Still waiting to receive my first magazine....its been 6 weeks since I purchased my subscription, will update when I receive the magazine."},{"rating":"1","title":"after weeks and weeks of waiting, I have yet to receive a magazine----what a joke","review":"after weeks and weeks of waiting I have yet to receive a magazine,I ordered another magazine at the same time and have received 3 ofthat order already."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did I subscribe?","review":"This is the second time I subscribed to this magazine. I did it knowingly that I didn't like the magazine the first time around because it was only $5. Well, it was a waste of $5.This magazine looks nice but most of the articles are not really relevant to a middle-class suburban mom-of-two like me. There aren't as many recipes as in other magazines, and seldom I find something that I really want to make (for reference, I usually cook recipes from epicurious.com).

The articles are on the superficial side and more importantly a lot of the recipes and product reviews are not as well researched as they should have been. I experienced more than one flop trying their stuff. The magazine tries very hard to be trendy and pick up the latest and greatest in the cooking and restaurant scene without being careful enough in deciding what is actually an important or meaningful trend rather than a fad. This magazine can't hold a candle to \\"Bon Appetit\\" or \\"Gourmet\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Trendy Disappointment","review":"Maybe I was just hoping for too much from one magazine - a good wine magazine with some recipies thrown in. The recipies are good, but the wine secion is a sparse and unsophisticated afterthought. The articles are truly grating, focusing in agonizing detail on the trendy parties thrown by the editors' friends. There is a place for a magazine like this, but don't let the name fool you; this publication is really more of an entertainment lifestyle magazine than a food magazine. What is most definitley is NOT is a wine magazine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Appropriate for the genre, I suppose. . .","review":"My husband got me this magazine because he knows how I love to try new dishes and wines. Unfortunately, this magazine has a very different audience than what we expected. In any given issue I might find one or two recipes that catch my interest. The others are too \\"food and wine snobby\\" for me. In addition, the magazine tries to capture that jet set feeling by telling you all about Boston, New York and Napa Valley five star restaurants. As a working mom, I doubt that I'll be able to try them in the near future. In general, this one reminds me of the magazines you get at the airlines."},{"rating":"2","title":"Food & Wine Magazine","review":"A friend sent me an email saying that Amazon had a bunch of magazine subscriptions available for only $5.00, and since we cut back on our subscriptions to save a little money, I was thrilled to see that Food & Wine was on the list!

However, I do have one major qualm with it: the advertisement to recipe ratio, is aggravating. When I get a cooking magazine, I expect recipes, not ads galore. Besides that, it is a fine magazine, but I would recommend something like Cooks Country (my favorite-the recipes are delicious, the tips helpful, the accounts of how the recipes came to be entertaining, and the format both attractive and easy to follow) instead.

I purchased the \\"Thief\\", the \\"Queen\\", and the \\"King\\" at the same time and after reading this book I returned the \\"King\\". I just didn't want to spend anymore of my time on this series. I enjoyed the \\"Thief\\", but as I read this I kept thinking the book would pick up. It just didn't. I liked Gen, enjoyed a few other characters, but the story line was painful. One country was fighting against another country, then they would change sides, you needed a score card to keep up. I normally keep books I enjoy and reread them at a later date, but books one & two went immediately to Goodwill. I couldn't have disliked this book anymore. (I enjoyed the Thief, but not enough to reread it again.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing as a sequel","review":"The Thief was an imaginative adventure and I was hoping that its sequel would follow in the same vein. The Queen of Attolia went in a completely different dirction, both stylistically and in the plot. This book was more political than character-based and if I didn't already know the characters from The Thief, it would have been completely forgettable. To be frank, it kind of ruined The Thief a little bit just because the events afterwards are so dreary and Gen's life is so crappy and dark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great story but a little unsettling","review":"The age difference between Eugenides and Attolia reminds me of Mary Kay Letourneau and Vili Faulauu.

When I first pick up the book I wasn't really all that interested in it do to the fact that I had not liked The Thief as much as I had hoped, but because of a persistent friend, I ended up reading The Queen of Attolia and was thrilled with it. I will continue to look for the fifth book until it arrives. Chow"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I've recommended the first book about Gen, \\"The Thief,\\" to countless students, and I loved it myself. I'm not going to recommend the sequel! The plotting is certainly ingenious, and Gen's twisty imagination and clever talk are equally pleasing, but there are many minuses. One of the characters introduced in the first book is merely dismissed as \\"away studying\\" or some such, and is mentioned no more. A more serious objection is a psychological one. The end of the book is totally unbelievable, given what we know about Gen's opinions from the first book, and also from the tense and suspenseful beginning chapters of this book. Also, in the first book, the author chose to show us the people of her imaginary countries through the stories they tell. She attempts only half-heartedly to continue in her second story; only one \\"tale\\" is told.I wish I hadn't read it; I won't enjoy re-reading the first one as much, knowing what lies in store for the characters!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Show, don't tell! Too little time with main character.","review":"I loved The Thief-- we were completely inside his point of view, and he was funny and clever. I couldn't wait to read this sequel.But in the sequel, the author goes on for pages and pages about the politics of the countries involved. She tells us about wars and stuff... it's like reading a history book and I frankly had trouble following it. Scenes that actually have Gen in them are rare, and when we do see him a lot of the time he's just acting whiny and other characters are concerned about him. It goes on for pages and pages and it gets old.There are rare moments when Gen actually pops into the story and does something, and those are delightful-- the only reason I'm giving the book two stars instead of one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best YA Ever","review":"Megan Whalen Turner's trilogy is not just for young adults.

Just brilliant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love is the greatest challenge.","review":"Eugenides, the Queen's Thief, is not just a thief, he's a spy, and he's been spying on the queen of the neighboring kingdom of Attolia since they were both children. He fell in love with her the first time he saw her, but she's become cruel and ruthless under the strain of ruling her realm, and when she catches him in her palace, spying, she turns all her cruelty on him in a way that nearly breaks both of them.Despite her unforvigable act, Eugenides can't help but understand the pressures on this queen, can't help understanding her, and despite his fear and fury, can't help loving her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought Provoking.","review":"The Queen is a fantastic rainy-day read; intruiging plot twists & the fresh, well-developed story-line cause you to want to read the entire book in one sitting! From the moment you are first introduced to Eugenides in the midst of his trials to the very satisfying end, you are captivated by Turner's unique book & fresh dialogue.Absolutely one of my favorite books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring mumbo jumbo","review":"Saul Bellow is a good writer, but the character he writes about is boring, self centered and prone to long rants of \\"word salad\\" tangents.

He is unable to convince himself that he is worthy to be a human bieng. Distance, time and home bring this book into a personal perspective that is applicable to most adventurous males. The ideas about life and purpose, however, touch everyone right in the unknown area barely reached by most humans. Nothing bad can be said about Bellow here, he is in true form. The prose will keep you up all night"},{"rating":"1","title":"so-so","review":"There's one aspect of this book that I found delightful: Bellow apparently did zero research -- ZERO! -- before setting his novel in Africa. He didn't bother to find out the names of tribes, languages, features of the geography, etc., before sitting down to write. Not that this is a fantastic Africa; it's just that it's an Africa as Saul Bellow thought it could have been.I found this to be a wonderful and inspiring approach. I find it a bit sad that our age is so caught up with historical accuracy. The pressure to provide it can frequently stifle an artist's creativity.So Bellow here is unapologetically a novelist, not a cultural anthropologist, almost in a passive-agressive way.However, I didn't think there was much else of interest to the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top Ten of all the Books I've Read...","review":"...and I've read a lot! This book is incredible! It is the story of Henderson, a rich, upper middle-aged man, married for the second time (or third-i can't remember) and with kids, who decides he needs to go to Africa. He adventures through the desert with a loyal and patient african escort, Ramilayu, who translates for him and acts as a voice of reason, though henderson seldom listens. henderson finally comes across a tribe he can really love, only to discover they are not quite what he believed. a charming and extremely funny book-the ending stays with you (or with me, anyway) and gives you hope. you will want to read it again! buy this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"curious","review":"I love this book although I always have trouble finishing it. The older I get, and I am still quite young, the more I find my life parallels the plot of the book. The language usage is amazing and roughly poetic. I am most impressed though, with Henderson himself, because he seems strangely more real then anyone I've met. I believe this is the most curious book to read but perhaps not of interest to readers not so curious themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mildly humorous but not really worth it","review":"Henderson is a big rich idiot. Having got everything he ever wanted through his life because of his riches, he seeks to find fulfillment by going to Africa. As he says,\\"...it's the destiny of my generation of Americans to go out in the world and try to find the wisdom of life.\\" All he really does is try to accomplish something big to make himself feel better. He doesn't really know what he wants and doesn't figure it out. I wish he was eaten by alion at the end so he wouldn't have to worry about it anymore. The African characters are ridiculously idealized. The prose, however, is vivid. Even though it is not very difficult reading, I found myself losing interest frequently throughout. It's not utter trash, but I can't recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"the quickest of thoughts","review":"\\"wow! great book. it started really slow and i nearly gave up, but it ended with touching style and a great big dose of the bizarre. in the end, i think it finds redemption, or at least hope. wow...\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"So much ado about so little","review":"I read this book with an open mind as it has been suggested by many to be worthy.

Can I get a refund?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for somebody with a short attention span","review":"I really didn't like this book. It's very long and wordy, and it describes things of no importants. Henderson goes off in long stories that mean nothing, and then expects people to remember what he was talking about in the first place.

I STRONGLY URGE THE BUYER TO INSTEAD READ THE MANGA, AS OPPOSED TO WATCHING THE ANIME.Chobits (as more clearly seen in the manga) proposes that the idea of machines being created in the image of man is not much different to the idea of men being created in the image of God, and so these machines should own the right to exercise the same privileges and liberties human beings do.

It is virtually impossible to make smoke-free, so unless you have a really good stove hood, don't even think about it. It would be a good device to take on an outing where you're going to cook outdoors, however, either over a camp grill or with a portable stove, and the smokiness of the environment is not a concern. It is really hard to clean once you use it and the wood powders available to use with the smoker are pretty expensive. I smoked fresh caught fish of all types for many years using a standard electric smoker, so I am not a newbie at this, but if you are going to use it indoors, don't bother unless you like a smoky kitchen and a really messy kitchen contraption to deal with afterwards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smoker Review","review":"This smoker arrived on schedule.

Too much smoke escapes when you cook with it. I will be using it outdoors on my grill. While the food it cooks is pretty good, I only rated it 2 stars because it is not an indoor smoker. My house smells like smoke...and not in a good way.

I forgot that his \\"set\\" had a big industrial exhaust fan over the stove that blew fumes out into the city. I have a \\"builder's standard\\" oven hood, like 99% of Americans that blasts the exhaust right back into the room. Using this smoker on a stovetop inside your house is not unlike lighting a campfire on your living room carpet and then puttng it out with wet hickory-soaked blankets. You probably don't have enough windows to open to clear the stink in a reasonable amount of time. After 3 days, I'm considering pulling down the drapes and dragging the furniture to the curb.

I have a large drum smoker and a gas grill, I'll probably just stick to them for now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets the job done!!!","review":"The key to getting the most from this product is to go above what the instructions call for. For instance, if the instructions call for 1 1/2 tablespoons of wood chips, put in 3-4. That will give you the smoky flavor that you are looking for. Also, if the instructions call for medium heat on your stove, go slightly above that (for example, medium setting is 5 set it to 6 or 7. That will not only insure good smoked flavor but it will also cook the food thoroughly and give you the color you are looking for. Be aware that stoves are different and my stove is electric so gas stoves may do the trick if set at medium heat. And finally you may want to extend your cooking time as well 10 minutes or so beyond what instructions call for to get the smoke flavor and tenderness you are looking for. For salmon I usually cook it 45-60 minutes. Hope this helps someone who might be on the verge of throwing their smoker away. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Ribs Yet","review":"My husband and I had purchased a Cameron Stainless Steel Stovetop Smoker for our use, after using it to smoke baby back ribs for 45 minutes then putting them in the oven on low temperature for a few hours (with Barbeque sauce on them), we were more than satisfied with our purchase. We recently ate at a Barbeque place that advertised that they had placed 2nd in a cookoff for their ribs, but I guarantee that our ribs were 200% better than theirs!!!!

Smoking is a wonderful cooking methodology which imparts flavor into food through the type of wood used and the smoke it produces.To use the product, simply place the wood chips inside the base of the smoker and put the food that you wish to smoke in the tray on top. Virtually any food can be smoked. The guide that comes with the smoker provides suggestions for cooking times and a series of recipes to try. Or simply try your own.

Imagine my disappointment when I discovered I couldn't fit the meat into the pan! I cut a small portion from my brisket and put it in, but the juice from it swamped the chips and I finally gave up after cleaning out the pan and putting fresh chips in three times. This is probably good for two small chicken breasts or a small fish fillet, but don't expect to do anything more with it, and don't use the fattier, juicier cuts that would normally be put in a smoker or your chips will be totally soaked."},{"rating":"2","title":"its awesome!!","review":"i bought this smoker for my girl friend who is from down south and moved up north a couple of years ago. when we go down south to visit her family we always make sure we stop and get smoked pulled pork sandwiches. nothing like them!!! i got her this so we could enjoy smoked meats, not knowing what to expect. we love this smoker!!! i've had my family over for smoked pulled pork sandwiches and my dad wants me to open up a restaurant...lol! it works well, and we love it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great item","review":"I have seen these used on a number of shows on the cooking network and since we love to make smoked food I decided to give this a try.

Minimal fuss and easy cleanup. While the smoking wasn't as good as an outdoor smoker, it seemed to do the trick.However, after 6 months I put some water in it after it had cooled down , and found I had about a dozen cracks in the bottom of the pan causing the water to leak out. I followed the directions to the letter, yet this stainless steel pan which the manufaturer claims will \\"last for years\\" was done after 6 months. $60 flushed down the drain.

Yep, factory chips are expensive, but if your that bothered by it, split a baseball bat and run it through your pencil sharpener (ok, I haven't tried that, but I did take a camping knive and whittle off some chips from storebought chunks one night to avert hickory withdrawal). Yeah, maybe you can do better if you have a outdoor rig, but any smoker will tell you it's no small investment of time or money to fire up a wood pit, and I'm not likely to do it for just 4 chops.

But the fun is more in the having the KISS stuff than enjoying the sound. When I do my compilation discs for my own play, there is nothing memorable here. Sad, but true that this is not a KISS album, but it may be a rock album.

The album cover had bassist/band co-founder Gene Simmons sticking out his long trademark tongue to show fans that the quartet were still Kiss, with or without makeup.

The limits of those of a certain race to certain jobs is extraordinarily offensive, and I cannot see the benefit of reading this wordy and prejudiced story.

The pace is lively. The facts are accurate and frequently drawn from first person survivor and news accounts. McKee doesn't simply report the facts, however, he weaves them together and draws fair assumptions when conflicts occur from sources with reasons to shade the truth. It is an amazing tale that is almost unbelievable.

This was a fair read but far from being a book I just couldn't put down. There were areas where I wished for more detail and information and there were items of information that were completely uneeded. Overall I gave it a three. It's a good book if you can't find anything else to read. A chronicle of true stupidy at work on the ocean, with over three dozen different names of people to keep track of.

However, it was extremely disappointing. First, Pyper should *not* have tried to write a book with a female main character. It took me about 15 pages to even realize it was a woman. Almost everything she said or did seemed unrealistic and/or forced to me. Also, there was no \\"eeriness\\" in this book like there was in Lost Girls. There were a few attempts at \\"creepy\\" scenes, but they just ended up being cheesy. The whole premise of the book was bland and unoriginal: rich North American execs are kidnapped in a foreign country and terrible things ensue. Try as they might, they can't figure out why they've been targeted. Then, in the last few pages, all is revealed! Surprise! Too bad it wasn't at all surprising.Andrew Pyper is capable of much better writing than this. I hope that his next book is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Slim PDAs Only","review":"This PDA Case is attractive and professional; however, space is limited.

It's the story of the Black Robin and how they were saved. There were only 5 left, and only one was a female. She was already older than breeding age. Don and his crew moved them to predator free Chatham Island. Old Blue (the female Black Robin) suddenly changed mates and started laying eggs. Don had the idea that if he took the young chicks to be fostered by another species, she might lay more eggs. It worked and now there are over 100 Black Robins. I know Don personally, but even if I didn't, he would be a hero to me. Don also saved the Kakapo, the world's largest parrot by weight, and one of the most endangered. He's a genius when it comes to birds, and very humble about it.

That has happened with Jennifer Lopez and other manufactured artists, especially Britney Spears. Her latest single, Everytime, the third track from In The Zone, really isn't as good as her other signatures. I wasn't impressed at all at this song, it just sounded like a song Jessica Simpson conjured. With her image upon her previous songs: Me Against The Music with Madonna, and Toxic, it may also turn some fans away from her wild child reputation. It isn't a great song, and not really a joyous song either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Britney possessed by Kate Bush","review":"Time and space must have inverted or something. I'm flipping stations in my car and land on what sounds like a new Kate Bush song: \\"...Everytime I try to fly I fall/without my wings I feel so small/I guess I need you baby...\\" The same quiet hush to the voice, the oddball visuals of a little wingless ball of insecurity...that's totally Kate's art-rock style, right? I knew it wouldn't really be Kate Bush since she's retired (and wouldn't sing \\"baby\\") but, I check the net and am STUNNED to find it is the new Britney Spears single. And further surprised that the cover art, of Britney in a flower, seems to be intended to create a Buddhist/lotus flower vibe. Anyway, I - a person who wouldn't watch one of these lame lip synch dancers if you paid me - am about to own a Britney Spears single. Weird. Weird weird weird. Maybe Kate wrote it or something...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly gorgeous.....","review":"At first listen, I was completely mesmerized by the melodic and poetic beauty of the song. Britney truly pours out her heart in this one...it appears as though she is almost crying through thelyrics. She sings of love lost in a way that is truly haunting and intriguing. This is one of Britney's best ballads, I am soglad she decided to make it a single. The remixes themselves take the original song to a whole new level with this trance-vibe uniqueness that fits perfectly with this song. If you are a die-hard Britney fan, I would highly recommend picking up this album, as it is one of her greatest ones to date, and you will not be disappointed. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A gem.","review":"I saw an adaptation of this book on children's TV years ago. I could not quite remember the gist but jumped at the chance to read it when I found an old copy in a Jumble Sale.And it is really good. A tale in the old style, one of the first truly English novels. Set somewhere on the South coast, Moonfleet is the spiritual home of the Mohunes, a legendary group of pirates. The sea is always at the back of the story as we follow our young hero, John, through his various scrapes. His two goals in life are his girl and the treasure. As he searches for the way to both, John spends many a memorable episode in such places as the church's crypt, is defeated at almost every turn and goes through an adventure tinged with fear and horror that will exhilirate the hardiest reader.Although this is a children's book, its themes and scenarios involve the most serious of readers. This is the archetypal \\"good yarn\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moonfleet Review","review":"Moonfleet is a great book to read. It's an adventurous story told by John Trenchard,a man who lived many missions as a young boy. They story revolves around various issues such as the vault, secrets and a line of betrayal. The blatant use of description sets fascinting images and lets your mind flw into the amazing world of Moonfleet.

The most enthralling part was john crawling along a foot wide ledge with a broken leg. At this point I couldn't put the book down until I knew what was going to happen at the end. Other parts were quite different, like the chapters spent on John asnd Elzevier in the cave. I thought these chapters were never going to end it just seemed to go on and on. The book over all was like this it seemd to go on for a while but then start to get molre interesting.......it took a long time for the story line to pick up. Like the escape from the prison and the boat ride which climaxed at the storm where the ship they were travelling was nearly wrecked. Although I would probably never read this book again I'm not saying I didn't enjoy it. Some parts did keep you gripped and interested others were about as interesting as watching paint dry.

Once you start reading, the words engulf you, and you get caught up in the adventurous storyline.I'm glad that Moonfleet hasn't got too much description, but just the right amount, so that you can understand the story.Because of this we can at parts, feel the characters emotions.I would recommend Moonfleet to anyone, whether you like tragedy or humour, this is definitely a worthwhile read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Moonfleet book review","review":"This gripping tale of terror, betrayal and friendship that will haunt you at night This fantasy story is about 15 year old Jhon Trenchard, an orpan who accidently finds the secret entrence into the Pirate world: The Vault.

Even in the brutal heat and humidity of the summer, nights were comfortable. The absolutely only thing I though that could use a little improvement would be the zippers on the main entry door.

Some critics say that this movie doesn't have a plot, but it really does - It is a day in the life of two teanagers living in the hood and trying to just hang out and mind their own business, but the other characters and events they encounter are cause for one hilarious conflict after another.

THe movie takes place in an entire day (FRIDAY!), where anything can happen. This is Chris Tucker's funniest roles that he has ever portrayed. This film is definitely not recommended for audiences younger than 10. This movie by far is way better than \\"Next Friday\\" which was not funny in so many ways.

It will always rock. I am white, but you don't have to be black to enjoy this movie (even though that is the ethnic group this movie was made for). I love to see Smokey and Craig trip. however, I deducted a star for the fact that (in my opinion) it ripped off Cheech and Chong's Up In Smoke (and Nice Dreams, and Next MOvie, and Still Smokin'). It was the same concept. 2 guys sittin' around and getting high and having to deal with a lot of jerks. Nevertheless, it was a darn good rip-off of Cheech & Chong. Watch this.

This movie has all the classic black stereotypes. It even has a scene where Smokey gets so high that he ends up in the chicken coop thinking he's a chicken. Remember the old minstrel shows?: \\"nobody in here but us chickens.\\" There's no plot to speak of, just a bunch of insults, getting high, stealing money, potty jokes, black people knocking each other upside the head. Some character get punched out, and Smokey (Chris Tucker) goes over and yells in his face, \\"Dude, you been knocked out!\\" That's a typical \\"joke\\" from this movie.

I would highly recommend NOT TO BUY this copy/edited. Buy the original or buy the Ice Cube 4 movies in 1 DVD. Much better value.

It's a perfectly done movie with a lot of memorable lines and a number of memorable scenes. You can't find many if anybody that doesn't like it. It's definitely worth your time to check it out. Though not the most technically efficient movie, or one with an absolutely amazing story, it's one with a lot of charm and comedy that really makes you laugh without resorting to the tiring tricks that get pulled in most of today's movies.The DVD features deleted scenes, which are good to know, a poduction interview with the heads behind the film, and a few music videos, nicluding Dr. Dre's 'Keep Their Heads Ringin'.Highly recommended.

Now it is a watered down version of the old rag.What irked me the most though is being fed one sided environmental claptrap and political commentary. The people behind this magazine and mags like Outside don't believe there are conservatives who love and care for the outdoors.

Ah but back to the magazine it is filled with articles on trails, equipment, clothing, recipes and information for packing for your hike. Lots of Ads and phone numbers enable you to find the equipment you need. So whether you are going to hike the desert or going for that Rocky mountain high you can easily find the info and stats you need.

Too much of the publication is devoted to describing fantastic hikes in exotic locations and not enough space is given to backpacking equipment and supply reviews.

With a hunting knife clamped between his teeth as he dives off a 100-foot cliff into a raging river filled with man-eating crocks .............. well, you get the picture and he certainly doesn't deserve mention in a magazine devoted to backpacking.

However, I think this CD relfects, perhaps, the incredibly fast pace of his stardom rather than a tribute to Louis. Some of the tunes (e.g., Helly Dolly)are almost unrecognizable. Personally, I think only the last tune (West End Blues) really makes you think of Louis. And who told Nicholas that he could sing? He's an outstanding trumpeter but a less than medicore vocalist. I'm not really disillusioned-- I will continue to buy his CD's and follow his career. I'm sure this is just a little bump in the road."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nicholas Payton-Dear Louis","review":"I am sorry Nicholas, but as a true jazz affectionado, with over 1700 CD's in my collection, I can truly say you let us down on this one.

Maybe Louie would have liked this, I don't know. I do know that I don't. There has never been another musician or singer with Louis' ability to send the audience home humming the melodies of the tunes in his show. If I had never heard Hello Dolly or I'll Be Glad When You're Dead You Rascal You before I had heard this CD I would not be able to hum those tunes 10 minutes after hearing this CD. I'm sorry, but being born in New Orleans doesn't make you a New Orleans Jazz great.It is commendable that these modern music players have honored the great Louis Armstrong with this CD.

The acting, for the most part, was very effective; the family's initial happiness and the tragedies they go through are played out perfectly with heart-wrenching emotion.I am not a big fan of \\"old movies\\" or \\"classics,\\" because sometimes I find them superficial or overacted. Shenandoah effectively battles those annoyances of mine with its mature themes and honesty.

For reasons no film historian has been able to explain, Stewart's remarkable skills as an actor deserted him in the early Sixties, and he was never the same. It's an atrocious performance in a Civil War film that is full of them. Only James Best as a Rebel veteran manages to bring some life to the proceedings. The script is sickeningly sanctimonious and made all the worse by the incompetent direction of one of Hollywood's all-time hacks, Andrew V. McLaglen, who also blighted the later years in John Wayne's career."},{"rating":"2","title":"He shoots, He scores","review":"This book is one of the best hockey books I have ever read. It tells you about a boy that has never played hockey before, but is a really fast skater. He races against the fastest player on the Golden Bears hockey team and beats him. Scott is then invited to be on the team. With a lot of help and guidness, Scott becomes a very good player. In the book, there are some kids on the team that arn't very nice to Scott and that makes him feel unwanted. After about half way through the season, Scott chatches on to all the plays and becomes a good player and good friends with all the kids on the team that used to not be friends with him. I thought that this book was very fun to read, and it reminded me of when I was younger and played hockey but wasn't very good. But now I am a good player from all the practice I have had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't fool a real 11-year-old hockey player!","review":"My son read this book and found it \\"deameaning\\" because so much of the hockey information was inaccurate.

It even has a very introspective sound.It's not just the song dedicated to Wendy Melvoin's brother Jonathon that stands out with such sentimentality, but the other tracks share that same quality. However, enough is enough. You are left craving for something a little more up-beat; Not necessarily in the sense of dance music (more oomph, if you will). It's almost like the more toned down version of an Alanis Morissette album.This is one time where I feel like this album requires more style than substance. It's just too heavy to listen to at times. It also resembles a watered-down or diluted version of their Wendy & Lisa debut album from '87 ( and that album was excellent!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Overlooked Goodie","review":"This cd is full of great music.

Yesterday I made homemade meatballs for dinner and a double batch of dinner rolls, all while wearing the baby in the moby. This thing is a life saver! With a large family, there are very few days that I can just sit and hold the baby, sure there are always people around who want to hold her, but I don't want to miss the bonding time with my sweetie. With the Moby, I can hold her all day long and with it being flu season, I've noticed when she is in the wrap people don't ask to hold her as often which is a definite plus in avoiding germs.I wish I'd had this for my previous 5 babies!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the Baby K'Tan","review":"At first I purchased the Baby K'Tan as I thought it would be a good alternative to the Moby Wrap which looked very initmidating to me. I didn't like the K'Tan one bit. My newborn baby hung very low in it and never seemed to be comfortable. What is bad about the K'Tan (and also what makes it \\"easier\\" to put on), is that it is pre-sized, and not adjustable. I am 5'8\\" and 140 pounds and the size small was too big. Maybe if I had gotten the xtra small it would have fit better, but it wasn't worth shelling out additional money to find out. I went and bought the Moby Wrap from my local retailer and, after watching a video on YouTube on how to put it on, it fit so much better! Whenever my newborn would scream and cry I would put him in the Moby and he was instantly soothed. My advice...buy the Moby and skip the K'Tan. Once you get the hang of the Moby it is so much better because it is adjustable which is key!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Second Moby Wrap!","review":"I purchased a Moby Wrap in 2009 for my 3rd child and I loved it.

The lady at a local baby boutique suggested that I should go for a lighter color. Now pregnant again and due this summer, I purchased another Moby Wrap in the Bliss print/color - which is beautiful. Immediately, I realized that this Moby Wrap's weight was way lighter than my 1st Moby Wrap. I guess they changed the type of cotton being used. I love how much softer this one is and I know that I will love using this wrap. I will keep using my 1st Moby Wrap for around the house and as a back up in the cooler months. I love wearing my Moby Wrap and it is easy to put on. If you need help learning the different ways to wear your baby, check out youtube videos for Moby Wrap.

Some of the samples and their manipulation of such are amusing, but it gets boring...really boring after about twenty minutes or so (mind you, the album runs about seventy-one minutes total).

A modern \\"Joan of Arc\\" story interwoven with mideast terror, physical infirmity, and the power of redemptive grace. One of Morris West's finest books: a triumph of realism amidst recovery."},{"rating":"2","title":"West's best","review":"For those inspired by the more predictable of apocolyptic tales, this book may come as somewhat of a disappointment. For me, this was the most enjoyable of West's works. The story showed deep insight and knowledge into the workings/neuroses of the Vatican, (and yes, I am a practicing, believing Catholic) and the ending, which some have labeled \\"far fetched\\", is indeed about as far fetched as the Messiah himself was in his own lifetime. For many who know that person of Christ, West's powerful ending will inspire beyond words. For those more concerned with literary believability, it may leave one unsatisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Morris West, Clowns of God","review":"One of the very best books I have ever read.

I am thankful."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can remember when Morris West was a brilliant author...","review":"...but the ridiculous ending to this book would receive a failing grade in a freshman composition class.Unlike West's other books that deal with Catholicism, this farfetched tale does not illustrate depth, faith or compassion. He takes out his own bitterness in depicting, in essence, a Pope who has decided that most Church teachings are wrong.Andrew Greeley overworked the \\"democratic Church\\" topic years ago - but one would expect that from a pop novelist, not an author such as West."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mean-spirited corruption of Catholic ideas--Yukkh!","review":"Wow...I can see that I'm in the minority here. So be it. Thisis a nasty, pretentious, and near-blasphemous book, rich in theCalvinist and Jansenist heresies, lacking utterly in anything I would call compassion, and having nothing in common with genuine Catholic teaching.Not convinced? You could read it, as I did, but it's as likely to make you furious as inspired. We are a schizophrenic species in some ways, and this book shines kleig lights on the main faultline: Whether one views humanity as halfway home on the upward road to God, or halfway down on the inevitable freefall into Hell.Basically, if you hate humanity, you'll love this book. If you love humanity, you'll hate it.If you're a genuine Catholic, you'll shake your head and be glad that fewer and fewer people seem to think this way as time goes on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is the end of the world approaching?","review":"What would happen, if the members of the Roman Curia discovered that the Pope was about to publically state that he had received a private revelation that the world was about to end? This is the fundamental premise of this exciting novel by the author of \\"The Shoes of the Fisherman\\". This book has as many \\"twists and turns\\" as a spy novel, with the additional interest of having the Pope as the main character. The ending will shock and surprise most readers. Considering the popularity of the \\"Left Behind\\" series, this book is one which should generate real interest (and is better written and far more believable) among believers and non-believers alike."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not my cup of tea","review":"I have to say that I found this book to be quite boring. i've been laid up for a few weeks.

It is primarily a character study of Amory Blaine ,a young man of romantic temperament who lives off the inheritance form his wealthy mother. Blaine and his relationships with his male friends at Princeton both during and after college are one part of the book.His sense of purposelessness and his relationships with women are the other major themes of the book.Blaine is not a likable protagonist but Fitzgerald makes him compelling and his strong ear for dialogue and wonderful writing style plus some interesting secondary characters make the novel a winner"},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing","review":"I have wanted to read this book for a long time I just never had the time.

Definitely recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amory rocks","review":"Amory is the perfect character. He is more real than most books allow and his tale is life affirming while true to its misery"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow","review":"My thoughts on this first, autobiographical novel of Fitzgerald's are a little mixed. On the one hand, I strangely loved the gimmicky and unusual narrative format, with its headlined asides to the audience and occasional screenplay-style dialogue. The writing style is fast and easy to read. But, in the end, the cons far outweighed the pros for me. Plot is nonexistent, a flaw which works when the characterization is strong and compelling, but Amory Blaine failed utterly to connect with me, and the minor characters were ciphers to the point that I had a hard time even remembering who was who. The inevitably formative war years were glossed over, and all the reader is left with are meta ramblings on literature and socialism. Certainly not the worst book I've ever read, but not very redemptive either."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Absolute Favorite","review":"As a HS sophomore I read this book for the first time, and I was enthralled with Amory's journey to find himself. The closing lines of the novel remain some of my favorite of anything I've read. Everytime I re-read this book, I am captured by the search for self and prompted to rethink my own self-concepts. Some criticize the book for its unrefined style, but the variance in techniques used is one of my favorite parts of the novel. I love Fitzgerald most for his way with words, and the use of both poetry and script along with prose truly showcase his brilliance. A wonderful read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"F. Scott Comes Through","review":"\\"This Side of Paradise\\" was Fitzgerald's first novel, and it is quite immature. But nevertheless, it is extremely vital, and fascinating not jut as an example of his early work, but on its own... the compelling story of a young man trying to make his own way in an increasingly complex world. Rings as true today as it did with the Lost Generation 80 years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book this side of--oh, never mind.","review":"Okay, so not the ABSOLUTE best, but by golly definitely one of them. At first, you think, \\"Oh, no, I'm going to hate this Amory Blaine, I really am.\\" But then he grows on you somehow, because you can say to at least one of the situations he gets in--usually the abortive romantic ones--that you've been there, too. Especially good for young men (although by no means just them) and aspiring writers of whatever gender. I liked the way Fitzgerald experiments a bit (the one scene done in the form of a play) and how he ends the book with a phrase that many of us can say, at the end of our journeys--- \\"\`I know myself,\` he cried, \`but that is all.\`\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book, intellectual but NOT boring!","review":"This book was a complete surprise. The structure and material are very fresh and original, although it is almost 100 years old. The plot is not atypical (life story, growing up, especially college) but I'll be damned if any one I ever met in college had conversations like this character and his friends. It makes the reader think - something this reader hasn't done in a few years (and certainly didn't do in college either!). I liked it very much. It touched my imagination and made me realize that I've been a little bit stagnant for some time... (I'm 30). I would recommend this book to anyone. It's very readable, with a lot to say about the world, and all of it applying to today's world as well as the writer's. Thank you, F. Scott."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Writer-Terrible Book","review":"Fitzgerald is obviously one of America's greatest modern writers-his prose style and use of language is amazing and The Great Gatsby is a classic that everyone should own and re-read on a regular basis. Yet this book, his first, has one of the most obnoxious, least-likeable protagonists in American literature- Amory Blaine. Blaine is arrogant, self-centered, self-important, and a pompous windbag; yet not in an interesting way such as Holden Caufield. Also, Fitzgerald's description of the idealism of Ivy League life and society is so corny and hokey that it is difficult to read at times.Of course, the book has its merits for the fact that it is the first novel of a great novelist and it contains the seeds of the literary style that he polished with later works. You can still find insights and character descriptions that lesser authors could only hope to create."},{"rating":"1","title":"Puerile","review":"Sorry to disagree with most everybody writing their reviews but Fitzgerald failed miserably at getting down to the nitty-gritty of the human condition. He reminded me of the clueless politicians we have in Washington debating health care issues or national defense. Like our politicians, Amory was selfish, pompous, obnoxious and what's perhaps even more inexcusable considering his education, a dim-wit. Fitzgerald's vision doesn't penetrate beneath the surface of our daily lives. His characters are terribly vapid, philistines, bourgois to the max. I tell you what, Amory deserved the ass-kicking he received. I only wish I could have got in a few punches on Amory and Fitzgerald. And his entire rap at the end of the book was nauseatingly peurile. The novel was pure bull."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just didn't appeal to me.","review":"I don't know why. I liked The Great Gatsby. I love Fitzgerald's short stories. But I just couldn't get into this book. It took me months to make it halfway through because I'd put it down and read a few other books before picking it back up. When I realized I was looking at finishing the book as a chore instead of a leisure activity, I moved on completely. I'll just have to live with not knowing what happened in Amory's life."},{"rating":"1","title":"lucky he wasn't discouraged","review":"So dated it annoys. The language seems made up at times.

I finally donated it to the Goodwill"},{"rating":"1","title":"Somebody should just slap this twit","review":"Few have had the balls to call this book the pretentious pseudo-intellectual twaddle that it is. Amory, a spoiled rich boy, goes to the best schools mommy can buy, but squanders his time there partying and worrying about the cut of his clothes, while becoming a smug, poetry spouting phony. After an undistinguished hitch in the army, he realizes he is too good to work, and toys with several women while becoming an alcoholic and subjecting the reader to lots of bad poetry. Finally, he turns into a political bore, spewing Fitzgerald's socialist propaganda, and wanders the earth insulting innocent people.An episode in one of Amory's shallow affairs, in which he and his girl-squeeze of the moment take a break from reciting poetry at each other to wallow in sociopathic self pity after she has murdered her horse in a narcissistic fit, is particularly disturbing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it","review":"I attempted to read this for a book club.

I don't even know why I bring this up first, but it bugs me. It's just like everyone reflects Amory. The only good one was by his friend who sooner or later seems to be stifled of his creativity by simply hanging out with the dull Amory.Another point I have to make is that his one little affair with this country girl is so vague and unclearly written, the only things I understood about it was her poem and a horseback ride.Honestly, it was good in the beginning, but soon enough, it slowly fell apart. By the end it was just a chaos of words. By the end, when he climbs into a car with a big man with goggles and begins a string of vignettes about his views on society which all go nowhere, the book is just analyzations.Well anyway, it just had a horrible impact on my life and I hated his little encounter with the man with curly feet."},{"rating":"1","title":"How did this ever get published?","review":"This is the worst book I've ever read.

Scott Fitzgerald has once again perfectly captured an entire generation in this book, yet did so in such a way that people can still relate today. Everyone can relate to Amory Blaine's plight of finding who you are amidst a generation that is lost and determined to do nothing substantial. Furthermore, Amory's incessant dissatisfaction with himself is something else we all can relate to. The reader is told that with Amory, \\"it was always the becoming he dreamed of, never the being.\\" Amory always wanted to do things but never took the time to appreciate what he was.

But you don't remember any of them because they are all reflections of Armory himself. Yet he's dull. So a reflection of a rock is not much to take home. It would be nice if just ONE character held your interest.

Tiny, wearable, perfect for a no-frills organizer, Rex is approximately parallel to the functionality found in a Palm's four main buttons (calendar, address book, to-dos, memos). The Rex adds a few more tricks like a two-clock multi-timezone view, but can't run third-party software, do email, write with a stylus, or beam via IR. But if you're looking for an organizer you're not necessarily looking for those features. The real downside for me is the slow (though passable) data entry when away from a computer. The upside is that, lacking a touchscreen interface, the view on the Rex is razor sharp."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value for money","review":"I have recently purchased both the 5001 and the 6000 series REX, and found the 5001 to be more flexible in its synching options, and less delicate.I use my REX primarily as an address book, to do list and notes. Input is not a big issue for me, nor is Web content downloads.The 5001 uses the Starfish TrueSync technology to synch with any number of devices, including cell phones, Yahoo and Palm Desktop. I actually synch mine with both Palm Desktop and Yahoo simultaneously so that I have access to my addresses over the Internet.The 6000 does not support TrueSync, limiting my synchronization options to be only Outlook, and the bundled desktop application. The 6000 also seems to be more delicate with both the screen and the buttons.Bottom line: I just returned my 6000 and am ordering a second 5001."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rex Doesn't Work With Windows ME!","review":"I purchased the Rex after reading a number of excellent reviews, including many from people who had purchased the unit to \\"sync\\" with their Windows applications, particularly Outlook. I was disappointed to learn later that the Rex does not presently sync with Windows ME or its version of Outlook. Given the number of keystrokes required to enter even small items of info on Rex manually, the Rex is of little use to anyone with Windows ME. Xircom confirms the Rex does not presently sync with Windows ME, although they say they're working on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not tough enough for real life","review":"I really like this product, in concept and in practice. So much so, that I have replaced it *twice in a six months*. But I have finally decided that I cannot use one long-term, because the screen breaks too easily.The thing is designed to be pocket-size, but the manual points out that it is not really safe to carry in most pockets, briefcases or handbags. Unfortunately, they mean it! The screen cracks fairly easily under real-life conditions faced in any of these common places.On the other hand, maybe I am just a scrub. People who dress more business-like might not have this problem. The only safe and useful place I have found to put the thing, in my wardrobe, would a front shirt- or coat- pocket. But I do not dress far enough up on the food-chain to have one of those every day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Concept but not easy to use","review":"Cool little machine once I worked out how to use it (as the instructions don't tell you). It so much better than carrying diaries/day timers around with you. The docking station and TrueSync are a great idea but not that straight forward. Its a lot quicker to add all your info from your PC or laptop using this however when it come to synchronising from you PC to the REX that's when the problems start. I spent nearly 1 hour of the phone to the help line and got them to go through it. Saying that, I still have problems with it. But, if you are a wizard on the computers and not a technophobe like me you should be OK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another one bites the dust!","review":"The rex system is small, flexible and can be an indispensable resource when away from home or office.

After a couple of misfires I was able to synch it with ACT and now have over 1200 contacts with to do's, phone numbers, and calendar.

So I bought a Poulan 810 EPT.I used the Poulan for the first time today, and it was a greatpole saw. The corded electric saw is far more superior to thecordless B&D;, when the cordless did work. The saw is much faster, andthe speed was constant.The only problem I have with the Poulan, is it doesn't comewith a chain cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"No complaints","review":"I needed a pruner and was trying to avoid yet another gas engine. The Poulan 810EPT seems to be a good contraption for the money. I was concerned that it might be underpowered but I have used it to cut limbs as big around as a grapefruit {about 5\\"} with no difficulty; it will likely cut a limb several inches larger. It cuts fast. My only concern with it is that, when you take it apart, have it on a flat surface like the ground or a bench because it is so long that it is hard to control when it comes apart as there is weight on both ends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst tool ever","review":"First one lasted about 3 hours.

Replacement was treated even more gently than first, so it lasted a little longer. Second unit has now failed, same failure as first, a plastic coupling between the motor and flexible drive cable. Bad design. Great tool while it works, just don't expect to use for anything other than trimming the rose bush from a distance. Won't cut real wood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product Support Non-existent","review":"Purchased form Amazon, lasted 20 minutes before it broke. I was told to take it to a brick and mortar store for warrantee work. They were unhappy that I brought it in. They have no parts for this tool and they cant give me a date for repair, it has been two weeks now. In fact, they told me that if purchased from them there is an over the counter exchange policy. This tool should be replaced rather than repaired when it is new. The repair could cost more than the original purchase price. If you buy this tool over the web, don't expect any support from the either seller or the manufacturer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Effective pruner","review":"The Poulan pole saw does what it is supposed to do - trims branches that would otherwise be out of reach. It cuts quickly and cleanly, and so far (I've used it only a couple of times) I have had no trouble with the chain either binding or becoming too loose. It is quite heavy (compared to a hand pole saw), but if you adjust the shoulder sling they provide you can get it to balance reasonably well. The fact that the motor is at the bottom of the pole while the cutting mechanism is fixed to the top of the pole makes balancing and control easier. But of course it also means you cannot use the tool as a hand electric chain saw without the pole (as I believe is possible with some electric pole saws)."},{"rating":"2","title":"works well","review":"I have used this saw once and it worked well.

Same run-around from local Poulan repair shop. Same frustrating experience from Poulan trying to get warranty replacement (they finally did replace the unit). The product is good -- while it works. But anything more than what you can cut with a manual pole pruner (~1\\") seems to overload the shaft coupling. I'm afraid to use the tiller attachment becasue it seems like it would be a much heavier load on the coupling. This must have been designed by the Poulan CEO's idiot son and no one has guts enough to fix it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't Good Like the First One","review":"This one wasn't good like the first one.

The writing has mostly been replaced by repetitive eye candy for weight weenies, Lance wannabees and the summer fred and does little to bridge the gap in the variety of bicycles, cyclists, and cycling styles and needs.Maybe it has to do with the market's share going to mountain bike mags (5 out of 6 in my local market) or maybe the same cookie cutter bikes it features every month are just fast money, a sure thing marketed to the before mention riders.

For years I have seen my son's attitude and self esteem go down the drain. Nothing but video games, the computer and pizza and sodas. It never occurred to me that his physical fitness (or lack of it) had so much effect on his life (and confidence). We made a deal that he would give this book a try. I really didn't expect much, but in a few short weeks, I saw his whole life change. He rushes in from school and heads for his weights and his workout. I think he finally feels that he has some control over something in his life. I feel that this is a much more productive way for him to spend his afternoons. He has more confidence, more interest in life and he is even starting to get better grades.

I contacted the president of the Van Cliburn Foundation to see if this was authorized. He replied saying that he did not know about this CD, and upon investigating he discovered that it is a pirate recording. This is an illegal CD and should NOT be purchased.

It is ironic that those who most benefit from our tax dollars--the middle class--are those who most complain about their tax dollars being wasted.Shales' proposals are just as typically hopeless.

I find it sad, and depressing that women actually buy magazines like this that covertly tell them they are worthless unless they are almost invisibly thin and star-like attractive according to some impossible-to-attain standard.

It's all about fitness, beauty, health, self-confidence (as said before, most fitness magazines don't include this), and your mind + body. It's great for teenage girls and women who want to be healthier and achieve a better body. It's great for women who need motivation; it gives you tips on how to lose weight, how to eat right for life. In my opinion, the best part is the SELF challenge, when you have 3 months and a good planner to help you get ultimately stronger, leaner, and healthier. It's got great articles too and a little fashion and make-up-not so much that's like a teen magazine. In all respect, SELF changed my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"ladies steer clear of this rag, they are under the impression women are stupid and insane!","review":"Self is a rag that lives under the standard liberal montra that women are too stupid and insane to be able to operate the same devices that men do. they hate women that think with their brains instead of whats under their skirts. they assume you are stupid and SHOULD be raped instead of perfectly capable of defending yourselves, and are not afraid to take facts and turn them into complete lies. pic a different magazine or they will convince you to get back in the kitchen and give up your opinion!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good recipes","review":"I got this magazine because I was reading it one time in a waiting room and loved it.

The articles seem to focus on issues facing single women who are just starting their careers. Fine, but not for me anymore! Also, their subscription department is terrible! My most recent subscription has been plagued with missed issues, double issues and late issues -- and a customer service department that can't quite pull themselves together."},{"rating":"2","title":"My self-help glossy mag of choice!","review":"While I look to Glamour and Mademoiselle magazines for intelligent topics on women's interests and look to Cosmopolitan for sex and relationship advice and Vogue for the latest fashion trends, I look to Self for self-improvement. This glossy mag features articles on how to stay fit, eat healthy, look and feel great and delves into issues such as breast cancer and different types of painful menstruation as well as articles on what a difference it makes to eat strawberries instead of chocolate for snack and the importance of drinking water. (My skin is looking great for having started drinking more water.) It is the mag I look to to make me feel good! I have learned how to eat healthier snacks and different exercise routines by reading this gem.

The entire magazine now pushes product on every inch of every page. Their product placements went from \\"convenient and subtle\\" to obviously pandering to their revenue sources. Plus the stories and tips are so far out of reality that anyone over 25 with half of a brain couldn't relate. I once enjoyed Self and their monthly self-help plans. Their core message has gotten lost in the sea of product pushing."},{"rating":"1","title":"reasonably attractive, but content-starved","review":"As another reviewer stated, the content repeats over and over again, making a renewal a waste of money. Yes, Self has nice photography and a pretty layout, but that doesn't make it worth five stars. If you are even remotely into fitness, then Self will merely bore you - it contains such obvious information that it's almost laughable. Still, you might want to try it once, since it's cheap as magazines go, but reading it for true inspiration (other than all the beautiful models in tiny shorts that make you feel guilty) is a waste of your time and money. Reading it for fitness information would be like reading People magazine for political issues. There are better magazines out there, but this'll do if you just want something to leave lying around your house to make a good impression."},{"rating":"2","title":"i love this magazine","review":"I look forward to seeing the next issue for this magazine every month. I've been buying this magazine since 2001 and it's really inspirational. Unlike some of the other magazines, the women don't look muscular, look very toned and healthy. I especially love the monthly cut-out section near the end of the magazine. I've collected these over the years, and having a full exercise session saves a lot of time. If I want to look great in jeans, I'll just flip to the section called \\"look great in jeans\\" and follow all the exercises. I love that almost all the exercises can be done right in your own home without going to a gym! Amazing. It has such a pleasant design too...

I am 32 years old and recently decided to give Self a try - figured I'd have something light to read even if just during my commute to work and I quickly realized after two issues that I grown past the topics touched upon in this magazine. Mainly geared towards women just starting out in their careers and still single. I think if your a 20-something then try this magazine...I think you'll like it. If your late 20's - 30's..I would suggest trying something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"This magazine seems to spend more time pushing personal politics and little time on any aspect of a woman's health, fitness, or true development of \\"self\\".

It is amateur journalism at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Discouraging and Sinful with a few good recipes","review":"I subscribed to Self because I wanted encouraging tips on health and fitness. Over two years of subscribing, I'm convinced that this magazine is encouraging... just not in a healthy way. This magazine promotes having internet flings, three-way sexual relations, and (this is the one article that really irritated me) how one woman discovered her happiness by having an affair. Now, I'm not saying this sort of thing doesn't happen in the world, but I sure do not support it and do not want to spend my hard earned money to read about women who need psychological help or a better moral compass. Does media follow society or does society fuel the media? I think it's definitely both... but I know a good way to rectify it. Stop producing garbage articles and telling youth and women in their 20s-30s that they can discover their sexual \\"health\\" by having multiple partners, affairs, and internet sex. I'm incredibly disappointed with this magazine."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best magazine ever!","review":"I have been a faithful subscriber for approximately 10 years.

The authors talk about topics that are not important at all and do a 7th grade level review of the important topics.

This book is very poorly written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this one if you want to review for AP Biology!","review":"This is NOT a good review book. I teach AP Biology and I can tell you that this book creates confusion. The way in which it was written is disjointed and cumbersome. It goes into WAY too much detail. In a way, the Barron's book reteaches... but doesn't review. I bought this book when I took AP Biology 11 years ago, I hated it it then and when I started teaching AP Biology I bought the new version. IT WAS THE SAME DANG BOOK!!!!!Although biology has changed much in 11 years this book was the same long-winded read! I use it ONLY as a source of practice tests.

Nothing could be further from the truth. Carl Becker's essay is a wonderful addition to the historical analysis of our culture, our changing perspectives in it, and of our evolving mindsets.

Gentleman Jim Corbett, as he's been called, gives you his firsthand accounts of finding and killing man-eating tigers and leopards in India. While the author actually down-plays his own role in ending the deprivations of these much-to-be-feared killers, the animals will still give you cold chills when you realize that all too often the hunter becomes the hunted. The intelligence and thought processes of the killers will stop all scoffing that they're just \\"\\"beautiful animals\\", as they backtrack, lie in wait, and set up ambushes of their own on any unwary passers-by. The author himself admits that he loves them for the craft and wisdom that they display, along with his frank admiration for them as the top of the food chain. Definitely highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Read","review":"This book was written by not only a very brave man but a man that possessed great character and class. His only reason for hunting these Man-Eaters was to rescue the villagers from this ever present terror. He took no money for his efforts. Very exciting reading without ever a hint of bragging about his extraordinary gift of successfully hunting the most dangerous animals on earth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Map-Eaters of Kumaon","review":"The book is about as insightful as reading an Englishman's take on tea. I found it to be laborious and bloated, almost to the point of self idiocy for the hunter, who was nothing but a murdering colonialist who had everything carried for him by Punjabi jungle slaves and used large caliber hunting rifles.If you really want to hunt \\"man eaters\\", then you track into the wild alone with your own gear and you use a spear or other primitive weapon. Some blathering and arrogant Englishman who shoots a defenseless beast with a 50 caliber long range rifle is hardly \\"brave\\". If you want a bragging book from someone who lied about his \\"feats\\", then pick this up.As George Bernard Shaw said, \\"when a man wants to murder a tiger, he calls it sport; when the tiger wants to murder him, he calls it ferocity.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A Legendary Classic","review":"I first read this book 30 years ago and since then it has been read by my children, my wife, and most of my extended family. Most people return the book with an expression of joy and wonder saying \\"Wow, did all of that really happen?\\" Corbett instilled in me my love for the out of doors and hunting. I only regret that the India of Jim Corbett is rapidly disappearing.Anyone of any age who loves stories of animals and nature spiced with the suspense of a good mystery will love this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read","review":"One of the most gripping books I have ever read.

The book very well shows the respect Jim Corbett had for the man eaters."},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest hunting stories ever told","review":"This book, along with Col. Jim Corbett's \\"Man Eating leopards of Rudraprayag\\" and J.H. Patterson's \\"Man Eaters of Tsavo\\" are the three greatest hunting stories ever told. They belong on the shelves of every sportsman."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best jungle story I have ever read.","review":"I have read many jungle story. This one is my favorit. When I start read it, I cannot put it down. Every page is full of excitement.It is just amazing that a man can experience all these close encounters with man-eater in one life time. With auther's explianation of the environment, I could almost imagine myself stalking the tiger in India jungle in 1920. Great book written by a great man. What more do I have to say.If you like jungle book, try this one. I am sure you will like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enter a Vanished World","review":"The world that Jim Corbett wrote about -- his life as a whitehunter of man-eating tigers and leopards in India early in thiscentury -- is as vanished as that of the Ancient Greeks. TheEmpire he believed in is gone, the beasts he stalked so relentlesslyare now themselves endagered species... But there's a reason hisbooks have remained in print for two generations. He writes withoutguile or pretention, revealing a great respect for the jungle andfor the animals he hunts, and also providing a window into theimperial mentality -- a frank paternalism towards non-whitesand villagers in particular that in these politically correctdays is as refreshingly honest as it is shocking. And one otherthing -- while Corbett is modest almost to a fault, he was a manof remarkable courage. Sometimes the only way to stalk a predatoris to let the predator stalk you. His books have no shortage ofthrills and chills."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible print quality","review":"The story is great but the book itself looks to be a scanned version of a photocopy of the original book. There are even underlines and marks from the original owner in it that were not edited out. The quality of the text itself is awful and the pictures are worse. PLEASE find another version other then this one. I am stunned this is even sold in this condition, it feels like a scam not a real publishing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every American Student Should See This!","review":"If we are worried about our young people appreciating this country--this is what they need to see and hear.

I feel the author/author's could have done a much better job explaining why and how rather then writing we don't have enough room for that.... I was left with way to many questions when I finished the book and had to buy Cold Fusion MX Web Application Construction Kit (Fifth Edition) to help me.

You could smell the sea and the powder as you read. I was hoping for the same with this book, but it was a struggle just to finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Melodic!","review":"It proves to be very interesting when established band members step out on their own, whether it voluntarily or not. Piecing together the three Rush members collective works you can see their individual interests and talents and how they relate to each other (with their own tools) as a unit. Geddy's CD shows how much melody he can craft. Melody is a sign of maturity and Geddy displays a mature, open and honest writing style. If you like Rush, give it a try. If you don't like Rush (depeding on whether you don't like Geddy's voice) it is different enough that you may like this CD. I was pleasantly suprised and thouroughly enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maximum LEE","review":"As a true and faithful Rush fan, I must once again give congrats to the infamous Lee for his wonderful works. Truely one for the collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Geddy's Home (Home on the Strange)","review":"I must admit that I was nervous when I first put this CD in the player. Would it be so RUSH like, that I'd be bored (don't get me wrong...I love RUSH - but RUSH is RUSH and not Geddy, Alex, or Neil alone) or would it be so different that I'd be wondering if Geddy had lost it.Well, it was neither....it was fantastic. There's a hint of RUSH - there would have to be - his sound is part of RUSH's sound but this is no RUSH album. Geddy's been allowed to adventure out into areas which RUSH hasn't touched.For those who liked the RUSH of the 80s and early 90s, you'll find this album harkens back to those days. For those who are not RUSH fans, buy this album anyways....it's awesome"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Solo Album","review":"This album has a great sound to it, similar to modern Rush but different enough to distinguish Geddy as a great solo artist. Geddy's voice is unmistakeable and the album flows nicely throughout. If you like Rush, I think you'll like this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy This Album","review":"If you consider yourself a fan of Pearl Jam, Rush, Soundgarden whatever...you gotta give this a spin or 1,000. Just for the experience of listening to songs like My Favorite Headache, Still, Moving To Bohemia, and The Present Tense.Geddy should find time to work with all kinds of artists and do a solo album every other year. I would love to build up a collection of his solo stuff outside of Rush. Bring in a female artist or 2 next time to work with.The only downfall on this disc is a song called The Angels Share. My Lord does it blow. Other than that? 4 Stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is why neil writes the lyrics","review":"stick to singing and the bass, please. canadian humor in the lyrics of songs makes for piss-poor entertainment, aay. Now I know why geddy and alex write the music and leave the lyrics up to neil. both mfh and victor are weak in the lyrical department. This album is basically a rush fan ripoff peice and should be selling in the cheap bin or in the next bmg catalog for shipping in handling costs only($2.75) within a month. Don't get me wrong, I love geddy and alex, but like they say, united we stand, solo we suck. next thing you know neil will be writing novels, oh yeh, he already did that. too late. one positive note: check out [the website]. It is pretty cool. Next time though, please don't leave out the lyric book in the cd. Were you trying to save money or hide your weaknesses, geddy?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad I can't give this -1 stars","review":"I love Rush. I started liking Rush back in '81. Geddy Lee is an awesome bass player. But this album just stinks. I bought it, hoping for something fresh, but it felt like recycled new Rush (not a good thing) I went so far as to sell the CD at a used CD place and nuke the MP3s from my drive. I really really wanted to like it. But there were no redeeming qualities."},{"rating":"1","title":"A HUGE LET DOWN","review":"I thought this would be the \\"ROCK BASS ALBUM OF THE CENTURY\\" instead it was just another bassist who strayed away from the instrument and instead tried to be well accomplished \\"everything\\".I just wish he would've made it a more bass oriented album----that's what I was looking for. I EVEN PUT DOWN JACK BRUCE'S NEW CD FOR THIS ONE, BOY WAS THAT A HUGE MISTAKE!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best albums of 2000!","review":"I bought it the day it came out, Listened to it, Dismissed it.

To my astonishment, Geddy Lee Beat everybody to the punch. He never seizes to amaze me, with his inspiring vocals and hypnotic bass lines pearcing through my speakers, I fell in love with this record. Thank you Geddy for this amazing work of art."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is a cool, mindbending album that is awesome","review":"from the strange cover and album art to the unrestrained hard riffing alternating with delicate melody, this album is terrific and really showcases Geddy's talent. I hope he puts out more albums; unlike Lifeson, Geddy does a careful job in crafting a cd that is really good. I highly enjoy this album and recommend it to anyone. I truly enjoy all of the songs; this isn't just Rush rehash, it is music that has a mind of its own. Rush is getting much more unpridictable, and I like it. check this out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Geddy without his Counterparts","review":"This is a great recording , the music is in the 90's Rush style, but a little more accesible, the strings arrangments give a great dimenssion to many tracks, the bass and the Ged's voice is as always great. All compositions are excellents, Geddy is in fine form. It is a must for all Rush fans, dont worry, this CD is totally different from Alex's \\"Victor\\" disaster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Geddy Lee","review":"This is a wonderful album by Geddy Lee. True genuis in his writing ability and musical talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"The sum of the whole. . .","review":"This is a great album, no doubts. Geddy Lee is a brilliant musician, a fantastic songwriter, and his lyrical ability is definately above the par on the music world today. I must say, though, that this album shows to us RUSH maniacs just where the greatness lies. Rush's genius lies in three fantastic artist working together to make something that is far more impressive than anything that the three could do on their own. I love this album, but am chomping at the bit for the three to get together and make some musical mastery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Album in the history of the world","review":"OK, maybe I'm exagerating, but any true fan of rush, and any bass players would love this album. its a nice treat to get in between Rush recordings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad, so very sad","review":"Long time fan. Very eager listener of the boys of Rush. So you'd think that I'd be head over heals for anything from anybody from Rush, but this solo project of Geddy's is very disappointing. The whole album is flat. The lyrics are trite. It seems as though Geddy didn't even try at all at his vocals. This whole album drags. I would not spend the money on this album until you see it in the bargain bin. Only then buy it so it can sit on your self to the day it hopefully soon goes out for print so it can be sold for a few extra bucks as a collectors item to some mindless, blind and over exuberant fan. It seems to me that Geddy was counting on just such a fan to buy this slop. Just riding on the past successes and coattails of the group laborings of Rush."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for the next Rush album","review":"It is apparent by listening to this album that Geddy Lee is probably the most significant compositional voice in Rush, a band whose music has never sustained itself on songwriting alone. Part of Rush's appeal is the flashy, yet tasteful playing that's integrated into their compositions. Geddy Lee on his own just sounds like Rush without Alex and Neil - i.e.- without balls. And now one can see why Geddy does not write Rush's lyrics (which ain't always the greatest in the first place). Nice title track, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is the deal with the hokey packaging?","review":"I am big Rush fan, among other prog bands, and really want to get this CD. However, I won't buy a CD not packaged in a jewel box. The record companies can stuff it up their you know whats if they are going to sell me something that looks like a used newspaper after a year. I have CDs that are heavily played, and still look like new after 16 years! Anyone know if MFH is available outside the US and Canada in normal packaging, like other albums I have seen?My rating is based on the LP-like packaging. Definitely not the music, since I haven't heard it yet!Judging by the reviews, it looks pretty killer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what I hoped for","review":"Most of the positive reviews sum up my thoughts on this CD. But I have to admit, I love it when a CD exceeds my expectations, and this one does just that.I have been a Rush fan since \\"Hemispheres\\" came out way back when, and on the first listen this CD gave me the same great feeling that every Rush album has through the years. I didn't expect that, and it turned out to be a very pleasant surprise.I highly recommend this CD not only to Rush fans, but to people who are tired of today's boring dirge and long to hear some genuine talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"loved this cd so much I wore out the first one.","review":"I almost wish Geddy Lee would have followed up with two or three more solo projects. This cd is a must have for any true R U S H fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slipping","review":"Get this album just to hear \\"Slipping\\" Geddy sounds vulnerable. Ben Mink is a great musical partner.The missing Rush album after Vapour Trails."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lost RUSH Album","review":"This would've been a Rush record if Neil's wife hadn't died. We almost lost Rush forever when that happened. Yes, the real tragedy is the loss of Neil's loving wife, however it's also a loss for us bc you can hear how this would've made another fantastic addition to their already exemplary catalog. If you love Rush, you'll absolutely hear them in this album. But make no mistake, the playing of Alex & Neil are sorely missed here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Southern Soul Lite","review":"On the surface, this debut album by Ricky Fante is a breath of fresh air in an era of synthesized sampled soul, but upon several listens, there's nothing that digs deep enough to be memorable. All the poses are there -- the raspy voice, the Memphis-sounding horns, the call-and response background vocals, but imitation is not necessarily the foundation of a lasting career. Otis Redding, Wilson Pickett, and Al Green, all of whom are echoed here, are originals and innovators, and had better written songs to work with. I suspect this album will become a crossover staple and Grammy favorite -- it is very easy to digest. But there's really nothing to stir the soul and rock the foundation of the listener. I prefer more spirit and danger in my soul music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible- Buy it now if you haven't already!","review":"I had no clue who Ricky Fante was until I heard him on NPR, and now I pledge to buy everything he releases. This album is incredible, and if he isn't nominated for a grammy...... well, then, the grammy voters are sniffing something reminiscent of glue.Do yourself a favor and buy this album. I hesitate to call it an album, though, really. It's more of an experience in soul music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stellar R&B","review":"Ricky Fante puts more soul into a single note than all the other neo-R&Bers combined will manage in their entire lives. Rewind is simply the best R&B release in at least 25 years.I have seen comparisons of Ricky Fante to Otis Redding, Wilson Pickett, and the other great soul artists of the past; these compliments are understandable, but Ricky is an original with a unique sound who pays tribute to the sound of old school Stax/Volt artists without sacrificing a thing.If you can listen to Rewind without wanting to buy it, call the funeral home...your brain hasn't figured out yet that you've expired."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Southern Soul Music","review":"I discovered this CD while browsing and I must admit I never heard of Ricky Fante' until now, he reminds me of the soul of Sam Cook mixed with the grit of Otis Redding. It's like the mid to late 60's music with an urban twist of Neo soul, I'll pen the term of Neo Philly Blues. If you listen to this with a three finger shot of scotch you'll agree, I say way to go Mr. Fante', you brought good listening music back with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"very lite&Just aight","review":"Ricky Fante has some decent range but is at best a Modern era version of Dobie Gray.He is vocally right to do a Cover of \\"Drift Away\\" but that would give Him away far to soon.alot of Hype but not much depth here. not bad vocally but nothing to get excited just yet.time will tell."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm Trying","review":"This man is adorable. With one sound of his raspy flavor and one glance at his cute face, I felt like I could not dare miss out. I went out of my way to get this cd only having heard \\"It Ain't Easy\\" which I love. I love it so much it's the only song I bother to play. Maybe with so many other greats like Jill, Van and Anthony I'm not giving Ricky a chance, but there's nothing that stands out on this cd. It borders on pretty damn boring, actually. I want so badly to like this cd because I am a sucker for young artists taking me back to the old flavor, but this is something I was not ready for. It's difficult to describe with words BUT I give this man serious props for staying true to his style and bringing us his music...it's just not for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Low Ratings for this Album from Deaf People?","review":"I don't get it. People rating this album with 2 stars are either deaf or have absolutely no appreciation for great music.Anyone even remotely interested in soul, or classic R&B; are going to instantly fall in love with this collection of well written and produced odes to the greats of yesteryear.Ricky Fante's vocals are better than anyone I've heard in years. He's just shy of Terrance Trent D'Arby (one of the most underrated vocalists of the past 20 years) in pure vocal gymnastics. He doesn't have the higher vocal range of D'Arby, but his voice is at least as soulfull, if not more so.My Favorite tracks are It Ain't Easy, Why, and If It's Love, but there is truly not a bad song on this CD.Do yourself a favor, stop reading this review and order the CD!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ricky Fanté, \\"Rewind\\"","review":"Everything appears to be okay coming in. You have Ricky Fanté, a guy who can carry a tune over some throwback old soul record tracks. You have the lovely percussion and horn arrangements as well as some Motown-esque background singers. But something feels very wrong here. There isn't much substance. The lyrics themselves are as clichéd as they come (especially in 'I Let You Go': \\"I'm down on my knees/Begging you baaaaaby...\\") while Fanté's gritty voice sounds more annoying than nostalagic. Of course artists like D'Angelo, Bilal, Musiq and Donnie take a cue from soul legends like Stevie, Hathaway, and Otis Redding but without much above the surface, Fanté comes off as more of an imitator than a successor to a soul legend. If you're craving for real old-school-sounding soul in today's world of boring R&B, check out something like Al Green's recent album, \\"I Can't Stop\\", and accept no substitutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I heard this guy on NPR and knew this was an album I would enjoy.

Amateur investors are constantly screwing up their portfolios by routinely buying high and selling low with every bull and bear market and yet they expect a different result each time. This is one of the very few books out there that can actually make you a superior investor by simply educating you to the numerous behavioral blunders that the \\"herd\\" makes time and time again. Volatility creates enormous opportunities for making market beating gains routinely but you must understand and avoid the typical pitfalls of the clueless masses.

He argues against adding to a position when it goes down in price. I have added to positions and this I have found to be very effective. For similar reasons, he argues against dollar cost averaging, which I have also found to be profitable. The reasons both of these strategies can be useful are that they are counter intuitive, so his opposition to these strategies seems out of place with the rest of the book. Also, in both these instances, I find his justification not to be persuasive.The author is clearly a smart guy who writes well. I would have given the book 5 stars if it were not for those 2 issues. I purchased the book on Amazon.com and would recommend that every investor read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caution: Read with care...","review":"Like most markets and investing books you would do well to take them with a grain of salt. That is the case with this book.I appreciate the subject matter and the book came highly recommended to me.As a Chartered Financial Analyst with almost 20 years experience I am having a difficult time finishing this book. The author makes factual assertions without any empirical backup. For instance, he asserts that fundamentally greater wealth does not make a person happier. This is not factual.There is a great deal of current research into happiness and wealth, greater wealth suffers from diminishing returns, but suffice to say that people with double the average income are in aggregate happier than the average American.If this was the only example I would hold my tongue, but it is not.Caution: Read with a grain of salt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Kindle Sample, don't bother reading the rest","review":"Maybe its just oversimplification, but some of the information here is just plain wrong. For example, in one section he states \\"There is speculation (both whispered and in the futures prices) the dollar will eventually weaken...\\" Anyone who had an iota of background in currency futures knows that futures prices are solely a function of the current prices and interest rates in the two countries as there is a risk-free arbitrage opportunity if futures prices responded to sentiment. The riff against efficient markets was also very one-sided and not especially helpful.

It also has the added benefit of protecting the lens and glass from scratches and accidental damage.There have been stories of photographers dropping their lens and the filter acts as a sort of impact absorber, shattering but leaving the lens unharmed. I would much prefer replacing the inexpensive filter, rather than a lens.I've experienced much lower glare and reflections using the Quantaray Pro Digital UV Filter, than other less expensive filters. It also appears extremely well built, low-profile and no internal glare from the edges of the filter glass.

I definetly think that \\"Jane Eyre\\" and \\"Villette\\" are given undue credit, while \\"Shirley\\" is underrated. Though \\"Shirley\\" was a strange choice for a title, because the main character is Caroline. This was a perfect book with just the right amount of romance, tragedy, and happy endings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite Pleasant","review":"After reading this novel, i couldn't understand why it wasnt as highly acclaimed as Jane Eyre, or even Villette....I think that Shirley would be my favorite novel by Charlotte Bronte, her other novels were written just as well as Shirley, but i feel that Shirley treaded on deeper issues than the others. Even though this might not be as popular as Charlotte Bronte's other works, I think that Shirley should be the one that you seek out first."},{"rating":"2","title":"The heroine's experience of nature is wonderfully described.","review":"I liked this book because of the way Charlotte Brontewrites about nature; the heroine's experience ofthe moon and also of nature in general when she takeswalks--she experiences her surroundings,takesher time and really enjoys nature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably not Ms. Bronte's objective....","review":"At the beginning of Shirley, Ms. Bronte addressess the reader by telling him/her not to expect a romantic tale. After the first couple of chapters, which give a general idea of the community, Bronte focuses on the two main love interests. She addresses serious concerns about the Luddite Riots and flaws in religious organization, but I see the novel as ultimately, a romance. Less Cinderella-esque than Jane Eyre, but still about self-denial and facing reality. The book has two heroines- Shirley is not introduced until almost halfway through."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Review","review":"At times it was hard to follow due to the old English in the wording.

Unfortunately, I wanted to read the rollicking good tale that Tolkein buried with plodding details of topography, weather, and history instead. The pacing is so off that several chapters are given to a character that has nothing to do with the plot, while a pivotal scene involving Galdalf is told as a puny, bland page or two flashback. Luckily, the movie excavated the story and showed us what this book could have been if Tolkein was as skilled at storytelling as he was at world inventing."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is the best, all i can say is WOW!","review":"This book,in my opinion, is the very definition of a great fantasy novel. This book is so masterfully written. The story was original and had the feeling of a true epic adventure. J.R.R. Tolkien writes in a way that makes u love the charectors and the surroundings in this book. I have read this book numerous times and have recomended it to many people. The only problem I found with this book was that it ended to quickly. Overall I dont think I will ever find a series of books as good as The Lord Of The Rings. This book is truly a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"The beginning of the great adventure","review":"Get this classic book. Our charachters begin thier great adventure.

This is part of the poem on Sauron's ring. This book is my favorite out of the trilogy. Enjoy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lives up to it's reputation","review":"On a whim I bought the LoTR trilogy. I'm glad I did. The Fellowship of the Ring was exciting, detailed and creative. Although the plot is a little slow going at first action picks up once the Fellowship organizes. The characters are very realistic, all with flaws we can relate to but unlike ours this world is filled with Hobbits, Balrogs and Elves. My only complaint is that some of the language used it a bit old fashioned so it makes for more of a \\"slow and steady\\" read."},{"rating":"2","title":"big fan","review":"It would be incorrect to simply place this novel in the category of fantasy/action. Here, Tolkien attempts to create the first, truly English piece of mythology, and he succeeds brilliantly with unmatchable skills in world-building. Many find the first 100-200 pages slow and tedious, yet these pages testify to Tolkien's relentless imagination and the wholeness of his world. This is a piece of true literature, and should not be read with impatience and sloppiness."},{"rating":"2","title":"great reader, addictive story","review":"Unfortunately, I have not read the books and don't have time to. I have just recently started listening to audio books on my long commute. This unabridged version has to be the next best thing to actually reading it. The reader has a good range in his voice to distinguish different characters and it never sounds dry or dull. The story really draws you in and seems so real that you want more. I wanted to listen to this before I see the movie, which I'm going to do this weekend because I'm almost finished. There is no doubt that I will be buying the next audio book next week so I can continue the story. This is very entertaining all the way through the 20 hours of listening and I recommend it without reservation."},{"rating":"2","title":"You either love it or hate it...","review":"I cannot possible ask anyone to read any book more then the Lord of the Rings trilogy and the Hobbit. No other books have entertained me as much and got my imagination going. The great storyline, the talented poems and songs, and all the rest.The only problem is you either find it exciting or you grow bored quickly. I have seen both sides, argued my points, and found it a moot discussion. if you can get through Book I you're going to love the rest!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The original and, still, the best","review":"I'm an avid reader, though not a fantasy/sci-fi fan under normal circumstances and I've read many of the more well-known works, many of which I enjoyed thoroughly. The Lord of the Rings, of all the books I've read, is my unquestionable favorite. No other book is so rich and detailed with the history and peoples of its world and no other book tells a tale of such magnitude and beauty. So many people today have such short attention spans and require such consistant melodrama that it's no wonder the beauty and detail of Tolkein's masterpiece ends up wasted. I've read The Lord of the Rings many times and know the story and its conclusion well but I don't read them for the story anymore, I read them to return to Middle Earth.For anyone who has yet to read these books, I envy you."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best fantasy series, if not the best books, period","review":"Nobody has surpassed Lord of the Rings. Read it and you'll see.Tolkien spent decades creating the backdrop for the story, a tale that literally fills volumes and is also well worth reading (Silmarillion, Unfinished Tales I & II, Lost Tales (all volumes)). SF/fantasy writers today could learn something from this astounding amount of preparation. A true masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"You wouldn't be able to pay me enough to read this book again..","review":"I love fantasy and I love long books that are continued in a series. That being said... I read all of the books in The Lord of the Rings. The first few pages were okay.. but I quickly grew to realize that while there were some interesting concepts put into play for this book and the others in the trilogy.. however, it was far too long.I read this right before the movies came out thinking that I'd be wowed.. The movies were fantastic.. but I really wish I hadn't forced myself to read the trilogy. It was an unnecessary evil."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book.Not the best out of the three.But still great","review":"The Fellowship of the Ring is Great.But not the best of the three.I'm half-way through The Two Towers and I can say it is better then the Lord of the Rings.I think what makes it not as good is it's not as action packed as The Two Towers and it has one LONG chapter called The Counil of Elrond.true this chapter gives you all sorts of information.But it's too long and nothing happens.However this book is worthy of it's fame."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pioneering fantasy novel","review":"I just finished re-reading \\"Fellowship\\" and like always, it's a nostalgic journey back in time. This is the first fantasy story I can remember reading, way back in 1973 when I was in fifth grade, and even though I know now the story inside out, I never am tired of this book.For some reason, I find it more magical than books 2 and 3, probably because there is still a sense of innocence and youth about the main characters, and we still do not realize the full horrid power of Sauron. I enjoy the many songs and stories written, the more so because it is seldom done anymore because it would sound phony or contrived by other authors. To be short: This series built the fantsasy genre as we know it today. The majority of authors out there have,conciously or not, put aspects of this tale in their books. That, I believe, is about the greatest testament to the power of this trilogy. It's wonderful"},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING...Doesn't compare to Shannara series","review":"I know everyone says Tolkien started it all...blah blah balh...Everyone else is a rip off...blah blah blah.But I read Hobbit, then I forced myself to finish Fellowship, then got half way through the next book and gave up.I've got one word for this book...BORING! Too many songs...I found myself sifting through chapter when Tolkien decides he is going to spend 50 pages on a meal or a night of talking.I read these books following my reading of the Shannara series (Sword, Elfstones, Wishsong) and there is no comparison. Terry Brook's novels are sooo much more exciting and compelling with the perfect amount of character development and scene descriptions. I don't 6 pages of a scene description like TOlkien does. The Hobbit seems like a Childs book to me, since there really isn't much of a evil force. Fellowship just bored the living hell out of me.

Pointless","review":"The best review I ever read of this book was by one of Tolkien's own circle of friends. After hearing Tolkien read aloud yet another chapter of the Ring trilogy, the visitor exclaimed \\"Not another (...) elf!!??\\". Tolkien's work is so dense and slow moving you wonder if it is an adventure or a still photograph. He has no concept of moving the narrative ahead. His dialogue is wooden. The Hobbits sound like robots. His poetry is leaden. What is the point of this book? I can't figure out why people praise it so! And why is it that whenever anyone does a take on a mythically powerful ring, they need such absurdly great lengths to do it (hello Richard Wagner). I am utterly puzzled by the enthusiasm this book stirs up in people. To me, it is mindless, poorly written, and an utter bore."},{"rating":"1","title":"most boring est book ever","review":"chuck it away burn it most boring est book ever go buy yourself a decent book like George RR Martins Song Ice And Fire the its better than LOTR this crap"},{"rating":"1","title":"not very good","review":"This book is quite boring and goes off on long tangents that have nothing to do with the plot of the whole story. It is like Tolkien started this set without any outline or idea where it was going. The next two books far surpass this one. It was a struggle for me to get through this book. Just because everyone is in love with Tolkien does not make this book good. I know he did not have the format modern writers do for their series but that still does not make this book good. I think that most raters overlook how poor this book is because of who wrote it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid Encylopedia","review":"O my god i hate thhis book.now, i like the concept of this story and the plot is excellent. elements of fantasy are included wonderfully in this book, but it should have stayed an idea, or have been given to someone else to write.tolkien makes reading tedious and boring and almost make you bag reading it except that you want to see when the good part comes, but right before it happens, the book is over and you have to wait to read another few hundred pages in the two towers. reading this book is like reading an encyclopedia with frequent reference to generations past and ancient kings who you will have no idea about unless you master the appendixes of the third book. it almost seems hopless to fully understand the plot and almost seems like a college course to master and study for instead of an enjoyable and enchanting fantasy. probalby good for older readers, but for me, 14 years, ill just take a fast paced brook's novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible!","review":"This book is a fanstastic example of fantasy literature. I couldn't put it down except when Tom Bombadil showed up(if you read it you would understand) the charectars are true to their charectars and the setting is greater than any I've seen. You must read the series and then the \\"Silmarrilion\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the Hobbit, Richer than the Movie","review":"It took seeing the wonderful movie version to finally make me read this book and for that I am grateful. I had read the Hobbit and enjoyed it but never finally felt compelled to pick up J.R.R. Tolkien's The Fellowship of the Ring. The characters of Frodo, Sam, Aragorn and Gandalf are more complex than I expected and I loved the slow build up as both dread and unbearable tension are increased with every step on their long journey. The novel has a quicker pace after the Council of Elrond and the previously established atmosphere is put to good use and delivers on all its promises. How I missed this book during my nerdy teenage years will always remain a mystery. I am only thankful I have opened myself up to them now in my tender middle years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing, but with its flaws...","review":"I think that Tolkien did an absolutly astounding job in creating middle Earth, and i think that the Hobbit and LotR is a classic. But as with all books, this one did have its flaws. First of all, there were no people of color (african americans), nut this can be forgived because there may be none in Middle Earth (Hmm..?). Second, there were fery few women roles in the trilogy (Arwen, Galidriel, the stewards daughtor, and a few elves). Overall, there were few flaws, and those were crushed by the woner of Tolkiens imaginative world"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great story idea but a boring book","review":"I'm glad I sorted the reviews lowest first because I saw I wasn't the only one who did not enjoy this book. I tried reading it three times, the first two I gave up. Finally while on vacation I finished the book only to be disappointed. The story was way too long and had entire chapters that contributed nothing to the plot. I don't think I can bring myself to read the other two books, instead I'll watch the movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This book was boring and hard to understand.

The only reason it became popular was because of the movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"mediocre fantasy","review":"Despite the fact Tolkien has inspired hundreds of great fantasy authors, these books are boring. They detail way too much environment, the characters are stale and the action is warm at best. What more could you ask for to completely avoid a book?I listened to the audiobook and while I realize Inglis is a sub-par reader when it came to many of the characters, the book just isn't engaging. I don't think the tone of voice would've fixed it all that much (but it would've vastly improved the action scenes and tougher characters)"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Perfect Cure for Insomnia","review":"Never before have I encountered a wordier or more boring author than Tolkein.

Now, I have absolutely no desire to see the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Getting Started","review":"J.R.R. Tolkien's first novel of the Lord of the Ring series begins out slowly, but it is well worth the slow begining to come full circle into the adventure. If one is reading this for sear pleasure it blossoms into full fantasy of adventure. A wonderful book all around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do the next two get better than this?","review":"After years and years of hearing how Tolkien's LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy is the best fantasy ever written, I finally made it through the first book (after several earlier attempts). I hate to rain on everyone's parade, but FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING is a snoozer. The book could have at least a hundred pages cut from it simply by eliminating the endless descriptions of nature that the band is travelling through. Another thing that I found annoying was the portrayal of elves - why are they always relegated to living in magical forests, where they possess great wisdom and power, but never use it? Just to say I've read them, I will probably force myself to read the next two volumes. On it's own, however, the first book is a real disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"I really liked The Fellowship of the Ring a lot. It is full of beauty,mystery,and terror. I really liked hobbits and elves a lot too. There is so many great characters that it is difficult to choose a favorite one,but I would probaly say I liked the hobbits,the elves,Gandalf,and Aragorn the best.Merry and Pippen are the most engaging hobbits but Frodo is the bravest and most serious. He would have to be my favorite character.Tolkien uses great imagination and description. There is not one dull chapter.Some chapters,like the ones in Lorien are very lovely while others,like in Moria and the barrow downs are terrifying.This is defiantly a great story and I recommend it along with The Hobbit and the other two in the trilogy."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Most Boring Fantasy Book I Have Ever Read","review":"I personally do not understand why everybody rate this book so highly. After reading the numerous excellent reviews for this book, I grabbed I copy of it and started reading it. I couldn't finish reading it halfway through. It was just too boring! All Frondo and co. did was to run away from Dark Riders, travel through bogs and marshes, sing songs and rhymes, look for Grandaf, etc. Boring...zzz. Hell, the only time when they actually fought with the forces of evil was when they were caught by some underground monster! Blah! I have better things to do that keep on falling asleep with this book. Do not buy or read it or you'll regret it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"lord of inaccuracies","review":"This book could have been really really good if it had stuck to the movie more. Fist of all it added all that weird stuff in the \\"old forest\\" and that old senior Bubadil was a little strange. I don't think I would like it very much to be lost in a forest with him and ghosts. Also they cut the lovely and heroic ARWEN out of all the excitement. ALL in all their were to many words and details that bogged everything down(no pun intended). Also, how are we expected to understand elfish.And my wife agreed with me. And I don't think it is just because we are pretty old. My grandchildren also agreed with me and my wife and they are not old."},{"rating":"1","title":"this book is awesome","review":"This is the absolute worst book ever written. I still can't believe they killed off Frodo, the supposed star of the trilogy, within 175 pages. That's just ridiculous. Also, what's the deal with the zombies??? I re-read that section 3 times and I still didn't get it. Did they eat Gandalf or not? I still don't know. If you're looking for a confusing book filled with wordy descriptions of fish and the walking dead, you're in luck. Otherwise, you'd better find a new book. A great boook."},{"rating":"1","title":"Before you read this book...","review":"George R.R.

Who is that Tom bombadil guy and why did they add him? Or those stupid songs? And they ruined the cool intro and never showed Saruman's side of things in the book, making it all one sided. At least it ended where the movie did, but wth is up with Boromir not dead at the end of it? Whoever wrote this should have paid more attention to the script. The characters had FLAWS in it. And doubts. I don't plan to read the others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lookie Pookies Book Review","review":"In the Lord of the Rings the Fellowship of the Ring, there is one ring that everyone is after. This ring is a ring of power that will give the evil lord Sauron ultimate power. It turns out that a hobbit named Bilbo has acquired the ring over time. The ring has a bad effect on Bilbo after years of having it because of the evil power inside it and gives it to his nephew Frodo before he leaves reluctantly. Frodo learns about the evil power of the ring from his good friend Gandalf the wizard and decides to destroy it and THEN.........You will have to read it to find out. Well anyways the book is a little hard to read and very big but it was good and very enjoyable and I had a good time with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Definitely a book to read if you are an advanced reader and likes fantasy. I still like the movie better though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good But Somewhat Boring","review":"This was a great book overall, and I think J.R.R. Tolkien is definitely a genius. Since I haven't read the entire trilogy, I can't judge the three as a whole. There are some chapters that you can't stop reading, and there are some that you just can't wait to be over. It takes perseverance to finish, but well worth it in the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"JORDAN WILL BOW TO THE GLORY OF TOLKIEN","review":"I have to say that I believed Robert Jordan to be the lord of Fantasy. Well I repent for I have seen the light. Tolkien is not only the lord of Fantasy but he is a GOD! I have to say that I have never had this much fun and joy reading a book in all my life. This book is also deep and very rich. The world Tolkien creates is so real and his characters are so intricate that I have to slap myself for ever thinking of Robert Jordan as the King. In Jordan's books you get the same richness of his world but not like Tolkiens. It's weird. It's like Tolkien has some special skill that becomes apart of his words. Oh yeah, and Jordan waits up to 4 years to bring out his next book. While this is insulting to the fans and shows how smug Jordan can be I can't help but appreciate the sincerity of Tolkien. This books is pure Magic!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much mundane detail makes for a boring read","review":"Obviously a creative story, but the movie is 10 times better than the book. This book moves very slow and more than half of the entire book is spent on explaining the mundane details of your surroundings. Everytime the characters in the book move from one place to another, the author has to stop the action and spend the next 3 or 4 pages telling you how many branches are on each tree and which types of leaves are on each branch. The other half of the book is filled with these long and grueling elf chants. This book lacks any real action and I wasn't able to read it for more than 15 minutes at a time without being bored to tears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Got abridged version in mail","review":"I was led to believe the CD was unabridged by reviews, even though the product description is not very clear. I also was hoping for a single reader, as opposed to full cast (just a personal preference). Once again reviews reassured me there. I ordered it and got a 3.5 hour fully casted telling of the story. I listened for about 2 minutes before I realized it wasn't an unabridged reading, checked the back of the box, and sure enough it said it was abridged.I hate giving a 1 star, because I know the book, and it should be a 5 star. It seems there's a mistake where multiple products are sharing the same review base though.If you're new to lord of the rings and aren't sure if it's worth experiencing, it most definitely is, but that seems like a given with it's popularity. Be wary of ordering the CD from this page though, because it may be the abridged version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Idea- But Way Too Detailed","review":"I began to read this book thinking that with all the praise I had heard it received it would be great, filled with action and adventure. However, the book is so detailed that it gets boring very fast. The extensive descriptions of the places that are being traveled through become work to read. The 360 something pages (I think) of this book could easily be condensed to a little over 250. Great plot and interesting at times but it ends up boring and tedious to read with all the details."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice plot, nice worldbuilding, lousy book.","review":"Now, I will start by saying that J.R.R. Tolkien is incredible, and Middle Earth is truly a masterpiece. However, he may have been better off just building the world and letting someone else ghost-write the actual books.The problem is that there isn't a single aspect of Middle Earth that he *doesn't* mention in this book. Since there's no way to just sort of work the details in, there are large amounts of *explaining* by the narrator. Consequently, the book looks more like a documentary than a novel. Tolkien would have been better off leaving out details, if there was no good way to include them without having to actually spend a full chapter describing the Shire.So, if you can put up with the *extraordinarily* slow pace, you may enjoy this book. I would say, though, that this is one of those extremely rare cases where the movie is better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book for anyone","review":"I am 16 years-old and NOT a big fan of reading but this book sparked my intrest.

It got really hard to read when they were constantly on the road and describing every single bird that flew by, but by the end it was all worth it. I think you need to read the whole set to appreciate the story. After you read it all, it will hit you and what came to me was, \\"Everyone should have a faithful friend through even the darkest evil, just like Sam.\\" These books bring to light just what real friendship and brotherhood are.

I have read 8 of J.R.R. Tolkien's books and I can't say anything else but praise this person's work. My favourite books are The Lord of the Rings and the Silmarillion. But LOTR has taken the first place of my heart. The amazing Lord of the Rings is my personal beloved book. I like it more than any other book of the trilogy, especially the chapter: The Bridge of Kazad-Dum, the climax of the book. The Lord of the Rings isn't just a book. It is a masterpiece, something historic. Tolkien is the Homer of the 20th Century and his \\"Odyssey\\" is the Lord of the Rings. I highly recommend this book to every single person and it is sure that anyone who completes it will love fantasy and will search other works of the same writer too."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Amazing book","review":"The Fellowship of the Ring is one of the best books I have ever read.

You might want to read the Hobbit before you read this book so u do not get lost at times in the story and characters. The story is about Frodo Bagginses(Bilbo's nephew)and three other hobbits Sam, Pippin, and Merry. Throughout the story a wizard named Gandalf will accompany Frodo and his companions. As you go farther through the story there will be new characters and it will get much more exciting.

Having seen the movie before I read the book, I had a vague idea of what should happen next, so I was able to finish the book pretty much satisfied.

If you didn't like Part One, don't waste any more precious time on Part Two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, let me see...","review":"Let me see the flaws in this so-called \\"masterpiece\\", that I should call THE LORD OF BOREDOM:1) WHy the hell all the characters must have at least two different names (in different languages)?2) The \\"songs\\" are a joke, boring, it only serves to destroy the narrative;3) endless repetitive descriptions of characters and environment, such as sunset, sunrise, \\"the air was heavy and hot\\", \\"the hobbits were tired and hungry\\", \\"the fields were green\\", \\"the sky was foggy\\", ... Uau, it's utterly boring!!!4) Heavy narrative. Tolkien should have handled his ideas for someone else to write. He's totally conservative, and you just can't sense the real urgency in the plot, as modern fantasy writers can do.5) Empty characters. The characters are lame and their dialogues worst still.6) Terribly drawn maps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond comparison","review":"One of the few works actually worthy of the hyperbole (e.g., the greatest work of 20th Century fiction). I can no more than add another two cents' worth: profound imagery and depth of story that affected me deeply and enduringly. When I trekked in Nepal, the main comparison that came to mind was of The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings: the Inn at Bree, and \\"the road goes ever on,\\" etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a classic of fantasy.","review":"It's good book to start your acquaintance with world of fantasy. It's a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why didn't I read this earlier?","review":"I'd been a fantasy binge as of late and decided to pick up the first installment of the Lord of the Rings trilogy since the movie is due out soon. Why did I wait so long to read this? Actually I can remember starting this book at an earlier time but I got bogged down in the detail. This time through the detail didn't stop me and I screamed through it. Tolkien has woven together a very intricate adventure with characters that are both likable and believable(in the sense that they have flaws as well as attributes) in land that you can easily visualize. When I was finished I ran out right away and purchased the second installment and hope to start it shortly. I would recommend this book to anyone....even if you aren't a fantasy fan, because you soon will be. The only reason I didn't give the book five stars is the fact that there were a few sections where the action seemed to slow down, but theses sectoins were short and easy to read through."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to love this but.......","review":"As a self-professed nerd I wanted tot love this. I read The Hobbitt about 20 years ago and remember really rnjoying it. I expected more of the same here as I finally got around to Lord Of The Rings. What I got however was sadly a little boring, very tedious, and wordy to the point of confusion. Tolkien certainly has created one of the most amazingly thorough fantasy world. However, his writing style is so verbose that by the time he explains whose talking to whom you can't remeber what's being talked about. The actual novel could've been a quarter of the size and probably more enjoyable. I haven't given up on the entrire series but it'll be awhile before I feel the itch to read Two Towers. :("},{"rating":"2","title":"Hang in there","review":"If you are struggling throught this book, my advise to you is to keep reading. The rest of this series is absolutely superb (especially The Two Towers). Though I must admit that this is J.R.R. Tolkien's worst book about Middle Earth, it's still pretty good and is well written. The only thing that I really dislike about Tolkien's world is the elves. They strike me as silly and unmotivated, and even though they have infinite wisdom and strength they send in a bunch of untrained hobbits to do the dirty work of getting rid of the ring. Luckily there are some brave and honorable characters like Frodo, Aragorn, Gandalf, and Sam, who are willing to save Middle Earth, no matter what might happen to themselves. I would definitely reccomend this book to any fantasy fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sheer genius -- completely supported throughout","review":"I will not belabor the obvious with praises of Tolkien's works. I've read the whole trilogy (and \\"The Hobbit,\\" of course) over 30 times and love them all more with each reading.

Reading the first page of the book got me hooked completely! Lord of the rings is much 'better' than 'Harry Potter' J.K. Rowling better watch out! Even though Mr. Tolkien is dead, he is, to me,Mr. Tolkein is the greatest author of Fantasy/Sci-fiction novels of all time!!!! My father has read the movie and he loved it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I am reading Two Towers now and I have already seen the movie! The movie was a job well-done and I can't wait to see Two Towers in theaters this December. Mr. Tolkein's son, Christopher Tolkein also I must applaud him on the most wonderful book ever, Silmarillion!!!!!! I can't wait to read It! I own the trilogy myself and I tell you, Tolkein's work is truely a treasure to keep!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A journey worth taking","review":"This book was amazing...one of those \\"can't put it down\\" kinda books. I definitly recommend it to people who need an escape from they're every day life. Tolkien will take you through an adventure that you will become hooked to. After seeing the movie, I definitley thought that the book could not be better. Once again, the theory of \\"the book is always better than the movie\\" is proven true."},{"rating":"2","title":"The grates book in the world!!!!!!","review":"The greatest book I ever have read!!! I couldn't stop reading!!! Tolkien was a storyteller of genius!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of the Lord of the Rings Trilogy","review":"The Lord of the Rings/ The Hobbit are one of the best series of books ever written. What is so vast about Tolkien is that he creates a world and a culture like nobody else. He created languages, mythology, huge maps, etc.., culture, and in this world which is as believable as ours, a huge war is on the verge is breaking out. Many will complain that it is boring or pays too much attention to details, but do not listen...Warning: if you get stuck on the chapter \\"The Council of Elrond\\", know that after that chapter it gets very interesting, and you can skip a few pages if you like. Also, the movie-lovers will proclaim that this is not anywhere as good as the movie. Some will tell you that the book does an injustice to the movie. But do not listen to them. The movies were good, but the books are just as good, if not better.Try THe Lord of the Rings....most likely you will be glad you read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The classic fantasy-book","review":"Frodo Baggins has to save the world from the evil Sauron, with the help of his trustworthy friends, the wizard Gandalf the Gray, and the mysterious Aragorn. Against him stands the monsters known as Orcs, under the lead of the feared Nazl. The plot is good, but simple and predictable. The characters are mostly good, but sometimes they do things totally without reason. It's a little bit plain, and would have been better if there were at least one person who wasn't white, black or absolutely gray (yes, that's possible). My main complaint however is that there are no women! They simply don't exist in the book, one of the biggest signs of tFotR's writing-date. And while this book is good, it's not as great as many will have it, though it's a nice read, not the least since it's one of the first real fantasy books. I'd recomend you to buy it, but don't expect too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want to say this was a great book... but it wasn't","review":"I have never seen the movie and I only started to read this book after the movie came out. Actually, I was forced by my English teacher. I thought, since the book was good enough to have a movie after it, it probably wouldn't be such a bad book.Well, I started to read the prolouge. Bad idea. My biggest advice is, DO NOT READ THE PROLOUGE!!! It took me days to get through the ten pages of it. This part is so confusing and worthless information that you really don't need to make sense of the book. Anyways, the rest of the book was very slow. If you want a quick read, this book is not for you. The details go on and on and there really is no action what so ever.However, this book wasn't all bad. I got through it, but I could only read about ten pages at a time or i would lose intrest. At the end it is a nice story but I don't know if the pain reading it amounted to the pleasure of finishing it afterwards."},{"rating":"2","title":"An epic beginning!","review":"I'm not a die-hard fantasy fan but I truly enjoyed Fellowship of the Ring (and am currently working on The Two Towers). It is a delightful combination of poetry, lovable characters, beautiful descriptive writing, and adventure. Tolkien is an incredible wordsmith and paints beautiful (or terrifying) pictures of scenery, from the clouds in the sky to the grass on the ground. The reader can see the forests, the mountains, the rivers, even the clothing worn by the characters. The characters in this story are diverse and fascinating, coming from different races, speaking different languages, but all having a common purpose and a profound friendship. Frodo, a hobbit, the humblest of all creatures, is chosen to embark on a perilous journey to destroy the One Ring, the greatest instrument of evil known to Middle Earth. Together with eight other companions, they begin the first leg of their heroic journey to Mount Doom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just a boy's tale","review":"People have pondered about wether or not the The lord of the rings is a young boy's (and girl's) tale or an outstanding and fanciful piece of literature in which a man is so sure of his ability he tells the story as if if the world that it takes place in is real. The question has lasted for twenty years and since the world is standard of good literature or simply fun with words then I will contribute my opinion.You are most likely familiar with the Harry Potter series, and it is the perfect example of a child's tale. J.R.R. Tolkien studied the language of our past and used it to write his story, and as you know their form of language, the early english written tradition, has proven not to be useless long sentences and foolish puns,(hint:Shakespeare),the context is so full of language and wit it would be an insult to call it a child's tale. Also out of the many books I have read, none have portrayed the imagination into an adventure like he has..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Fellowship of the Ring","review":"The Fellowship of the Ring is a great book. The author is J.R.R. Tolkien. His writing style is very unique. This book is the first in a trilogy of three.The book is about a young hobbit named Froto Baggins. He has inherited a ring from his uncle Bilbo Baggins. Little does Froto know what perils this ring will bring him. So he is set out to destroy the ring before it is too late. Froto sets out with nine others to bring evil to an end once and for all. If the ring is not destroyed they all will be destroyed.This would be a book well worth your while to read. If you have read The Hobbit which is the prelued to The Lord of the Rings series then you will like this book and all the others in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"An awesome book","review":"I think this is a great book. There are so many different interesting characters. I also like fantasy. It was a hard book to read, so I listened to it on tape. The details were really fascinating.

It really gives in-depth details and allows you to imagine the setting clearly. There were very exciting and fun parts of this book that keeps your attention. One of my favorite parts is in the beginning with the party, when Frodo gets the ring, and the plot starts to take form.On the down side of this book, the details and descriptions I mentioned can get too long. There was simply a lot of dialogue. If you can manage the downside, this book is for you, it will leave you with memories of a world that you will not forget."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book Is Amazing!","review":"Tolkein is a master story teller.

Tolkien is an exciting and insightful read. The world which Tolkien creates, called Middle Earth, although fanciful is a place which one cherishes. The world created has clear cut lines between good and evil, leaving us whole-heartedly cheering on Frodo and the Fellowship. However, not only does Tolkien's Middle Earth capture us, we also are taken by Frodo's brave journey. He possesses the One Ring, which if surrendered to the enemy could destroy all that is good in Middle Earth. Frodo is faithfully accompanied by his innocent and vulnerable friends Sam, Pippin and Merry. Their helplessness and doomed quest capture the readers' attention and encourage the reader to complete all three parts Tolkien's spectacular trilogy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating","review":"I've read the Lord of the Rings twice, and each time, I have a hard time putting it down.

Like Frank Herbert's Dune was just \\"a bunch of people in the desert doing stuff.\\" Please, we're not infants here. So, with that cleared up this book perfectly sets up the stage for the next two. Please consider that the trilogy is written continuosly, and is in excess of one thousand pages. Therefore, for you to know what they are talking about, they will have to put you through a little boredom. This is a good introduction to the final two in the trilogy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST READ","review":"I have read Lord of the Rings at least 6 times and each time I do I still feel the same emotion I felt the first time, even more.

I have nighmares everytime I see that book in the bookstore. MAKE IT STOOOP!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Moves as slow as cold molasses. Pointless","review":"The best review I ever read of this book was by one of Tolkien's own circle of friends. After hearing Tolkien read aloud yet another chapter of the Ring trilogy, the visitor exclaimed \\"Not another goddam elf!!??\\". Tolkien's work is so dense and slow moving you wonder if it is an adventure or a still photograph. He has no concept of moving the narrative ahead. His dialogue is wooden. The Hobbits sound like robots. His poetry is leaden. What is the point of this book? I can't figure out why people praise it so! And why is it that whenever anyone does a take on a mythically powerful ring, they need such absurdly great lengths to do it (hello Richard Wagner). I am utterly puzzled by the enthusiasm this book stirs up in people. To me, it is a mindless, poorly written, utter bore."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad!","review":"I had to read this book for a school assinment its like 5oo pages long or something and it is SO boring!

So buy the Dragonlance series if you like GREAT fantasy and not this boring old stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"Everyone knows that the Lord of the Rings is a fantastic fantasy epic and a classic work of literature. It shows that genre writing does not have to be hack writing. Clearly if you want to get into the series you have to start with The Fellowship of the Rings. I do not think you can think of yourself as a true fantasy lover unless you have read or tired to read this book.

The stories of Middle-Earth are based on a mixture of post-Roman English stories and Olde Norse myth. However, he combined age-old themes and fascinating peoples in an ingenious story-telling marvel that has never been matched. If you are have never read this book, but love fantasy novels, this could very well become your bible. If you don't, you may find this is a gateway to a whole new literal world. The Lord of the Rings series is simple in themes, with amazing characters and adventures that young and old will treasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge misprint","review":"This Houghton-Mifflin hardcover edition has an inexcusable misprint--buyer beware.

I even started reading it again a few months ago. But it's just too damn detailed. I can't stand it.Remember: NOT ALL CLASSICS ARE GOOD. I can't believe this was rated with 4.5 stars.

The original LP by this title was released by Capitol records in 1976(and re-released in 2002 by BGO as a single CD with another Haggard album-\\"My Love Affair With Trains\\"- as a bonus) and is a fine album. However this compilation album, has the exact same title(leading the unsuspecting buyer into believing that this is a re-release of the '76 LP). I'd suggest that any other Haggard fans avoid such deceptively titled releases and buy only the albums as originally made, or stick to the many, many fine compilations available that don't rely on marketing tactics to sell what should sell itself on merit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it","review":"This version of Sound of Music is worth it just to hear \\"How Can Love Survive\\", \\"No Way to Stop It\\", and \\"An Ordinary Couple\\" with Oscar Hammerstein II's brilliant lyrics.

When you are poor it is toujours l'amour, For l'amour all the poor have leisure!\\" (from \\"How Can Love Survive\\").I am a big fan of the movie (I have seen it at least 30 times, probably more) and I love Julie Andrews' voice, but I do not own the soundtrack - I own this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine alternative to the usual","review":"Some might forget that The Sound of Music existed before the film starring Julie Andrews, among others, was made. This is a recording of the music from the Broadway musical with the original Broadway cast, starring Mary Martin. Perhaps not for everyone, it offer the careful listener a interesting and pleasing alternative of the music of the movie that many have come to love."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the real deal","review":"Julie Andrews was the definitive Eliza Doolittle (and should have played her in the movie version of \\"My Fair Lady\\"), but the role of Maria in \\"The Sound of Music\\" belongs to the Queen of the Broadway Musical, Mary Martin. What a voice! What delivery! The stage version of the *musical aspects* of \\"The Sound of Music\\" simply outshines the Hollywood version, in my opinion. Not only is this because of the stellar performances by Mary Martin and Theodore Bikel, but because for some strange reason, the producers of the movie removed some fine songs (e.g., \\"There's No Way To Stop It\\") and substituted cheesy and unmemorable ones in their place. Why? The movie was a highly entertaining presentation of the *story* of the von Trapp family, but if you want a cd that presents the best version of the *music* from this terrific show, get the Broadway version!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sound of Music-Sweet and Complete","review":"Yes, Mary Martin was a little old for Maria, but she becomes the character in this CD. The remastered version brings out a richer sound, but the original 1959 audio is a little funky (i.e. use of reverb, levels of singers microphones-especially kids) This, however is the original, and the movie version will never come close to the stage production. How can Love Survive?, and No Way to Stop It, showcase Max and Elsa's show-stealing capabilities. Theodore Bikel makes a fine Captain, especially in a very simple version of Edelweiss, not the over-produced version the movie portrayes. In all, a very fine album."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Second Choice of TSOM recording","review":"Many people heard the original soundtrack of the movie starring Julie Andrews. Yes, that version is perfect and good for many people. But if you want to hear the Broadway's \\"The Sound of Music\\", this one is for you. The voice of Mary Martin sound so elder than that of Julie or Rebecca Luker from the revival cast. But Mary Martin's voice has its own charm: warm, and sometimes very powerful. I'd like to recommend this one to the Second Choice of TSOM. The First choice? Of course, the soundtrack! It's better to have both of them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay.","review":"This Recording does not even come close to the original soundtrack, Not that I don't like Mary Martin & Theodore Bikel, but the quality of this CD and of the recording in particular is horrendous, The performers are good, they just didn't do the music justice.

She saw Mary Martin on Broadway in the 50s, and was as enamoured as Richard Rogers and Oscar Hammerstein were. I grew up not with this version of The Sound of Music, as opposed to the 1967 movie (also wonderful). There are songs in this version (How can Love Survive, No Way to Stop It) that are true Rogers and Hammerstein collaborations, incredible lyric, and indelible melody. This is a must for musical theater lovers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this 'Sound of Music'.......","review":"Though, I saw SOUND OF MUSIC on film at an early age, I also heard the original Broadway Cast recording, with Mary Martin and Theodore Bikel, as a young person, too. Mary Martin has a great stage presence and was a wonderful singer, in my opinion, and she is nothing but great in this production of Captain & Maria Von Trapp and their brood of singing children. Yes, the Maria (Martin) and Captain (Bikel) are significantly older than the version we see in the film (with Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer), but they are still very, very good actors and they sing the songs with feeling. There are songs in the original recording that were cut for the film (\\"How Can Love Survive,\\" \\"Laendler,\\" \\"No Way To Stop It,\\" and \\"An Ordinary Couple\\"), and I think they are actually far superior to those that were added to the movie (\\"I Have Confidence,\\" \\"Something Good\\").

Finding another copy and having the chance to re-read the story, I'm struck again by how much it still made me yearn for a simpler acceptance of the good in the world, and made me weep during the sadder parts as I looked back on all of the dark times that have occurred in my own life during the years since I first discovered this beautiful story.Read it!

It contains some good sections on color correction, but falls short of being an essential Photoshop book. It is very expensive, contains uninspired examples and has several minor annoyances such as sections on outdated equipment ...poorly cropped/grainy/unnecessary screenshots and somewhat questionable chapter organization and overlap. I think it is a helpful book, but is not in the same class as something like the \\"Photoshop WOW!\\" series, which is more complete and ultimately more useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"A remarkable tome that should ship with Photoshop","review":"The big question here is, How can a book get so good? It requires something on the scale of the grand alignment of the planets. Haynes and Crumpler have without a doubt mastered Photoshop. They have spent years honing their teaching skills. They are both excellent writers. They have the rare discipline to go the extra step when assembling information. This is the fifth edition of their book, and it is obvious that they listen to their readers. If you thumb through the book, you will be amazed at how densely packed every page is (I've seldom seen such narrow margins). This is not clutter. Each page stands as a miracle of organization. The text and diagrams complement each other to near perfection. This is the book that should come with Photoshop. Adobe should toss their embarrassingly deficient user manual and pack this tome in each box."},{"rating":"2","title":"I certainly recommend this magazine for all those runners or future runners.","review":"Great magazine which helps keep me informed on all the latest running tips, techniques and nutrition recommendations.

I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best running magazine by default","review":"I have subscribed to RW for about 5 years. I am a Marine and I run lots of miles every week and about one race per month. This magazine offers good nutrition and training advice, and it also provides quality shoe reviews each season. The race guide leaves a lot to be desired, but then again, you can only devote so mnay pages to that subject. (The website has a better and more detailed guide.) The primary problem with RW is that it is very repetitive. My most recent issue had a picture of a female runner on the cover doing abdominal work. I scratched my head and pulled out my issues from last year and found a different girl doing the same thing on the cover of the same month in 2002. In any event, this overall is a good periodical for the money and trounces the competition in the running magazine category."},{"rating":"1","title":"Um, no magazine","review":"I'm sure this is a great magazine.

I was supposed to be coming in mid march (so there is a wait to begin with fyi). I gave this review 2 stars because I'm sure it is a good magazine, but the publisher apparently has problems working with Amazon to get it to my house, so they are not scoring to high in my mind.I am nervous too that my once my subscription gets sent out, in November or something, that the year will expire in March because of their mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"delivery could be better","review":"love the magazine but i was disappointed with the delivery initially. i got a two month old magazine for my first delivery. it finally caught up with what was avail in the stores but now I have paid for three magazines that i had already purchased in the store. i guess if you want a magazine you need to buy a subscription and then not buy the ones in the stores for a couple of months to wait for the back delivery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rodale ripped me off","review":"It is not one of my favorite magazines and the only reason I subscribed was because the price was reasonable and Amazon was running a promotion. Well, since Amazon did not meet its end of the bargain, I canceled this subscription 4 days from the order date, or so I thought. As it turns out, this subscription was never canceled because I had to do it directly through the publisher, something Amazon never told me.

First, when I ordered the magazine online through Rodale's website, they offer me a free journal, which they send me. No problem. Before they send me the journal, however, I received a package with a training log that I don't remember ordering! This company needs to examine their misleading practices, otherwise they will lose a lot of subscribers, myself included. Also, I find the magazine overloaded with information for beginners, which is okay, but they focus too much on it. They should include articles about pregnancy and running, vegan runners, running and age, running and kids, nutrition, competitions, etc etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Magazine","review":"I love this magazine, I've been a reader for years.

And, unlike most fitness-related magazines that I read, it doesn't provide annoying beauty tips for women. It's about the sport. My only criticisms are 1) many cover stories focus on weight/fat loss instead of the other beneficial aspects of running, and 2) there could be just a little more substance. Often after I finish reading the magazine, I still feel a little hungry for more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"This magazine covers nothing that you can't find online. If you like shoe guides, and the same story over and over again just in a different town then by all means go for it. The magazine maybe has one small section that is useful each month, so save your money because they always publish that article online. You don't need this magazine, and it wont teach you anything. Iv'e been a subscriber for over two years now, and it has failed to impress me.

It does have a problem with taking tempatures quickly...it does not take them quickly. You have to let the watch get acclimatized to the temp while it is not on you.

Hit and miss throughout. Best songs are: I Can & Lavdate Dominum. The album is dominated by singer Andy Deris' writing and perhaps that is the problem. Most of the songs sound alike. Definately not as good as Master of the Rings or Time of the Oath, (or the Keepers)."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst Helloween album","review":"As someone who got into Helloween in 1989, I have followed the band closely and have all their albums. I watched the band grow, change and then return to the power metal style and I have to ask, how many times can a band put out the same album (see AC-DC, Overkill)? There is no growth in songwriting or musicianship here. Absolutely nothing new or interesting. Just a band that should have called it quits after Master of the Rings (although I have to say that Time of the Oath is a decent album). In fact the band hits a new low here with the song Laudate Dominum. Helloween has always been about goofy songs, but this makes \\"Heavy Metal Hamsters\\" look like a masterpiece. The only songs worth listening to on this album are \\"I Can\\" and \\"Time\\". Weike and Markus, please don't spit on my mind by putting out garbage like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"It could have been a great album, but....","review":"Otherwise good songs on this album are held down by two major flaws, in my humble opinion:First: the always below-standards vocals of Andi Deris. He just does not fit into this band;Second: the bad drumming by Uli Kusch. Technically speaking his drumming in this album is a lesson in virtuosity, really awesome. In terms of arragement and band-objectives, it's a disaster. Talk abou overplaying, talk about Uli Kusch in BETTER TAHN RAW. Amazing! Could no one restrain him just a little bit, so that the drums did not turn the songs into a big mess of a noise ????!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"C'est probablement le meilleur d'Helloween depuis \\"Keeper\\"","review":"La production est vraiment bonne, le son est pesant; probablement le plus pesant album dans les dix dernieres annees.

The musicianship is phenomenal with plenty of double bass drumming that is sure to get your head banging. This is one of my favorite Helloween releases. It is a great listen from start to finish. This American version of the album has a bonus song called \\"A game we should not play\\", which is , I think, better than the bonus song that was on the Japanese release. This is one of their heavier albums with some creative drum rhythms. One of my favorite songs is Laudate Dominum which has some of the most beautiful almost angelic singing and still retains a heavy metal feel with double bass drums jamming along and some AWESOME guitar solos.

Trying to get it back in and working is impossible and I am handy with tools. A micro spring appeared on my work area. I have no idea where it goes or where it came from. When I finally did get it back together some of the buttons did not work. After many attempts I gave up. Also, once you break the seal by opening the back of the watch it is never quite as waterproof as it originally was.I have been a Casio fan since Casio started making digital watches.

Found out you just cannot put on a new band. Sending it in to Casio they charge $60 to fix. The band on this watch is the same as the SPF-60. If you look closely there is no easy way to take the band off or on. It breaks where the band housing meets the case. Many other stories out there with the same problem that happens anywhere between 1 year and over 4 years. Watch is too expensive to have a design flaw like this. It is possible every couple years you will be spending $60 to fix the band issue.

Would like to have more disk just like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"MOST RELAXING PIANO ALBUM IN THE WORLD","review":"I GO TO SLEEP AT NIGHT WITH THIS PLAYING LOW.....IT IS A REAL LULLABY FOR ME.....ALL THE MASTERS THAT I REMEMBER AT THEIR BEST"},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible recordings","review":"received this disk today and put it on the stereo. i knew when i ordered the cd that all of the pieces were time worn and trite, but they are all inherently lovely. these are possibly the worst recordings and the worst interpretations of every one of these lovely pieces that i have ever experienced. anyone familiar with these classic pieces would be as offended as i (and the composers of course) and the cps went straight into the trash bin where they belong. it is hard to imagine that anyone would turn out such a miserable series of recordings. it is upsetting to imagine that this may be an introduction into classical piano music for some people. whoever put this together for EMI should be ashamed of themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"I loved the music, but it was not as relaxing as I had hoped. That being said, I will buy more of the same type of music, just not for the same purpose."},{"rating":"1","title":"a ridiculous book","review":"This is more of a cartoon than a book. It tries to cover so many topics and fails to help you understand any of them. So many cartoons and wierd illustrations are present. If you want to learn about Einstein, or his theories, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Simplified Approach to a Complicated Subject","review":"Einstein for Beginners acts more as a visual representation of Einsteins work. An easy to read format for anyone interested in knowing Einsteins theories without the mind-boggling formulas. I would suggest this as a place to begin. A nice read, although the theories one still needs to comprehend. The author, Joseph Schwartz puts it in a perspective that both challenges and educates. Highly reccomended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent introduction to Einstein!","review":"This book is a very engaging tool for acquainting young people with Einstein and his work. My son enjoyed the cartoons and appreciated the fact that the author included personal biographical information as well as professional history. The book is most appropriate for middle schoolers on up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware Mesh Lining","review":"I have been using Pampers for my daughter since the day she was born. I sware by the Pampers brand name. Unfortunately, their new \\"mesh\\" lining may have caused my now two year old daughter a visit to the emergency room. As it turns out my daughter suffered a serious abrasion to her groin which bled. It was an absolute horrible experience for me and my baby who had to suffer from excruciating pain and discomfort. The ER doctor advised me from staying away from these diapers for the next couple of weeks. Needless to say - we ended up buying Huggies. I've always trusted Pampers and hope that they will remove the mesh lining as soon as possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silica leaks out all the time!","review":"When my son was first born, we tried both Pampers Swaddlers and Huggies size 0 (whatever they're called), and we settled on Swaddlers. Then, we won a year's supply of Huggies, so obviously, we used those throughout my son's first year. Now that supply is gone, and I decided to try Pampers Cruisers for a change.Oh my g-d, I'm seeing things that I NEVER saw with Huggies - there's silica crumbs all over the diaper area almost at every diaper change. I have to take him into the sink and wash it out with water at every diaper change. I didn't change the frequency of my diaper changes, it's the same time interval that I used with HuggiesTrue, they don't leak, but Huggies never leaked either, so when this pack is finished, I'll go back to Huggies.I've never had silica leak out of a Huggie diaper, in my opinion that's just dangerous and shouldn't be around a baby's privates"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for babies on the move -- sometimes the tabs rip","review":"I almost exclusively use Huggies for no other reason than I was able to get a bunch of them on sale in many different sizes. My mother had Pampers Cruisers at her house for my 8 month old son and I liked how much they gave at the hip and imagined them being more comfortable for him as he's crawling and climbing and beginning to stand up and down. When I ran out of size 3 Huggies, I ordered these. I like the Cruisers very much, but didn't give them a five as maybe 1 in 20 the tab will rip off and make the diaper useless. It is not the end of the world -- but it is a premature end to that diaper!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great item","review":"Great diapers, if you are from NYS it is cheaper to buy it on amazon.com than in Babies r us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth for the price","review":"Product is good and acceptable. However for the price of the produce it's not work it.Material used is not suitable for Kids of this age."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed about shipping","review":"The product from Pampers is great. We bought this online to avoidhassles to rush into local stores.However, the shipping is really disappointing. First, I don't think theyeven bother to ring the bell at our gate before leaving a notice. After their secondnotice on Fri., we called them asking about the package and they told uswe could pick up (~10 miles away). On Sat. we called themagain that we wanted them to deliver on Mon instead of picking up ourselves.But nothing happened until Mon. afternoon, we called again and they couldnot locate our request to deliver: there was nothing on their record.Bored of this process we drove there and picked up ourselves.REALLY disappointing. This carrier is not so good as carriers used by amazon before."},{"rating":"1","title":"SHAME ON YOU PAMPERS!","review":"Pampers have pulled a bait and switch! They have changed this product for the absolute worse with no warning to the consumer!! No more mesh lining! Which kept the moisture off your babies skin. The inner liner has been basically cut to half its original size! No longer does the liner go all the way up the back! Which was important for poops etc. Also the inner liner does not absorb anywhere near what it did before! This allows for MANY leakthroughs! And finally the over all softness of the diaper inside and out has been changed to a stiff papery generic type feel! BUYER BEWARE!! They still charge premium price for this serious downgrade! shame on you! PARENTS UNITE!! AEDANSDAD22908"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best ever!","review":"My second baby finds me a wiser more diaper educated parent and this is the only diaper for us. I tried the cheaper huggies and even cheaper luvs and eeww. Leaks galore and a suspiciously high incidence of rashes. I am so ticked off that our local Costco is not carrying the Pampers #3 anymore but Amazon saves the day! With the free shipping its worth every penny."},{"rating":"1","title":"From best to WORST!","review":"Pampers has taken the best, highest quality diaper on the market & made it one of the worst, cheapest diapers on the market. There are many downgrades to the Cruisers that have me very angry:1) They seem to be made of construction paper-they are VERY stiff, cheap & papery (the old cruisers used to be very soft)2) No more mesh liner to wick away moisture! This has proven to cause many diaper rash on many babies (this is from feedback from other parents I know)3) 5 inches of paper in the back of the diaper: no padding, no absorbency-do they really test these things before sending this stuff out? What's going to absorb all the #1's & #2's back there? Paper???4) Absolutley no notice had been given of this deceptive switch. All boxes/packaging is the same as the old cruisersI could go on with other things, but I have things that need to get done-like shop for a new brand of diapers. It's a shame, I really loved Pampers, but this is a disgrace!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pampers Diapers is the absolute best!","review":"I have tried so many differnt brands and styles of diapers, but nothing compares to Pampers. Especially Pampers Cruisers! I will never buy ANYTHING other than Pampers again. These diapers fit my baby boy perfectly, no sagging, no tearing, no leaking! Soft, Stretchy, and Durable! Great price too, lower than most discount stores. A must have for all babies! A++++"},{"rating":"2","title":"No diaper is better!","review":"We started out with pampers because they are the diapers we received in the hospital. We fell in love with them right away, but wanted to see if there were any other brands that might be just as good for cheaper. The answer is NO! Huggies bulk up right after they use them. My daughter got a rash from the grocery store brand. This by far are the best diapers on the market!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great diapers - and that's all that should be said","review":"Pampers Cruisers/ Swaddlers make wonderful diapers. I've tried Huggies, Luvs, and a no-name brand, and they just don't compare (neither do Pampers Baby Dry). Cruisers/ Swaddlers are the only diapers that I never had to worry about leaking (Huggies and Luvs both have), and they are absorbent enough that I don't have to wake my daughter up halfway through the night for a changing.Although the prices have gone up and down, ignore the 1-star reviews... If they didn't want to buy these diapers, then they wouldn't be complaining about the price - just another way to show how good they are. These diapers are 5-stars all the way!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy these!!","review":"I tried these diapers for the first time a week and a half ago, and now my son has the most severe rash that I've ever seen. He never had any problems with the normal pampers but as soon as I switched hie broke out. I've been putting cream on him, and that doesn't even help. Luckily he is going to the doctors tomorrow. I wouldn't have even know the cause, had there not been a news story today about this brand causing rashes in lots of babies. I will no longer be using Pampers brand diapers."},{"rating":"2","title":"diaper is good, but shippment is slow","review":"I found the cruiser diaper is good, but the amozon shipping is too slow, almost take one or 2 month."}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:D,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},x={class:"card-container"},O=["disabled"],N={key:0},C={key:1};function R(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=y("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",x,[(a(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",C,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",N,"See more"))],8,O)):b("",!0)])}const W=d(M,[["render",R],["__scopeId","data-v-88c61727"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/52.md","filePath":"drive/52.md"}'),H={name:"drive/52.md"},P=Object.assign(H,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(W)]))}});export{L as __pageData,P as default};
