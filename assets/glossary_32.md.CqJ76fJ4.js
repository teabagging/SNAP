The blame surely lies with director Abel Ferrara, who has used the themes explored in this film elsewhere to much greater advantage (e.g., Harvey Keitel's 1992 \\"Bad Lieutenant\\", Chris Walken's 1990 \\"King of New York\\").Perhaps it is the 1930s setting. Or perhaps Ferrara's films are better suited to a low budget look. Or perhaps by 2005 we've come to expect more from our gangster films. Who knows for sure, except the film left me disappointed.BTW - director Ferrara is a big fan of \\"The Sopranos\\" and often employs them in his work. In this film we have Annabella Sciorra (Tony's girlfriend Gloria ), John Ventimiglia (Tony's boyhood friend Artie), and Joseph Gannascoli (homosexual hitman Vito)."},{"rating":"1","title":"extremely disappointed","review":"DON'T BE FOOLED!!! first let me say that i am a big fan of Bad Lieutenant,King of New York and Christopher Walken.who doesn't already know that Walken,Penn,Del Torro,and Gallo are already great actors? of course they are good but that does not make it a reason to see this worthless piece of trash.Ferrara directs this movie at a snail's pace and makes you not care about the characters.he tries but to no avail.i had heard such great things about this movie and after watching this i find myself wondering why.i won't go into any detail because i refuse to waste another few minutes on this disappointing film.so don't believe the hype.don't be fooled by the great cast.they're seriously wasted amongst this turd.consider yourself warned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inside jokes","review":"This is humor for the initiated.

If you're one of the uninitiated (like me), most of the jabs and puns will be baffling. I did some reading about the targets of the humor, after which many of the entries made more sense. But, as the saying goes, frogs and humor fare poorly upon dissection.You'll understand some of the entries better if you read the authors' other book first, Why Truth Matters. That book also assumes some familiarity with the Theory, but it gives you a much better feel for the basis of the authors' derision.Even if you don't understand all of the entries, you'll be able to chuckle knowingly when you hit on one you understand.

The kind of thinking that this book satirizes has trickled down onto high schools, where it harms and even wider audience. So High school students should read this as well.My sole criticism of this book (for which I deducted one star) is that if one is not already familiar with the concepts (Who is Jacques Lacan for example) then some of the jokes are less than funny.

It is rather poorly written and in many of his arguments for the Trinity Prof. Boyd makes use of common fallacies of logic, and his knowledge of biblical Greek is inadequate for the task at hand. His occasional use of 'ad hominem' regarding his opponents (e.g., p. 84 - \\"cultic reasoning\\") has no place in a supposed work of objective scholarship.

Most of what he claims to be Oneness belief is not. Mr. Boyd does not understand Oneness doctrine, and does a good job of proving that in this book.

Somerset Maugham wrote, \\"A good rule for writers: do not explain overmuch.\\" Unfortunately, this is exactly what Boyd does.

Even when contrasting \\"Oneness Pentecostals & the Trinity\\", a well-written text could cover the subject in half the space. This book is wordy, repetitive, and contains too much of Boyd's personal angst to be objective. A broader, deeper, better-written book on the subject of Oneness Pentecostalism (including the Oneness/Trinity controversy) is Thomas A.

That about sums it up. Stephan Shore's pictures exist on many levels simultaneously---one reason they are worth owning in book form, able to be revisited many times over a long time. Shore has a genuine gift, and he shares it with whomever takes the time to really look. This older work is relevant to contemporary production worldwide (i.e., Thomas Struth). Hopefully you will enjoy this book as much as I do."},{"rating":"1","title":"American Surfaces, pretentious time capsule?","review":"It's hard to tell how vital this visual diary is in the grand scheme of photography.

You can find out what people looked like and more importantly, what everything else looked like. I appreciate this aspect of the book, it's a reference guide to 1972.

I did this after my own research showed that there's no good evidence that craniosacral therapy has any benefit.Bottom line is that although what I read of the book shows that it might convince someone that not all therapies are beneficial, and that quacks exist, it did not convince my mom.So if you're buying it for a similar reason, realize that it may not do the job."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Insight into Alternative Medicine","review":"For those of us who do not know the difference between Ayurveda, Chelation, and Iridology, Dr. Isadore Rosenfeld comes tothe rescue. In his practical book, Dr. Rosenfeld's Guide to Alternative Medicine, he spells out the difference between theseand many other alternative therapies which more people are going to everyday. I wholeheartedly reccomend this work to beon anyone's bookshelf who is even romotely interested in knowing different therapies used today.To read the rest of this review and to view others, go to the World Wide Web Book Review at their NEW address: http://WebBookReview.com"},{"rating":"1","title":"Consider the Source...","review":"This book is a good example of why NOT to get advice from someone with their own axe to grind.Dr. Rosenfeld is clearly and utterly a Medical Doctor. He sees little or no use for modalities that do not agree with traditional medical ideas. He basically is judging his competitors in health care! How objective can he be? Consider the source."},{"rating":"1","title":"Medical Dogma","review":"Clearly, this is a spokesman for the medical profession who is continuing the age-old attack on anything but traditional medicine, either out of ignorance or malice. That maybe harsh for those who give the book a quick read and let the humor brush over the misleading information. For anyone interested in a overall views of alternative medicines you need to read books by individuals not on the complete other side of alternative medicine. The book does do a good job of introducing common alternative methods but is very limited on todays specifics procedures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Meat????","review":"Dr. Rosenfeld's scare tactic language as to POSSIBLE side effects of Chiropractic care are merely undocumented accusations as he gives no factual evidence to back these claims. On the other hand, factual evidence does exist for the proven side effects (and even readily admitted side effects by the pharmaceutical industry) for many of the over-the-counter and prescription drugs medical doctors (such as Dr. Rosenfeld) prescribe to their patients on a daily basis. If someone is truly interested in seeking out alternative medicine, they should go and visit a doctor in that field and ask their questions to him or her in person. I believe you will find these practitioners to be very honest and helpful, while truly interested in helping the patient get better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whittle away, old timer","review":"This obviously archaic version of what Dr. Rosenfeld considers a timely view of alternative medicine does nothing more than demonstrate his age and misconceptions about contemporary healthcare.Particularly in his views on chiropractic in the chapter \\"A Disjointed Theory?\\", Rosenfeld says chiropractors are excellent for low backs but believes they should never touch necks. How disjointed is HIS theory? Is the spine in the neck all that much more delicate or different from that of the lower back? I myself have had problems in the past in both regions and have found chiropractic to be my only true source of relief and correction of the true source of my problem.The only thing Dr. Rosenfeld sheds light on in this book is his medical bias, age-old theories, and misguided hypotheses. And all without merit. \\"The truest sign of ignorance is to dispell something you know nothing about.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all the facts","review":"This book does not review all the facts regarding many of the alternative methods used. He skews the facts by his opinion regarding many areas of therapy. In particular when he states that chiropractic is has potential side affects. The side affects he mentions are so rare they don't even register. The side of affects of traditional medicine are far greater and more catistrophic.He prefers a osteopath over a chiropractor if he can find one that does manipulation. When in fact chiropractors do almost 95 % of all manipulation done in this country I believe that I would want to go to those that are the most trained and experienced. If I wanted to avoid side affects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chiropractic Patients Know Better","review":"I was very disappointed in the content of Dr. Rosenfelds book on alternative health. It is clear to me that the millions of Chiropractic patients are more educated about Chiropractic than Dr. Rosenfeld himself. With 66,000 licensed Chiropractors in the United States alone, the terms \\"alternative\\" have an ever-changing meaning. I would not recommend this book to anyone searching for non-biased information on Chiropractic, or other \\"alternatives\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Not Know of What He Speaks","review":"The title should give it away.How could a mature medical doctor, especially one who is such a well-known medical spokesman be anything but medically biased, when disseminating his opinions. Especially regarding those areas which are outside his lifelong discipline.Dr. Rosenfeld also does a great disservice to people when he tries to scare them away from recieving neck adjustments for instance, from a Chiropractor (whom he says \\"He loves\\", in his chapter entitlted: Chiropractic A Disjointed Theory?). Chiropractic is THE only profession that should ever touch you or your family's spine. No one is more highly trained.If you truly want the standard AMA view on Health, routine or alternative, just look around. It's in every medical office and coming at you in every and all media. Have you seen a pharmaceutical ad today. Be oh so wary."},{"rating":"1","title":"The earth is not flat dear Doctor","review":"I found the book to adress Chiropractic unfairly, I think that Dr. Rosenfeld should do some current reading of his own on recent research that has been done and in the process of being done. Overall his opinions on Chiropractic adjusting of the neck are out-dated.

Unfortunaltely he has misrepresented some types of care--both their safety and efficacy and his information is misleading. Too bad for his limited view points."},{"rating":"1","title":"The sins of ignorance","review":"I was, to say the least, appalled by the views and opinions shared in this trashy piece of slanderous garbage. Clearly, this Dr. Rosenfeld is unaware, under educated, or just plain ignorant to the benefits of proper and prudent Chiropractic care. Even the subtitle of the chapter on chiropractic, \\"A Disjointed Theory,\\" shows the Doctor's anit-chiropractic bias toward a most beneficial practice.To even suggest that the medical profession considers subluxation to be a \\"chiropractic state of mind,\\" shows his backward and outdated knowledge of the medical profession as a whole. Fact is, Chiropractic helps millions of patients each and every year feel better physically and live better lives without invasive and expensive surgery and/or drugs.Get off the ancient and outdated band of chiropractic attackers, Doctor, and come into the 21st century. Either do THAT, or say nothing at all, for clearly THIS information is not worth purchasing, reading, or listening to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dr. Rosenfeld's BIASED Guide...","review":"This is just another attack by organized medicine on Alternative treatments and therapies, in particular chiropractic. Dr. Rosenfeld comes across as biased, ignorant and at times completely malicious in the information he provides. His assertion that he \\"loves chiropractors is disingenous at best.\\" He prefers non-specific manipulation by a doctor who can also prescribe (toxic) drugs. He lists warnings about chiropractic that are extremely rare, occuring one in many millions, and suggests that these are common occurances. He fails to mention that the practice of (Allopathic) medicine is the third leading cause of preventable death in The United States, which is the very reason we need more practitioners of the so called \\"Alternatives\\".

I'm watching it now though why I don't know. The music is good but completely wrong chronologically. The actors don't look at all like they are in the 70's. Only the large lapels suggest the 70's rather than the obvious late 90's/early 2000's. Just look at the real 70's footage and compare against the contrived scripted nonsense. I was born in the 60's and so the 70's were very formative - only the news footage bears any resemblence to reality. If you were not alive in the 70's then please don't take this movie to be remotely accurate.

The cabinet arrived with green mold all over it, as if it had been wet, but the packaging wasn't water-damaged. This means it was wet when they packaged it originally. Not a good sign. The rest of the finish was blotchy too. After opening the cabinet, we found damaged wood that looked like it had been banged around, again prior to shipping or packaging.

While this thin-skinned packaging kept it safe in the container on the way across the Pacific, I do not think it was intended to serve as a shipping container in it's own right. My dartboard cabinet arrived severely damaged.The right cabinet door was completely broken off at the hinges while the top hinge took some of the cabinet with it. The brass screws that had held the cabinet door on were loose in the box and during shipping one came to rest on the dartboard surface and damaged it by permanently indenting the board with a screw profile.The supplied darts are a step above disposable bar darts although the flights (stars and bars along with the union jack) are very nice quality and look good on my Nodors.I contacted Harvil and they are having me work through Amazon to get the item replaced."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing","review":"The cabinet finish is much darker than the picture, almost black.

It was still in the huge box that everyone keeps commenting on, I'm surprised they haven't changed that yet due to the many complaints. In fact, due to the other poor reviews about similar damage, we suspect that the same few damaged cabinets may be floating around! Very disappointing.

Daley on so many signs, permits etc. I was also impresssed by the respect and affection many people has for the mayor . This book describes the laying of the foundation of that Daley dynasty by Richard J. Daley. It tends to focus on the machinations of the Democratic Party rather than the benefits Daley brought to Chicago. Not as well writted as Caro's biographies, but still readable. I'm looking forward to reading \\"The Boss\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Disappointment","review":"I got this book hoping for somthing akin to Caro's biographies of Moses and LBJ, and was very disappointed. The authors are more concerned with segregated housing in Chicago, and the civil rights movement - they appear to make no effort to understand or explain Daley the person or what made him tick. Just page after boring page on the unfairness of segregated housing and how racist Daley was. This could use some \\"truth in packaging\\" - I would not have bought and read a book on the struggle for \\"fair housing\\" and civil rights in Chicago, and it needs a label \\"WARNING - Authors despise Irish Catholics and smugly look down on them\\".

It reads so fluidly, one can forget he/she is learning history while riding along with a fascinating narrative. I very much enjoyed it and learned a great deal from the exhaustive research that obviously went into the project.My only criticism, however, keeps me from giving five stars: the co-authors seem obsessed with housing and perceived racism issues in Chicago - at times to the extent that Daley is almost forgotten in their drive to bring home a point. If this is where their academic background is based that is fine, but the reader deserves to know this going in instead of being advertised a full one volume biography type of study. This was an occasional distraction, but one that usually ended soon enough with a paragraph break - welcomed with a 'whew, glad we got back on track'- from this reader.All in all, a fine book very much worth your time, but be advised not quite what it might seem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"This biography is shoddily reasearched, loosely referenced and glaringly biased. Mr. Cohen and Ms. Taylor have rummaged through the Tribune, the Times and other people's versions of the story in effort to present a \\"definitive\\" biography, yet fall well short of the mark. This is not a biography as much as it is an attempt at a vindication of short-term battles that were lost by liberals in post-WWII America.Of course Mayor Daley was a big time politcal Boss who didn't much care for folks different than him, unless he could snag their vote. But you know, Mike Royko already wrote that book 30 years ago. There's nothing new or revealing in this rehash whose only impressive feature is it's length, and that becomes a chore as two shortsighted, copy-inch driven journalists incoherently weave anectdotes together from newspaper clippings and other people's rehashes in secondary sources."},{"rating":"1","title":"Errors Abound","review":"If you're looking for a basic primer on Richard J. Daley, then this book is a harmless introduction. Serious historians will find the many inaccuracies in this book appalling though.

Then she meets Lucas Johns, a bold, dynamic crusader for social change - and an ex-con.

The walk-through of a full project using the test driven approach is a very unique insight into this practice. You can read methodology books for weeks - but this book actually shows you how to apply the methodology. It gets a little terse at times, but is otherwise a technical book you can actually - read - and get lots out of. It's definately not a reference, but that's not the intention. It's also not built to provide source code to an XML Editor, it's designed to show you how the code was built over a lengthy amount of time to arrive at an XML Editor.

I would say if you want to learn C#, don't write a book to do it. Why should I pay Mr. Jeffries to learn the language (and it is evident that he did not learn it well), and get the same old comments about Extreme Programming that other books have given me?I did find it comical that he states that he likes to keep things simple but when it comes to Xml, he would rather write an Xml parser / validator himself than to use what the platform provides. I guess the next thing we will see now that we have the editor, is a new operating system built from the ground up to prove that we need the editor :).Save your money and buy another book in the series, and Ron... you owe each of us $50 for teaching you C#, but I will take $25 since you didn't seem to get a lot out of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"what, no editors?","review":"I like Ron's writing style, but the code samples in the book bore only superficial relationship to the text.

Profound truth.","review":"Dr. Paul's book is a stunning achievement. I believe that it is one of the most profound books ever written. It is for those who sincerely seek to heal their wounds and become the most loving possible versions of their true selves. It describes a process that really works. The book is written without judgement and with true compassion, and at the same time leaves no place to hide. It is profoundly spiritual, but makes it clear that a belief in God, per se, is not prerequisite for following this path. Even for those familiar with Dr. Paul's other works and with her intensive workshops, the books contains many \\"Aha\\"s. For those unfamiliar with her work, although concepts are spelled out with great clarity and with many real-life examples, the depth and scope of this book will probably necessitate many readings. I totally recommend this book for anyone who is open to the profound level of growth that it offers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent thriller.","review":"This lesser known old dark house thriller from Lang, comes highly recommended. It's not about a haunted house actually, but I'd still call it spooky.

While on vacation in South America Bennett falls for stranger Redgrave, and promptly moves in with him. -He's strange indeed; with all the secret rooms in the big house, and two other just as strange occupants.

The file names are also non-descriptive. Many images are identical with slight variations on colors or rotation.

So, totally NOT what I was expecting (and thus the poor rating).This is basically paying $39.95 for a one year membership to a great web site that will cost $169.95 per year thereafter.Regardless of whether the value is worth what you get (and it probably is), the offer and product are still not clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Serious Misrepresentation","review":"I bought this product looking for an inexpensive home clip art collection.

This is a very good site with 10 Million images (reported), a good search tool, and easy to download features. In addition, the usage and licensing agreement is very generous and allows me to use the images in my personal project (kid's homework, fliers, etc), advertising for our business and, even in our professional educational (candle making) videos we make!Highly recommended for the access to the online images!

This book is a wonderful resource in this respect, but it left me with the question, \\"What should I do?\\"This leads me to the classic, \\"How to find your dream job and make it a reality.\\" By Jason McClure. This book doesn't tell you want to avoid, like the book reviewed, it tells you what to do to find a meaningful career. I think both of these books work hand and hand with each other. It is almost like the authors knew each other, and worked as a team to develop a resource library for job seekers."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOLD CITY DELIVERS ONCE AGAIN","review":"Not since the days of Ivan Parker, Brian Free, and Mife Lefevre has Gold City sounded so good.

Because it's so strong, you have to be really careful when you apply it. It will stick to itself (and not come apart), if you get a long piece that falls down on itself. I find it best to work in strips no longer than 12\\". For big rugs, or rugs that see a lot of traffic, it's best to use more tape, but if you put on several strips, it holds up well. I agree with another reviewer that it's best to place the strips going the short way instead of the long way. I've used this tape on rugs with several different kinds of backing (from rubber to weave), and it works on all of them.

They jump, wrestle, run, romp and about anything else you can imagine that involves doggie play. I put a two foot strip of this tape on all four edges of the rug, pressed it down good and it hasn't moved since. It's been a month now and no problems whatsoever.

I vividly recall an outstanding song about \\"Punch\\", the stuff you drink at parties.There isn't much point in giong into detail of all the songs on this set. It's often been said that Schubert's Octet is about 8 players sitting around, having a few beers, then making music. That's about what's going on here too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeesh","review":"Wow. This workout takes a toll on your wrists and shoulders.

I do like the emphasis on shoulder stability, however, as I could see I needed some more work I this area. Buyer beware, however, if you aren't use to barre or Pilates type workouts, ease into this series with other DVDs (Ive done Physique 57 for over a year, Pure Barre, Tracey Mallett, Core Fusion (great for beginners), etc.) Overall, I'll have to give it another try but first impressions weren't terrific."},{"rating":"2","title":"Workout","review":"What a workout. . .definitely more difficult than I anticipated.

I know some people have complained about wrist pain, but I haven't found this to be an issue.

That being said, I would probably not recommend this for beginners. This is very challenging and fast paced-but in a good way. It does put pressure on the wrists and shoulders, but it definitely targets the arms, back, and core with the planks. I am confident this will give quick results."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most challenging upper body workout evr!","review":"I have all three DVDs in this series and love how challenging they all are. This upper body one one is the most difficult of all three in my opinion, or I guess I wasn't as strong as I thought! By sticking to it using the modifications, I am amazing myself at how quickly I'm building strength, as I was thinking I'd never come close to executing these difficult exercises. I realize now how important her coaching is which teaches you how to develop the strength, and I glean a new understanding of what she saying with every session. Focus is paramount as it is with the other 2 DVDs.I'm soaked by the end of the workout from the sheer exertion of it. Make sure to modify at first and to keep your weight out of the shoulder as she says or risk injury. This series is blowing me away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goodbye flabs!","review":"Love this arm workout, my arms are tighter and less flabby.

Its just more flexible (Mac OSX/Vista isn't.)Right now I'm running Vista (I hate it, and so do all my freinds) and on another computer (a shiny new Imac) I have apple. It comes down to this:XP > Mac OSX > Vista. And Linux goes somewhere in there depending on who you are.Overall XP is the best.

I highly recommend such titles from the 70's and 60's as TRAMP IN ARMOR or HEIGHTS OF ZERVOS. But in the past few decades he seems to have sadly gone downhill, particularly in this ongoing series with Tweed.

The conducting was excellent, and the singers ranged from good (Charbonnet) to the so-so (Forbis). From an audio perspective it was a fairly representative of what we hear broadcast from major opera houses. Unfortunately we are not talking about CDs, and all I can say is that the artists' painstaking efforts were sabotaged by the bizarre video direction (and that's putting it kindly). Others have described the director's shenanigans better than I (Oh all the colors and camera jumping was enough to make one seasick). How bad was it? So bad that I could only watch it once...after shelling out big bucks! I don't mind something innovative and a fresh approach to a classic, but this was rediculous.

Once a noble profession, the practice of medicine has become a highly marketed industry consisting of the combined forces of the pharmaceutical companies and the media. Mind control is the aim, and today's doctors are subject to these influences. \\"Diseases\\" are being created where none exist to promote the industry, and a deadly industry it can be.Christian Science and spiritual healing, in my opinion, are far less likely to do harm, and doing no harm was the original committment of the physician. My personal choice is to consider spiritual healing the first resort, and the medical industry as the last resort - and in that case, proceeding very cautiously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hysteria title to sell a book.","review":"The mind control model is not applicable to anyone except people being held in prisons that are indoctorinated by abusive guards. Courts today do not accept claims of mind control because unless one is held against their will then there is no chance of controlling a persons mind or thoughts. I have never been to a Christian Science Church or Reading Room where members are locked up in jails. My great Grandmother was a member and lived to be 95 years old, my grandmother is a member and is 93 years old, so I guess CS is not a great killer religion. While I don't agree with all the beliefs of CS, I was raised Catholic, I don't find it's belief system harmful to it's followers. More people die of accidental death in hospitals then people die of praying. So I guess if the author wants to do a new book she can do one on how HOSPITALS KILL. I used my book to start my BBQ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lazy is the word!","review":"I can tell you that you don't get anything out of Christian Science without individual study. Deep deep study and work. The people who are writing the \\"bad religion\\" books have given no indication of any personal work to understand and put into practice the theology. To sit and wait for a miracle or \\"magic\\" is to be disappointed. Mind control? I don't think so. Not in a teaching that makes it necessary to do your own work to progress. TV is mind control. Spiritual work is quite the opposite.

We all know that the title of this book was used simply to entice readers. The fact of the matter is, if you've ever known a Christian Scientist, they are very practical, loving people. They only wish the best for their families, and themselves. The religion is not a cult, people come and go as they wish. People are never punished for their beliefs unless they are directly putting down the church (membership can be revoked). Many Christian Scientists live by the philosophy \\"God does not keep score.\\" They try their best to rely on healing, but Christian Scientists are NOT against going to the doctor if a condition persists. This book really tries to put C.S. in a box. Christian Scientists are like any other group of religious people. There are good ones, and there are bad ones. So why write a book full of anti-C.S. propoganda? Just to sell books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievaly bias","review":"This book plays on total sensationalism and has false information.

Christian Science is far from being a cult and obviously these reviewers are non-Christain Scientists who know nothing about the religion except for all the \\"NEGATIVE\\" things they read, or they , like the author failed to grasp what Christian Science is all about. If one wants to get a fair and honest opinion they should read \\"MARY BAKER EDDY\\" by Gillian Gill, a NON CHRISTIAN SCIENTIST. Also they should take a walk to the Christain Science reading room and read the Science and Health, but actually READ IT! Obviously something MS. KRAMER did not do!

Buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea, Poorly Made","review":"I bought this steamer because it has the extendable handle. I purchased two steamers. Before I used it, one of the legs popped off of one of the baskets. I thought it must have been something I did and dealt with shoving the leg in every time I used the basket. The baskets fit well into my pans and was really easy to get out without burning myself. I only washed the baskets by hand as the directions indicated. Last night, I used one of my baskets for maybe the tenth time and noticed the handle was bent and ready to pop out and one of the legs fell off.If you are trying to decide which steamer to go with, don't choose this one. I thought I would save an extra two dollars by going with this one instead of the silicone one. It was a big mistake. I am now going to buy the silicone one and am out eighteen dollars instead of two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't last 24 hours","review":"We needed a new steamer basket.

One of the legs fell off the first time I washed it. This is before we even used it. The \\"leaves\\" or whatever you want to call the part the collapses on the side, looked like they would separate in no time. I returned it.

When I am done with steaming my veggies I screw this handle in and lift the steamer basket with it. This way the top plastic part of the handle is not in any kind of contact with food.The only thing is that you dont really know what the water level is unless you take it out from the pot.

Also, if you pull it up out of the pot while full of veggies, you better make sure it's properly balanced on all sides or it will turn over and dump your food out all over.

If your interested in this title, I recommend the manga more than this anime."},{"rating":"2","title":"A well documentary and someone should be embarrassed...","review":"The film went into unexpected details about the whole Broadway process.

The rest are mostly filler like cleansing wipes and band aids. You only get ONE (yes, one) of each of the useful things such as burn cream, hydrocortisone cream, and sting relief. You are better off just compiling your own first aid kid by purchasing items from the drug store. The reviews and descriptions I read made this seem like it was a must have for parents with small children.

Yes the case is cute and practical and can fit quite a few first aid items in it. But you would think being made out of a hard plastic that it would last a good while; that wasn't the case with the one I received. Not even a month after purchase one of the sides has already broken off and the other is coming loose. I still use it, I just can't carry it by the handles any more.

The tutorials are useful in seeing how to work dark to light (which I understand to be the opposite of many artists)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk // Do not recommend purchasing","review":"I'd give this zero stars if I could. First of all, I thought this was set up similar to the bookshelves that fold up and require no assembly. However, for this little gem, some \\"assembly\\" is required. You have to hammer in dowels to hold 3 of the 5 shelves. When I started pounding in the dowels, the rack started coming apart. After pounding it back together, it wouldn't hold. I was not about to trust that it would hold multiple bottlles of wine. It is going back. I don't believe you have to spend a fortune on a wine rack that is going to be in a closet, but this isn't that wine rack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self Destructs on Assembly","review":"The dowels are not uniform in shape and all of them did not fit into the slots. With a little elbow grease they fit in but in doing so the screws came out of the \\"built in\\" shelves, the unit came apart and the wood surrounding the screws cracked. Therefore, the whole unit was not secured together anymore. I recommend not buying this unit. It is not worthy of any amount of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Buy","review":"If you are looking for a basic wine rack that is not bad looking, this is a good one. I just received it and will works fine for my needs. Easy to assemble. Will get one for another location. Remember that it is not a \\"high end\\" rack, but if you are looking for a 25 bottle rack it should meet your needs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wine rack review","review":"I like the rack, good looking and does the job. One concern is there is no way to rack the long skinny bottles of wine, they fall thru the gap. I can live with that. Where they came up short for me was in the fit and finish on self assembly. No matter how I assemble, there are gaps on the fit and finish of the side walls to the shelves. For the money, still a good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap, half-broken, banged up and not even worth the price","review":"I guess you get what you pay for. Package arrived half unwrapped / poorly taped, and the wine rack itself is cheaply made. Half the factory-installed screws were already ripped out of the wood, two of the shelves are crooked, and it took 30 minutes to install the other two shelves using just their cheap dowels. Not even worth the trouble to return it but buyer beware - something from either a better, higher-end vendor or Ikea would be much better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wood Wine Rack","review":"It arrived in excellent condition and was just as \\"advertised\\" if not better- easy to assemble (virtually no assembly required other than a few dowels) works just fine and is \\"attractive\\" in the process."},{"rating":"1","title":"wobbly and unstable","review":"I got this rack and put it together. Putting it together was easy enough but then I started to take a look. The whole thing was unstable and I wouldn't have trusted filling this thing up with wine for anything. The shelves that came pre-assembled were coming off the rack. I had to drill a few wholes and add a few more screws to shore this thing up. Sort of took the collapsable and easily stored features out of the product, but I had to do it so the thing would hold my wine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable Story of Escape","review":"This is the story of Agnes Peregrine, whose mother is a well-known bird expert. From a very young age Agnes is able to exactly imitate the calls of many birds. One day she and her mother go to find the rare, elusive pink-headed duck. At the same time, the evil villain, Colonel Edwin Pittsnap, decides he doesn't have enough bird trophies in his collection: he wants to capture the pink-headed duck. Pittsnap decides to secretly follow Agnes and her mother, and when Agnes calls forth the pink-headed duck, he captures it in a net. Agnes, however, finds a way to make the villain release the duck. This is a humorous story about the difference between loving natural things and trying to own them. It's one drawback is that it's a bit predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved the drawings but the story is a little weak.","review":"Put it this way, I had to reread this story to even remember what it was about and even then it was a little confusing to the child I read it to.

BUT the caveat is there is no support for the Instructor. There are no Keys, and as every instructor knows, there is not enough hours in the day to do the work AND prep for all the labs we have to do. I only give 2 stars because of that one fact. It would be a 4 star effort to be sure (some of the questions in some of the labs are NOT obvious what the author was asking for), but A Key is needed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, not great","review":"This book was kind of boring, and patronizing to the people who live in Times Square. The author acts like he's disgusted with humanity. Way too cynical, and the descriptions of black people were very minstrel show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Explaining fall","review":"I used this book this semester while student teaching with a Kinder class. The kids really loved the illustrations, and the explanation of why the leaves fall. They were fascinated with the explanation of the pigment for red, yellow, and orange already being there. I'd reccomend it with older children too, as they might enjoy the science behind it even more, and there's more opportunities to actually have them describe the leaves and observe leaves in a section the way the book shows us we can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why Do Leaves Change Color?","review":"This is a question every elementary child asks their parent or teacher. Don't know the answer? Read this cute book and you will find out! A great book to teach one science concept of fall.

Excellent text and pictures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Illustrations for little ones, text for much older kids","review":"The \\"picture book\\" design of this book doesn't match the dry explanations about chlorophyll, etc. which would be appropriate for a much older child. There is no \\"story\\" motif, engaging rhyme scheme, or fun elements to capture the interest of a younger child. My very bright little kindergartner walked away after I had read a few pages -- something he has never done before. The illustrations are richly colored -- they deserved better writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"My 5 year old is not that intertested","review":"My 5 year old is not that interested in this book.

I think he may be more interested in this book in another year or two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice book for the age","review":"This was a very pleasant way to complete an autumn hike with our 4 year old grandson.

I would highly recommend this book to other teachers"},{"rating":"2","title":"Why do Leaves Change color?","review":"It is a very educational book. I am not sure though that the age range is correct. I think It may be hard for a 4 year old to all take in. There is quite the detail about information we only learn in our later years."},{"rating":"2","title":"**An Extraordinary Story About a Saint of Our Time**","review":"Padre Pio was canonized St. Pio of Pietrelcina on June 16, 2002. There are many books written about him, and this is one of the best and most complete. He was a Capuchin friar born in southern Italy in 1887 and died in 1968. He bore the stigmata, the wounds of Christ, for 50 years. He also possessed other unusual qualities, such as bilocation, odor of perfume, the reading of hearts, miraculous cures, remarkable conversions and prophetic insight. Because of his ability to read hearts many people sought to confess their sins to him. Although he heard confessions for 12 to 14 hours a day, it was necessary to register 10 days in advance because so many people desired his spiritual direction.I highly recommend this book and also \\"Stories of Padre Pio\\" by Madame Katharina Tangari."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing story of a very holy man","review":"Padre Pio, one of the most renowned modern-day Blesseds, was a very holy man loved by many people. The charisms he was blessed with by the Holy Spirit are truly amazing to read about, including bilocation, the odor of sanctity, as well as his most famous gift, the stigmata. The accounts of miracles attributed to his intercession are unbelieveable, and I'm sure they're just a small amount of the great deeds this man has done. This man seems MORE than a man, forgetting to eat meals, having great favor with the Lord, and sometimes being invisible from others. He comforted many dying souls in their last agony. This is a great compilation of the wonders of the great Blessed Padre Pio."},{"rating":"2","title":"I listen to his album everyday!","review":"i've never heard his name until my indian friend suggested to buy his album. his music is modernized,well-mixed with old hindi songs and R&B type of music. his voice is also pretty good when he sings in english and hindi.i bought same CDs to give some close friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateur","review":"Absolutely horrific. His talent is questionable at best, his lack of training shows, and his voice is certainly below average. In addition, there seems to be no emotional depth in his music whatsoever, and frankly the lyrics are overdone.(\\"I know we've just met yesterday\\") Yea, been there done that. Very unoriginal and a shame to our brown people.But on the other hand, I gotta give him props, just cause he's a brown person with a CD and actually finding success internationally, even if its unwarranted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boy band reject?","review":"I really wanted to like this cd. I loved the single Can't Get Enough, but unfortunately, that's the strongest track on here. All I could think of when I listened to this cd was how much it sounded like middle of the road NSync/Backstreet Boys pop. Lyrically and musically (for the most part) this is a really weak album. The couple of songs that have an Indian feel to them are pretty cool, but overall this just wasn't worth the money. I'd hold off on buying the full length cd...just buy the single for Can't Get Enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great mixture of east and west- plus he has a good voice","review":"I recieved this album as a christmas present- I think it is really really great. I particularly like how some songs start out with indian music and even words, and then Raghav starts singing with his american sounding voice. The melodies are the bomb, and I have not many complaints. There are a few tracks which wern't great, but the number of good tracks easily outweights the few bad ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome stuff","review":"This guy has a great voice....a melodious fusion of the east and west in his music.

And at the top of the handle, where it meets the vertical part of the plastic molded unit, there is a stress point. You can get cracking and the handle will pull away from the carafe.Make sure, if this happens to you, that you carefully support it and don't pull on the handle (especially full of hot coffee.) You can superglue or epoxy the handle right back on (I dabbed Superglue onto the cracked surface by pulling the handle slightly away, then pushed it back and pressed it to bond.)The pot is as good as new. But if you bash yours over the faucet as you stupidly dash out drops of water after washing, then this will come in handy. I am very fond of this coffeemaker; it makes great coffee and I'm glad Amazon carries these carafes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great replacement","review":"I was so happy to be able to get this carafe after mine broke.

These are the songs God intended Tom to sing, when he handed young Thomas Woodward, THAT voice. No plastic R & B here, these songs reach into your gut, and give it a shake. Tom is in magnificent voice throught - powerful, \\"smokey\\" and, dripping with feeling. Superb arrangements and musicianship from Jools and the boys, make sure that it all hangs together brilliantly. And, it's impossible to miss the fact that they all had a lot of fun making this record.Simply put, if you're a lover of genuine rhythm & blues, performed the way it should be - then, you must own this album.

His collaboration with Jools Holland is an R&B; gem. I found the 'Mr. Jones' album wildly uneven (although the good songs on it were incredibly good) but this newest offering is consisently strong and rockin'. 'TJ & JH' is in the same league as 'Reload'.My only complaint would be too few ballads, but the fantastic 'Who Will the Next Fool Be' and 'Baptism By Fire' (co-written by Tom himself) are good breaks in the raise-the-roof jam session.A must-have for any Tom fan, even at the import price."},{"rating":"1","title":"NEVER BUY FROM CLASSIC PINS!!!","review":"I bought from CLASSIC PINS and paid in full along with $12 for 2 day express delivery and almost 2 MONTHS later have YET to get my product!

The information in this book is a bit heavy, so you have to take your time and read each section carefully. It is a very elaborate and informative book but extremely accurate and very well written. My astrologer introduced me to numerology in the past couple of years and this was one of the two books he recommended to me. (the other was the Divine Triangle). I would say after reading both of these books you really don't need to buy another book.This book is out of print but the copy I ordered from amazon was \\"used\\" but was in near perfect condition- I would have never thought it was as old as it is. It was an absolute steal considering what my friend paid for one at a book store. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"complicated,dry not for the beginner to eastern thought","review":"I found the book hard to follow and far too technical.For those not grounded in philosophy or theology ,it would be difficult to follow the discussions that compare the mystic insights of Eckhart to Eastern thought.The book is suited to those who already have a firm grounding in the religion to which thEy aspire and who seek to view other traditions from this viewpoint"},{"rating":"1","title":"Zen","review":"Slow, dry, and dull. If you are really into Zen it might be for you, but if you are you will want more. If the reader is Catholic they will be dissapointed.

Strunz & Farah are incredible musicians, and though I own virtually everything they've recorded, this relatively early CD is my favorite by far. It should be in everyone's collection!

This is not easily digested and understood. You have to read the book in sections to obtain the greatest insights. The book is better on theory and the physics of synchronization processes. The end of the book discusses the chance for a electrical defibrillator. We are presently at a very preliminary stage of development even though a vagal nerve stimulator has been found effective in certain refractory cases of uncontrolled seizures. This book firmly places Epilepsy as a dynamic illness with chaotic, often unpredictable characteristics and sets in motion ideas for a cortical integrated defibrillatory device. Let's hope we innovate and obtain one soon for clinical trials."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good comprehensive introduction to freshwater fishes","review":"Although it's been around for about thirty years, it has been revised and updated. This is an excellent guide for getting a grasp on what those little fish are in the pet shop tank, what they need to eat, what they need in terms of water temperature, pH, hardness and quality, how much space they need, how well they get along with others, and how big they grow. (That cute little fish with \\"C. managuense\\" on the front of his tank will get along just *fine* in the 10-gallon tank with your fancy guppies! [NOT!]) There is even rudimentary breeding information for a great many species.Even for advanced aquarists, there is a ton of useful information here, even though much of it is dated. The looseleaf edition allows for updates.The only reason this gets 4 stars instead of 5 is that it is somewhat dated.

Colin Hays does not have a terrible voice. His guitar is like any other guitar. Any other guitar, particularly like your buddy who plays \\"Horse With No Name\\".

The entire video is extremely difficult to follow.

A breif segment in the intro shows a student demonstrating some of the more accrobatic techniques of the Art. Capoeira is known for its flips and spins. Don't count on getting much out of this video.I would assume that the Addvanced video of the series might get into some of the \\"Fun to Watch\\" moves. However, after viewing this video, I'd be very reluctant to buy anything else from the same creators!I highly recommend buying any other video than this one on Capoeira.

The book begins with a young man named Jimmy Little who is an intelligent boy trying to survive a rough neighborhood. Mama Jean , his father's mother, is his sole provider. Suddenly, and rather quickly, Jimmy's father (Crab) who escaped from prison appears in the story. They embark on a trip, which is very uninteresting. There were enjoyable points in the book. The character of Mama Jean was well done. Jimmy was an OK character if not a bit ignorant. This book fails on every level.

Suddenly one day he was walking home from school, he saw a man standing in front of his house. That's when the book starts to get interesting.I will recommend this book as one of the best book. The writing style is very persuasive. The father of jimmy is very dramatic. You will never know what he going to do next. This book has professional language and easy to read. This book is like more reality then fiction.It is the best time to try it out. It will probably take you week and half to finish it up. It also has lot of drama.

However, I found this book to have a weak plot and other flaws. The conflict was never really resolved in the book. How it ever became a Newbery honor book is beyond me. One plus was that this book uses realistic dialogue. However, this one thing could not save the book as a whole.

I could relate to this book in many ways and I know people that could also relate to this book.

I remember reading the book and loving it. I remember watching the movie right after, and being partly thrilled, partly disappointed. I appreciated the movie makers making the allegories visually clearer. The sex scene was an add-in, sadly. Other parts, including the scene showing Napoleon in clothes, should have been done better (the animals should have gotten to see Napoleon in clothes). On the other hand, I was thrilled how dedicated they were to the spirit of the book. The animals are well-played, the songs well-written, the lines delivered with deep emotion, and the music links everything together. Overall, this is a good buy.I'd heartily recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I don't have it but I have the Movie","review":"I don't have this soundtrack but I have the movie.

This is mostly meant for beginners with electric guns. One bad things is that when it breaks a ball, it spreads it all around the hopper so I have to take it apart and clean it out. Second thing is that it's very loud. The balls are always moving and this could very easily give away your position in woods ball like it has done to me. Therefore, I turn it off while at long range which is somewhat annoying. Lastly, it is only 18 bps which is terrible for an electronic hopper, but you can expect that for the price. But the price is pretty good which is the only pro. Overall, I would rate this a 5/10.

From the physical perspective, it's a very nice comic book, one of the coolest ones published by Vertigo in the 90s. Kyle Baker is responsible for both the argument and the drawings, which are specially expressive. The text that supports it all is absolutelly solid - catchy, funny, as intelligent as all good humour manifestations should be. The characters' somehow orthodox view on the modern society, the groupies' tendencies, interpersonal relashionships (love, sex, friendship, family) is f*** surreal, yet very centered and amazingly logical, and the whole development of the story leads to unexpected, delightful happenings which aren't as important as the dialogues in the middle of it all. It's hard to begin it and not to finish it in one take. Try it and you'll love Saturn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too Much Talk for My Tastes","review":"There's lot of amusing insights into relationships here, combined with visuals by a very gifted artist.Unfortunately, the relationships ring hollow to me -- I just don't believe in Anne, Ricky, and what's-her-name as real people. They seem designed mainly for humour.The early part of the book is non-stop talking heads with little or no plot or action. The early chapters could be interchanged without much problem. The visuals liven up the succession of heads, but I found the artwork a little too lively; with shots from every angle, and expressions jumping from joy to angst in rapid succession.The latter half of the book livens up with Anne's trip to LA and San Francisco. There was some action, and events that I could believe in.The road-trip elements at the end of the book might suggest \\"Thelma and Louise\\", but I believe this book was first published before the movie (?)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tool Bag for Field Service work","review":"In the machinery field service industry different types of tools are needed for different types of jobs.

I liked how David Almond brought a poets work into the story too. If I had one critism then it would be that it didn't tell you what kind of creature Skellig was.

It's a 192 page book, so it's not a hard book to read. It's a mysterious book. It's mostly held at a dark house. The book is about this boy who has the creepiest imagination. The boy and his mother, father, and sister all moved into a big house. And he was really excited to move in, but then something horrible happened his sister gets really sick and he starts looking through his big dark house. He thinks he finds something.I would have to rate this book a seven out of ten. I would rate this book a seven because of the plot.

It is a moving and compelling story about life and death and all things over and between. It is encompassing in a gorgeous way, but not at all overwhelming. I was very impressed by David Almond's writing style. The pacing of the story and the striking yet dreamlike creation of this world really made the story come to life. This is a very mature book and while it would be an incredible experience for children, it is probably too intense or \\"creepy\\" for younger kids. I will not be sharing it with my 6 year old sister for a few years. As for adults--read this book. It is a good experience. Be proud that you can stop and see the magic of life, in all its fragility and its indefatigable light; perhaps its the Skellig in all of us."},{"rating":"1","title":"OVERRATED","review":"What an overrated book for children this is. It was hard for my daughter or myself to empathise with 'Skellig' or with the children's love for him. His character was undeveloped beyond the morbid descriptions and habits of his eccentric predicament. Neither were we comfortable with some of the inappropriate language used to give the book a 'normal kid experience' or 'street cred' feel. With there being so many more imaginative, enriching new books out there I do sincerely wonder why this one has been so well received. Is it perhaps an overreaction to the current success of the more entertaining style of Rowling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reads like beautiful music .............","review":"Beautiful and lyrical, this strange and wonderous book will lead you and your child into unknown and uncharted territory.

This was my favorite book because Michal was kind and made a friend named Mina. Skellig was a man who lived in Michal's garage,ate dead blue bottles. Dead blue bottles are dead bugs.He also ate 27 and 53. But it never tells what these numbers are,but mabey if you read this yourself you could find out.Skellig also was very weak so he couldn't move.

Often, they tend to be formulaic. Not Skellig! From the moment Michael discovers the strange creature -- man, bird, or angel? -- in his parents' garage, I was taken in. You will be too, whether you're a child or an adult. Almond's attention to detail (Would an other-worldly being eat chinese food?) is what gets you. But what holds you are Michael's \\"real world\\" problems, his baby sister's illness, his family's move, the fact that his old friends, Leakey and Coot, think his new friend, Mina, strange. I was unable to put this book down until I found the resolution.

I would recommend this book to someone who just wants something to read because this book is easy to read and is a very moving story. The story was very anticlimactic. Nothing was really left for the reader to try and figure out. This story was not boring, but it could have used some more excitement. Being a Sci-Fi genre, the plot was not supposed to be believable but while reading the story you can get into the characters lives and feel how they feel about their problems.

I was skeptical: for the most part,book reviews seem to get it wrong with respect to children's literature, believing that children most want gently-wrought, monosyllabic, dumbed-down stories. I read Skellig to my six-year-old daughter. We could not put it down. The man/angel, Skellig, is a character not often found in children's literature: he is gentle, plaintive, weird, human, ethereal and a little spooky all at once. Needless to say, we were both boo-hooing by the end. One word about the beginning: don't be put off by its rather formulaic start, i.e., new house, unfamiliar school, sick baby, dark garage. The amalgam of events, and especially the way David Almond presents them, makes Skellig one that should or should have received the Newberry."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Children's Book For Adults","review":"Don't get confused by Skellig's \\"Children's Book\\" label. This story is deep and thought-provoking. Children can certainly read and enjoy it, but many of the subtleties might go unnoticed.The book's protagonist, Michael, is one of the most instantly sympathetic characters I've ever met in a story. David Almond tells the story gracefully, with few words, ignoring what is not relevant. The result is that the story was somewhat shorter than I'd expected it to be, but no matter. It's still excellent. Skellig, the mysterious birdlike man he befriends, and Mina, the artistic girl next door, are powerful supporting characters. The parents in the story, though minor characters, are nevertheless sympathetic and well-drawn.Definitely worth a read, especially for readers who enjoyed Madeleine L'Engle's Time Quintet or Ursula K. Le Guin's Earthsea series."},{"rating":"2","title":"title smitle...here's the review","review":"Skellig is an interesting book. If you're used to characters that are really engaging, this book only has one, and it's not the main character. It's the atmosphere of this book that helps elevate it to a four star review. It feels surreal, and perhaps, this is why the main character left me dissapointed (a bit mind you) in his personality. He seems to be drifting along, and skellig, is the anchor that helps him from drifting away from things. His infant sister is in ill health, and when he discovers skellig, a little magic is introduced to his life, as is a way to bond with a peculiar, home schooled, neighbor girl. I shouldn't be so heavy handed with the main character's lack of vitality, because I think he's supposed to be one you can easily put yourself in, and in a book as spiritual as skellig, that's what is needed. Give it a shot if you think nature is...mysterious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Skellig","review":"Skellig was a great book.

I've used it many places and times, the most convenient being the instalation of kitchen cabinets where there are not removable shelves but stationary ones and you need to get inbetween the shelves to secure the cabinet to the wall. Many times a regular drill just wont fit. My biggest complaint with this machine is the ability (or lack of) to keep the pressure behind the drill to get the job done. Becuase of its design (which makes it the tool what it is) getting enough pressure behind the head to screw in or out tough screws, almost stripped screws, or screws into a stud, can be difficult.

The Makita angle drill kept popping the built in circuit breaker in the drill, which is a great feature. The other review on this page says it has enough power for what it is designed for. Yes it does if you want to pre drill pilot holes for every screw you set or taking cabinet doors off. But sinking screws in studs is another story.

English aristocracy was known for \\"correct\\" behavior at all times. One's reputation was of utmost importance. Damage to one's reputation could ruin one's life and worse-- this is the foundation of the unlikely but entertaining mystery that is at the center of The Moonstone.The characters are all well done and even the bizarre detective with his surety, sideburns, and affection for roses seems completely authentic. Both my husband and I enjoyed this film completely and recommend it highly. English upper-crust society was very much about the keeping up of appearances. Everybody keeps their appearances in The Moonstone until things go very much astray. Excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad story /Bad directing","review":"This proves that not all period dramas are not good stories the story is poor not sure why this was made into a film.

The young lady owner sees someone take her diamond. She has access to this person; it is someone she knows. Why not just ask this person to give the diamond back? Why not ask \\"Why did you take it?\\" Why condemn this person without giving him or her a chance to speak? This stupid girl (Rachel is her name) soured me on the whole book! This is not the way that people would really act in this situation. Collins asks readers to suspend disbelief too much. If Rachel had spoken up, she could have saved others, like Sargent Cuff a lot of trouble."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting story, characters to care about","review":"Dietz's story is compelling, well-constructed, and intriguing. The idea of wormholes as economic assets is viable and exciting, and the young Dorn Voss is a character to care about.

The banalities of this fictional work stress the limitations of tolerance. The hero and the old man's daughter are scarce adventuring and more oft in the sleep chambers. Never has a wider crevasse been seen, or a more unappealing cast of characters wrote. Whether dreams of youth on rolling fields of wheat come true, enough ferreting in trousers she do.

The problems, on the other hand, are extremely difficult. There is no bridge between the two. The index is not particularly good. The explanations are obscure. The text spends too much time on theory that I suppose is interesting to mathematicians, but just gets in the way of learning about derivatives and integrals and their uses. I truly detest this book and find it a misery to deal with. My child's teacher was sick for the first half of the year, so I was thrust into the breach. I graduated from college magna cum laude with a Phi Beta Kappa key, I took Calculus and made an A (many years ago), I am a CPA with an MBA. My difficulties were not because I am dumb and not because I wasn't trying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shows, doesn't tell.","review":"If this were a novel, I'd love its exposition: all show, no tell. Sadly, this is a Calculus textbook that gives examples, but seems not to care about explaining the topic.

It's different, but not difficult. In an attempt to be terse, this book loses all of the things essential to getting a student to understand calculus: good examples, explanations, and a logical progression of difficulty. There are many ways to explain a mathematical concept, but you're lucky if you get a single coherent one out of this book. It needs to be supplemented so much -- to the point of it being just plain useless. I'm all for lighter, briefer textbooks, but not when brevity impedes on quality. It's sufficient for getting a student to pass the AP exam, in some cases, but that's not the goal. The goal is for students to understand calculus and, more importantly, better understand mathematics as a whole."},{"rating":"1","title":"The bane of my existence","review":"I am currently a senior in high school working my way through this book for my AB Calculus class. All I can say is that this is the crappiest textbook I've ever come across in my life, and I mean it. The concepts are presented poorly with very few examples. The examples that they do give are hard to follow and often times will not help you with the problems you will soon encounter. As life would have it, my math teacher is of no help either, which only makes things worse. If you know you will have this textbook for Calc beforehand, heed my warnings and learn from a different book if you can.

I was really disappointed because I felt as though the author kept making assumptions as to how I was supposed to feel about each character. I had no feeling for the main character other than contempt because she came off as a selfish woman who had made a bad choice in deciding to marry. I felt only pity for the husband and all in all was unable to see any real motivation behind any of the characters.

But Eddie's ego has ruined this band. And on the new songs, I haven't heard a note of Mike's bass. I think the new songs are weak. the best one is Up For Breakfast. The rest is total crap.

It is a true abomination and shows how utterly deep Eddie has suck into the bottle. Alex needs to sack up & get his li'l bro in line! The sequencing order is asinine! The lack of songs from Van Halen II & Fair Warning is ludicrous! The only choice I agree with is totally ignoring the \\"living abortion\\" Van Halen III era with that true loser Gary Cherone.

Starting to look like Aerosmith. The Roth tunes on the 1st Greatest hits album are much better then these new tunes with Hagar. Eddie is gone, done. This band is over. As much as Roth's new music sucks I'd still rather hold out waiting for him to find a hot guitar player and start playing rock music. Eddie has turned into a self absorbed whack case. Michael is not even playing bass with the band he's slowly working his way into the Wabo Ritas. I gaurantee you Sammy is not back in the band. Eddie will go on another hiatus. This album and the tour was a major bomb from what I read which will be a great motivator to make new music. Yeah right!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So close....but","review":"So close.....but so far away. I agree with some of the other reviews that Fair Warning should have had at least two more songs on this set(Mean Street and So This Is Love). The live songs should not have been on there at all. The strangest thing is that the strange instrumental \\"Strung Out\\" is included at the beginning of \\"Not Enough.\\" This is a good set and I like the way they mixed up the songs but the three new ones should have been mixed in as well. Besides the Fair Warning songs...the biggest omissions are Don't Tell Me, Humans Being, & Me Wise Magic. Those songs are some of their best. Bad move guys!! As for VH3? Well, maybe \\"Without You\\" should have been a hidden bonus track or something. No great loss though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Van Halen 1977-1984. R.I.P.","review":"The track listings on this CD are crap. Why couldn't they of released a seperate disc for the 2 worlds? Or is that they know if they had released a CD with just Van Hagar songs on it, it wouldn't of sold well? Warner Brothers should release the best of Dave Lee Roth with the best guitar tracks from the early Van Halen years through to Steve Vai and Jason Becker. Also back to the compilation, why are there too many tracks missing? whatabout more from Fair Warning like Dirty Movies? Or Sinner's Swing? etc etc. Where's Spanish Fly? I couldn't recommend buying this because its aggravating to listen to, as DLR once said 'I want my cake and I want it all, or I don't want at all'!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Somebody get me a doctor.....","review":"This album sucks! The 3 new tracks sounds like Van Hagar are now influenced by Nu-Metal. Why can't they release their live Concert from California with Roth in 83 on DVD? Hagar's song writing is crap. He never was able to keep the cheeky song writing of Roth. In fact I'd recommend Roth's 'best of' album in comparison to this, because the guitaring for starters is better. Like previous reviews anyway, weve already had one 'best of' album, so why another? Warner Brothers just wanna keep the money flowing in. Also I noticed when listening to some parts of this CD that the sound stops occasionally, so the CD is flawed. Overall, if you are a Van Hagar fan, buy it. But if you are a little weary of listening to the same VH tracks over and over again, avoid!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Ass Kickin Album","review":"Jeez, I have to say but this album totally reeks of awesomeness. You no longer have to go and look on Van Halen's old albums to go and find all songs. Because they are all on this cd.Van Halen has 3 live recordings on this cd, \\"Ain't talkin bout love\\", \\"Jump\\", and \\"Panama\\". Those 3 are sung by Sammy Hagar, since he's now the lead singer, and has been for about 12 years. Eventhough Sammy Hagar is the lead singer, they still have good ol' David Lee Roth. You can still hear him do his awesome screams like in Panama and Jump. I still think that Sammy Hagar kicks David Lee Roth's boot off the charts. Basically, if you want Van Halen's old hits, they are all here. And you can't find a better Van Halen cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Of course, YES!","review":"This is my style of music and I went to the concert this year in MN, USA (2004).

Can't go wrong with this one. It is in heavy rotation on my playlists for sure along with their new one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really the Best of Both Worlds","review":"Very nice collection. Some newer stuff I hadn't heard before but really like. \\"Ain't talking 'bout love\\" with the original DLR and a live version with SH makes for interesting listening. Really worth the $s if you like any version of \\"The Halen\\"! EVH never left so all the guitar shreds!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Compilation Of A Great Band","review":"This compilation of Van Halen is just awful. Whoever put this together should be ashamed of themselves. All of the songs are randomly listed, no chronological order at all. The David Lee Roth era should have been disc one, the Hagar era, disc two. And both of them with songs in chronological order. Then the fact that they cut off \\"Finish What Ya Started\\" is really annoying. The three new songs are ok, not great, but could have been done without. There are so many flaws in this collection and I wish they could get it right. I wouldn't recommend this compilation, unless you feel you must have everything Van Halen, good or bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"This remastering job isn't good","review":"The song list is great. I don't care that the Dave stuff is mixed in with the Sammy stuff. It's all good.The two stars are there because of the mastering job. What \\"remastering\\" really means is this: \\"We're going to throw a bunch of compression on the original mix. It doesn't matter that we're adding distortion (where it doesn't belong), raising the noise floor, and killing the dynamics, as long as we can get more level out of it. The folks that mastered Van Halen's previous studio albums didn't know what the hell they were doing anyway.\\"I would never have bought this if it wasn't for the three new Sammy songs. Unless you need the complete Van Hagar era, stay away from this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Packaging, RIP OFF, Same old stuff nothing new, WRONG","review":"This release is typical of Van Halen releases, they give there fans nothing new. I guess they are saving up for the box set, For $20 you figured you'd get some unreleased tracks or rare photos, maybe some good vintage live cuts. What do you get? This is the best of Van Halen but without the guitar pick and with three new LACK LUSTER songs that sound like they were written in three minutes. And Artwork thats similar to bad grade school finger painting. IF YOU ALREADY HAVE THE VH CATALOG STAY AWAY FROM THIS. A WASTE OF MONEY..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent with a few flaws","review":"I echo what other reviewers have said here. I am no Van Halen zealot, but I do enjoy the band's music. I had a couple of discs, but I bought this one for storing lossless on my AppleTV. Like others, the live tracks seem a bit out of place, but I take no points off for inclusion of unnecessary items. But there is--for me--one glaring fault: the exclusion of \\"Intruder\\" from its role as predecessor to \\"Oh Pretty Woman.\\" I mean, it is that incredible lead up to OPW that makes the song combo such a rocker. The OPW rendition is pretty good on its own, but with Intruder, it is killer. Its absence costs one star for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic!","review":"Van Halen is Rock n Roll. All of David Lee Roth's screams to Eddie Van Halen's guitar shredding this album brings back all the live shows. With exception of the newer songs that haven't grown on me yet, it is a great remastered album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did We Need This?","review":"First of all let me start off by saying I am one of the biggest Van Halen fans on this planet. Having said that do we really need another \\"Best Of\\" from VH? Didn't we just see one a few years ago?The problem with this album is we have seen most of these songs before. It is a better compilation than the \\"Best Of Volume I\\", but not much better. As far as the new tunes go there aren't enough, and the ones here are not very good. I've read several interviews where Eddie has said he has so much good material it is scary. If that is the case he must be holding it back for future albums.The bottom line on this is if you are a new fan or don't have VH's earlier albums then get this. It is a wonderful introduction. If you have most of the earlier albums and are already a fan skip this, and wait for their next full length release. I just hope the new original material is better than this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hagar Singing Roth Tracks? Are they out of their minds?","review":"Eddie Van Halen, although a gifted guitarist, apparently doesn't know what the fans want - a live Dave Era Album. I'm sure somewhere, deep in the 5150 vault is a screamingly, loud blast from the past. A testament to what this band used to be - the baddest band on the planet. Instead, we get badly sung versions of DLR era songs by a fat slob who obviously hates singing them.If I wanted to hear classic VH songs butchered by an obnoxious drunk, I'd go to a kareoke bar. This album is prime example of Eddie trying to tell us what to like.

RIP Van Halen"},{"rating":"1","title":"Get rid of the Sammy songs and you have a great collection","review":"Well ANOTHER \\"best of\\" so who cares. There are too many songs from \\"Fair Warning\\" omitted. The classic David Lee Roth mixed with the sappy love ballads of Sam just don't gel.The Dave-Sam-Dave sequence is a bit annoying, they should have at least separated them into their own discs. Then you could use the Sam disc as a coaster. It would have been even nicer to release this in two separate volumes, but then no one would buy the Sammy volume."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Sammy Horrible and Edward Scissor Hands Show.","review":"Firstly, I agree with all the reviews about the re-release of the same songs as the 'Best of' album. It makes the first attempt pointless. Secondly, I thought the new tracks are absolutely awful. What does shine in both compilations is the drop in quality of Van Halen. When they first appeared they were raw, fresh and they had a showman - DLR that was awesome. After his departure Hagar came in, stuck the band into a poppy direction and ruined the band for life. The new songs speak for themselves, they are crap. Eddie's guitaring is nothing special, he seems to be copying the Nu-Metal grunge theme. Sammy's song writing is what you should expect I guess from a fifty year old has-been. Overall, I can't give this more than 1 star. All I can recommened to any potential VH fan is to get their first 4 albums. All the albums afterwards were nothing special."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why can't this be GOOD?","review":"Ok, I'll admit it...I bought this for the three new songs. I wish I hadn't. The new songs are lame. So, if they come out with a new album......say in 4 more years, will all the new songs suck like these do?I want to hear songs like \\"Me Wise Magic\\" or \\"Can't Get This Stuff Anymore\\". I had high hopes when Roth was (kind of) back in the band.You can feel the Eddy/Dave vibe again on these songs.Sammy and Ed are capable of good stuff.

But the fact is, this compilation is a perfect sum-up of all Van Halen Eras, the Gonzo days with DLR, great songs and attitude, and Sammy, well produced songs, well crafted, concise compsotions... both of them were great, they had different styles obviously but a Van Halen fan can aprecciate all of the good things about both of'em. I like them both.The new tracks are heavy, the tuning is very low, Eddie is probably digging these FX now but I believe a new album is gonna have great tunes.For people who think Eddie's guitar style is easy, you could record a track of Eruption and show to us all, cause I've seen some fantastic guitar players playing and no one has the same picking as Eddie's, the guy's great and you can ask every great guitar player on the planet about that and Eruption is a masterpiece!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OK compilation but defect in CD","review":"The bottom line: the compilation is OK (a little lacking in the David Lee Roth department) and the new songs are forgettable.

Combining these two era's is like mixing Jack Daniels with bar brand tequila. It's both nausiating and insulting to the taste buds. There should have been two greatest hits by this band and no more. One as the mighty Van Halen and another as Van Hagar. Even though I believe in only one Van Halen (that died in 1985), I still would have purchased the Hagar tracks with Ed on guitar just out of curiosity. This is the second time that this band has stuck it to the fans with a bad mixture plus three new turds to flush. Also, the Roth tunes that were butchered by Hagar from the not so live cd (if you call re-recording Roth songs in a studio and over dubbing the crowd in live) \\"Right Here Right Now\\" serve no purpose except to throw the finger to Roth and old school VH fans. If you are a completist, then complete your VH collection with this. Otherwise, save yourself and run away as fast as you can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Walks OUT","review":"A. Never mix NEW songs with classics. No matter the temptation to lasso a few bucks, in the end the listener will only be TOO conscious of how subpar the new songs are. I call it Karma.B.

But like any good freeway pile up you look through the cracks of your hands just to see if a body is hanging out of the side of one of the cars.C. Fans already have all these songs.D. Fans do not want these new songs. Have you heard Marching to Mars or 10/13? It buries this nonsense!!E. The pacing and spacing of the songs is of course ridiculous.F. How the 'F' did this get made in this fashion?G.

The new tracks aren't my cup of tea, but neither were the new DLR tracks on the previous comp. Perhaps this is what VH are doing from now, releasing comps each time with a few new tracks?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Same Album, different cover.","review":"Why? Why? Why? Are we all to forget about the Best of album now, because this is almost exactly the same. Why they don't get DLR back into the band and drop Sammy (can't sing, can't right) Hagar it beggers belief. The new tracks on the CD are trash. VH were good at the beginning, but no way are they even half as good now.

Ignore the bad reviews! If people don't mind parting with their hard earned cash to buy repeat records with a different cover then what are they on? The DLR era made Van Halen what it is now. They may never of been heard of it if weren't for DLR. Sammy (bleach heard old whining git) Hagar's career would be over now if it weren't for VH. The Hagar era is mediocre at best. The new tracks on this record suck. Thankfully I have never bought a record from their Hagar era.

In conclusion, buy it and you will not be dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Roth Fans Get Ripped Off","review":"Even though there are some of the great songs from the Roth-Era, I cannot reccomend this collection. I can understand a balance between Roth and Hagar era songs, however the three new songs sound as though they were put together without regard for quality, and the real kicker is Sammy Hagar singing Roth-era songs live. Who wants that? I can see acknowledging the \\"Right Here Right Now Live\\" cd, but put Sammy singing Sammy-era songs or they could have put that cover of The Who's \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\" on it. It is a blatant attempt to erase roth's connection with the music of that era. They want us to believe that Sammy is an adequate replacement for Roth, and it isn't true. No fan of Roth Era Van Halen should buy this cd. The track list is very similar to \\"Best of Vol 1\\", and it includes the great Roth songs from 1986. Accept no substitutes. Van Halen is: David Lee Roth, Edward Van Halen, Alex Van Halen, and Michael Anthony!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Same Crap Again","review":"The same thing as 'Vol.1'. Important songs are missing ('mean street', 'mine all mine').

Sammy Hagar CAN sing so the band does NOT suck just because he's in it. Van Halen brings back a lot of good memories and since I bought this set I haven't listened to anything else.

EVH is an amazing talent and it will continue to influence i am sure allot of new artists. My brother in Law was debating with us about Slash, Sammy, EVH, and Edge (U2), Clapton and apparently they all chose EVH. I didn't believe it till i heard it! EVH is an inspiration.

Apart from DLR performing with some of the best guitarists in the world like me, I must admit he IS Van Halen! Sammy Hagar is boring. His voice is boring, his lyrics are boring and non inventive, how many time does he have to sing 'stormy weather' for f***s sake? The music changed into poppy dull crap when Roth left because we had to tune up one step We shouldn't of taken on a singer who's career was just about past it's sell by date. Dave Lee Roth should be put back in this band as soon as possible, I'm gonna talk to Alex about it. Only nerds can be into Hagar. Hagar should retire, something that he should of done 20 years ago. Yer, lets get ROTH Back!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Double-Disc Set Vocally Pairs A Buffoon With A Righteous Rocker","review":"BEST OF BOTH WORLDS, a two-disc set of Van Halen's greatest hits and album tracks, equally splits the songs between those sung by that annoying buffoon David Lee Roth and those fronted by Sammy Hagar, who rightfully believes that the young Australian tourist jailed in Indonesia since 2005 for drug-smuggling was unjustly convicted; thankfully, the four new songs feature Hagar, not Roth, which makes this set a vast improvement over BEST OF, VOL. 1. People can complain that VH were never the same without Roth, but I don't take any stock in their whimpering and whining, and, in fact, those people don't deserve to waste our oxygen, because Hagar, besides being a better person than Roth, can kick Roth's butt as a singer any day. This is a great set, but you'd be better off buying the first three albums with Hagar instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"David Lee Roth IS Van Halen","review":"David Lee Roth IS Van Halen.

It will be obvious then that Dave is the heart and soul of this band.The title of this should be \\"Some Good Songs From A Great World And Some Garbage From Another World\\". Sammy Hagar destroyed this band (or perhaps Eddie Van Halen destroyed it by letting Sammy Hagar into it). Van Hagar is nothing more than a second rate version of Journey.The fact that live versions of classic Van Halen songs are on here sung by Sammy Hagar is all you need to know to prove the sorry state of this band (and Eddie Van Halen's mind).To sum it up.

As for the newer material, god Eddie, what the hell have you been doing all this time? What I use to like about the early stuff was that you had never heard anything like it before, it was fresh.

Just dumb!Eddie Van Halen said he had written enough new material for 10 new albums, and this is all we get. Total rip-off!.

However, non actresses who can't sing, performing songs that require someone with a voice like Gertrude Lawrence is something else. Did this show really run on Broadway? Did Americans, used to the highest standards of musical theatre really pay to see it? She has no range, she is way too nasal, she is at times out of tune.

The pockets are VERY small but work to hold his files, picks and guitar strings. It is made of tough fabric and the wide mouth top stays open to make it easier for him to see everything he has in there. The shoulder strap is a nice plus to carry the bag after you load it up.I would not recommend this bag if you are looking for a bag to carry a lot of small tools or parts in.

Sands, Camels, desert and market the Arab world is a modern beautiful cities. There were no Arabic words through out the book to let the kids learn basic greetings. My kids had a look at it for a minute and they lost interest straight a way. The Arabic numbers are badly displayed and they are clearly were put manually after the book was laid out.

It is less than 22 minutes long, and only contains 2 minutes and 7 seconds of film containing Jigoro Kano, the subject of the video. This is including some quarter screen shots during the opening credits, and a three second clip of him smiling. The filler is smarmy documentary including tons of camera shots lingering on still photos, and even silly cartoon drawings. One might think, with the video being only (not quite) 22 minutes long, they wouldn't need to recycle footage, but presto, there is a two minute segment, not including Kano, that you get to watch twice. After you suffer through the 22 minute fiasco that the producer calls a collector's item, they have the gall to tack on a 6 minute 'video catalog' of their other products. The catalog spends more time on the screen than the subject of the film. Absolutely infuriating."},{"rating":"1","title":"DONT BUY IT","review":"SIMPLE,....

Sadly I was very disappointed. I'm no gourmet chef. I have basic ingredients on hand and I can't afford to buy expensive fresh herbs and exotic foods. So needless to say, the extraordinary number of recipes containing such ingredients in this cookbook left me with very few recipes that I could actually use. The few recipes I have managed to find all the ingredients for have turned out less than perfectly appetizing.

This book is challenging enough for me to be fulfilled on both those levels. For instance... The Tandoori Marinade recipe might be a bust for some people who don't keep cardamom, turmeric, or garam masala on hand. But for a foodie who maintains an herb garden and has personal contacts to the Spice Islands for free spices, this is a no brainer winner recipe.Don't get me wrong, there are some great easy \\"standards\\" in this book. Biscuits, Chocolate cake and vinaigrette (my 15 year old made the Raita recipe for gosh sakes). We pigged out on an Indian food meal complete with Naan, for only 11 points. I appreciated that!

However, the recipes here were not good--I have tried several and all of them have been passable at best.None have been awful, but the flavors are off--for instance, with the Bow Ties with Asparagus and Salmon, the combination of sour cream, mustard, and white wine (all things I love by the way) came off as too sour/acidic. The Scallops with Parsley-Brandy Pesto, which sounded wonderful, didn't taste that great and the pesto overpowered, rather than complemented, the scallops.On the plus side, the range of recipes is huge and the ring binding is nice.

I want to take the book back to Barnes & Noble but since the book is sold \\"sealed\\" so you can't see what you're getting before buying, that's probably not an option, and I've seen online postings that suggest it's next to impossible to cancel your online subscription, so that's, no doubt, not an option.

The book is indeed profoundly empty; it contains no life, nor anything taken from life.The characters give entertaining speeches, and are doubtless well pleased with themselves; but why should I spend the hours of my own life reading it? Barth's skill with words is impressive; that doesn't make him a great writer, any more than being fast made Herb Washington a great ballplayer.Some praise its knowledge of history; I would say, rather, that it demonstrates the distinction between knowing some facts about history and knowing something about history worth communicating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing and sophomoric","review":"I didn't really get this book. I found it too long and almost boring. The plot is so complicated that I gave up on following it. At the same time some parts of it, especially near the end, completely strain credibility. The idea that some people, despite having notable physical characteristics, would be able to repeatedly diguise themselves so completely that even close friends could not recognize them is ludicrous. The frequent philosphizing of the book, while not annoying, tends toward the sophomoric. Above all, I found the book to just too pointlessly scatalogical.

I still have yellowed clips of paragraphs, retyped (on an IBM Selectric, thank you) and carried in pocket or purse to remind me to change my angle of observation from time to time. Plenty of reviews here to tell you the story, I'm just here to praise it."},{"rating":"1","title":"NLP for Skiing","review":"I'm not a fan of NLP in the first place, but NLP for skiers? If you know NLP, there is really no need to read this book. Just apply what you know to skiing. I think NLP is alot of hokus pokus. There is one thing that is true in this book and that is you can't be using the conscious mind when skiing. But that applies to every sport. The more you practice, the more it becomes automatic and the better you are at something."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have","review":"I must agree with another reviewer. This is a must have safety product.This should come with a saw like a miter gauge. You must either build one or purchase this one. Don't wait until you need it for a project because you might find yourself just being extra careful on that cut like I found myself several years ago. I pride myself on being safe in the shop and in life in general. I ,however, cross cut a 1 x 4 using the rip fence one too many times and found myself with two nice little bruises on my belly. It hurt like crazy. I knew better and had heard Norm say not to do it several times. I now know why. I didn't want to spend the money on the device. Please don't hesitate to purchase this product. I was lucky to only have three bruises, two on my belly and one directly to my pride. Four stars because it is nice perfectly one inch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"I use this on my Jet Xacta table saw. Works great! For the price, you could build your own.

And when it's on, I sing, I dance, I move. Or I just put it on in the background. It reminds me of a bunch of other music, but it's not like any of the others it reminds me of.I ended up buying the other one that people keep raving about (\\"Wicked is the ...\\") and that one's just as good (or maybe I remember the Willy Wonka more).Not that it sounds like any of the following, but if you like Air, Jackson 5, Toto, Steely Dan, Pablo Cruise, late Roxy Music, Sade, The Crusaders, Starbuck, Level 42, Style Council or Scritti Politti you probably will like this.PS: Everytime I play a track from this CD at a gig someone always asks who it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Magic is Gone...","review":"The album that got me hooked on Crazy Penis was their first - \\"A Nice Hot Bath With...\\". At the time, I thought they were in the Big League of downtempo/chillout, along with Solid Doctor, Fila Brazillia, The Irresistible Force, Nightmares On Wax, and the like. And they certainly had the sound to walk with their head high among equals. Sadly, with every consecutive album, they've been regressing, until, with their last two albums, they've devolved into generic commercial trash-dance filler music. No originality, no soul, nothing to remember. Sad..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"What can I say? Music is music.

My friend regualry uses it at his 'house' parties. The music on this record reminds me of the off the beaten path clubs I stumbled into in London, Amsterdam, Madrid, and Lisboa some years ago where the grooves and solos filled the air like the stench of the bathroom. Quite a mix: Vintage, funky 70s grooves, 60s bossa nova, jazz=avant guarde, spoken word, modern break beats, et. al. Sophisticated music and you can still dance/chill to it.Stand out tracks are Sun Ra Arkesta w/Cee-Lite and Marva Broom & The Art Ensemble of Chicago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly plastic, not going to hold a ton of weight","review":"This is a neat idea but keep your use of this object to small items.

Although the illustrations may be whimsical, most of the facts could pertain to any state--there's poison ivy in North Carolina too. All of the factual information is contained on two text-only pages at the back of the book, and children are not going to sit still while Mom reads these facts to them. Having grown up in Wisconsin, I was looking forward to reading this book. I was extremely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"TAKE WARNING","review":"This is a totally different band. For all of you who hold No Rules, or Keasbey Nights dear, I warn you to brace yourself for this new release."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit less than Keasbey Nights","review":"I realize that Catch 22 will have a slightly different sound now that their lead singer and guitarist have been replaced, but what makes them special is still there. Still has fast, inventive horn melodies. As some of the previous reviewers have mentioned, I miss the soft, acoustic guitar found in Keasbey Nights. The new guitars are good, but it's one step more toward other dime a dozen punk band guitars. The songs are still first rate, though I miss Tomas a bit. The live songs at the end are fantastic, and the cover of American Pie is great. Overall, a bargain, and a must-have of fans of the first album."},{"rating":"2","title":"different but good","review":"washed up! is sweet! it's not as good as keasbey nights but i still love it. even though it only has four songs it has 3 live bonous songs at the end, but you have to hit the search button for a pretty long time after the 4th song. Leaving is one of the best songs i've ever heard by catch 22, it mixes outstanding trumpet play with some hardcore gutitar. hard to impress is also amazing. it mixes different but cool trumpet play also with some really hardcore gutitar. the cover of american pie is the best version i've ever heard! that song shows you how much talent they really have. Get washed up! or you'll be missing out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Different Band; Change is not always a good thing.","review":"\\"Keesbey Nights\\" is probably my favorite ska album. C22 somehow manages to play quite complex horn lines at really fast speeds but the mix of acustic and electirc guitar and the harmony of the vocals really makes the album. \\"Washed Up\\" is still good. The new lead guitarist who seems to lean towards more distortion guitar a la \\"Less Than Jake\\" looses some of the charm that \\"Life goes on\\" or \\"Christina; she don't no I exist\\" had. The bonus tracks after the reprehensible \\"the death of my blood is your indulgence\\" are great. It is great to hear the new band playing three of the old songs live. I still am waiting for them to come by San Francisco."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different, but still KICKS A**","review":"this is a different style than Keasby nights, but it is still awesome. the fast beats in all the songs are great, and the live tracks that are on the end of song #4 are great(except that it takes a while to fastforward 16 min). The remake of Amercan pie is awesome. This is truly a great cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun Regency debut!","review":"When Dashing met Danger is an enjoyable book with just the right amount of adventure to keep you turning the pages.

Find a better book about great African Americans","review":"This book is one of the worst writings I have ever read. The author begins each bio with bad prose, extolling the virtue and greatness of the person to be described. It's actually an insult to the 100 African Americans listed, as though their acts were not really great enough to stand on their own by simply describing what they accomplished. Rather, the author must first wax poetic (badly) about how wonderful they were before even telling you what they accomplished. Was there not enough that could be said about their deeds to fill a book without pages of useless filler?If anyone knows of a really good book of mini biographies of great Black Americans I would appreciate your telling me about it.

The footage is powerful and impactful. When the focus was on the former child-soldier, Ishmael Beah, you are left feeling a sense of \\"western-guilt\\". This kid tells these horrific stories of death, chaos, and greed, then brings a smile to his face, because of the gratefulness he feels for being alive. The focus of the documentary should have rested more on his storyline. At the very least, there should have been more conversation between Ishmael and the musicians about the potential they have to change the attitudes towards diamonds. The musicians that traveled with him to Sierra Leone came across as shallow and selfish, only superficially impacted by the horrors being presented to them. The film ends and you have this uneasy sense that these musicians are going to return to the United States and leave the misery behind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must-see film about Hip Hop and Diamonds","review":"If you don't own it, you should. I saw this amazing film at BAM in Brooklyn and I hope it gets wide release and exposure. It can really be used to educate the uninformed about some of the consequences of buying diamonds. Cepeda's film is both insightful and provocative in the way it exposes the links between hip hop culture and the devastating aspects of the diamond trade on the land and people of war torn Sierra Leone. Cepeda is able to creatively weave the stories of hip hop artists with those of the victims of the war; child soldiers, amputees, rape victims and the displaced. Watching the gradual understanding awaken in the minds of the hip hop artists Cepeda traveled to Africa alongside the gripping homecoming of a former child soldier is moving."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inferior","review":"Mallet arrived with no Bessey markings and no place of manufacture.Inferior workmanship as compared to other Bessey products that I own."},{"rating":"1","title":"The King is Dead","review":"True story: Like a diamond in the rough, I came across this game--minus its label--on the sidewalk one cloudy day. You can imagine my surprise upon discovering that it was KOF EX, even though I've bought the sequel long beforehand. In retrospect, I made the right choice.Though basically the same as KOF EX2 in terms of graphics and functionality, EX1 is worlds apart from its successor. First, you have a total of 30 fighters to choose from; 2 are unlockable and 10 are only available as 'strikers' that you summon when in a jam. Also, compared to the sequel the inferior music and sound leaves you 'howling' in pain. Special moves seem harder to pull off, all the difficulty settings are easily beaten and the end bosses suffer from SNK Boss Syndrome.I suppose I could keep both games if only for the (slightly) different character rosters. But even that feels like a weak reason to keep this weak portable fighter.This game is rated T for Teen: Violence"},{"rating":"2","title":"a beautiful prose","review":"One of the rare books I could read in one breath. It is short, inspiring, and imaginative. Choukri's writing is very simple, like a dessin, in a diary style. Simple, yet it tells so much about so many things, mainly about Genet and how he relates to people, what he thinks about literature. It also tells a good deal about Morocco. The translation is excellent, I think. The beauty of the language is well preserved.One will sense the respect Choukri has for Genet, and his compassion, sensitivity and warmth toward the society. There are a few pictures of the author with Genet and his friends also, which is a treat.A great page turner. Couldn't put it down. One of the most beautiful proses I've ever read. Now I'm looking for more books by Choukri."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing read.","review":"Well written report on what really goes on in the South and how it affects the inhabitants of a real, yet often mythical part of the country. Only someone who lived in the south, and experienced the realities, and subsequent myths, of the region, could research those realities and myths in such a way to intertwine the seemingly incongruous concepts to capture the truth that is the South. Ms. McPherson attacks this challenge, grabs it by the belt buckle, and dissects the milieu that many of us are a part of, but very few understand. This book about \\"other\\" people taught me more about myself than I would have dreamed (or chosen to) on my own volition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beauty in the imperfect","review":"I liked the book overall. The simplicity of the book itself went with the theme. I am a visual person and would have liked to see the pictures in color, although this may have also been Wabi-Sabi. I enjoyed the cultural background. I bought a copy for myself and as a gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Book-But Not For All People","review":"By its very nature Wabi-sabi is difficult to define. It is an aesthetic best learned through observation and personal experience. However, as Westerners we have a need for everything to be explained with words and categories. We seek to make the intuitive, rational. If you are a person who best learns through the written word, this book is for you. It is well written and dispenses with a lot of mystical babble that is often used to explain Asian philosophy. However, if you are a visual learner, you may find this book disapointing. Too much writing and not enough visual examples of the Wabi-sabi aesthetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"A slim skim","review":"Perhaps if I had read this book before I readWabi Sabi: The Japanese Art of Impermanenceby Andrew Juniper, I would have a higher opinion.

It is a clear spring of sweet water that will quench the thirst of everyone.

But the dumb asses at DFA (Death From Above) records wouldn't allow it so they made them change their name.

Pick it up there, that's where I got mine. It's kinda different, only in the way that it sounds a little more distorted and dirty. There's some crazy vocals that are put through a synthesizer by the bassist, which is pretty cool. Get this CD if you like DFA79.

Both these book have extraodinary parallels, with both men questioning their fundamental beliefs, when faced with physical extinction. Palden Gyatso's book is set in modern times but rings of antiquety, Patton's inspired offering is 2000 years old - yet you can virtually feel Jesus breath down the back of your neck! Both these books are essential reading, since they portray people faced with ultimate spiritual dilemmas - and oddly - both set against the background of the Himalayas.

The publishers were kind enough to provide most all the Portuguese and English lyrics.My personal favorite arragement is \\"Wave\\" - it's amazingly fun to play.

There are even contradictory statements within one page! E.g., on the top of p. 22 he states \\"Fliers work, and they're economical.\\" Later on the same page, he says, \\"...pass out free tapes or CDs...

Probably 'cause they Rock!)Some of the material was pretty generic and could work for promoting anything, but there were so many ideas I had never thought of before and I think I'm pretty good at this self-promotion game.

Great explanation of technique used to locate missing people, and a great story also. In '79 William Dear had to do things the hard way, no cell phones, no computers, no G.P.S., just good ol' fashon' detective work. A really good book that keeps your interest until the very end, a glimpse into the way law enforcement can be led off track and go nowhere, while a private investigator can go places and do things no cop can. I highly recommend reading this book, as well as other books by William Dear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laughably naive.","review":"This book does nothing but reveal the author's minimal research into both James Egbert's disappearance (he ran away from home) and the AD&D game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"So maybe Bill Dear does have a bit of an ego, but you've got to admit, he IS good.

I purchased the first home freeze alert and I tested it by installing it in my garage where the temperature was cold and it worked fine. The temperature was below 42 degrees and I got the tone like I should have. I then used it for a couple of winters when I went away. I assumed it was working as it should have. When I finally got around to testing it again, I realized that it was not working. I purchased another one for $38.00 and the new one has done the same thing. I do not recommend this product for the price I had to pay. It has a two year warranty but unfortunately it was just past the warranty period each time when I realized that it was not working. It would be a great idea if I could depend on it.

I am a fan of the space shuttle program, any NASA program. This book was a pretty interesting attempt at detailing what could go wrong. One would hope that the security of the Kennedy Space Center is more tightly monitored than what is represented in this novel. But, being a government patrolled area, it does give one pause, considering Washington's loose-lipped history. If you are looking for a no-brainer type book that is just a nice comfortable read, then you will like this book. If you are looking for something with strong character development and indepth plot structure that requires you to exercise your college degree, you won't. I like reading for fun and entertainment...this book handles that quite well."},{"rating":"1","title":"How can anyone give this book more than 1 star?","review":"Very irresponsible writing that treats readers as idiots"},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable and Overblown","review":"I have enjoyed all of Anderson & Beason's previous techno-thrillers, which were well-researched, suspenseful, full of 3-dimensional characters and believable -- if a bit apocalyptic.However, \\"Ignition\\" was just a cheap Hollywood pulp novel -- oversize hero, oversize villains and a plot that seems to be on rails. It was *way* below their potential and I'm sure it'll be a blockbuster movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely horrible","review":"Totally predictable and Totally boring.I made it about halfway through the book and then threw it away.Its typical that holleywood will grab this and make a really bad movie out of a really bad book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!","review":"I picked up this book after reading the Star Wars Jedi Acadamy Trilogy. I didn't like those three, but I hoped the coauthor would help. It didn't. The action was non-stop, of course, but that was the only thing going for it. The characters were awful, the bad guys disgusting. (see the editorial reviews) The ending left me wanting more, kinda like \\"thats it?, that whole book and thats it! \\" I also have to comment on the extent of iceberg's injuries toward the end. I find it hard to believe someone that badly injured could continue to function. My advice is, stay away, at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrendous","review":"This book was extremely badly written. The characters all have a big ego and the worst dialogue. The plot seems interesting at first but becomes an even-worse-than-B-movie plot. I hoped it would be good because I'm a huge K.J. Anderson fan but this was horrible (right next to Ai! Pedrito!). Hopefully both of these terrible novels were because Anderson wasn't working alone.Instead I highly recommend Hopscotch and Captain Nemo, both by Anderson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, Slow Paced, Predictable","review":"I have been a fan of Anderson and Beason for a few years. However, even a fan of the two could not excuse this piece of garbage masquerading as a book. The story was difficult to believe. The Vilians were inept and incompetent. It was more a matter of watching the terrorists kill each other off. The characters were cookie-cutter, cardboard, one-dimensional characters with no depth and histories so laughable to almost make this story a comedy. Finally in what can only be loosely termed a closing the author waxes nostalgic and tries to stir up emotion for the space program with the most rambling and incoherent arguments this reader has ever heard. All I can say to anybody looking to read a good book is look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"A non-stop action thriller","review":"What was amazing to me about this story was how plausible it was actually made out to be. And to that degree, it is very terrifying at the apparent futility (and I say apparent) at stopping a catastrophy, such as the one Anderson and Beason propose. There are certainly enough smart crazies out there who just might have a warped sense of \\"logic\\" that only by destroying a space shuttle can public interest be swayed to take the space program to a level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly enjoyable \\"Die Hard\\" formula","review":"I agree with another reviewer that when I got into this book, I could easily see Bruce Willis taking another stab at the \\"Die Hard\\" formula in this one--but getting it right again (after that third movie flopped). One man against an army of terrorists who hold several hostages, including the man's love interest...sound familiar? Well, it works anyway. This is a fast-paced book that never really slows down once it gets started. Its breathless pace will keep your interest until the end. No, there aren't many surprises here, but the fact that the hero has a broken foot is an interesting twist.There are a few \\"Oh, come on\\" moments in here where the hero ignores the obvious solution to a problem and goes for the grand-stand play, but if you can overlook those, you get a great story. Despite its weak points, this is an interesting story and worth the time to read it. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting story - fast paced continiuous action","review":"This is a book with action on every page. I couldn't put it down and was forced to stay up late to finish it. The only weakness is that the lead character's broken foot would not permit him to do the things he does. But that aside, the story is exciting, the reading is easy, and this is definitely a book to read and enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Die Hard Lite","review":"Not his best writing to date. I would equate the story as a \\"Die Hard Lite.\\" Half the action and suspense without all the calories. I found the villian to be a regurtitated Hans-like villian ala Die Hard, with all the gun toting half-cocked henchmen in tow. The plot was intriguing in holding the astronauts and space shuttle hostage. The story fails in a predictable plot, a improbable hero, and tired ending. I'd recommend this book for beach reading only."},{"rating":"2","title":"Implausable plot but a great read.

I have a ... little Eureka \\"Mighty Mite\\" compact vacuum, and its tools are actually more substantial than the supposedly \\"industrial grade\\" Fein products. Ultimately I imagine these accessories will work fine, but I am actually amazed at the high price relative to what is provided. ... Final complaint - I really can't imagine that anyone who orders the Fein vacuum cleaner wouldn't want the tools - they should come with the machine. Separating them out seems to be a way of keeping the machine's cost down - ultimately an artificial savings."},{"rating":"2","title":"does the job","review":"I am a contractor doing mostly interior work.

I'm mostly a finger picker on 5-string and guitar, so I don't have the most reliable grip for strumming. I thought this pick would give me the confidence to wail on the tenor banjo without worrying that my pick would go flying (again). But the flimsy loop, pick angle and overall dimensions just don't work. I tried putting the loop on different fingers, putting the pick on upside-down and twisting it to reduce the length, even putting the loop on my thumb.

The body is so long that it forces you to hold the pick improperly. This is fine if you only want to play songs that simply require strumming every string and that only contain chords, but if you want to play anything that requires even the most basic single string picking you will be fumbling a lot by using this pick.

The pick looked really crappy and did not feel like it was different from regular picks. It had some stain on the rubber part and it looked disgusting. If you think this pick will help you improve your skills of using pick, you would be wrong. If you keep practicing, this pick would be useless.Also, when I asked for refund, I got rejected because they said the pick was not defective.

It's disappointing therefore to see him in an amateur production like this-he deserves better. In addition to very obvious poor quality it is clear that this video was produced by people who know nothing about karate as the kata are full of mistakes. The sound of traffic in the background combined with a static consumer quality video camera were probably acceptable in the 1960s if the action was good, but in 2001, and with poor editing, it is not. Having seen Mr.Ota in action I have to assume that the producers left out the \\"good stuff\\" and omitted to delete the many, many, technical errors this video contains.If you get the opportunity to train with this instructor take it as has real ability, something that his producers were clearly not aware of."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wank fest in your face.","review":"I am a huge Mars fan, but this is just bore.

Here on Scab Dates they take their horrid act on the road where they wow (bore) audiences with endless noodling and incomprehensible dictionary lyrics. I can say that this CD definitely captures their live act, in the same way that the Zapruder film catpures Kennedy's assassination: they both give you a front row seat to something awful that you wish never happened. I once attended one of these musical disasters and after the show, I saw so many people tearing up ticket stubs, I thought I was at an OTB outlet. As someone who was a big At The Drive-In fan, I am still baffled by the loyal following of rabid fans that Mars Volta has developed.

If you are not some of these walls of sound can become a bit tiresome, but when it is what you are trying to hear it does NOT get any better than this. The final part of Cicatriz isn't exactly from a live show but rather was made up of all kinds of bits and pieces of live material until it finally kicks back into the original lines of the song. This isn't a must have cd but if you are a die hard volta fan or just want to hear how they sound in the live format you should def cop this disc.ps...Cedric is in top form and Omar is tighening his claim as the best guitarist on the planet with this album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"I have been a fan of The Mars Volta since I first heard them back in 2003.

I think 'De-Loused in the Comatorium' gave the perfect combination of music, experimental elements and entertainment. I just don't see it as much on this album.

It is not an entire show recorded but rather a mixture of several shows. I wondered how they would translate to a live setting and I am not disappointed with what is on this album. This is not for everyone but if you want to hear something truly mindblowing get this now. This album is a throwback to the live albums of the 70's. Very freeflowing and stretching out in context on the songs. They already recorded long songs for their albums but this shows how well they can stretch out their sound in a live setting.

And at the same time \\"Morning Becomes Electra\\", \\"Porgy and Bess\\", \\"Idiot's Delight\\", and even \\"Oklahoma.\\"The book is broken up into chronological chapters with a few well take pictures distributed throughout.

Vertical bands of interference moved jerkily across the picture.

Looks great too","review":"This is a classic shooter with no visible story. As lots of folks have pointed out, it is amazingly derivative of lots of other games out there. There is a moronic Utopian/Distopian guy talking through it just like Half Life 2. There is time manipulation (really slow motion more than anything else) like FEAR and many others. But in reality, its actually quite a decent shooter.It kind of reminds me of SIN Episodes, in that its not massively original, but its really kind of good actually. Not a classic, but a worthy addition to any collection. Certainly as good as the massively overhyped and under delivered Crysis train wreck.As a couple of other reviewers pointed out, its not worth the premium price. This game is a classic example of great technology and a stupid story with no real objective. The artwork, graphics, movement, AI and general gameplay are all quite good. But unfortunately, its wasted on a non story that doesn't go anywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time to step away","review":"The Graphics are very good. Sound is Ok and the controls are fine but the game play is too linear and uninspired. Maybe it was designed by commitee. Another bad point is the plagiarism of another game. After about 30 minutes of play I realized this game is very much like parts of Half-Life 2, only not as interesting. The voice of the propogandist even sounds like the one in HL 2. The time shift properties add some interest, but, overall it is a rather insipid game. The game designers need to make the stories interesting, to draw you in so you care about the characters and what happens. If you have not played very many 1st person shooters it will be fine, otherwise it's \\"been there done that\\".

It has a volume switch if you don't like the loud music but he just loves it. Plus it is so easy to fold up and take with you to Grandma's! I highly recommed this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for baby! Break for mom!","review":"This is great for the baby who is bored of the bouncer and wants to be \\"independent\\". My daughter loved looking at all the colorful toys and the music is so fun! It was such a relief to have some time to just enjoy watching her having fun and give me a break from carrying her. The only reason she is no longer in it is because she is too big, but now she stands in front of it and pushes it up and down to hear the music and watch the lights."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for skinny kids - Step & Play Piano is MUCH better","review":"My daughter gets bored with this very quickly. She much prefers her Step & Play Piano where she can actually move around and it has more toys. Also, she is a skinny kid and it's still hard to get her out of the toy. She sits down very low and the space between the back of the seat and the tray is VERY narrow. The only toy she really likes is the bar with the plastic toys. The rest doesn't do very much. Cute toy as an alternate for grandma's house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Choking Hazard","review":"We were very excited about this product to entertain our 5 month old who just can't stand to be laying down anymore. It was an easy toy to put together and the first couple of uses were fine. BUT-- somehow my 5 month old daughter managed to get the teething toy from the side out of the hole and choked on the stick part. I have no idea how she got it out... we checked all the others and checked to see how easy it is to take those out... it wasn't easy for us. But somehow our 5 month old got it out. We will return this product and get one that has toys built in. A little too scary!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute!","review":"My baby is still to little to really enjoy this toy yet but when we do sit her in there for a couple of minutes she tries to \\"catch\\" the lights. I know when she gets big enough to make it hop n pop she will love it! It's very cute and colorful. I love the fact that it's not tremendous like the regular exersaucers (which take up too much space)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product...Worth the $$$$","review":"I love this product, by daughter started using this when she was 4months old.She loved this the from the very first time.She likes the toys, music & lights.I dont find the music too lound, you can adjust the volume if it bothers you.Its small & doesn't take up too much space not like the jumperoo.I like the fact that its easy to carry, I can bring it to another room without folding it.It keeps her occupied for a while I do some of the chores around the house.I highly recommend this.I haven't seen this in any baby magazine.They don't advertise this as much as the jumperoo, I wish they will."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caution","review":"I suggest using this with caution. My daughter did enjoy it however, it can be dangerous if you have other children. My five year old pushed down on it while the baby was in it and hurt her legs. Thankfully, she was ok but I could easily see a babies legs being broken if a younger sibling trys pushing it down, which they all like to do as it makes the balls inside pop up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Toy","review":"I bought this toy as something to bring with my husband and me to the bowling alley once a week. My daughter loves this toy. I can put her in it and keep her entertained for the couple of hours we are there. She loves playing with all the toys on it and loves the teether. There are times I will let her play with it during the week since she really likes it. I like it because it so easy to fold up and go. It's easy to clean too. Definitely, worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seat Size","review":"I really liked this product for my 4 mo. old son, the only problem is the diameter of the seat opening, it is not very big and he will not fit in it soon. (My son is in the 25% - 50% range for his age, not on the big side by any means!!) If the seat diameter was even 2\\" wider, this would be a much better product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great baby item","review":"This toy is fantastic. We bought it for our daughter when she was 5 months old. In the beginning we bought it to help her strengthen her neck muscles. And now it is helping her to support her own weight while standing up. She loves being in her Hop and Pop, and she hasn't even discovered the concept of bouncing in it yet. I especially love how light it is, and how easy it is to fold down. I even brought it with me when I flew to Fl. My older niece (14 months) loved to stand on the outside and dance to the music.I live in a small house, and have bought all Fisher Price travel toys. It allows me to save space and to easily take them from room to room."},{"rating":"2","title":"Downright catchy","review":"Darren Buck's vocal presence on this, Seismic's debut album, is overpowering. A roaring but emotional voice, like Black Crowes singer Chris Robinson, he drives the intensity and passion of this fine record.One of these tracks, Under A Kiss, wins the title of best song. A soaring rock anthem about lost love and innocence. It's powerful stuff. \`Roses Never Die', the obligatory ballad, is great, too, and is destined for a video shot in a lighter-filled arena.The musical delivery here is way above par and the songs are catchy. What sets it apart from the countless, increasingly faceless indie rock bands, however, is the strong songwriting and melodic intensity. These tunes are downright catchy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Potential for greatness!","review":"Seismic are a band with potential for greatness. This is clearly demonstrated by their debut, Man From Space. It is full of sing-a-long rocky anthems ('Under a Kiss', 'Top of the World', \`Fine Kinda Lover') and has a few good emotional tracks (\`Backbreaker', \`Roses Never Die', 'Ocean View'). Lead singer Darren Buck has a powerful but very emotional voice - which is best heard on the last acoustic track (\`Ocean View')...my favorite! These guys can certainly write one hell of a tune. I'm looking forward to hearing more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not like this","review":"This video was nothing that I thought it would be. Wish I could get my money back for this. Hated it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get over it orphans","review":"This documentary is all about whining about some past glory and not having the fortitude to move on and make something of yourself. Do they honestly expect people to feel sorry for them for being on Broadway as a child. How I would have loved such a hard life! Please! And their biggest injury: watching gay people kiss. The horror! How deeply offensive. There were quite a few Annies that seem to have weathered this trauma just fine. Its a good example of different types of people; some who do indeed look to tomorrow and are happy with what life has given them, and some who choose to dwell on yesterday and create some mystical drama as an excuse for being the miserable adult they are now. Listen to the words of the songs in this beautiful musical orphans!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Won't be sorry you bought this.....","review":"...More closer examination of what goes into the art of caricatures, and such of equal value to other arts.BUY this and you will add to a repetore of books that are of great and easy to read and follow for the comic arts persuation."},{"rating":"2","title":"MUST HAVE!","review":"For any aspiring caricaturist, this book is a must-have. It not only was the first of it's kind, but it covers the basics as well as many of the finer points of caricaturing, using both theory and specific examples."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think a lot of people will be dissapointed","review":"This book is a dissapointment. All it tells you to do is picture a perfect face in your mind with all of the facial features the perfect size. Look at the face that you're drawing and if he/she has any facial features that are too big, you make them even bigger and if he/she has any facial features too small, then you make them even smaller. Only true beginners will benefit at all from the information stated in this book. It never tought me how to draw caricatures like the ones I see people draw at amuesment parks or the ones I see in MAD magazine. The author doesn't have the same drawing style as them. It only told me the very very basics of caricaturing, which I already knew. If I were you I wouldn't buy this book, you can learn just as much by looking at how Tom Richmond and Chris Rommel draw their caricatures at tomrichmond.com and chrisrommel.com."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kubaton certified, but not by this guy...","review":"I recently finished an official Kubaton course. That is NOT what this tape is about. The author teaches the student a few simple flail techniques and strikes and that is all. None of Kubota's really good techniques for this defensive tool are demonstrated on this tape. In fact, the author spends a considerable ammount of time on this tape trying to convince a Canadian audience (and he clearly states that is who he is addressing his comments to) that they actually do have a right to defend themselves against violent criminal attack under Canadian law, and that it is moral for them to actually do so. WHAT A JOKE! I would sell my used tape on ebay or something but my conscience will not allow it. This one goes straight into the trash!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not useful anymore.","review":"I picked this up so that I could charge my iPod while using it with a portable amp. This was fine for that at first, but now that all iPods can only be charged via USB, this adapter's firewire port is pretty useless. Once I got a new iPod with video, I needed a new portable dock.Even if you still use an older firewire connecting iPod, there are some smaller models that do exactly what this one can do, but are about the size of a quarter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated on Planet Earth","review":"By noticing the contemporaries of this band, (like the Ducky Boys, Blanks 77, August Spies, etc,) one might easily think they are just another oi or streetpunk band, but that couldn't be further from the truth. Ping Pong's vocals are slightly reminiscent of Johnny Rotten or Jello Biafra, but any other comparisons stop there. These guys and gal made some of the best, most energetic and fun punk rock of the late 90s, with lyrics that will make you scratch your head and start looking up random and obscure pop culture and historical figures on Wikipedia. I'm not sure what planet the previous reviewer is on where everyone likes the Showcase Showdown, because on the one I'm on, they are one of the most overlooked and underrated punk bands of the past 10 years. This record and \\"Appetite for Kings\\" are classics in my book."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a heap of stinking offal","review":"Every one seems to love the showcase showdown, and lots of people say it's original.....lets face it it's just a poor sex pistols imitation. if your gonna buy an album buy the sex pistols never mind the bollocks least that \\"WAS\\" original, don't bother with this heap of crap"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hampster Mansion review","review":"I ordered this product after my hampster finally chewed through one of the metal bars on her small cage. I acquired this cage and hampster from a friend. The next cage, I wanted it to be bigger and more room for her to run around and explore. I found this on Amazon and thought it was reasonably priced and figured I would give it a try. It arrived in a timely manner. It took my hampster a couple days to get aquanited to her new home but she loves it now.The only negative is it is a bear to put together. Not the cage itself, but the tunnels she climbs through. I finally ended up taping them together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning Do not buy","review":"We had a hamster in this cage for six months. First the tubes are impossible to keep together, they fell apart constantly. Secondly the wheel was not large enough for the bigger Syrian Hamsters. Lastly, and most unfortunately our Hamster Nemo was able to chew thru the plastic corners that kept the cage together. He did this in one night!!!! Sadly he did not survive his night out, we found him half alive from his fall. I would not purchase this cage, but would suggest one that is put together with interlocking metal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Cool Remixes","review":"Here is Geri's second UK Single and her very first solo number one! There's a reason for that, you know?Mi Chico Latino is the latin-flavored track that you can't help but sing along to, and is so catchy, that after awhile, you realize you've even gotten the latin rap part down.The Junior Vasquez Mix is very cool and dancey. The only downside is, it's only the 6-minute version and not the full 9-minute remix. But it is still very cool and danceable. The best mix on the CD.The Charlie Rapino 12\\" Mix may well be the worst Geri remix yet. It's very motonous, boring, and it's very poorly edited. Geri should have definitely left this one on the shelves (and perhaps put the 9-minute Jr. Mix, eh?)The CoCo Club Mix is very cool and tropical feeling. It starts off with lusty moans, and Geri's sizzling vocals only intensify this hot remix. Only second best to the Junior mix, but has a totally different feeling all its own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong fitment info","review":"Claim to fit a 97 Accord EX sedan but be careful it doesn't.

First off, it is erronously advertised: it is nowhere in the ballpark of being the complete works of Maupassant; it is a 220 page text (extra large print) of some of Maupassant's more mediocre short stories, like \\"Ugly\\" or \\"An Artist's Wife.\\" Secondly, the translation is poor: 'Victorianized' for turn-of-the-century bourgeoisie, it reads nothing like Maupassant, and the power of his naturalist prose is all but obliterated.My advice: stick to the French, or find a newer edition/ translation."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT The Complete Works","review":"The title of this book is very misleading; it is not \\"the complete works\\".

In fact, he is one of my favorite writers. The reason I gave this only two stars is because of how misleading the title is. When I see the word complete, I expect it to mean that all of his stories are included. There are only 29 stories in this book. Two of my favorites aren't even included--The Necklace, Bellflower. If you want a book that includes all of his stories, as I did, I suggest you look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Complete Works of Guy Maupaussant","review":"As other reviewers noted before I bought the book.

The very first time I used it in water it rusted and stained a brand new stainless steel pot I had just purchased for $100. It is cheap pot metal which is not designed to be used with water or with steam. It rusted so fast it seemed almost magical.An important note:The company selling this rack through Amazon on this page at time of posting (MV Trading Co.) does not back up its sales. They simply say \\"we never said it was stainless\\" as if selling a steamer which can't be used as a steamer is excusable if you don't explicitly claim it won't rust out the very first time you use it. This company is highly unprofessional in my experience and I would recommend avoiding them at all costs.Post note/update- I see that the company no longer describes this item as a \\"steamer rack\\" in the header, but rather a cooling rack.

The introduction to the material is very unorganized, unplanned and difficult to follow. He is constantly going off track.The shooting is all done inside a small space with no variety. There are no graphical aids or close ups. Much of the fighting is shown from the side, so you can't see what's happening very well.

With these innocent mistakes, I'd have expected something more along the lines of \\"Whoa--careful!\\" and/or oops--sorry! instead of the harsh/grabby reactions. The hippo looks a lot like an older Helen or Helen's Mom, making it even more uncharacteristic. If I'd have browsed this in a bookstore, I would not have purchased it.

The organization of the book is by topic, which ends up with the author running frequently from the 1950s to the present without segue and with lots of repeated information. It also doesn't help that the author often stereotypes the music in the same ways that the censors did; labeling Slayer's \\"Angel of Death\\" as a bona-fide ode to the devil is a wildly inaccurate misinterpretation (the song is actually about Josef Mengele's human experimentation at Auschwitz).

We figured it would be a lot more fun once we educated ourselves with the resources provided. We spent hours pouring through the game tutorials and manual.

Maxis as certainly advanced a lot in this version of the game. Lots more to take care of like garbage and high schools, but what I love working with the most is designing an efficient transit system, now with separate rails, subways, and monorails, plus a plethora of other options. And instead of in the previous game aiming for a general residential-goes-to-industrial/commercial route for mass transit, you can actually see where individual Sims live and work and make the best routes. My only complaint is it's sometimes a huge pain to actually lay out some transit elements like rail and highway. Messages like \\"this terrain is not valid\\" aren't too helpful in figuring out an alternate way. However, I would recommend this game to anyone who has thought \\"they should make a subway that goes like this...\\" or \\"why do they need a landfill here\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"good game","review":"This is a good game, but I wish I had bought the original version. It was easier to follow. I liked it better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crashes alot","review":"This game is pretty fun! I feel like trying to keep commute times down is very difficult without going over budget all the time. But that could be because i'm not very good at the game. Besides that, I think is very fun! Also, it crashes all the time! In addition, it doesn't have an autosave feature. So you often lose alot of the work you've done. But after reading up, it could be because all I have is a laptop and since it runs heavy on the CPU, it closes the program to prevent over heating. But over-all, a good game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hours of Fun","review":"i cant get enough, with the downloadable addons and regions you will have fun for days to come"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Product Key","review":"My game came without the product code required for activation.

This game nags you from the minute you make your first move all the way to the last. Many times there urgent advice is not even accurate, just a way to get you to lose the game.

I normally trust EAGames but this was disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"hours of fun","review":"This game is so addicting and fun, the best thing to do is naming streets and roads and naming neighborhoods and districts.

You also have to pay more attention to the coverage of fire stations, police stations, hospitals, schools, and so on. Interacting with your neighbors has gotten much more important as well.But it is still a very fun game, and I recommend it to any Sim City fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the BEST GAMES","review":"OK, let's put it straight. This game is very organized. It contains lots of options for transportaion and civic structures. The graphics are pretty darn good and the sound is mildly decent. But then there are the downs. It may get a bit sluggish when the city is VERY BIG!!! So, this game is still very good.p.s.

I read all these reviews on it and saw alot of good reviews on it,so I decided to buy it.And I'm wondering what do people see in this game? I must be missing something if people says it's that good.Maybe I have to get in to it a little more and play it more or something.

I kept on reading reviews that either said it didn't or didn't mention Windows 7. So, I took the risk and tried it and have no issues. I bought it as a download from Amazon and I have Windows 7 64 bit. The game itself isn't bad. I just wanted a simple game for my new computer.So, if you're worried it won't work with Windows 7 64 bit, don't because it will. I didn't even have to use compatibility mode or anything. The main reason I wrote this review was just to state that, because I almost didn't buy the game because I didn't think it was compatible.If you still have doubts, check out Microsofts website website which confirms its compatible:[...]Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought the download and can't play it without the disc","review":"I bought the download.

So I recently got the itch to play some Sim City again, and Amazon delivered. I read all the negative reviews saying it didn't work and it would crash all the time randomly. Well I had exactly zero problems installing it, and it hasn't crashed once.Whoever is having problems either did something wrong, or their computer sucks and shouldn't be running it anyway.

I bought Sim City 2000 and enjoyed it fairly well, even though it too was too difficult. This game is worse than Sim City 2000 because the land is far too small. The night and day stuff isn't all that great. Also, though the game did work on my computer, I hear it doesn't work on many machines.

There are a few changes that could be made to make it more play-able. Such as, how about an elevated avenue crossing for inter-sataes and rail lines. A move-able camera view to see the stuff behind other graphics. More than one city in a LARGE zone would be cool too. A \\"ghost\\" rendering of adjacent zones would be nice too, to allow accurate matching of rail and hi ways.Alot of people think that the inter-face isn't right. It isn't \\"intuitive\\" enough. Heck, most of the fun is figuring out how to do something.After playing the game for two days straight, I came away with a new and thorough understanding of just how difficult it is to manage a city effectively. It even changed some of my feelings toward the mayor of my real life home city."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loads of fun!","review":"This is my first experience with Sim City. I've never played with the earlier versions. Important Note: The computer prompts you to type in the code that is in the white box in the lower left part of back of the CD case. Well, I looked and looked, and it wasn't where the prompt said it would be. After five minutes of thinking my eyes were playing tricks on me, I finally found the code. It's on the back of the owners manual located inside the CD case. You'll find it at the very top of that back cover of the manual, not in the lower left corner.The tutorials are helpful, so if you're new to all of this I highly recommend you go through those first. And if you feel you need to go through them again, you can reset the tutorials to start fresh all over.I'll built a small city, and I've only had this game for a day, but I know I'm going to love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great game for creative people!!","review":"SimCity 4 is a terrific and fun game. Build banks, airports, and anything else you can think of. There is also a god mode, where you can create the environment, or set things on fire, or other natural disasters. Managing the economy is a bit complicated, but if you manage it right, you would be suprised what you can do! Overall, this is a great game!!Note:don't take out a loan every time you need money, or you will go bankrupt in about 10 minutes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An very addictive and fun game","review":"This game is great, you'll have hours of fun building cities and connecting them, people will go from one city to another, and there's a great level of control over traffic systems, you can see where people are going and build systems that take them there, no more guessing. My only complain is that sometimes the game crashes to the desktop for some unknown reason, other than that its a great game, I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too complicated","review":"I have been a fan of this series since the original SimCity for the MAC. Unfortunately, I think they have finally taken the simulation too far in terms of complexity. The beauty of the game used to be that you could jump right in and build cities and learn as you go. Some cities flourished shile others failed. But it was fairly easy to learn from your mistakes and improve your ability to build successful cities. The new simulation is so confusing that you have to complete all the tutorials to even have a basic understanding of where to start. I don't want to be a real mayor and I'm not creating a real city so I liked this game much better when it was a little more simplistic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simcity fan","review":"As a fan of the series I am pleased to have this one back and able to play while the new version is set to come out February.

She thoroughly discusses ways to release your life to God and follow His will instead of your own understanding and desires. Ultimately, this book can guide you to peace in your life, in addition to many other things that are mentioned in the book.

And these were always my favorites anyway. Billie called Lester \\"Prez\\" - President of Saxophone - because she loved his playing.This is a different Billie than the Billie on the 50's Verve recordings. Even when she sings a sad ballad, she seems sassy, chipper and somewhat upbeat. A twinkle in the eye. These are classic performances.The recording, well, what can you expect from the 30's? Probably mastered on shellac 78 records, not tape. Adds to the charm. This is about as good a transfer as you can get from this source.Good price.Of the two in this series, vol 1 has the better songs, I think, but this is worth having also."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful workout","review":"I have a fair number of Ana and Ravi's DVDs (as do most reviewers, I noticed) and this one (along with Solar Power) became an instant favorite!This workout has a lot of variety in the poses and also because it works on your energy on multiple levels, not just the physical.

One of those exercises goes on for 10 minutes so there really aren't that many different exercises. If you want a good workout, I would go with their Fat Free Yoga or Brian Kest's Power Yoga instead.

For those of you familiar with Ana & Ravis workouts - the style of the exercises are more like their older stuff which I love and the style of music is exactly right too!

This is an overly commercialized dvd. Ravi talks as though he is talking to a 5 yr old! I felt like this was Kundalini time on Sesame Street! The matrix does not work, the music is horrid. Ana looks so incredibly fake doing the exercises. Sacred Kriyas have been reduced to kindergarten style songs. Kundalini yoga is a VERY serious ancient practice and nothing to trivialized for profit as Ravi and Ana have done. Do yourself a favor.

The yoga is different than a lot of other DVDs I've done and because of that, I am never bored with it. I now have a few of their programs and Transformer is a favorite. No matter how down I feel, I am up when I am finished! Over time it feels like this workout is actually changing my cells and brain matter. LOL, but it's true! What I like is the way they don't talk for hours before you are actually doing anything. You get right to moving and you do move! I actually sweated doing this. It starts with standing horse stance arm moves. It also has some ab work and all the other workout must haves. Overall this feels very cardio like their other workouts. Like I said, this isn't like the traditional yoga where you are holding poses. You are moving and breathing. Ravi & Ana bring such warm and fun energy to their DVDs that you want to do the workouts over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maxtor Shared Drive","review":"This unit has been flawless!

I enjoyed the book from cover to cover and found the individual examples amusing.

If you've been awake and breathing recently, you know that the entertainment component of almost anything is becoming increasingly important. Providing an experience, as opposed to simply a product is becoming more important. A hit movie can open the doors to sell complimentary merchandise, which may end up being more lucrative than the movie itself. OK, so why does it take 300 pages to explain this? It doesn't, just read the reviews people have written, and keep you eyes open when you go out in the world.So much sizzle surrounding this book, from the glittery cover to Judy McGrath at MTV..\\"I laughed, I cried, I took notes\\" Come on, get real, a box of Kleenex would be a better investment!

However, the book consists, almost entirely, of a sequence of lengthy and detailed paedophile fantasies.

In my opinion, Brian Jacques is a much more interactive author, who really draws you in, almost instantaneously. You quickly become attached to his characters, and keep reading to satisfy your curiosity as to what will happen next. The description of the settings in Mattimeo is brilliant, and the mysteriousness of the villain's schemes are slowly revealed as the plot thickens. The scene of the last battle was a stroke of genius. It was amazing how Jacques' was able to smoothly and effortlessly, incorporate parts from the other Redwall books into this one.

In this book (if you have read Redwall) you would have never guessed that Slager is...(I'll save the suprise) or why he wears the silk mask."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful and enriching book!","review":"I think that Mattimeo is a wonderful book. It showed much more though than the previous book, Redwall. Brian Jaques distinguised each character very well. It is a long book, but, worth reading. It' s the kind of book where you read it all the way through and get something out of it, or don't read it and miss a great book. So, read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish he did this more often","review":"Brian Jacques is one of those writers who came out with a break through that hadnt really been done since C.S.Lewis wrote the Chronichals af Narnia. I think this was Brian JAcques last great book until he wrote Marlfox, i say this because i believe books 4-10 sort of had the same plot repeated over and over again. I have the entire Redwall collection in first edition releases and have read each several times.I think Brian Jacques should be very happy with this book and this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anthropomorphic Story, Bryan Jacques","review":"I read Mattimeo by Brian Jacques. This anthropomorphic story was about a fox, who is a kidnapper, and he kidnapped some little animals, including the warrior of Redwall's son. He made them into slaves, and took them to a place called Malkariss, and set them to work on a statue. Meanwhile, some rescuers from Redwall come to rescue them and are successful. At Redwall, some birds attack the Redwallers, but they are beaten back. Then the rescuers return. One is the hero of the story, the warrior of Redwall, Matthias. Everyone at Redwall has a big feast and everyone exchanges tales.I recommend this book for anyone who likes fast-paced, exciting, and suspensful books, like in the part where Matthias and his friends are fighting all of the rats.I thought Matthias was cool because he used a sword, unlike his five friends, and with them, defeated seven hundred rats."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just for Children!","review":"What a fabulous read! Actually, all the Redwall books had me gasping for more. Once you start, it's impossible to stop reading them, and they just get better and better. Mattimeo in itself was one of the best in the series. It had all the right ingredients which make the Redwall books so enjoyable; good company, good food, comradeship, love, honour and high excitement.The Redwall series is unmissable, for all age groups. I'm 24 and I'm addicted!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent service","review":"This book arrived before it was scheduled and in excellent condition.

It was just what i would have expected from the sequel of Redwall. If you liked Redwall then you will definatlly love this book. The reason that I gave this book 4 stars was because the ending was lacking a few things. It just didn't seem like it was over."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT! 10/10!","review":"This is either the best or the second best Redwall book. It's the direct sequel to the Original Redwall, so there will be a lot of familier characters.

It shows Mattimeo goes from a troublemaker to a warrior. Slagar the Cruel manages to capture the young ones of redwall. So the kid have their own adventure, while other Redwallers search for them on their own unique quest. Also, follow how General Ironbeak tries to kill the sparrows and take over Redwall. GREAT BOOK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like fantasy thrillers, this book is for you!","review":"One of the earlier additions to the Redwall series, Mattimeo, by Brian Jacques is a great book for both fantasy and action readers. When Mattimeo, the Abbey Warrior's son, along with other creatures is kidnapped, a hunt for both captives and capturers alike turn this novel into a non-stop thrill ride. This book kept me interested for almost the entire story. I recommend this book to anyone looking for an interesting and action packed book that will keep you on the edge of your seat!

( Though seeing the animals who were quite young in the previous book having children was quite awkward at first )This story is exellent and I rate it accordingly.Few things can happen to Redwall that is worst than this. First, The young ones are stolen from the Abbey, And when Matthias, Jess and Basil, along with some new found friends, whose young ones have also been stolen, are gone, some other uninvited guests visit the Abbey. General Ironbeak and his birds from the Northlands invade Redwall, at the time when most of the fighting beasts are gone searching.

It (the CD) just doesn't make you think. It's backgound music for a bad party where everyone is talking about when they played high school football. Capable, but run of the mill musicianship meets junior high locker room joke lyrics. Of course some of the riffs are catchy, but it all ends up a little vacant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hello 1994!","review":"My friend gave me this CD. She said I would love it.

However, the Buzz Poets do not fit into this category. This CD is just as bad as all of their other ones. The sound quality is also terrible too. Have a sound mind when you listen to this, because it can make someone go crazy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best fictional look into science I've ever seen","review":"Within a page, Allegra Goodman nails the bench scientist world. Within a chapter, she nails the institutional and political carapace around it. Within a section, she has you living with her characters, wondering about them, even gossiping about them with friends who are reading the book. In a world of ambiguities, Goodman shows us a meta-microscopic mirroring between what our cells and selves tell us is right, or legitimate, or relevant. Start to finish, this is a superbly realized book. One or two minor characters get rushed off stage or don't seem fully employed in the novel, but these are minor quibbles. I've sent this book to 4 people already. You just want to press it into someone's hands and get them to enter the world. I bow to you, Allegra Goodman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating read","review":"This is a wonderfully intelligent novel--both intellectually and emotionally--and a fascinating read. Goodman has remarkable insight into human motivations and feelings, and their influence on social transactions. She takes the rarified field of scientific research, and its interplay with media and government, and reduces it to its true human components: need, ambition, idealism, amorality and desire. Her characters come alive on the page; her warm, savvy writing brings scenes to life so you can watch them like a movie as you read. And she illuminates deeply grooved social dynamics between men and women in the workplace and in marriage. This is a masterful work of fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Actually 4 and a half - Highly recommended","review":"I really loved this book. The science / research subject matter was a little off-putting at first (e.g. growing tumors in hairless mice and the \\"sac\\"ing (sacrifice) them when they're no longer needed), but the characters and plot pulled me through. It seemed like the academic culture and dysfunction were pretty right on, and the characters very believable. And there's enough ambiguity as to what's good and who's right to keep you thinking. It's quite a page turner at the end. This is one of the best books I've read in the last year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Subtle moments packed with emotions","review":"Long term business partners, Marion Mendelssohn and Sandy Glass lead the Phillpott institute in Boston. They are always looking for their next source of funding. One of their postdoctoral protégés Cliff Bannaker works to discover the impact of the virus R-7 on tumors in mice. His work allows the Institute to write an article for Nature. Robin Decker one of the postdocs, Cliff's ex-girlfriend, seven years older, doubts his results. She pursues her doubt and finds evidence to support her theory. She unintentionally takes her investigation to the highest government levels. The Institute is rocked by her allegations, and their lives are changed forever. A well-written narrative with memorable characters, that leads to a heart-felt crescendo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story idea, poor execution","review":"I really wanted to like this book. At 150 pages, my usual quitting place if I am not enjoying a book, I still didn't. Yet, I continued on. At 250 pages I felt too far gone to quit. I hoped that somehow the story could be pulled together by the end and that all those pages were not a waste of time. Unfortunately, my hopes were dashed.The story in this book took forever to develop. I absolutely don't care for the characters. Correctly handled, \\"unlikable\\" characters are my favorite to read about. These aren't those kind of characters. I couldn't care less for simpering, self-involved Robin. The development of Cliff's character is flimsy and I find him boring. I believe the general idea for the book had a lot of potential. Unfortunately, Goodman drained the lifeblood out of it by dragging it on and on and on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely furious and totally disappointed. UGH","review":"I cannot believe the \\"universal acclaim\\" this insipid, unbelievable, uninteresting book on scientific morals and ethics received. Perhaps the publishers had a REALLY swanky \\"coming out\\" party for this little number. UGH and double ugh. Obviously it's that or literary judgment has gone by the wayside. I was appalled by the exclamation marks in these paeans of undeserved praise -- since the book is like weak, tepid tea with a bit of mold on the edges. To compare Goodman and this work to Jane Austen is a scandal indeed! The characters are stereotypes of the first water, the events are not believable or so poorly described as to be simply dumb, and the entire production idiotic in the extreme. For SHAME!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If It Only Had a Heart","review":"I read Intuition because it a selection for my book club. Alas, not my cup of tea. I now know a little bit about cancer research, but was unable to connect with any of the characters. Although the plot was totally focused on scientific activities and politics, it was never clear exactly what scientific deception the male lead had committed. Indeed, it was unclear which character was central. When the promising cancer research goes south, all the characters worry about their careers, but not one mentions the cancer patients, present and future, who are the real losers. I would not recommend this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intuition","review":"Allegra Goodman's \\"Intuition\\" is a brilliant book with one of the funniest and most rueful accounts of a person accepting his identity.I have given 5 copies as gifts, and each reader has thanked me."},{"rating":"1","title":"When Did This Take Place?","review":"I read this book in one day when I was sick in bed in Europe and couldn't get anything else in English. I'm not sure I would have finished it otherwise.I was aware of Allegra Goodman's reputation, but was disappointed in the writing and character development. Not bad, but no Jane Austen.For some reason Ms. Goodman chose to avoid all references to pop culture. As a result, there was no way to tell when the story took place. Obviously not in the present---------WHERE ARE THE CELL PHONES?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The mixed fate of those who blow the whistle","review":"The best thing about this book is not the science but the way in which Goodman portrays the human relationships within the laboratory. I've written about and read about whistleblowers in real life, and Goodman's portrayal of Robin rings true. The key moment for her is when she decides to go outside the confines of the lab with her concerns and make a formal report to the NIH. At that point, as the novel makes clear, the issue is no longer the alleged misconduct in the lab but Robin herself. She finds her allies wherever she can, but the establishment closes ranks against her.When a key member of the establishment has second thoughts about Robin, the novel takes yet another turn."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't praise this novel enough.","review":"It captures the atmosphere of bleak desperation I experienced when I did a postdoc in physics. Also, none of the characters are villains. The author makes their motivations real and shows that by acting with the best of intentions they turn the situation into a train wreck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the effort","review":"This book has been on my to-read list for a while now. I finally finished it, and I have to say I was extremely disappointed. The science is ambiguous. There are too many peripheral characters who have no bearing on the plot. Those characters who are central to the plot are not likable in the least. And finally, the motivations of each of the central characters are never truly defined. I still don't know who the real \\"villain\\" in this story was. And if it is who I think it is, then the author did not explain well enough how the science behind it was wrong. Basically, this book was so ambiguous throughout that I'm left unable to make any judgments of my own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Allegra, Awesome!","review":"This is a brilliant work -- it captures the tension between science and reason better than almost any fiction book around.

Honestly?","review":"Once every 10 years I don't finish a book I started. The comparison of the author to Jane Austen made me try to hang in there, but alas, even after 100 pages, I didn't care a whit about a single character (nor whether or not the lab results were accurate or not). Maybe if you are in this world this book will matter to you.

He discusses items as central to his subject as training, motivation, and casualties to those as remote as rituals, use of alcohol, and \\"Dear John\\" letters.

Yes, within two weeks of the first one dying... three of the mega pixels died leaving me with these nasty looking black circles in all of my shots. I sent it back to have it repaired and they told me it would be the same price as buying a new camera. So... after a year of a decent camera, I found it just didn't last for the money. I am back on the market for a new camera. I wouldn't recommend it because of that purpose and the cost of having it repaired after a year when it could also break. On the plus side, I loved that it was black and could fit in my pocket."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well.........","review":"I don't know why I bought this, I guess it was because I had just gotten my DVD player, so I wanted to build my collection, and this was four movies for 10 bucks, so I said,'Ok, I'll buy it.THEY SUCKED!The only reason I give it two stars instead of one is because of two things:1)Jack The Ripper is good.2)Lots of frontal nudity.Otherwise, don't buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Dr. Ice cuts off close to the end of the movie.

We had to find extra copies because it means \\"Christmas is here,\\" to us. The mellow cool of Johnny's voice, with the lush orchestration and measured pace speak of a simpler time, before sentiment was considered in bad taste or cynicism had grown such deep post-modern roots. Recover your Christmas innocence and intensity! It's a five star experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Christmas Wish","review":"I wish that just once I could go through the entire Christmas Season without hearing this effeminate little toad gargling his way through one classic Christmas song after another. Maybe it is because I love Christmas music so much that makes me hate Johnny Mathis so much. What ever happened to \\"What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas\\"? Johnny Mathis could only have made it in Vegas and I wish they'd keep him their little secret. Johnny Mathis is such a narcissist that on his album, his name printed larger than the title. When I saw that nobody had given him a one star review I knew it was my duty to point out that only women and neutered men would willingly listen to Johnny Mathis singing Christmas Music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Learn to pronounce your continents dude...","review":"This dude only knows how to sing vowles, here's my impression of him singing misty \\"ooo aaaa eeee, III aaa hhelleee aaa a iiieee uuu aa eee\\" translation \\"look at me I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree\\". If you like a singer to sound as though his mouth were full of something, and singing chritsmas songs go ahead and buy it, but he's too hard for me to understand any of his words, he needs diction lessons, he's got a speaking imparment. Too bad these are nice arrangemets(the only reason it got two stars, and for the great songs selection). This cd as is true wit hall mathis cd's has great camp value, his music is so campy, it's so bad it's almost good (another reason for the 2 stars instead of one).

I remember growing up and listening to his rendition of \\"What Child is This?\\" on a Canadian compilation produced by the once-mighty Eaton's stores. I always liked it, but when I heard his performances of \\"Sleigh Ride,\\" \\"Winter Wonderland,\\" and \\"I'll Be Home for Christmas,\\" I knew this would be a winner. His rendition of \\"Silent Night\\" may be the best I've ever heard from any pop singer. What makes this collection great is that it draws on romance (of course), but more importantly, from gospel influences.

As an elementary teacher, I would recommend this toy to anyone. Students act out different scenarios and can then write them down.

The universal bracket was not tall enough to screw into the back of the speaker. I had to flatten another universal bracket that the stands came with, and bolt it to the other bracket to make it tall enough. It worked fine but I think Sanus should include taller brackets for taller speakers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good purchase for the price","review":"This is my 3rd pair of stands for my Onkyo speakers so I can now position all 6 of them perfectly. They are not as stable on the stand as I would like, as no adapter fit, but I cannot argue with the price. 3 of them are hidden behind my screen, so no chance of people walking into them, and the others are in the corners in the back of the room.Solid, lots of adapters to fit many different types of speakers (just not mine). I do have to note, they have some weight to them which I like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Satellite Stands","review":"These were easy to assemble & came with plenty of mounting hardware for speaker configuration. These were also the most rugged stands that I could find for the price. The speakers shouldn't weigh much more than 3 lbs., though it's stated that they'll take a 10lb. speaker, it might be a stretch. They come with spikes for leveling & have a channel for running the speaker wire through the post. A thumbscrew at mid post is used for height adjustment. I'm using Polk's BlackStone TL350 & the stand is a good match. If using larger speakers I'd look for something more suited."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple sturdy and flexible stand","review":"I have owned the popular alternative to these Sanus stands, the Atlantic version works but they were not quite a polished as these. The powder coated finish is delicate and can be easily scratched but the units went together quickly and the hidden cord feature really gives you a clean looking result. I used the mounting option pictured but I had to flip the speakers upside down to get the bolt to line up properly. A small compromise but I am pleased with the overall result. I like how you can both rotate and lift the speakers to the perfect spot without needing to move the base at all. The speakers are well supported and the whole arrangement feels very stable. The variety of other mounting brackets mean these stands should fit any speakers I may purchase in the future. Well worth the price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the money","review":"Just a great and good looking stand for the money. I'm using Polk Monitor 30's which are heavy compared to your typical surround speaker but it's holding up perfectly. The only thing I couldn't do was hand tighten the height adjustment screw without having it collapse under the weight of the speakers. I slowly tightened them with a pair of pliers which worked great. I was a little worried about snapping the plastic heads off but it held up just fine. But even if it did snap I'd just use a black metal tapping peanut screw or hex head to secure it, and still might regardless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"I did a lot of research before I got these speaker stands. As it turns out, I have Infinity Modulus surround speakers and I wanted something easily compatible with them. These stands, though they don't mention it, contain something called a Modulus stud that screws into the ball on the bottom of the Modulus speakers. They work really well, though the bases are a little larger than I would have liked to have had. They will definately support a large speaker. The Modulus speakers are about 6 pounds and there was no problems with the weight."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT stands, and not \\"just for the money.\\"","review":"Can't beat them for the money. VERY high quality. Solid and quite heavy. For smaller speakers to be sure. VERY nice looking and VERY easy to assemble. You can't go wrong with these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weight Limit Incorrect","review":"These stands are ok for small speakers (though still sort of bulky and cheap looking). However, the weight limit on the box is listed as 10 pounds, which is simply not the case. We put a 7 pound speaker on the stand and the weight of it bent the metal attachment and sent the whole stand crashing to the ground (luckily we caught the speaker). We set up lighter speakers on these same stands and had no problems, so it seems clear that the weight difference of the speaker caused the different result."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weight limit is VERY optimistic","review":"Fortunately I put a dummy load on these stands before attaching my 8lb speakers. They simply do not hold a weight greater than about 5lbs. Even then, I had to tighten the clamp screws so tight that one of the threads started to strip. That was only by hand! The cost of returning these was around $20, so I have decided to salvage them by designing an alternative clamping system, and using them for another system that has very light speakers (~3lbs)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Stands!!","review":"Can't say enough about how well made these stands are! I was a little worried about their construction and quality when I saw the price, but wow I am impressed. They have a very solid feel to them, much heavier than I expected, they have a ton of different brackets, and the base is very solid and even come with carpet spikes. You won't knock this stand over very easily! Don't spend a ton of money at best buy, spend half as much with these quality stands!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NICE! BUT, DOES NOT FIT ONKYO SPEAKERS!","review":"Bought these for my Onkyo speakers, Would have had to mount them upside down to make them work. But with the included hardware, Managed to make them work after 4 hours of fabricating brackets. Can be mounted upside down, Or you can use the flat bracket, And use double sided tape to stick them to the flat bracket!? I do NOT suggest it. Spend the extra money for the Onkyo speaker stands around 50 bucks a piece. Other than that, these stands are solid heavy duty, All metal stands. But, Make sure they are made for your speaker. Do NOT do what I did! UPDATE 1-6-2013 Do NOT place these in a walkway one bump, And over they go!? Must be the 3 legs makes it unstable!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Crap","review":"DO NOT BUY THESE.The nuts to hold the sliders are too small and the threads stripped. My speakers are now damaged as they came crashing down when the nuts let go. My speakers only weigh 5 lbs each, this is rated for 10 lbs. Most of the screw holes were stripped. Only after permanently securing the 'adjustable \\" part are they usable and no longer adjustable. Not worth the money, time or effort to send back. Very poorly made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slight mis-match with Klipsch Quintet III","review":"I got these stands for my Klipsch Quintet III surrounds. They work well enough, however the slot/holes on the bracket that is designed for these speakers doesn't QUITE line up with both intended bolt holes on the back. I'll have to fix that with my dremmel drill press at some point.The speakers stay in place well enough with just one bolt, but long term I think it would be better to hack the mount plate to work right.Otherwise these are great stands, and come with ample hardware to mount many different kinds of speakers, including a flat platform and sticky tape for \\"book shelf\\" type surrounds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent, but not great for Onkyo speakers","review":"Bought these and returned them. The build quality was decent, but there was no elegant way to secure my Onkyo speakers to them. I understand that it's probably hard to design a stand that's all things to all speakers, but I felt I should say that if you're looking specifically for stands for Onkyo speakers, which have a taller profile than most, you should know that these stands are not for you. Ultimately, I ended up going with the Onkyo AS140s--a bit more expensive, but worth it in my case.As an added note, I wish the Sanus bases had a little more weight to them. They were just a little on the unstable/light side for my taste, but then again this problem may vary by speaker model. In it's defense, I'd say that the provided hardware probably was comprehensive enough to secure just about any type of speaker footprint, but like me, you might find that you aren't fully satisfied with the results. Just my two cents."},{"rating":"2","title":"best of best","review":"That spray is best of best, I bought for my husband, this is his favorite parfume and mine of course too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Smells nice","review":"The cologne smells awesome but doesn't last as long as we would like.

Shirley MacLaine lights up the screen again, playing the role of Aurora Greenway. The movie takes place years after Aurora's daugher has died, and all of the deceased mother's kids have grown up. Growing up hasn't been easy, and the movie focuses on the relationships between family and friends, the good times and the bad times. The movie focuses on rediscovery of life, and finding new purpose for each character. The movie both entertains and tugs at your heart strings with its dramatic plot that will bring tears to your eyes, but also will make you laugh in more comedic scenes.

Kaplan has an eye for detail that can make negotiations and other business meetings come alive.The plot tells the story of a high profile venture in the late 90s, Go Inc., from inspiration through fund raising and product development to fame, near success and ultimate failure. Anyone who may have thought about starting a new venture who wants to sit in the passenger seat and observe the whole ride in detail (though not too much detail -- it's an easy read) will enjoy. I wouldn't say the book is highly educational in a process sense (how to do this, how to do that...), but it does give a lot of high level insight into the difficult tradeoffs and predatory practices that can be confronted in trying to grow a business in high tech.

At other times you really want to know who, what, why something happened and the book completely skips over it leaving you looking back through pages to find where you should have figured things out.

The album starts out almost manic, with the eery yet catchy Mary Mary. It calms down without losing seductive energy. David Bowie really revs me up for my favorite tracks of the album--Identify and Inertia Creeps. Yet I personally think that Afro Celt's mix is the most beautiful and haunting on the album, perhaps because of the soothing feminine vocals.All in all, I think that it is a great album...great for listening to when you want to loosen up, meditate, fantasize, get creeped out, or do anything in the dark with nice accessorized lighting (think christmas lights, candles).

Lots of photographs as well, which I appreciate.The book would have gotten five stars, but I really expected the majority of the recipes to be vegetarian, but only one chapter is devoted to vegetable-only dishes. Although I am not vegetarian, I am working my way toward a vegetable diet and would like help in that regard.But overall I am very glad I bought this book, and what I have made from it so far has been very good. I have found very traditional Indian food to be difficult with a lot of time required for prep.

I was disappointed to find this one is very inferior, at least for my tastes.I felt the original Arabesque struck a perfect balance between loungey electronic chillout music and traditional Arabic instruments and musical styles. Tlata 3, however, veers away from the electronic, dubby elements and focuses on real instruments and singing, which wasn't really what I was looking for when I bought this (I miss the techno!!!) In particular, I found the focus on the male vocals very jarring, and the music sounded overall disjointed and uninteresting to my western ears.To sum up, it's probably a good sampler of traditional Arab music and my inability to appreciate it likely stems from a certain amount of cultural closed-mindedness on my part; my only point is just don't buy this expecting it to be similar to the original Arabesque."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christagau's review informs us","review":"The third ..of Algerian-born London restaurateur Momo's world comps - Maghreb survey, leads with \\"N'Sel Fik,\\" the rai classic Chaba Fadela and Cheb Sahraoui released 20 years ago.

A visually stunning film with an incredible score. We were mesmerized."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Surrealistic Postmodern Journey into a Lyrical Wonderland","review":"The first time I saw this video, I wondered where it was shot, as the film is other-worldly in its scope, its landscapes serene, yet oddly and discomfortingly familiar. Yet on my subsequent viewings, it was obvious that something magical was lurking beneath the surface. From the moment that Odile and Yvette jump out of their psychotic father's car and run through the cornfield in a scene reminiscent of North By Northwest, we know we are in the hands of a master. Director Andre Burke has a true sense of how to create tension in seemingly mundane details with his sparse use of evocative, nondiagetic music and superior shot composition. And only when Odile's secret is revealed do we understand just why she and Yvette are on the lamb in the first place. A must-see for people of all ages, it stands as the new Red Balloon for the Next Generation."},{"rating":"1","title":"odile and yvette at the edge of the world","review":"this movie is confusing and weird! there's no meaning to it! it jumps from one thing to another. when i saw it i really got lost and didn't know what was going on! the people start talking after like....30 mins into the movie! it was lame and dumb! i really didn't like it or understand it! the movie doesn't even tell you the names of the people or who the man was. but they seemed to be running away from him. Sisters Odile and Yvette discover a magical wonderland with the power to make their dreams come true. they don't know if the real world or this magical place is the better one.

I would've loved to see the extra footage, commentaries, etc. from Latifah herself and more actors in the film. This film was heavily promoted in 1996 with material and footage which New Line should've included but didn't. Another criticism is the groundbreaking soundtrack and music videos from the film which was totally disregarded on the bluray. It would've been a treat to feature music videos in HD such as Bone Thugs-n-Harmony's \\"Days of Our Livez\\" and En Vogue's biggest hit with Dawn Robinson \\"Don't Let Go (Love)\\".

Unfortunately he is killed by police who mistake him for a criminal. So, Jada and her cohorts, played by Queen Latifah, Vivica A. Fox and another girl with whom I am unfamiliar, turn to a life of crime robbing banks themselves. Pinkett Smith was not cut out for this life of crime, though, and finds love with a bank employee (Blair Underwood of LA Law and City of Angels fame). However, she finds herself in too deep with her friends and their bank robberies, so they plan one last heist, only to end up in very big trouble.

It really gets the JUNK out!!!!!This tape makes meditation so easy because they give you great instruction, lead you through with timely inspirational advice and they also have beautiful music to move it all along!I thank you raviana, my children thank you, my husband thanks you! xoxoxoxoxoxo"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent choice!","review":"I'll make this review brief because there are plenty of very thorough and great reviews already, but I received my copy a few weeks ago and have been greatly enjoying the mantras and meditations.I really like the extras, the primers and their explanations of each meditation.I found the music to be absolutely wonderful, proving once again that Ravi and Ana have a great ear for music and sound.The only part that didn't quite work for me was the \\"tune in\\" part, the Ong Namo was a bit fast for my taste, and I found the rather loud music distracting, but I do appreciate that they change up their Ong Namo from dvd to dvd, and it wasn't a problem, I just put it on mute for that part.Overall, I gave this 5 stars and highly recommend it to anyone interested in taking their first steps into meditation or looking to deepen their existing practice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great way to get started","review":"I love Ana Brett & Ravi Singh's yoga DVDs so I thought I would try their meditation DVD.

As meditation is an integral part of Kundalini yoga , I would recommend it as an addition to daily workouts -- meditations vary in length of time and focus, and can be designed to suit personal needs using the matrix option which is very useful, depending on time a person has to meditate each day ."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Mood and Look is Distracting & Frustrating!","review":"I have a library full of brown-haired Ana Brett DVD. If you are a die-hard Ana & Ravi fan, you'll know what I mean. I've seen many reviewers make the following remark, and it is still too true: Avoid DVDs with blonde Ana! Whoever they hired to \\"update and glam-up\\" their look and sound did them a huge disservice! With all due respect, what made you different Ravi & Ana, was that you had a simple sound and look; and, you had an understated class and grace! Please, bring it back -- it is your Sat Nam (true you is what it means!). I'm returning this DVD and following my instincts: stick to the brown-haired Ana and all will be well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Displeased","review":"I recently purchased this item along with the Kundalini Yoga for Beginners with the Matrix Menu Option for my brother who has never tried Yoga before. I purchased these two DVD's solely on the reviews from others who seemed very pleased with them. All I can say is that I'm glad I previewed them before giving them to my brother because they were the most bizarre form of yoga I've ever encountered.

I picked up a review copy of The Metaphysics of Nudity at a used bookstore because of the catchy title. Little did I know that the catchy title is really what the novel is about! But it's much more than that. Miller's story is hilarious; his manner is witty; his style and choice of words are clever and precise. The characters are lovable, and the story contains frequent touches of humanity and insightful observations on the contemporary human condition. As if all this isn't enough, the ending is satisfying and uplifting. What a great read! As a newly self-published novelist myself, I am grateful for self-publishing and small independent publishing houses. Without them perfectly good novels like Miller's might never see the light of day. My book (Compared to What: A Novel) is quite different from Miller's, but I hope that its humanity and its characters measure up to his effort in The Metaphysics of Nudity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hunting killer lions isn't much of a story","review":"Why the lions were vicious or strange is never explained.

Fast forward five years, and the inevitable sequel, Happy Feet Two, hit theaters last November. This time around, Mumble is all grown up with a kid of his own, Erik, who refuses to dance like his papa and runs away, only to meet Sven, a unique penguin who can fly. When the entire population of emperor penguins is trapped by an iceberg, Mumble must bring all his friends together to save the day and win back his son's respect. Unfortunately, while the first film was worth watching and took home the Oscar for Best Animated Film, I wasn't too thrilled with Happy Feet Two, its is narrative noisy and incoherent, even if its animation is expectedly top notch.

It's pretty comical that their personal taste goes into a review for a movie for kids. The movie was somewhat well received by critics from what I read. Adults need to check in their expectations for a movie and realize that it's target audience are probably pre-school to elementary kids, NOT ADULTS!!!!Most sequels are not as good as the first (unless you're pixar & KungFu Panda 2) but overall it was an enjoyable movie. My daughters love it, they sing along and dance to it. The Krills do seem disconnected from the overall plot (existentialism in a kids movie?!? a bit over the top). Bill and Will are comic relief and could have been an entire separate plot to itself. The animation is eye-popping, the songs are fun, the baby penguins are cute. But the main fact is kids will enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seen better","review":"I personally didn't find this movie entertaining.

It is hard to see how the subject could be better explained. I thought sometimes explanations were more detailed than necessary, but I found the book masterful and very convincing in showing the pretty steady advance of democratic ideas, even though when it ends in 1861 there are still huge advances to be made in Americah democracy. .After reading this book no one with an open mind can doubt that the Confederacy came into being because the South wanted to keep slavery and the myth of the South wanting 'freedom' is thoroughly shown to be untenable."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST BUY!","review":"This book is 100% real!

It is based on the format of the Harry Potter books and provides the real world equivalent of a Hogwarts education if studied diligently. I have given a copy of this book to each of my grandchildren for their 11th birthdays. They love it. It is a great tool for helping kids learn the difference between the sort of magic practiced in the Wiccan and Neo-Pagan communities and the fictional magic depicted in the Harry Potter Books and movies.

My biggest problems with this book is he makes some blatant errors when it comes to the topic of history and some minor errors in the mythology, especially the Egyptian mythos. I think the author really needs to go back and hit the history books to make sure his timelines and histories are correct, which as the book stands now, they are not. The other major issue I have is his section on Psychic Vampires, it is WAY OFF!!!! Real psychic vampires are not clingy, soul sucking monsters like he describes.

I enjoy complexity, and most importantly, a challenging game. Unlike many other strategy games, this game is a challenge, meaning that I didn't master it in a matter of hours (the demo, that is). furthermore, the \\"Hero\\" (Me) develops over time, so one can't simply finish a set of scenarios and \\"finish the game\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best computer game i have ever played","review":"This game is superb.

Most children's movies and shows are a far cry from anything I'd ever enjoy. This movie, though, has appeal to anyone who's ever been a kid. Adults, teens, and kids can all watch this movie. It's hard to believe Nickelodeon wouldn't do more entertaining things like this film, becuase now all they seem to air are badly made cartoons that kids can enjoy for about two years.

If there is a lesson that could be drawn (which the movie misses), Harriet's secrecy from her parents manages to create a full blown crisis out of nothing, because she is showing the sort of secrecy and evasiveness that (in a kid 2 years older) could be a sign of bad things like drug use, shop lifting, or bulemia, as in the movie \\"Thirteen.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Best movie since land before time part 6!","review":"There are 88 used copies of this movie for sale, starting off at 33 cents.

The combination of excellent screenplay, superb direction, and the typically outstanding Nickelodeon production values make this a must-see for everyone. The viewer's enjoyment is enhanced by the highly talented cast. Michelle Trachtenberg is a marvelous actress who displays both charm and wit in portraying the title character. Of course, another major strength of this wonderful film is the very welcome presence of the wonderful Rosie O'Donnell. With her rare combination of beauty, refinement, and pure talent, she is a charming addition to an already-strong cast.

The steel tubing is very good quality and the welds and connections are all very good as well.

The chapters are concise and easily readable. It took me about two weeks to work through Chapters 1-13 and 19. After that, I knew enough Perl to hack around my Windows NT box.Each chapter ends with a few appropriate exercises. Although the exercises are brief and easily accomplished, they demonstate the important concepts covered in the chapter. After working through the exercises, you will have working examples (that you coded) illustrating common control structures, I/O, regular expression use, file and directory manipulation, and so on. I learn coding best by doing, not by reading. It's only after working through some code that you really will begin to understand how Perl, or any other language, works.I have a handful of Perl books on my shelf, but I use Learning Perl and the Perl Cookbook most often. I hardly ever find myself in the camel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Starter; two tiny problems, not insurmountable","review":"This accessible and practical book can make a Non-Programmer into a Proud CGI Guru, given that the beginner understands some basic logical structures, and is willing to meet the authors halfway.PROBLEM 1: The book assumes a fairly extensive Unix background, so doesn't always explain itself where that's concerned. SOLUTION: Just ignore the bits that don't apply to you and keep going.PROBLEM 2: The first chapter can be intimidating. SOLUTION: Understand it to be an overview: \\"Here's what you can do with perl.\\" Run its programs to see how they work, experiment with them, but don't freak out if you don't understand them completely. Alternately, just skip on to Chapter 2.We enjoyed Learning Perl, and found it a good beginner's book for this language or for programming in general.

Whenever I try to use it as a reference, I end up even more confused then when I started out. I find that I can usually guess the answer to a problem or else just \\"do it like they do it in C\\" rather than trying to find a good example to follow in this book. For example, after reading the section on doing formatted printing statements using \\"fprintf\\" I was thoroughly confused. I tried using the function just like C does and it worked, but I would have spent days trying to figure out the syntax from this book's explaination. I don't know of a better book, but I would suggest you keep looking for something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"This book is typical of O'Reilly books, in that in the first chapter, they attempt to summarize the entire book. For a non-Perl programmer, attempting to learn the language, it will leave you frustrated and confused.

There are clearly better books available for learning Perl, and your money is better spent elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Invaluable for a beginner","review":"If you are starting the perl language you should look no further. Buy this book and read it from cover to cover. When you get to page 100, just before Miscellaneous Control Structures, go ahead and order Programming Perl and Perl Cookbook.

Randal's teaching by building a simple program into a more complex program. For clarity, he simply retains the ugly original code and tacks on new features. It's self evident that the program should be re-written, but to do so at that point in the tutorial would be disruptive.Ten is just the perfect score to accord this classic.This book delivers on what the others promise: Perl in XX Days.

I found the prose easy to read and follow, and the examples illuminating, yet sparse. I would have doubled the number of examples and also questions at the end of each chapter.My method of success was to read the book through, re-reading occasionally for difficult sections. Read the chapters and do the examples.

But I'm skeptical enough (even of my own skepticism) to keep an open mind on these matters. What I was left wondering as I read through this is, why do we need to go through this? What is it that we can't provision with existing tools? What is beneficial about having many ways to do simple things, which only leads to more confusion? Perl code is not easy to read, easy to maintain, nor easy to learn. It all looks a like a regular expression that ate too much spaghetti. Give me a carefully structured language like C, C++ or Java any day. For Unix needs, Bash shell scripts, sed and awk are just fine. Perl is a mess, and this book doesn't make it any clearer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I see a disturbing ternd by O'Reily of pumping out books that are not well done. I consider this a terrible book. Its poorly organized, skips over many important topics, and among the worst books on Perl Ive seen. My gut impression was it took them about a month to write it, just a rush job rip off of programming Perl.A beginner should avoid this book. Learn Perl from another book and use Programming Perl as a reference. The Cookbook is good too.Avoid this book, its a waste of money. Its the worst languages book Ive seen in a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is for people who have NEVER written code","review":"I followed the advice from other reviews and bought the book since I am completely new to Perl. The foreword and the odd attempt at humor are terrible, but that is a small detail. What really bugged me is that the author spends so much time on the simplest stuff. You learn that functions that take arguments can do more interesting stuff than functions with no arguments, and you learn what if/else is about. Wow! For anybody who can understand the following:while (i-->0) array[i] = 1;this book is a waste of time. I did learn about Perl, but it could all have been summed up in 30 pages, not 200+. If you have programmed in C before, go for \\"Programming Perl\\" instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfection","review":"The world of Perl awaits you.

She has been playing with them for years. Well about two years ago we could no longer find them in the pet store, so I went on line. Found your site and ordered 10 bags so we would never run out again. Problem with your product is that it is made with much cheaper products than the ones we used to get. With your toy the squeaker is broken in less than a minute. Sooooooooooooooo disappointing for my dog and myself. She loves to play music for us with her toys and with yours the squeaker is dead before she even gets to start playing. I will continue to order the toys for her as she knows the name of each one and adores them so, but I am also going to work hard at finding her something else of better quality to play with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank You For The Introduction To Mehdi !","review":"I've always enjoyed Mannheim and this album is no exception, but while reading some of the customer recommendations posted on this site I discovered \\"Instrumental Heaven\\" By Mehdi (pronounced meddie).

Also, the 8th track on the album-\\"I'll show you mine\\", the lyric is exactly the same as another song called \\"I see you\\" which is sung by a Australian singer named Peter Andre. I think it's pretty low for a talented group like LFO to copy a foreign singer's lyrics in hoping that noboby would ever find out.

The lyrics in \\"I will show you mine\\" tells of a guy realizing his fantasy of undressing with a girl and having her say \\"I will show you mine, if you show me yours\\" and being naked with each other. While this would normally not even warrant a double take, the idea of my 9-year-old son, who is just becoming interested in girls, listening to some \\"cool guys\\" sing about this hits me the wrong way.

No, I'm not just talking about about \\"summertime girls,\\" although that is certainly one of the more outrageous examples (and I wouldn't be surprised if they chose to promote Abercrombie and Fitch, simply because it rhymes with the name of the singer).

Keaton, Scooby Snacks, Paul Revere, Macaulay Culkin, Abercrombie & Fitch, what kind of s**t is THAT? Well, LFO, if Chinese food really made you sick, how come you have to keep saying it three billion times during the course of the song? I LOVE Chinese food, anyway. And another thing: WHAT THE HELL IS MAURO MALAVASI DOING ON HERE? Relax, he let these guys use a piece of one of his songs on this album. He's Andrea Bocelli's producer.

LFO is a great between R&B and rap. So I suggest you go buy their album. Trust Me you'll be glad you did. Its worth your money"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Nice Job!","review":"I was not entirely convinced that LFO was that different from other boy bands when I heard Summer Girls, but once I heard Girl on TV I realized that they're really not that bad.

It's not the best CD, they're definately NOT the best group in the world, but it's still an entertaining CD worth the price you pay for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"You have got to be kidding me","review":"I have to say that LFO has probably accomplished the impossible.

The face of pop music these days is one of homogonization. I have no clue how people differentiate between NSync, BSB, or now LFO. The lyrics are trite, the harmonies are elementary, and the music is interchangeable from one group to the other. LFO is particularly troublesome because they actually work \\"Abercrombie & Fitch\\" into their lyrics... wake up people.. this is marketing caca, not music. These are bands made up of people capitalizing on their looks, not their talent... and if I were a teenage girl, I'd be insulted that the record labels would think I'm stupid enough not to be able to tell the difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"LFO: Lurid, Filthy, Oppressive","review":"In the subgenre of boy bands, which is not one of music's more well-appreciated genres to begin with, LFO stands as one of the least talented. They aren't the greatest singers, some of the lyrics are among the cheesiest boy-band lyrics ever, and the rapping on many of the songs on this album is simply pathetic. The only reason that it gets 2 stars is because \\"All I Need To Know\\" is, if nothing else, a hummable, melodic song that you can try closing your eyes to and pretending that it's somebody else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lyte Funkie Ones","review":"I remember this album when I was in the 7th grade. I love this album. It is a classic IMO. They had a special hip-hop sound is a fusion of rap, pop and R&B grooves coupled with good time ballads. The album showcased their vocal and songwriting talents which mesh from a rich, unique harmonic blend of pop, hip-hop, rap and R&B. They attracted thousands of fans with their smooth moves and obvious good looks. This album has been certified Platinum. Remember, this was 1999-2000."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!","review":"This band is new but they have came out with a bang. I listen to there songs every day I love their music.

I have known about them for quite some time, so I was pleased when their music was introduced to radio airwaves. Yea so maybe alot of ppl may think that the lyrics are a bit corny...But think about it, they're fun, catchy, and the beats make u wanna get up and dance. Rich is an incredible songwriter, and he's got great rapping capabilities. Devin's velvety smooth voice makes the sound more professional, and Brad's backing vocals blend in wonderfully. On top of the sound, it's upbeat and these guys are always gonna be at the top of my list for talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grow Up.","review":"I'll concede that for 12-year-old girls, there's nothing too wrong with indulging in vapid, vacuous, empty lyrics and laughable ripped-off boy band posturing.

Loaded on cliche hip-hop inuendo and lame brain lines like \\"Michael J Fox was Alex P Keaton\\" and \\"Dooby doo-wop and scooby snacks\\" this record rates as one of the most embarrasing pop concoctions ever made. But give these boys credit, they do arrange and write their own music, and the actual music isn't too bad.. But this record lacks direction and a producer who could channel the well-intentioned band and edit the painfully hard to swallow lyrics that will undoubtably drop your I.Q. 100 points with repeated listen. A fad and nothing more.. But enjoyable none the less.."},{"rating":"1","title":"What in the blazes!?","review":"This is without a doubt the worst album of 1999, and quite possibly the worst album of the whole decade.

They sure are funky, as in they really stink."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst of the boy groups","review":"As expected, EVERY song on this album is a cheesy, love ballad. So \\"Summer girls\\" is actually dedicated to someone, and was written by the group. But all this seems to make it EVEN WORSE than BSB, N Sync, or 98*. At least KoRn turned A.D.I.D.A.S. into a catch phrase, LFO singing about A&F is nothing but sellout! What if a girl preferred GAP, would you still like her guys?

I thought 'N Sync and 98 Degrees were bad, but L.F.O. can beat them all in ripping-off the public."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WORST SONG EVER WRITTEN","review":"Summer Girls is everything that is wrong with music today. It is style over substance. The words make no sense what so ever, but that doesn't matter because the guys singing are cute (sentence must be read with high levels of sarcasim).

Instead of Bob Dylan singing about social injustices we have LFO singing about how Chinese Food makes them sick.If you are a music fan, please avoid this band at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Copycats","review":"LFO's debut album follows in the steps of many bands. A poppy sound, good looking guys and the latest styles. Unfortunately this is a formula that has been well run over and continues to be beaten to death. Lyrics make no sense. On the debut single \\"Summer Girls\\" emphasis is given only to rhyming. The rhyming schemes used in this song just rhyme and thats it. The song make's very little sense and further drives the point home that quality boy bands are no longer being put out.

Apparently some people think we do. Don't get me wrong though. \\"Summer Girls\\" has a nice beat and all but the lyrics sound so amateurish and really don't make much sense once everything is put into perspective. LFO seems to resemble an act in a junior high talent show. One hit wonders all the way!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone's Confused...","review":"These boy band dancers sure have their style confused. Who knows what their songs really are? One boy seems to attempt to rap through out the songs while the chorus bounces like a pop star on drugs. While spitting out a few \\"intelligent\\" one hit wonders such as \\"Summer Girls\\" which talks about a preppy clothing brand throughout the whole song and \\"Girl On T.V.\\" which is a song about loving an actress on the television, LFO seems to be clinging on to the younger children in a sad try at selling albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"This group and their cd is a disgrace! =(","review":"This cd will be a waste of your money or your parents money. I never liked Summer Girls but I still bought the cd thinking it would be a good investment and maybe that they would have some better songs. Man was I WRONG! I only gave them one star because I can't give them ZERO! It's pitifull, they can't sing and they surely are NOT hot! To the girl who said it changed your life, I say \\"Yeah Right, Whatever\\". My little brother can make better lyrics and he's only 7. Please do not buy this cd unless you want to waste it on trash. What has happened to the good taste of some American teenagers? Invest your money in a group who can really sing and have the lyrics and melodies to go along with it get the Imajin self-titled cd. It'll be well worth your money.

The lyrics sound like they've been done by a 11 year old, they can't sing and it sounds like they're trying to rap sometimes. Blah, leave rapping to black people and Eminem. By they way, they also seen to be one of those bands of the \\"One hit wonderism\\" since \\"Summer Girls\\" seem to be their ONLY hit cause \\"girl on TV\\" isn't doing that good at all.

It shows that you cannot always judge a book by its cover. I was expectin them to sound like NSync and the Backstreet Boys (at the beginning) but it is much better than that. The songs are good R and B songs with not too much bubblegum pop which was a big thing at the time this CD was released. Devin, the lead singer, has some of the best as well as strongest vocals out there. He has a very soulful voice that is unheard of with many other singers. \\"Summer Girls\\" is a very good song that is kinda played out now but still holds up well. However, \\"Girl on TV\\" still sounds as fresh as it did then with its tight and cohesive sound.

Now, I am really starting to get concerned that the world may actually be getting ready to end since this group is supposed to be a hit. This cd is the biggest piece of garbage I have ever heard. The lyrics make absolutely no sense plus these guys have NO talent and can't sing at all. Every song I have heard on the radio by this group makes me sick because it so pointless. These guys are supposedly singing about a girl but they are talking about Chinese food making them sick? What the hell does that have to do with anything? For the love of God, why do some people support this? This is HORRIBLE! PLEASE STOP SUPPORTING THIS STUFF SO IT WILL GO AWAY!

For anyone other than pre-pubescent little girls and people from New Jersey, though, listen at your peril."},{"rating":"2","title":"LYTE FUNKIE ONES.","review":"I love this CD. LFO is a great new vocal Pop group with true talent. The best songs on this CD are definitely \\"Summer Girls\\", \\"Girl On TV\\", and my new favorite - \\"West Side Story\\". Rich, Devin, and Brad write all of their songs (well, at least Rich does!), and all of them are awesome. And sure, they don't play their own instruments (such as BBMak), but hey - not everybody can play instruments! LFO has awesome vocals and they need to be recongized more. They have a brand-new sound with a mix of Pop and Hip-Hop. And if you like this CD, then pick up their new release, LIFE IS GOOD - out soon! Also, Rich Cronian is so hot! LFO rocks!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Girl on TV a beautiful yet true song","review":"I have to admit, \\"Girl on TV\\" describes the way my best friend felt about this guy she saw on TV. She didn't even know his name, she called him \\"the guy with the black hat\\" and told me that he was the one she was gonna marry. She was completely serious, \\"It's just the way he looked,\\" she said, when I asked her why in the world this guy would even think about her. She was mad at me when I mentioned that he was just some guy from somewhere we don't know, and she should forget about it. She would have long moments thinking about him, just dreaming about him. Just a flash of his face on TV is all it takes for my friend to worship the \\"guy on TV\\" I guess.

However, this group goes beyond all borders of good taste and breaks any wall of descency ever established for music. Has anyone ever even listened to the lyrics? They're incoherent and sloppy and seem unable to make up their minds as to whether or not they want to rap or sing! What kind of relation does: \\"New Kids on the Block had a bunch of hits\\" and \\"Chinese food makes me sick\\" have? It is stupid and pathetic! This band is a digrace to the genre of boy bands! They've obviously disregarded any attempt to make good music. All they've done is take a bunch of good looking guys and created an Abercrombie and Fitch Commercial! HORRIBLE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this supposed to be?","review":"I just listened to LFO and I can't seem to stop jamming rusty nails in my ears. To give them some credit, they did use an interesting strategy in coming up with the music and lyrics for this CD. First, they got a chimpanzee drunk and gave him a pencil, and two hours later they had the lyrics to \\"Summer Girls.\\" Then, they snuck into the recording sessions of other popular boy bands and went through the garbage, knowing they'd find a few gems in the \\"lyrics we threw away because they were too trite and cliche even for an uninspired boy band\\" pile. With all the lyrics for their CD finished, it was then just a matter of laying the tracks down. They used MTV Music Generator 2.0 to produce their baselines, then had Vanilla Ice come in and figure out the rhythm for their rapping. The result is this classic, one-of-a-kind reminder of why nobody should ever buy Abercrombie and Fitch."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Agree with Josh from South Carolina","review":"I agree with Josh from South Carolina who said that this cd is very sad.

Each of my friends have a copy, and LFO is their new favorite \\"band\\".Once you've heard one boy group, you've heard them all. There is nothing good about this CD. I have to admit, \\"Girl on TV\\" didn't harm my eardrums as much as \\"Summer Girls\\" did, but they are a group with a three hit maximum. I don't think they're gorgeous, or even in the slightest sense cute. They have no talent. If you look at the booklet, you'll see the songs were written by at least four people each. What does that tell you? And they have ruined \\"Can't Have You\\" with their senseless \\"raps\\". Like Eminem.For the love of God!

Surprised that my fiftysomething ears could actually hear the distortion, I loaded \\"Atlantis\\" into my WAV editor (Audition) so I could map the waveform. The second portion of \\"Atlantis\\" has more clipping than a late-model Tom Waits album. At least I can picture Waits having a reason for introducing this much distortion into his songs.

It provides everything you won't be able to retain immediately, like enums and the many built-in functions that can make your life a whole lot easier, but are too detailed to remember when you're trying to wrap your head around everything else.For the expert; it's very well indexed and, with a little use, can often prove to be a faster reference source than digging up a pertinent web result.

I called MS and things got worse. Now I have an dditional problem (no sound on my desktop) and the first problem remains unsolved. I have been through three layers of MS technicians, only the last of which spoke English with an accent close enough to mine to be understood.

In the latter dept. it's still not robust yet; you need a firewall (e.g., a router or ZoneAlarm software) and a free anti-virus program (AVG, from grisoft.com) to beef up your security. But in many other aspects SP2 fixes stability and security holes and it installed seamlessly on my PCs and has made things soemwhat better.This XP Pro upgrade is for people who have XP Home installed. The added advantages of XP Pro include 1) the ability to encrypt files and folders at the OS level; 2) the ability to control read/write/access rights of individual files and folders; 3) enhanced networking support; 4) dual-processor support; 5) and more.

Kind of like the type seen on a episode of Good Eats. I thought these might fit the bill. They don't.Serrated? No. For something to be serrated the actual blade needs to have serrations, not just some fancy cuts on the side (non cutting part) of the blade. How that can be called serrated I do not know.8 inches long? Yes, they are. Which if you look at the picture you will see the handles are quiet big. Nice right? Well half right. Big handles are nice, but in a 8 inch long item only a couple inches are left for the working part of the blade. It is like cutting with kids scissors.

I have picked up quite a few DVD's in the past of old material, but this solo section is the top of the line.All in all, it is well worth buying if you had the VHS in the past and lost it - but if you still have the VHS its probably not worth buying since it is EXACTLY THE SAME VHS AND DVD.

The stage show's lacking the flavor of anything entertaining and the drum and bass solo's are 4 minutes to long.

I want David Lee Roth ERA VH on DVD please........."},{"rating":"1","title":"a disappointment ...","review":"Making History is about a Cambridge student, Michael, and a physics professor who, by transporting sterility drugs through time to a well in Austria, create a world were Hitler had never been born. Making History is conceptually interesting, but poorly executed and at times exceedingly dull. Many of the action sequences are written in a screenplay format, which leaves some of the book's major scenes without any narrative description and results in tedious chapters where characters act without discernable motivation. The slower paced, more interesting first person narrative style is abandoned (it seems) in favor of getting quickly through scenes that, though vital to the plot, do not afford the oppurtunity for clever banter or amusing description that the author is so fond of. The resolution is forced and unsatisfying, and there are glaring holes in the plot that are never resolved. Fry is a witty writer, but I think he is overreaching with this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great \\"what if?\\" read (if a less than original topic)","review":"I never read this book in English, I've only read it in German (translated by Ulrich Blumenbach), so some of the wordplays didn't come across that well, and neither did the difference between the British and the American, but the story is still great. I particularly enjoyed the somewhat circular story line. All in all, very enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't go anywhere","review":"The story starts out rather promising. But as it goes on it gets progressively worse. The worst part being when the author stops writing in paragraphs and instead pretends that he is writing a screenplay. The rest of the story isn't particulary good. I don't know if the author was trying to get across a point, but if he was he didn't do a good job getting it across. I also found it frusturating the way the author attempted to tell two different stories at once. Unless your a really big fan of alternate history stories, I really wouldn't recommend this book. There just isn't any real point to the story. The book comes across as incoherent babble, not as a story with a central focus."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tremendous what....if... book","review":"Stephen Fry explores the classical question \\"What would have happened to the world if Hitler would not have been born?\\" In this book, which is serious, hilarious, inventive and thought-provoking all at the same time, we get a possible answer to this question and it is not a nice one...A young scientist helps an old physicist to change history by preventing Hitler from being born, but an even bigger rogue takes the place left open after this event. The problem is that this man is not as unacceptable to other nations as Hitler was, thus changing history in a way which the two had not quite imagined... So the young man has to struggle to set things right working in a society which is as grim as can be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Imaginative, sometimes comic","review":"Michael is a young doctoral student in England whose thesis centers on the early life of Adolf Hitler. He encounters a physicist who harbors a deep hatred of Hitler (as well as a deep secret), and the two hatch a plot to make so Hitler was never born. The two change history, but the world doesn't turn out how they intended. Michael struggles in this new, disturbing world to find the physicist and to right the wrong, and along the way he finds love with another man. But will this love survive when they try to set the world right? Sometimes fun, always intelligent, this novel can be called a sci-fi comedy, or just a highly imaginative book. Any which way, though, Fry's book is a marvelous read about history and our views on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific!","review":"Laughed and laughed...this is a wonderful, well-written, free-wheeling intelligent book. One of the few gay authors who can write wittily about gay sex (gay love, actually) without being in-your-face all the time about it. Does not let his sexuality overwhelm the story line. Buy it and read it today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enthralling!","review":"Admittedly, I usually shudder when a novel is described as 'enthralling', but there...I've gone and done it myself! Well, to be fair, in this case, it's an accurate description. Stephen Fry's third novel takes the reader on an amazing ride through what could have been. Fantastical - and yet, plausible - the story explores the possibility of what might have been if one were able to alter history in order to eliminate one of it's least savory characters - Hitler. Would we be better or worse off? There's no way of knowing for sure, but Fry gives us one possiblity. More than just conjecture about what history was and might have been, Fry's story is filled with wonderful characters, and the joy in reading it is just as much for following the development of the characters, as for exploring the possibilities of a Hitler-free world."},{"rating":"2","title":"The genius: Mr Stephen Fry","review":"I feel so unworthy of submitting a review of such a fabulous writer. I have just read the other reviews for this book and most people, as they do for all his books, comment on his wonderful use of the English language. I purchased this book as I am a great admirer of Stephen Fry the comedian and was interested to check out Stephen Fry the writer. I was enthralled! I remained in my PJ's all day and didn't put the book down until I had finished. One reviewer mentioned his unease with Hitler and Humour being used in tandem. I found parts of this book humourous, but from my humble point of view, the whole scenario left me feeling uneasy and got me thinking 'what if' and 'oh my god'. This is a very clever, very funny and extremely well written that left this reader with a very strong message to try and assimilate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Written Second Half","review":"While the first half is rather tediose, and only mildly boring, the second half is an insult to the reader. It appears that the author was given a sizable advance, ran out of time, and threw together the second half of this book from some working notes. Then, his publisher was too afraid to not publish the work due to contractual agreements even though the work as a whole is a waste of time, money, and trees."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite and banal","review":"I picked up this book at a library used book table thinking that it might interest my high school students. It was a waste of time and 50 cents. The writing is simplistic and the plot line is banal and boring. It was entirely predictable and Martin, the main character, was not developed in enough detail. The writer also needs an editor who can pick up on some obvious grammatical errors. It is \\"He could have gone\\" not \\"He could have went.\\" I could understand if this was part of the dialogue used to portray an uneducated character but it was not. Do not waste your time with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and stupid!!!!!!! -5 Rating","review":"OMG- this book was torture to read. Most of the book/ dialog happened in the characters heads. If either of them at any point had just said what they were \\"Thinking\\" then the entire book would have been 5 pages tops. I don't see this need to prolong \\"thoughts\\" and live in doubt and be \\"sad\\" when they both supposedly felt the same way about each other but through pride, misunderstandings and misinformation, the book had to drag on and on.

He's helping to undermine the prevalent thought among scholars that the slaves had no technology and were blank slates for Europeans to paint in their own images. He identified the fact that some \\"Planters\\" requested slaves from certain areas such as the rice coast, (modern day sierra leone belongs to this coast.)Which in itself shows that Planters were well aware of their slaves origin and the differences between them.

Big Band music is wonderful, and this is much more rewarding to listen to than the scratchy old masters from 20 years earlier.More importantly -- this album MOVES. Of course James' trumpet is the star, but Helen Forrest's vocals work perfectly on the several tracks where she appears. Too often, remakes are pale shadows of the original, but in this case Trumpet Blues stands strongly as (1) a great, mostly uptempo album with classic James tunes and (2) an acceptably high fidelity recording.If you have never bought a Harry James album, this would be a good place to start -- a solid introduction to his music, without the distraction of the uneven early recordings. Be assured it is really James playing, not someone else trying to pay tribute!Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"really not what i expected","review":"got this on sale so i guess i should not be too unhappy....this really was for older kids and was not worth it even at $3.99. maybe when my boys are older they will like it but at 5 and 6, i would have had to work with them way too much (i have a baby too) and it just was not what i wanted."},{"rating":"1","title":"AVOID AT ALL COST$$$!!!!","review":"When I first received the mic, I thought I had a defected product since the sound was inaudible. However, the mic came back from the dealer tech as having no defects and a comment that I turn up the echo all the way up. I don't want to sing in an echo chamber. My friends and I still can't distinguish any of the words when anyone tries to sing. It sounds like people are gargling in a tunnel.I have a strong a/v production background, so hearing from a tech that the echo needs to be up all the way is just plain silly. A mic's job is to capture the voice and be able to reproduce it as pristine as possible and any effects like echo should just be add-ons and not required for the general function of the mic.I expected much more from this mic since my parents had an earlier version and it was just a better built mic then what I have. Now I'm out close to $500 (I splurged for extra song chips and submic). OUCH!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be called a collection of Paintings...Period!","review":"The title is misleading.

If you have digestive issues, please please please consider this product. My stomach is super sensitive and the active enzymes help tremendously with digestion. The taste to me is great, not at all as \\"grassy\\" as the others (Amazing Grass, Greens Plus, Green Vibrance, just to name a few). It has more barley grass than any other grass, which my stomach digests well. It's smooth, mixes easy, and goes down without a fight lol. Give it a try; you'll be surprised at what it can do for you.

(one on structures and the other on rolling stock) I have no idea why these books are out of print, except possibly that most modelers want the quick out-of-the-box, ready-to-run modeling experience. For those of us who enjoy the art and craftsmanship of making something from scratch and the pride that comes from saying, \\"I build that model from scratch\\", there is no greater inspiration than Wesolowski. My copy of each book is falling apart I have reviewed them so many times. When I get discouraged with my modeling, one review of his books is enough to get me excited and back to work. I hope the publisher will someday reprint the books so others can share the joy. For now, a check on eBay may turn up a copy. Note: There were two different publishers for both books with different titles for each, so there may be some confusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesnt work consistently","review":"I would say if your cakes coming out perfectly is important, stick with the shortening and flour method.

After turning over another ruined cake this weekend, I just threw the can away. Its tempting to use it since it is so fast and convenient, but I just cannot trust it. I make many perfectly smooth buttercream and also fondant covered cakes and so I need my cakes to release perfectly every time.I was drawn to this product as it doesnt contain hydrogenated oils. It even advertises that on the can, which I find interesting since Wilton freely uses hydrogenated oils in many of thier products.I will stick with shortening, flour, and parchment liners. Its extra work, but at least you can count on it working."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best","review":"As much of a Wilton fan as I am, this is not a good product.

I had to spatula the pieces left behind and patch them to the top of the cake with frosting.I read the directions and made sure that all of the pan was covered with the product before pouring the batter and baking.Save your money and buy Pam or do it the old fashioned way by hand greasing and flouring your pans, if the recipe calls for it.I was very disappointed.

It also may inform your choice of what serious book to read next as a number of these actions are discussed more fully in other works to which the author openly refers to.Battles covered vary from Waterloo to Antietam, Mafeking to the Boxer Rebellion, the Lost Battalions saga of WW1 fame to Pork Chop Hill in Korea.

This hefty 3 volume sequel follows up to the first two books, also combined and released in hardback as 'Warlord'.I enjoyed these books when they first came out, I remember being very frustrated each time I'd finish a book because I had to wait months before the next book in the series came out. Play your cards right and you'll have all the enjoyment, none of the frustration. As it should be.After you've finished these books you may find yourself curious about the history behind this alt-history series. If so, I also recommend 'Count Belisarius' by Robert Graves."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best yet","review":"soundsystem is a smooth blend of rock, this cd goes back to the roots of 311, if you liked grassroots and music, buy this cd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hello Out There!","review":"As you 311 fans out there know, the blue album focused on a ol skool rap stylee, and transistor focused on laid-back rythyms.How would you like it if the two CD's were to be combined into ONE GREAT CD?Your prayers have been answered.Along comes SOUNDSYSTEM, the new album from the boys from Omaha. It sounds like the offspring of Transistor and the Blue Album. Songs like Freeze Time (Track 1) prove it. Hell, they ALL do.

Not even close...","review":"I reviewed this album earlier and gave it 3 stars because I thought it was pretty mediocre. Then, on a long car trip I listened to it again carefully, and must unfortunately downgrade my rating. In reality, this really isn't a very good album. There simply isn't much catchy or memorable stuff on this record. Everything sounds the same; no track leaps out and grabs you (except maybe Come Original).I have the tape, and the whole first side is basically forgettable. A couple of decent songs salvage the second side, but nothing that special. And I LIKE 311!!!! But compared to earlier efforts, this one is just plain weak. I think many of you gave this album 5 stars out of fan loyalty to the band, which is cool. But if you were truly honest, you would see that this is a rather disappointing effort from a group of talented guys who are capable of much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Nice Combination of All Of Their Albums","review":"311 has made their best album yet with \\"Soundsystem\\". It is a nice mixture of their trademark sound with a few surprises. For example, \\"Life's Not A Race\\" is the best ape of Santana, musically, I have ever heard, it's a dead ringer for something Santana would have done in the early 70's. \\"Livin' And Rockin'\\" begins with this trip-hop beat and evolves into a hardcore slam that doesn't let up. \\"Evolution\\", though lyrically kind of silly, musically is a little of everything. The lyrics, of course, are the area of 311's recipe that don't hold up to the rest, but that's a minor complaint, the music speaks for itself. Guitars that both rock and have soul, funk bass riffs, scratches, fast vocalizing, a hypnotic beat. It all comes together so very nicely on \\"Soundsystem\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soundsystem expands the horizon of musical styles...","review":"311 have once again broken the barriers of categorizing music with Soundsystem.

Gone is their ever-popular drug influenced tracks and now present are poppy boy-band esque songs of hum-worthy melodies. This just wont do it for me driving in my car going ninety. It may help if im driving past the local mall trying to pick up thirteen year olds however. I suggest Transistor, dubbed the \\"stoney\\" album or Grassroots, their best ever effort and collaboration on a disc to date."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely 311","review":"Thank you, 311, for putting the trippy stylings of \\"Transistor\\" behind you and moving back to what you're good at: music. \\"Soundsystem\\" grooves back to the 311 of old, filled with memories old and new, of \\"Music,\\" \\"Grassroots,\\" and \\"311.\\" This is a solid album.

I really liked what I heard, particularly \\"Stealing Happy Hours\\" and \\"Beautiful Disaster,\\" and I purchased Transistor a few days later. Hearing about a new 311 release, I thought I'd be pretty safe purchasing it without hearing any of it beforehand. After bringing it home and listening to it, if I were to describe the experience in one word, that word would be \\"disappointing.\\" The music doesn't explore any real new territory - the guitar riffs sound like reruns from the last album, and the lyrics sound hastily put together and not particularly in synch with the music. There were just a couple of bright spots, which were the songs \\"Life's not a Race\\" and \\"Strong All Along.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"311 Keeps It Real","review":"After Transistor I wouldn't of known what to expect from 311. Transistor had its moments but it was recorded too fast and I believe alot of marajuana was involved in the process. 311 hit back with Soundsystem a postively charged album heading into the 21st century. 311 has always in their lyrics tried to stay positive and in Soundsystem there isn't any let down in that. SA raps with more fuel for the fire this time round and scratches it up on the turntables quite well. Pnut beats that thing more then usual and the result is pure genius. Chad on drums is the standout, i think, on the album. Tim is always there with killer riffs and Nick well Nick is Nick his melodic vocal styling is unique and is matched well with SA's rapping skills. All in all Soundsystem is a excellent record with all their styles on one CD. You'll be quite interested in the way they start a couple of their songs with techno beats, but thats only the start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what I was expecting","review":"okay first off, this album is nothing like metal. Some hip hop this and that, no metal. Now I'm a HUGE metal fan, I was wishing for something near metal, but nothing remotly close. But I did enjoy it for just laying around doing nothing. It has a nice beat to it, for a slowish CD. I like come original, that's a classic song. I like the CD, but it isn't for making you get up and jump all around, more for a mellow time. Thanks for reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"A worthy album.","review":"311's albums are all a little different in style and substance; Soundsystem is a lot like a convergence of their previous work. Gone are the traditional ode-to-weed anthems, but Soundsystem has a vibe that's reminiscent of the fun-lovin' tone of Music. There are a couple throwaway tracks here, but it's quite a good album overall and most 311 fans should dig this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Bounceback from \\"Transistor\\"","review":"Usually I can cope with bands I like a lot making albums that aren't to the best of what I concider the best of their ability. 1997s \\"Transistor\\" was for sure an album by a band I liked since about 1995 when the blue album was big and 311 was pretty big.Now \\"Transistor\\" had too much of a changed 311 sound that was too changed and unusual. \\"Soundsystem\\" is everything that was wrong with \\"Transitor\\" fixed and totally improved.With the catchy beats, unique and original sound and just kickass tunes that 311 has been producing for 12 years now hasn't lost its touch. And \\"Soundsystem\\" is proof that through other rap/rock (I actually concider 311 funk/rock) acts like Limp Bizkit, which I concider the sellout of 1999 and now I even call THEM \\"311 wannabes\\" in my mind at least 311 still rules.Or in short: 311 forever. \\"Soundsystem\\" rules."},{"rating":"2","title":"A mind-blowing album, continuing with their own style","review":"Three Eleven's new album Soundsystem is a mind-blowing masterpiece, with a creative mixture of a Grassroot's sound and the sound of Transistor. They have once again made it clear that they are on top of things. The amount of talent in this group is amazing. S.A. Martinez scratches a great deal more in this album compared to the others, while still rippin out crazy lines. Nick Hexum continues to break out with his amazing voice, Chad with many phat new beats, Tim Mahoney continuing to blow away every other guitarist (except his favorite guitarist Carlos Santana), and P-Nut still beatin that thang. Right now, Soundsystem is my favorite 311 album, and I cannot wait to see them in concert at the Convention Hall in Asbury Park, NJ....up close and personal!

I was disappointed by transistor...a handful of the songs are good, but on the whole, it was too simplistic and (dare I say it), maudlin. Well, I was really refreshed and geeked to hear the new Soundsystem tracks. I really love tracks 1-7...the true 311 spirit really comes through on them. I especially loved Large in the Margin...and songs 4 and 5 too. A couple tracks are a little questionable, but all in all, I'd say 311 has taken it to the next level! My only prayer is that they don't release any more songs off this album -- they still need to complete their penance after Transistor, and seeing them get even more popular would be detrimental to that. Anyways, enough with my criticism: on the whole, 311 is great, and Soundsystem is a worthy album! :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"promises to be another great 311 CD","review":"Come original is a tight song, and backed up well. they keep their fast beat that has worked so well in the past.

I absolutely loved everything they did before. Music, Grassroots and Transistor were my favorite albums. I just don't see how anyone who like THAT 311 could like THIS 311. They don't even sound the same to me. This album is pathetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gross lyrical incompetence and turgid music","review":"Exactly why so many people rave about 311 is completely beyond me. They appear to be little more than Rage Against The Machine, but without the rage. The music does not 'rock'; it's unbelievably boring and conservative on the whole with the odd unsuccessful foray into reggae. The lyrics are comically bad, although you should probably expect that from a band with a song called 'Largin' in the Margin'. Even the sleeve is utterly foul. No redeeming features whatsoever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Transistor? minus Excitement and Motivation","review":"This is a lot like transistor except it's missing the serious flow. These songs might have been left overs or something. 311 sounds like they are just goofing off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty average CD.","review":"This is my first purchase of a 311 CD, and I didn't really know what to expect from it. I like to buy a new band once in a while to expand the music library. So I am not a \\"previously hooked\\" follower of this band and am basing my review of this CD on this release alone.If I had only listened to this CD once, I would have given it a 1 star rating... At first it comes off pretty simple and repetitive. The biggest problem I had with this CD is how the guitarist and drummer get stuck into \\"power chord/bass drum\\" ruts, where they mimic each other in mid-tempo land for entire song after song. Being a fan of musical creativity, this doesn't do much for me at all....Luckily, I gave it a second and third listen. The extra listen boosted this CD up to 2 stars, mostly because of the 13th track \\"Liven and Rockin\\", that does have a cool \\"living color - Cult of personality\\" style riff through the chorus.Pretty basic stuff here overall....."},{"rating":"2","title":"They just can't stop rockin","review":"I own every 311 cd there is, and this one is by no means a dissappointment. I\\"m not going to say it's my favorite, because every cd of theirs is my favorite. 311 is truly one of the most talented bands i've had the luck to listen to. I put them in a catagory with led zepplin and eric clapton. Their lead guitarist,Tim Mahoney, has an unmatched stylo =) and creativeness. Chad sexton is absolutely awesom on the drums, and of course SA and nick make the perfect hip-hop reagge combo. Everyone of 311's cd's are one of a kind. They mix so many styles, and play them all well. And their good vibes and positive attitude is a much better alternative to some other modern band's complaining and critizing. buy this cd. you won't regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"this is one of their best. check out there 1995 cd 311, it is cool too. buy this cd right now or just buy it if you don't you will be missin out on some great music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Im still dancin'!","review":"Okay guys.. buy this cd.

I wasn't sure what to expect, but I didn't think I would like it as much as I already do. It is amaizing. They blend everything. They include all the different styles of the other CD's, but they add effects and scratches like I have never heard. It is unbelievable they can keep on going for this long and not repeat themselves. If you have heard \\"Come Origional\\" that is not even the best song, and it is good. My favorites: \\"Freeze Time\\", \\"Flowing\\", \\"Life's Not a Race\\", and \\"Sever\\". Buy it you will love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I love this album. I think 3 of my top 10 favorite songs from this band are on here. Flowing is great, I absolutely love the harmonizing and sound. Sever has great lyrics and probably my favorite chours from the band. Plus, I love the little guitar solo outro at the end. And Mindspin, while a fairly average song for the first two minutes, finishes with maybe my favorite piece of music in the history of music. The ending of that song is absolutely brilliant. Add those songs with a bunch of other solid songs (Freeze Time, Come Original, Life's Not a Race, Large in the Margain) and it easily makes the album 5* to me. Plus, the other songs aren't all that bad either. In fact, the only song I really dislike on the album is Can't Fade Me. This is definitely in the upper echolon of 311 albums for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Party time!!!","review":"\\"Soundsystem\\" is probably 311's most fun record. Even though it begins with the off-kilter riffing of the excellent \\"Freeze Time,\\" \\"Come Original\\" comes next and quickly establishes \\"Soundsystem\\" as a fun, breezy but deep album; just 311 being 311. \\"Life's Not a Race\\" gives Tim Mahoney a chance to step out on the guitar, and has a cool, jazzy/Santana-esque vibe to it. \\"Evolution\\" has some tight riffing and clever lyrics, \\"Flowing\\" is a classic 311 tune: a poppy and heavily distorted section gives way to a metallic, heavily palm-muted, chromatic ascending riff. Great singing too. And \\"Livin' & Rockin'\\" closes things out with an uptempo bang.\\"Soundsystem\\" is a great, fresh and fun offering from 311. It's like a 13-track party with 5 of the coolest dudes you know."},{"rating":"2","title":"this cd is so rad","review":"Get this ive listend to this cd over and over again and it doesnt get boaring get it you will not regret It"},{"rating":"2","title":"Soundsystem","review":"I am from 311's hometown of Omaha, NE.

Now comes \\"Soundsystem\\", 311's statement to the music industry that they won't go down without a fight. Soundsystem has all the potential hit songs that made the self-titled release so popular. I had to laugh at an earlier customer review that labeled them \\"so unoriginal\\"--as if any other band BUT 311 revolutioned hip-hop/metal/reggae. While the brilliantly mixed \\"Come Original\\" will sell the album, \\"Large in the Margin\\" or \\"Flowing\\" could very well steal your heart as favorite song on the CD. The harmony in \\"Large In the Margin\\"'s chorus will blow your mind. \\"Freeze Time\\" also gets a big thumbs up in my book.

Tracks like \\"Come Original\\" and \\"Freeze Time\\" prove 311's impressive talent. If you'd like something fresh and original then buy this cd, along with all of the other 311 cd's out there.

Boy, am I glad I only purchased one!My main complaint is Ms. Barr's gutter mouth. Call me old-fashioned, but I do not appreciate it, in either movies or books. Furthermore, for someone who represents our National Parks, especially as a former NPS employee, I believe she should be a little more respectable in her writing.Regarding the rest of her writing, her characters were shallow, although it was evident she was familiar with fire camps.

I can tell you that the audiobook is great. Rosenblat's voice captures the essence of the character very nicely.I'll admit this isn't the most interesting of the Anna Pigeon stories I've heard, but it was still decent. I think I might have liked it less if reading b/c there are a LOT of descriptions to wade through. What that means for the story is a less than intricate plot. Still, if you like the Anna Pigeon series as a whole, you will probably enjoy this installment.

Danger exists in the air she breathes and the exhaustion that takes a toll on all firefighters that have been brought in to save the park.Nevada Barr convincingly shows why rangers are called from many locations and the need to work as one in the midst of a Firestorm. The problem in working as one is that there is a murderer who has no compunction about covering up the first death with more. The most intense scene is when the Firestorm is blasting down the trail and the only way to survive is as dangerous as the fire itself.Ms. Barr is a great storyteller who writes what she knows. I have no doubt that she has experienced survival in various parks and on a myriad of projects. She brings with her the full power that a writer can when she has lived the events--perhaps not the murder itself, but survival in it rawest form."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional","review":"I don't understand why this book isn't at the top of the bestseller list. Anna Pigeon is a ranger with the National Park Service. She is currently serving as security and EMT at a fairly routine fire in the Lassen Volcanic National Park when things suddenly go to hell in a hand basket. The firestorm scenes are absolutely riveting. The characters are all very well developed. Some are easy to love and some are easy to hate. There is plenty of sophisticated, witty humor sprinkled throughout. Some of it made me laugh out loud. The landscape descriptions were the next best thing to being there. And tying it all together is a whopping good murder mystery. I probably shouldn't make comparisons but I will. Nevada Barr has Sue Grafton beat by a mile"},{"rating":"2","title":"good mystery, exciting situation","review":"This is an excellent mystery about a groupof firefighters who are stranded on a mountaintopafter discovering a murder.

Another plus is that the video is long-enough to entertain and teach within a toddler/pre-school attention-span, but not too-long (you don't have to turn it off mid-stream and endure the screams!). And, did I mention that the songs are fantastic! Finally, a pre-school video that parents can enjoy watching with their children!"},{"rating":"1","title":"the jazz officer almost nails it","review":"Please read the Jazz Officer's review of this video but ignore the parts alleging that a good drummer is present.

I especially enjoyed Shaka Don, she is the mosy genuine in my eyes. I really liked that the women got something from them either selling drugs, or their ass. Its a shame that us women have to do those things. Atleast Champagne got a nice house, even if it was doing that. She is still maintaining with her young daughter. Some women do that and forget about their children. I recommend this film to everyone. I applaud Harry Davis & Associates for their insights and await another original project."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not download, a lot of text is missing","review":"I started to read 'When God Laughs' and noticed that whenever there supposed to be a poetry in the book, the poetry parts are missing from the text.

The person gets thrown out window, and book's main charactor thinks of them as \\"Dumb Guidos.\\" Everytime I would get into the story, an Italian put-down would come up.

The images of stars, nebulae and galaxies are excellent.

All in all i enjoy reading a different Psalm and passage each day to give me a bright outlook on the new day ahead. Sometimes it just inspires me to press on when every thing seems so bleak and dim.

The book can be used for daily reflections or as simple readings to meditate on. I found that the vast majority of the reflections pertained to things that happen to me in my everyday life. I felt as if the author was speaking to me personally. This book realates lines in the Psalms to things that happen everyday to us.

The vagrant, now a bright and shining pillar of the community, turns out to be... I won't spoil it, but can't you just guess what the end is?

But the editor's choice of chapters did not lend to a good read. The excerpts chosen fail to cohere. And the excerpts here are not good representations of the authors' work.The table of contents made my mouth water: Bourdieu, Strathern, Foucault, Dumont, Luhmann, Habermas, Lyotard, etc. But the sum is far, far less than the sum of parts.The introduction isn't a great deal of help--one feels that this collection is more representative of Faubion's personal faves, and less a work designed to communicate to a greater audience.There are much better collections addressing the re-thought subject. This is not the one to choose. I'm afraid I just cannot recommend this collection to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Was the Grinch a Nazi?","review":"I really enjoyed looking/reading through this book and learning a lot about Theodor Geisel. While he participated in some of the racial paranoia about the Japanese during WW2, for the most part he decried racism against blacks and Jews. (Don't be too quick to judge. Perhaps, living in the time of uncertainty he did and, just like you and just like me, he was merely an imperfect human being?) His pieces were very pointedly against the isolationists of the late 30s and against anything that could impact the successful prosecution of the war. Anyway, I would encourage all the fans of Horton, the Grinch, the Lorax and the Cat, as they grow up, to learn more about their cartoonist idol and view this fascinating piece of American history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressive","review":"I wasnt impressed by the recipes in this book.

The meaty lasagne doesn't have enough liquid in it to cook the noodles (I had to add about 1 cup of water). The Garlic Chicken and Tri-Colored Pasta didn't cook the pasta right, some was hard and crunchy and the rest was gummy. I have a stomachache from trying to eat the mess, and am very upset to be throwing away 2 chicken breasts, a box of pasta and 2 heads of broccoli because it didn't come out.

Those who appear to be enemies are not what they seem...nor those who seem to be allies.The ending, like those in all of Vivian Vande Velde's books, is not quite a happily-ever-after conclusion.

It's also about the diabolical human nature, in the terms of loyalty, greed for power over others, and what desperate people do in desperate situations.

The protagonists are clever and smug, and the technology vague, but that doesn't make it a bad read.

The humor that they were able to see in the different trials that they suffered was amazing. Second, there is always the possibility that the editors removed a majority of Christian references so as not to offend the non-Christians. This book is a well written documentary of their time. I was in awe of their initiative, and the faith that led them to service in Afghanistan. Well done, and if only there were more people like this (and I don't mean preaching the Gospel), but just those to go out and help then the world would be a much better place.

I wish I could see the man in person.I kinda felt somewhat sorry for her in \\"Hard Lovin Man\\" when she and Jack didn't hook up.

This is story of woman who is still mourning the loss of her husband and has a one night stand(which turns into more). She gets pregnant and they get married. He has secrets that he can't tell her for good reason. She gets mad. I found heroine to be stupid. To me this book read like a Sandra Brown romance. I am not a fan of SB.

I didn't expect to like it, wasn't even sure what it was about, and didn't realize until I read the cover after finishing it that it was based on a real person. Go figure. I did feel compelled to finish it in two sittings (would have been one, but there simply aren't enough hours in the day or night!), and by the end of the story I realized that I cared about the characters.

Only then, you would be able to level Baldwin's book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth a read","review":"Neil Baldwin's \\"Henry Ford and the Jews\\" is a compelling look at how a genius at one thing --- the mass production of a good automobile --- could become such a dangerous buffoon when it came to another thing --- the mass production of an idea.

Let's just say that maybe--perhaps--just perhaps, a ghost writer could have written this story. If Jakes, however, did in fact write it, he's probably embarrassed about it. Too late. You can't take it back because it's been published. But the beauty of it is that it can be revised and re-edited in a second printing. I wish I had gotten it from the library instead of buying it.

This made it difficult to relate to or empathize with the main characters. It was hard to find the characters' true voices.

In any case, I don't think I'll be reading anything else that's fiction by him."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unfortunate disappointment...","review":"T.D. Jakes first foray into Christian fiction was an extreme disappointment for me. I picked up this book with great anticipation based on my love for Jakes' ability to make a story come alive when he is teaching from the pulpit and in his inspirational writings. Unfortunately that ability did not transfer to the art of fiction novel writing.In this tale, we meet a host of women who are connected primarily by friendship or work. The story attempts to follow the changes in these women's lives as they encounter trials and tribulations. I did not find the characters or the storylines to be well developed. Often when attempting to infuse faith into the characters lives, it felt that sections of sermons had been lifted and abruptly plunked down into the middle of the story.It is my conclusion that Jakes gift for teaching is best left to face-to-face ministry and the writing of inspirational non-fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting histor","review":"This is a comprehensive history of country music for the years covered.

If I were one of those poor guys, I would be severely tempted to mug Mary-Kate and Ashley, which is far more likely. An unoriginal movie, which is really sad. I am quite sure there is someone out there willing to write an original plotline for these two and they might just refrain from ruining it. But really...isn't it funny how American's still think us English are completely up ourselves? We're not! Really! And I, for one, do not own half a county and have an incredibly rich relative. I'm not that offended at being constantly depicted as wealthy, neither are my mates, but, hmm, if you're going to put it in the title, couldn't you at least research the place a bit...?"},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS SO STUPID/TERRIBLE!!","review":"This Movie is so.... stupid. Don't get me wrong; I'm a HUGE fan ,but this movie is just plain dumb. Parents, if you want your kids to have a good example of a movie. Don't get this one. There is like 5 kissing scenes.

Now that they're 15 they want tobe kissing in all their new movies. And I want to say toMAry-Kate and Ashley to stop with the kissing you guys are onlychilds and you guys think you're grown ups but you're not."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, but grossly innacurate","review":"As sugary Mary Kate and Ashley movies go, this was OK, but I thought the ending was too predictable, and the portrayal of London and the English was so bad it was hysterical. The actor, Jesse Spencer, who played Riley(Mary Kate)'s boyfriend was so obviously NOT English, that it was no surprise to discover he was Australian. Nobody in England speaks like that, and most English kids don't have fancy luncheons and play polo on the weekends! It was gnerally poorly done, but then again, most American movies about London are. I just think that if the plot was spruced up a bit and the footage of London (and the accents) were made A LOT better, it would be a great film....."},{"rating":"2","title":"DON'T MISS THIS ONE!","review":"This movie was awesome.

Well done, girls!"},{"rating":"1","title":"worst movie...","review":"The only reason why I gave this even one star was because of everybody's effort to make the movie. Unfortunately, this movie was one of the worst ones I've ever seen. The Olsen twins are the exact same in each one of their movies, and it's getting old. If you're expecting a movie a little different, don't rent this one. It's just about a couple of twits running around London trying to save the day.

Soppy love scenes make this movie gross, and not THAT interesting on the whole.London IS a fun place (I've been!) but they do not wear bubble dresses, they shop at Harrods!Not very good at all, I paid good money as well.

Oh and boys here don't wear suits! Anyway this was a good film, but they should of got someone better and english to play james!

But we really like the movie. It has adventure and we really like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"Winning London is not one of my favorite Mary-Kate and Ashley movies but it is still good because these girls are great. The movie starts with the girls' national relations team winning a trip to London. While there, of course the girls fall in love with two stunningly handsome boys, but while coupling up they must study for their contest. The group is very creative throughout the contest, but will their relationships cause a loss for their team?? Watch this great adventure to find out how the girls Win London!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Their BEST movie yet!","review":"This movie was the BEST among all their other films. Their taste in boys is improving. Although when Ashley & Brian kissed in the air-duct, it was like they were practically adults. I don't think they should have put that scene in. It was enough that they all kissed in the boat. I loved the part when the group tried to make the queen's guard laugh though. But my favorite part in the whole film was when the girls fenced in the Globe Theatre and rode scooters. I loved it when they played 'So Little Time' by Arkana. MKA fans, you have GOT to watch this!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Olsen Twin Movie So Far","review":"This movie is the best. It is about two sisters Riley and Chloe who go to London along with 3 other people from their school and perticipate in the Modal U.N. compoition. This movie is different from all other Mary-Kate and Ashley movies becuase the girls Riley and Chloe are totally different and a lot of times don't get along. In Winning London it is the first Mary-Kate and Ashley movie where they are not perfect and their lives don't depend on lip gloss, they are actully somewhat smart in this movie. Winning London is also a very, very funny movie in many ways! This movie also teaches people that their dreams can come true. You should rent or buy this movie today. One thing is that in every Olsen Twins movie they BOTH have to fall in love with someone, this movie has no exaptions to that fact."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a great movie!!","review":"Winning London is an awsome movie! If you've seen Mary-Kate and Ashley's other video Our Lips Are Sealed it is just as good, if not better. Winning London isn't a complete comedy like Our Lips Are Sealed, but is just as good. It's a bit of a drama, but with a twist of comedy on the side. In Winning London, Mary-Kate and Ashley are on a Model U.N. team. They have to compete against people from all around the world. For part of their research, they tour London and go to clubs. In the meantime, they fall in love and learn all what competing is about. If you love Mary-Kate and Ashley, you'll love Winning London. Even if you're not a Mary-Kate and Ashley fan, who knows you might just like it. This movie is for all ages."},{"rating":"1","title":"From a MUN buff","review":"I really wish Mary Kate and Ashley would research their topics a little before they decide to go be cute in their latest location. As an avid Model United Nations participant, I would like to say that YOU CAN'T WIN! Model UN at the high school level involves no points, no competitions, and most of all, NO WINNING! While there isn't nearly as much free time at real MUN competitions as Mary Kate and Ashley enjoy, what little time we have is often spent discussing how inaccurate this movie is and mocking it shamelessly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Winning Hearts Winning Minds And Winning Stars!","review":"This moive is cool, but one thing about all their movies is they always get their way! They always win! That is so not a good story line! Another thing, they are always the only ones with cool clothes! Unfair! Also to much lip action, I mean why do they always have to have boyfriends? Its not like they are going to die without a boy! other than that it was pretty cool!

I was quite impressed with the quality as compared to Symphony X, Blind Guardian or Iced Earth. Dream Evil takes Swedish power metal to a new level. There is not a bad song on the CD. The vocals are particularly excellent, and there are mellow songs as well as more angry or depressing ones. I can tell you that if you are a power metal fan, you will enjoy this CD. \\"Break the Chains\\", \\"Bad Dreams\\" and \\"Children of the Night\\" are great heavy ballads, while \\"Evilized\\" and \\"Forevermore\\" are comparably mellow and emotional. There is a good variety of songs on this CD. This album is definitely worth its price. Buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Melodic Metal","review":"I've been listening to a lot of Melodic- and Power-metal over the last few years. Unfortunately the bands not worth hearing are the ones that get all the mainstream publicity (if they get any). Bands like Dream Evil are often overlooked simply because their albums aren't widely available in record stores (at least in my area).This is an excellent album from a superior melodic metal band.I recently saw a CD from a mediocre band I've never heard of (and promptly forgot), that had a sticker on it touting them as the \\"saviors of swedish melodic metal.\\" I say no savior is needed, not with awesome bands like Dream Evil and Hammerfall and a dozen others going strong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best","review":"This book is ok, but is by far not the best text available. This text was used by our medical school for gross anatomy and many times lacked the detailed information required by medical students. I broke down a couple of weeks into the course and bought a much more effective book.The Snell book lacks detailed diagrams and so-called clinical correlations. A large portion of diagnosing problems involving the musculoskeletal system is being able to invision the mechanism of injury. Snell does not have any detailed case or example information that reinforces the concepts. This book will be fine if you have a great anatomy instructor to fill in the blanks; however, is a poor reference if you are left to fill in the blanks.Bottom line: I paid for this book, used it twice and it has been sitting on my bookshelf throughout the remainder of my gross anatomy course."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"It is very precise and can help students understand clearly the anatomical structures and distinguish normal .

No, it is not a Sobotta or idealized anatomy like in the \\"Netter\\" series, it is concise and clear of clutter.Everyone in surgery needs more that one anatomy book, Heck, I still have my father's Thorek.

This CD includes ballet favorites such as La Bayadere, The Sleeping Beauty, and La Sylphide. There are also excercises from Granados, Monti, Minkus, and Drigo among others. Each excercise has a good introduction, which is important for students. Also, the music is not extremely difficult to count and is therefore, ideal for beginning through professional classes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Aerator","review":"I never imagined myself writing a review for a faucet aerator, but this is a great product.

Better brands will let you use ASCII text, (your dog's name or some other phrase) to generate the 64 or 128 bit key. Even with the new firmware, this card requires you to translate the passphrase into hexadecimal, and then type in a 26 digit number.

Give it a try!"},{"rating":"2","title":"These are great","review":"My daughter's feeding therapist introduced us to these. My girl is just learning how to drink from things beyond the bottle. These are wonderful because I can easily see how close the liquid is to her mouth, and I don't have to worry about the top of the rim pushing against her face. I find a thicker liquid works best at this point, but even thin ones work well. I do wish that I had seen that they came in two packs before I ordered, though. Five is a bit much for one baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Cup!","review":"My daughter has some developmental delays due to food allergies and sensory problems. The Feeding Team at CHOP during our stay at the Day Hospital Feeding Program used this cup to begin to teach our daughter how to drink from a cup.

I do not print pictures nor do I do anything fancy.Other than the battery life issue, the camera and I were getting along reasonably well. The only exception was that it was hard to take pictures in crowds. The angle of the lens was too wide and I would have to crop the picture down to be able to focus on my friends.Last week, it stopped accepting batteries for no reason. The batteries died and it would not charge up when I added new ones. I tried several different brands, to no avail.I've ordered a Kodak 4MP camera on a competing website that I get a student discount on. I hope that camera works out better for me.As for this camera, I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working 2nd time I used it......","review":"I received this camera as a gift and thought I would love it as it seemed fairly basic. It broke the second time we used it. The door to hold in our SD memory card would not stay shut. The internal memory would not store our pictures, it kept erasing them right as we took the pictures. Very frustrating!! I would not recommend this camera, there are more reliable ones for the same cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vivitar Vivicam......hhmmmmm","review":"I want to start off by saying that I am an advanced photographer. My mom bought me this camera for Christmas (my first digital) and I was very excited at first. I, very excited, plopped in the AA batteries that this camera requires, and starting taking some pictures. After about ten (with flash) the batteries go dead. In all, I had to change the batteries three times on Christmas day. The quality of the pictures are okay, but not the best. I began despising the camera and eventually (within a month) bought the new Canon Digital Rebel, which is obviously a camera in a completely different league. If you or the person that you are buying the camera for are photography enthusiasts, rethink the purchase. I gave this camera back to my mom (she didn't have a camera at all) and she is excited about it, but she has no clue regarding photography.

These aftermarket are the same capacity or greater than the original. They are so inexpensive, get two or three of them so you'll never have to stop shooting!

I found the entire tone of this book to be condescending and presumptive. Not only was there no useful information, but some of the information was downright harmful. She talks about learning difficulties being due to the child being \\"sinful\\", and gives no credence at all to learning disabilities.

This was the very first book on homeschooling I read and it was rather depressing to read that the only possible way to be a successful homeschooler (she says this outright...no mincing of words) was to be \\"called by god\\" to homeschool. Luckily, the rest of the book was sloppy enough for me to completely discount her opinion and move on to more encouraging resources.If you are fundamentalist AND love a chatty, personal style (think of a talentless Erma Bombeck), you will probably like this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Christians only!","review":"I want to agree with the one other reviewer who was misled by the title. I bought the book thinking it would be a well rounded factual book as the title and cover bullets described. The constant (as in practically every paragraph) references to Jesus, Christianity, and Christian values made it impossible for me to get the information I was looking for. The last straw was this statement from the book: \\"I don't know about you, but something in my heart of hearts tells me it is more than coincidental that the homeschool movement has been birthed in a generation run amuck with legalized abortion. As in the time of Moses and in the time of Christ as well, the wholesale slaughter of innocence has provoked a mighty response from God.\\" P-LEASE!

In spite of some quite helpful information for beginning homeschoolers, I found myself feeling leary of her curriculum references. Anybody who raves about curriculum materials put out by Bob Jones University is automatically a bit suspect. I kept encountering statements such as \\"I have not found any positions that conflict with our (Christian) beliefs.\\" Was this the royal \\"our\\"? As a Christian of a different persuasion, I found such remarks out-of-place and presumptuous.

And in the end it really is Harryhausens stop-motion magic that makes these films worth watching. I grew up on this sort of stuff, and even after all these years I still get a kick out of them. While most films today shoot for realism, what you get here is a true feeling of fantasy. The scripts are pretty much interchangable, the acting isn't always great, but in the end they manage to rise above their flaws and deliver a whole lot of fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantasy Adventure at it's BEST!!!!","review":"Ever since I was a child-I loved Sinbad tales!

My aluminum seatpost clamps, the single bolt aluminum \\"sandwich\\" type clamp common on many if not most average-priced seatposts, have rail grooves that are no more than 50 millimeters apart, outside edge to outside edge.The rails and the grooves have the same diameter; diameter is not the issue. The rails are just too far apart for both of them to sit in both grooves of the clamp simultaneously, and they can't be made to fit.So, to avoid disappointment, and the unnecessary expenditure of time and money, I'd recommend that you measure the relevant dimensions of your seatpost clamp before you make your purchase decision."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very practical","review":"Eels, honeycomb tripe, veal knuckles, pig's feet, gooseberries, oxtail, quahogs and lamb neck - just some of the many oddd ingredients in this book.

While the story is gripping I found it hard to be especially sympathetic to McGartland, who basically sells out the IRA because he doesn't care for their anti-crime efforts!McGartland's bland story of his recruitment as a double agent doesn't quite ring true for me; undoubtedly the R.U.C. had plenty of criminal evidence against him. As he is now in a British witness protection program we may assume a certain degree of self-interest in his demonization of his one-time 'comrades'! Nevertheless the gritty depiction of life in Catholic Belfast and McGartland's escapades as a double agent (especially his arrest by the IRA) make absorbing reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was this written by a school boy?","review":"Too many spelling mistakes to enjoy this book.

It provided a balanced view of two sides, the IRA and the RUC Special Branch.Not once did he blame any particular side and he he stuck to his experinces rather than trying to make any political statements. The subject matter is highly cotrovesial but it is handled objectively.The book is well worth a read but should be read without biasness because for people who have not experienced the troubles it is unimaginable. It is a stale mate. It is an unsolvable conflict in which there can be no winners.McGartland conveys the hopelessness of fighting history, religion, patriotism and age old hatred. He was caught between his beliefs and morals. A powerful story of a young man who risked all and now lives in hiding."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOTHING NEW!!","review":"I was glad I did not purchase this book!

There are not even chapters or presentations at all just questions with answers available."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's so easy!!","review":"This program is brilliant! I couldn't have done well in my Advanced Chem class without it. Not only does ChemTutor teach you how to do each type of problem, it explains the individual answer for any question you don't understand. Plus, there's no need for a periodic table; ChemTutor already has one! ChemTutor also has quick references to helpful equations. ChemTutor also provides immediate feedback that tells you if you got the question right so that you can make sure you understand each concept before you move on to the next.

As a high school senior this year, my grades on chemistry tests directly correspond with my use of Chemtutor: if I don't use it, I find myself lost in the chemistry equations and concepts; when i use it effectively, I breeze through the material, often finishing my work before the rest of the class and getting high marks on it. A must for the high-school and college chemistry student."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chem's rough, but not with the help of Chem Tutor","review":"Chem Tutor has personally made this year of Chemistry go by as easily as possible. Not only did it give me a good review for tests, but it also taught me what I didn't understand in class.

Not only does it teach the concepts that are vital to success in chemistry, but it also does so in an interactive computer program that actually makes you feel like you are on a game show, but can't lose. What I mean by this is, if you get a problem wrong, it doesm't just move to the next problem, it gives you the option of reviewing the problem in the \\"Learn\\" section of the tutorial.

Buy a set of Mozart's violin concertos or maybe Don Giovanni if you're so inclined. But not this \\"potpourri excerpts from his work\\" trash.

And let's not forget the ink! THIS MACHINE IS VERY COSTLY TO OPERATE! I suppose if mine didn't jam all the time wasting so much paper, and ink I might not feel this way. Oh, did I mention the error message I get each time I plug it into my laptop; not even the Mac store can get it to go away without rebooting.The thing is a mess and was a total waste of my money.

I'm not sure if she was mistaken or I got a lemon, but I was only able to use this printer for 3 or 4 months, max. I never even made it past the cartridges that came with the printer. I got paper jams every time I tried to print, and now I guess I have an 'eternal' paper jam because it won't print at all now. I've tried everything, and I'm pretty handy with jams because I remove them all the time from a much larger printer at work. Yes, it was slower than a turtle, yes, it was always cleaning.. but at least it was better than nothing. Now I can't even say that..! What a piece of junk!

Then you have to go through the pain of taping over the window on each cartridge to get the printer to actually use the ink you paid for.

I strongly urge you to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"- You can't print unless all ink cartridges are installed and have some ink. For example, if you want to print a black/white document, your color cartridges must be installed with at least minimum ink.- The printer uses a lot of ink- I never used the color ink but somehow it is slowly going away- Paper jams are a hassle- It is completely worthless. Please, spend a little extra and get a different brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Got it for free and still disappointed!!!!!!","review":"I received this printer for free and realized that its nothing more than a glorified door stop. Extremely slow and has a major problem with knowing how much ink is actually left in the cartridges. As pricey as ink is these days, when your printer tells you your cartridge is empty and you actually see that its still about half full, there's a problem.After the paper jams, ink snafus, and mystery freeze ups, the printer just stopped recognizing that a cartridge was installed period. No matter how many times I removed the cartridge and replaced it with a new one, it kept stating that I needed to install another because nothing was registering.Will make a youtube video soon with the error and subsequent destruction of the printer by brute force!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Marvelous multifunction, best of his class in the market","review":"This is my first Brother printer.

It prints photographies with very natural colors, so as you see on your PC's monitor, and they look very beautiful even in regulatr paper. I had't try with photo paper.

I'm curious about where this ink goes. 3 replacements of 3 color cartridges = 9 cartridges of vanished ink. Probably back into the cartridge I suppose.2. Once a cartridge is empty, the printer is basically a brick until you replace that cartridge. Want to print a B&W; text document? Not gonna happen if your yellow is empty.3. Paper jams. Seems to happen mostly with photo paper.4. Print quality is annoying. There are 4 quality settings. The highest is so much ink that it's blurry. The lowest is unreadable.

Just changing the ink carts was ridiculous, as the stupid thing ALWAYS said \\"no cartridge\\" until you pounded the new one in with your fist (all three colors and black did the same thing). Had to \\"clean\\" the black each and every time I wanted to print a letter, resume, etc. More smudged and faded prints than should ever be put up with.

I figured the ones that came from the factory are not full sized as I printed maybe a document or two to test the set up. A few months later she wanted to use it to print, sign and scan a timesheet. It would not work. Carts were low again. I spent $70 for new carts and it still would not print black. Cleaned over and over again. Nothing.

The only complaint (but to me a major flaw) is that the printer uses the color cartridges up even if you do not print in color. I have set the default parameters to print in black (grayscale) only, and do not print anything in color. I STILL have to change all 3 color cartridges about every 3 months because they are empty. The factory rep (in India) explains that the printer cleans the cartridges to ensure proper ink flow, but it only uses a minute amount of ink to do so. That is simply not true.I have nothing but good things to say about Brother laser machines, but this ink jet machine is one to avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"umm...","review":"I brought this all in oneon sale about a year ago and sort of forgot about it.

It hates cardstock and it takes several tries before I can get it to go through. I can't print on anything smaller than 8 1/2 x 11 because it won't feed and keeps jamming. I try taping the small piece to a larger piece but it just chews it up. Or it will pull several papers through at a time even though I've \\"fanned\\" them.

The advantage of the clay is that you can gently \\"scratch\\" to remove any pigment you have applied pigment exposing the white surface-- in this way, you can utilize the clay to create highlights, shading, texture, and depth.Easy to use, highly recommended.

All they could do is put my first subscription on hold for 12 months until my new subscription runs out. Then restart my first subscription for the 2 months that remain on it. WSJ is inflexible and acts like they don't have anything to do with the subscriptions purchased through Amazon. I would advise anyone else purchasing a renewal to Wall Street Journal through Amazon to wait until you have about 3 weeks left on your subscription before renewing.

Since the Murdoch purchase, however, quality of the content has degraded, with many more fashion and fluff pieces. The new auto-renewal subscription tactics are not consumer friendly, to say the least. Now they are increasing my subscription fees about 200 percent. Sadly, I am cancelling my subscription and will be looking for a substitute news source."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lee's best!","review":"This a great recording that really brings out the different sides to Lee Morgan. The title track is a classic and worth the price alone. Morgan is genuinely known for a straight bebop style with great technical skill...sort of like Freddie Hubbard. But \\"Search\\" is a different side to his playing b/c it explores modal tones that are very expressive and not unlike Miles on moody pieces on like \\"Guinnevere\\". The other tunes are more akin to his style. Lee Morgan burns.I recommend this recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"go for CDs, not SD card","review":"There is no doubt that Pimsleur language programs are excellent. Pimsleur Spanish is also wonderful and I love it.However, this audiofy chip is very bad. The biggest problem is that you cannot use it on MP3 players or iPod. It is designed so that you cannot transfer the files onto MP3 players, so you have to use it on SDcard-capable pocket PCs or your computers. I should have bought the program in regular CDs because it would have been possible to listen to them on my iPod as well as transfer the program onto SD or CF card.The other problem is that this audiofy program is awkward when I need to find the exact part of lesson I want to listen to again. It is very hard to manipulate compared to regular CD or MP3 players.Therefore, I highly recommend you stay away from Aufiofy versions of Pimsleur. Instead, go for regular CDs even though it may take up some space and you may need 30minutes to transfer the program to your mp3 players or SD/CF card."},{"rating":"1","title":"not really quality","review":"the battery or something hits in a way that it constantly runs.

Great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product not as advertised","review":"I was surprised that the the cover that arrived did not match the product description. I've ordered numerous items from Amazon and had good success in the past. Unfortunately this order is a bust. There is no 'Elastic shock cord in bottom hem' to 'provide [a] slip-on, custom-like fit'. Basically it is a 5 sided plastic cube, open at the bottom, that drapes over the generator. I'd ordered this specifically for the cord in the hem to keep it in place in windy weather. Also, one corner is open and fastens with velcro. This was also not described in the product information. I'm concerned that rain will get in thru this opening, which defeats the purpose of a cover.In all I wouldn't recommend this product as a generator cover. I'm more disappointed however by the misleading product description."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as advertised","review":"The description for this cover states: \\"Elastic shock cord in bottom hem provides slip-on, custom-like fit.\\" The cover does NOT have any type of cord, drawstring, or other fasteners on the bottom to make it more secure on the generator. I have a Generac 8000 (pro series), and the cover was way too loose. In addition, the \\"heavy-duty fabric\\" is actually a very thin nylon with no type of coating to keep the elements away from the generator. Any wind more than a light breeze is simply going to rip this lightweight, loose-fitting cover off the generator. An additional note: the cover I received was NOT branded with the CLASSIC logo anywhere, as shown in the photo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Generator cover","review":"I bought this for my new Generac XP8000e and it fit like a glove.

Because my generator's handles go down vertically, before installing the cover, I heavily taped and closed the two handle openings from the inside of the cover. The generator is not even totally uncovered, with overhanging roofing above it. When I took the cover off after having some rain, the generator was wet, as was the inside of the cover. When I called Classic Accessories, I was told that water can leak through the cover's seams, even though their site states \\"maximum water resistance and repellency.\\" I can't believe that a leaking cover like this exists and strongly recommend that no one buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as described","review":"Description states elastic bottom but info that came w/cover states only on the medium.

It does cover my 7,000 watt generator but it is made of very thin material and I could have as much protection for my generator by covering it with an old sheet. It has holes for the handle but they are not in the correct place to be used with my handle. With the shipping cost it's just not worth sending it back. Maybe someone else will benefit from my experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy. Awkwardly designed","review":"I ordered this cover to try to save some money and this is truly a case of \\"you get what you pay for\\". It is very flimsy, unlike the photo. The holes are awkwardly positioned close to the top, which is important to me. With the way the holes are positioned, I am forced to run chains to the generator loosely, allowing slack where I prefer to keep the chains tight to the fence where generator is chained to in order to allow no slack for would be thiefs to have room to cut the chains. The generator is also packed in a bag (which interestingly enough has a drawstring where the cover does not.) That bag is permanently attached to the cover unless you cut it off. There is also no way to tighten the cover around the base of the generator. Very poorly made product. I should've worried less about price and more about protecting my investment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as advertised","review":"The picture of the product and its description was totally different than what I received.

There is no shock cord in the bottom edge and there are 12\\" seam openings in two corners (to allow for handles is my assumption,) but I bought this to keep rain and debris off the unit. Rain and snow would have no problem building inside the cover and a good stiff wind would likely remove it from the generator.

It reviews the history of the jet, the problems of the new jet technology and the rush to get this fast plane into the skies to knock down the Allied bombers.Lots of clear B&W; photos, technical data, line drawings help flesh out the narrative. I especially like the section on the replication of six Me -262's to fly at air shows. The author also addresses post war influence on Soviet and US designs.What's missing? Color photos or plates to show the camouflage schemes used. Willy Radinger (published by Schiffer) has a book out on the Me-262 with a little less text, but many excellent photos from WW2 jets as well as a restored 262.If yo're not a modeler, than this book is probaly the better buy.

The premise of the story, by screenwriters Frank Gruber and Alvah Bessie, is good but director Raoul Walsh isn't able to generate much energy until the actual pursuit begins. Julie Bishop is a rather weak female costar while Helmut Dantine is good at what he does best in his role as Nazi von Keller. However, Errol Flynn is good throughout giving a very realistic and determined performance.
