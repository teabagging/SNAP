Carrie covers her limited range with her head voice, sounds unpleasant and goes off on \\"Wasted\\". She probably just did not have enough time to experiment with the sound in a studio. \\"Some Hearts\\" sounded all over the place like she had not decided how to sing it yet. She did much better job with the song on Billboard Music Award show. Nothing of this matters, because Carrie has a huge following and her fans will love anything she puts out."},{"rating":"1","title":"She needs to stop singing..","review":"She isn't old enough to sing with depth and passion.

She's just a newcomer to the music industry so, I don't expect her first album to be as great as Kelly's second album or Mariah's album but, I think Carrie will become as successful as Kelly. By the way, for those of you who do not know yet,\\"Some Hearts\\" is now a Double Platinum album, her single Jesus, Take the Wheel spent six weeks at No. 1 in the country charts and now Carrie is launching her second single Don't Forget To Remember Me"},{"rating":"2","title":"Carrie Underwood - Some Hearts","review":"I give it two thumbs up! I think it's a very good album. It sounds more to me like her Greatest Hits album than her Debut album! Like what Simon told her before, whatever she sings, she sounds fantastic. This is what makes this album a great one. There are a couple of songs that i don't fancy in this album but her voice carries a beautiful essence that easily beautify a song and makes me love it eventually. There are some solid tracks in this album that makes you immediately love it in the first listen too. They are Before He Cheats, Start With Goodbye and alot more! Overall, this album does showcase what she has to show and her pipes are really powerful. Just to add some bonus stuff, she's really beautiful. All the photoshoots makes her looks so great! What a talented young lady indeed! But i got one single complaint! There's no lyrics book! Haha!!! Everyone, you got to give this new lady a try! She got the potential to be the next superstar!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good easy listening CD","review":"I like this CD very much although a lot of it is not necessarily memorable - only a few songs, but it is easy to listen to and relax..

Carrie has a great voice and a great debut.And anyone who rates the albulm less than 3 stars doesn't know music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Start","review":"Some Hearts is a good, though not fantastic, album from American Idol winner Carrie Underwood. It's modern, contemporary country with pop influences at times but not too many. There's a mix of faster stuff and ballads with some religious references, particularly in the tune \\"Jesus Take the Wheel.\\" Othewise, good tunes are:Some Hearts - the fastest, catchiest number. More pop than countryNight Before - about high school sweethearts about to be separated by the need to grow upBefore He Cheats - song with attitude, revenge on cheating boyfriend through vandalism of vehicleWe're Young and Beautiful - faster and with spiritI Ain't in Checotah Anymore - homage to hometown and recognition life has changed a lot"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Carrie Underwood","review":"This CD is great.

I just love \\"Wasted\\". It's my favorite song on the whole CD. \\"Some Hearts\\" is a good catchy fun song. I think \\"Jesus, Take The Wheel\\" is just super! \\"Lessons Learned\\" and \\"I Just Can't Live A Lie\\" really grow on you after a while...If you're going to buy only 1 CD this year, then this is the one to buy! Carrie Underwood is already a superstar!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the best!","review":"I loved her on AI, got the single for \\"Inside Your Heaven\\" and then eagerly awaited her debut CD \\"Some Hearts\\". Every song is brilliant!!! From the beginning track \\"Wasted\\" all the way to the last track, the aforementioned \\"Inisde Your Heaven\\", there is not a wasted breath. \\"Jesus, Take The Wheel\\" is the first single and the best track on the album, but they are all good... Every song on the CD has it's own unique little story and Carrie tells these stories like she's been doing it all her life.

I was. This album justifies my outrage.It is full of regurgitated country crap. Listen to the whole CD the through once and other than Inside Your Heaven (which is a badly remade version of the one she sang at the Season 4 Finale) nothing is memorable, nothing is fun, and NOTHING is impressive.Country is starting to sound the same and maybe Carrie just didn't want to be left out of the loop, but she has fallen into the same pitfall.Contender for Martina? Never. She's not even good enough to lick dung off McBride's heels.Thank God there's another season of American Idol. Maybe this time America will finally get it right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst sound in my whole life","review":"This is really horrible. It's like an ache in my ear that never goes away.

Sure, you get it fast and all, but it's all pre-packaged and stale. Music shouldn't be like fast food. If someone wants to be a singer, they shouldn't win that right on a lame tv show. They should write songs and sing them. This sounds like some Hallmark Card writer handed her the lyrics and she just sang them and let the studio workers do their thing. If she really wanted to be a country singer, she should have written some songs and gone to Nashville like everybody else. That's the problem. She didn't write anything. It was all just handed to her.If you want to hear a good cd, check out Madonna's \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor.\\" Now THAT is a great album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I LOVE SOME HEARTS!!!!","review":"ITS SO BEAUTIUFULLL.

I THINK SOME PEOPLE ARE CONFUSED IN THE RATING AS THEY ARE GIVING GOOD REVIEWS IN THE TEXT, BUT GIVING HER A 1 STAR BY ACCIDENT. THIS IS CAUSING HER AVERAGE RATING TO GO DOWN.

I thought she could sing, and it would be interesting to see what she could come up with, music wise.First of all, Some Hearts is NOT, in any way, a country album.It is one heck of a pop album if I've ever heard one. And the lyrics are quite cliche...nothing original.Carrie can do better. I don't not like Carrie, she has potential. I just wish she'd live up to it. She calls herself a country girl, so why not make the country music she wants to make, and not let the record company take over? I looked forward to hearing an American Idol prodouce a country album, but this is just pop..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring...","review":"From what I heard from American Idol I guess she is an okay singer, but she doesn't really have her own style.

I just hope that country music opens its arms to Carrie and gives her a chance to really show her talent as a country singer. I believe this album has her off to a great start and I am sure we will be hearing more from her for years to come.Some of Carrie's younger fans will be happy to get the poster of her included in this CD, but I for one would have liked to have the lyrics to read along as she sings.I hope that everyone gives this debut album a chance and listens to the range of songs that are recorded on it. Pop/Rock and country fans can all be pleased by this album and the songs included on it.

She is young but is sure to do great things in the years to come. I think she is shy, which is why many folks think she is emotionless in interviews. I was disappointed in an interview that I watched because she harldly spoke at all. I love the album and am glad I bought it. I don't, however, think most of the songs capture her big, big voice, but I doubt that SHE got to pick the songs. I look forward to more from this talented young singer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great debut","review":"I'm not a fan of American Idol nor do I watch it.

The first single \\"Jesus Take The Wheel\\" is climbing the charts and is a great emotional song.

Do they earn the least bit of respect, no? What makes her earn anything more. Her voice is far less spectacular then the voices i've heard. Especially after seeing her perform on the CMA's I was convinced of that. The CD is just not good at all. Some Hearts is a terrible album full of confused lyrics, and poor singing. Better luck next time, Carrie Nobody."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carrie Underwood deserves 0 stars!","review":"I can't believe she created an album, she didn't even deserve to win American Idol. Her fanbase may have backed her up for now but she won't last. Her music is too boring to make a dent in the industry. If she REALLY grew up and matured she wouldn't be singing with not even a drop of passion in thriving songs such as Lessons Learned and I just can't live a lie. Carrie hun, singing isn't just making things sound pretty."},{"rating":"1","title":"She needs a better band, other than that...","review":"I agree that \\"Wasted\\" was well composed, i LOVE that song. Along with \\"Jesus, Take the Wheel.\\" Those songs have a brillian musical arrangement. Her band was weak in all of the other twelve songs. It's because she sang too quiet and the band is too loud for her voice. Some of these songs are cliche also, like, 'Don't Forget to Remember Me' and 'Whenever you Remember', even 'Before he Cheats' is kind of a rip off of 'Shania Karaoke'. Overall, just not nearly good enough to take me off my feet. Good luck next time, Carrie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy Kelly's Album Instead","review":"All This girl Does is try to scream high notes and has ZERO vocal range.

Best I've Heard in Ages","review":"Carrie Underwood is great. She just needs a little bit of a better selection on her song choices. Other than that its a pretty nice and pleasant CD.

I really liked her better with black hair though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, she needs to get over herself","review":"I don't think i've ever listened to a snobbier album in my life.

Mostly because I don't think she deserved to win. Out of plain curiosity, I borrowed the cd from a friend and fell in love with it. Completely and totally in love.

America voted right!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Debut!","review":"I was a big Carrie Underwood fan during American Idol, and I knew then she would make a great artist and this CD proved me right. Every song on this cd is amazing and Carrie's voice is perfect. If I had to choose a bad song, I would say \\"I Want to Be Inside Your Heaven\\" - not the best American Idol song (Fantasia's \\"Believe\\" was much better) - but if that was the worst, then Carrie's not doing so bad. It's just not a country song, and Carrie's at her best when she's doing country music. My faves: Some Hearts, Jesus Take the Wheel, Before He Cheats, I Ain't in Checotah Anymore. But overall, a great CD and a great singer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"SIMPLY AWESOME!!","review":"All I had hoped for and more! The songs are beautiful and Carrie's voice is amazing.

Whenever You Remember, That's Where It Is and Inside Your Heaven are just dreadful songs, and Carrie ruined Wasted, Lesson Learned, and Some Hearts. The rest is just bland and forgettable. This is disturbing how many people pretend loving this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carreokie","review":"If you want bad kareoke music then listen to this boring overwrought horrific mishmash of pretense. It's one glob of pathetic production and screaming vocals. The girl needs to get a vocal coach to stop screaming. She is responsible for all the muting that went on last season on American Idol. Her voice just pierces your ears and makes them hurt. Why record a cd when you are generic, run of the mill and boring? Who would want it? I can't believe some Carriemaniac bought 50 of these and insisted on giving me one. I listened and I had to throw the cd out instead of inflicting it on someone else.Just awful.And all you little kiddies out there trying to prove a point? Amazon doesn't do hardly any of the major sales. They are a drop in the bucket. So go ahead and slam Kelly and Clay and the rest. Or maybe just get to bed."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful album!","review":"I didn't find this good at all. There seems to be people trying to decieve me, but the 4 star average proves that not everybody was satisfied with album, and i'm not one of them, what a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overly commercial, bland, mediocre 'country pop'!","review":"Listening to this CD all the way through was a very painful exercise. Our military should have used this Carrie Underwood CD to 'flush out' insurgents, not heavy metal! The music is way too commercial and boring to be taken seriously by any music lover with good taste. It is pathetic and sad how gullible the masses have become in accepting the contrived, overproduced pop stars of today, who clearly exist and are 'manufactured' by the greedy record companies to make them maximum dollars and profits. We are witnessing runaway greed and commercialism that is turning 'artists' into 'product' like never before!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Whooh shes awful","review":"She thinks shes all awesome just because Simon raved about her. She'll never top Kelly Clarkson. Kelly is the best Idol YET! That's for sure... GO KELLY! This CD stinks because every song sounds the same, she does too many corny ballads, and she isn't even good at them. Independence Day made me puke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible trash","review":"I can't believe that anybody would buy this buttered up trash. It sounds like songs that were recycled.

I particularly like \\"Before He Cheats\\" where Carrie steps away from her squeaky clean image to show she can be the woman scorned.The range of reviews reflects the variety of the contestants. Each year someone gets offended that their favorite didn't win (I admit my favorites didn't win in 2003 or 2004) but some people have the need to flame the internet with negative comments about the winner.I hope Carrie is around for a long time and drives those negative people crazy with her continued success."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome songs from the newest American Idol Star","review":"Carrie's new CD is as awesome as I expected.

It too me sounds almost like she is trying to hard to be something that she isn't. She does have a nice voice but this album doesn't show it.

I'm sorry, she just doesn't have it. I could list a review of every song but I won't, because I don't feel there was much to say about each song that would be different. They were all poorly written, poorly produced, and the audio quality is terrible. She needs to get up on her feet and learn to help herself. This is pretty pathetic, honestly. I had high expectations after winning a star studded season of American Idol. It looks like the only true winner is Kelly Clarkson."},{"rating":"1","title":"really bad music!","review":"This music is so repetitive and cheesy. All of it is, she couldn't have picked better material? Go on if you like, and buy this pseudo - country music. With tracks and lyrics like 'some hearts have the stars on their side' sounds like bubblegum to me. She needs to give it up, American Idol has done nothing for music except create manufactured artists. Real talent doesn't need a TV show to come out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hilary Duff is better!! whoohoo people","review":"If you like Carrie then you'll definately like Hilary Duff. Check out her latest album MOst WAnted! Its awesome. Carrie sings pretty on this album but I got tired of it after only like 5 days. The songs are all sad, boring songs and they get old really fast. Stinks for her, because I was hoping she would make it big. One song that did touch me however, was Jesus, Take the Wheel, which I can relate to in my personal life."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Talent","review":"She is horrible! I cannot stand her high pitched annoying voice. She ruined the songs, waste of recording space in my opinion. She can't even dance. Look at her prancing around like a happy little fish in an old field. She doesn't deserve the time of day. Wasted, Dont forget to remember me , Some hearts, Jesus take the wheel, The night before, Whenever you Remember are all poorly sung by her. All good songs... all poorly sung. Its a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"F","review":"She gets an F. This CD is terrible, every song sounds the same.

It's crazy how this girl even got a record deal, shameful if you ask me."},{"rating":"1","title":"As Lackluster as Her Personality","review":"Simon Fuller's team must be buying up truckloads of this CD for it to be selling as much as it is.................they'll do anything to prove their point, which is that this girl needs those types of devices to sell her music. It will never do it on it's own. There is nothing behind her voice, it's the same empty head we witnessed throughout the competition. What a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good job!!!","review":"I think Carrie Underwood sings pretty on some songs but on others she sounds kind of yucky. I try to stay open to a lot of artists. She's okay for a country artist~Rosita"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another \\"cookie-cutter \\"singer...","review":"Carrie Underwood sounds just like all the other good singers out there, but there's just nothing special here that stands out to me. It's as though the music industry has a big cookie cutter that they use to just produce the exact same sound and talent. Geez, can we get something new, nice and different for a change? Carrie just does nothing for me - same old thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too rushed!","review":"I know American Idol tries to get these cds out in a hurry but that is not necessarily a good thing. I like her voice, it sounds a lot better than it did on the show. That's why I gave a star. The songs stink, too much alike. I'm just telling it like it is. This is a filler cd. You have Idol to thank for that. Rush jobs hardly ever create great art. Good luck to Carrie Underwood and her nice voice. I hope she gets another chance at a cd.I hope the only release from this album is \\"Jesus takes the wheel\\". That might be less damaging than releasing songs that sound too much alike. Next time allow her to showcase her voice more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad album by American Idol Winner Carrie Underwood","review":"This album just isn't good enough. The songs are similar and she doesn't sing that well anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"shes average.","review":"what amazes me in this album is her inability to use country as her genre, but combines a bit of pop in the songs. totally am irked by her voice, there's no doubt about that. yet i feel like the album still has something. probably because i'm not really a fan of country music. but hey, she's still good at it. because of that, kudos to carrie for making a cruddy country album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Had high hopes","review":"I really had been looking forward to a great country cd.

Carrie just isn't...","review":"I'm not sure what happened to Idol since season 1 but it seemed to just have blown up, i'm sorry. Everything has been crappy since Kelly Clarkson. The trend is getting old. They can't just keep manufacturing no talents like Carrie. All she does is scream and yell with not one drop of passion in the least sense. I suggset she grow up and mature when singing a song like Wasted and see if she comes upon any newfound meaning. She sings it like an outsider who has no idea what she's singing about and needs voice enhancements. The rest of the album is just as shameful as this forsaken song. Poor lyrics."},{"rating":"1","title":"A review from somebody who used to be a fan.","review":"What happened? I loved her real performances on American Idol but this is just depressing. She comes off as such a fake girl on this album. She sounds fake too, because her music is constricted, and her voice is distant and not connective. She needs to work on her people skills before she attempts to make a dent in the industry. 1/5 stars for poor singing."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star ...","review":"This album is terrible. I saw her on the CMA's and on Jay Leno and she sang like a barbie doll. She barely even opened her mouth and one some parts she lypsynched. This CD isn't even close to being good. Especially the chorus's of the songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly Done!","review":"I don't think she did good at all on this album. I think that the good reviews were well-constructed, but lacking truth. Those who harness that will shall see demise.

This sounds like a cross between Hilary Duff and Ashley Simpson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some Hearts, Jesus, Take the Wheel, and Wasted","review":"are clearly the best songs on the album. Unfortunately, thats only 3 out of 14 that I liked. Which means I have to give it one star. It's too bad for her, I liked her on American Idol, and I was really excited about her single. However, when I bought it , I was slightly dissapointed that she put 'Independence Day' on it. I never thought she did any good with that one. This album just topped it off for me, no more Carrie Underwood purchases. :->. I was hoping this one would be better than her single but as it turned out, it was even more depressing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible release, It shoudln't have been done","review":"Carrie's all ben done before, shes just another rose in a bunch of roses, they all have pretty looks, but none of them ar erelaly different from eachother.

It was a no-brainer that she would win and I couldn't wait until she put out an album. When her single \\"Inside Your Heaven\\" was released, I played it hundreds of times & enjoyed every minute of it. But with the exception of one song on this album \\"Jesus Take the Wheel\\" her voice is wimpy and her songs uninspiring and insipid. Carrie, Carrie - where is the power, enthusiasm, and special spark you had on Idol? It's not in this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"KEllBell is amazing, Carrie, not so much","review":"I don't love this alsbum .. its okay but most of the time its just annoying to listen to. I don't like country anyway I like hard rock, but sometiems I like a soft tune to listen to. I thought this would be soft but it isn't her voice is so loud it makes your eardrums ring, oh well, i had faith in her. I was hoping she would so something impressive like Kelly did. But shes still her same boring self."},{"rating":"1","title":"LIARS! GIVE ME A BREAK","review":"Oh come on, SCOTT? There is obviously somebody creating multiple accounts, and once I found out who it is, i'm going to cut off their internet access, because i know how. Anyway, this cd is awful!

AI SUCKS","review":"I don't get this, AI sucks, nobody was any good last season. This CD is so boring, she will fade away into a nothing because she is afraid when shes unstage she looks like a dear in headlights. She can't sing worth crap she has no range, no control. She has ugly bulging teeth and bleach blonde hair that isn't attractive. She should just pack herself away, theres nothing to make her stand out. Her single 'Jesus take the wheel' pretty much flopped on radio because her video was the worst music video put out by anybody in a LONG time. Anybody who saw it knows that. That's a pretty good sign of whats to come from Carrie, more mediocrity.

All of the music on it is painful to listen to and there are many bad songs. Her current single, \\"Jesus, Take the Wheel\\" is pathetic. The upbeat songs are my least favorite but the slow songs show off her inability to think and unoriginality.

Other horrible tracks include \\"Before He Cheats\\"... which is a rude song about ruining somebodys car... would sound horrible on Country radio... also the title track, \\"Some Hearts\\" is a pop bubblegum... there really isn't a good song on here.I recommend that you don't buy any. It is THAT terrible!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain horrible~!","review":"I was so upset when I heard Jesus, Take the WHeel on the radio. This is such a bad song, it makes me cry.

Carrie is a great vocalist and Ashlee is just a manufactured artist. Carrie can easily sing songs from Ashlee..effortlessly. But Ashlee cant hit the notes in Carrie Underwood's songs.

WOW!","review":"Very good debut. Kudos to the American Idol folks for sending Carrie Underwood to Nashville and surrounding her with quality songwriters and producers. There is something for everyone on this album. She brings the songwriter's words to life on powerful, heartfelt ballads like Jesus Take the Wheel and Don't Forget to Remember Me and we get to see some personality and attitude with Some Hearts, Before He Cheats and I A'int in Checotah Anymore. Carie Underwood is one of the best new artists of the year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the wait","review":"Like American Idol predecessor Kelly Clarkson, Carrie Underwood delivers on her early promise and hands us a well put together album without filler material. Her smooth vocals are put to good use in a well chosen selection of warm country songs, and this is a debut album that most singers would give their eye teeth for.First single \\"Jesus, Take The Wheel\\" has some of the best lyrics I've seen recently, with the poignant plea:\\"Jesus take the wheelTake it from my handsCause I can't do this on my ownI'm letting goSo give me one more chanceTo save me from this road I'm on\\"Fourteen great songs, including the popular \\"Inside Your Heaven\\", make for a relaxing and enjoyable listening experience.Sometimes Simon Cowell and company get the formula just right, and this is the result of one of those times.

I am a total country music fan and expected \\"better\\" songs. In simple terms, it's a boring cd. Not the kind of cd you can just pop in the player and let it play.

It was also full of terrible songs, but look how big she is now. Shania just needed a boost, and to get her own style. Carrie definately needs her own style, she might need help in getting it too, probably because she doesn't feel any emotion. Or she hides it inside her, it just doesn't work Carrie. Pretty singing is becoming obsolete. People want something different and styleish. Thats why the most popular artists may not have the most incredible voices ever, but they offer passion and strength in what they do. Something that you seem to be critically lacking. Better luck on your next release, which I won't be purchasingScotia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carrie Underwood < Ruben Studdard < Fantasia < Kelly Clarkson","review":"Carrie Underwood's debut album is the WORST idol debut of them all. I thought that Ruben's was bad. Well it was, but not nearly as bad as Carrie's. She doesn't sing well because she never harnesses a song and takes it for what it is. All she does is sing it pretty, well let me let you in on something, pretty means nothing without a meaning. Whitney Houston could yell all she wanted too but it wouldn't mean a thing if she didn't put herself into what she sings. You've got quite a few lessons to learn little girl. Until you do, you won't have any worth in this industry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is she singing pop or country?","review":"I bought this because I thought it was a pop cd like Kelly Clarkson. But it sounds like a bad example of a country cd. I don't even like country that much, and I certainly hated this. She sounds like a yodeling goat on half of the songs. Especially on \\"We're Young and Beautiful\\". That's such an ugly song, and her voice makes it worse. Better luck next time, you young, neive girl."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is 1 Star the lowest ??","review":"I would like to give zero stars for this awful album.

It has it allCons It is a Country Album - This is only a con if you're looking for a LOT of variety.Less than Incredible Tracks - Like all CDs, this one has a couple songs that won't wow you.Substance - Some would say she doesn't move much beyond her AI image her. But is that bad?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Its good!!!","review":"First, brutal honesty. I live here and don't like country music. I know, I know. Nonetheless, I was rooting for Carrie Underwood on American Idol. She's sweet, pretty and an Oklahoma native. What else could you want?Her debut is good, and I highly recommend it. If you don't like country, you'll still enjoy this. But there's no doubt she is a country singer, and she doesn't go much beyond her Idol image. That won her the crown, though, so it's probably a wise move for the first album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as bad as everyone says, still not worthy","review":"Still only gets 1 star from me, no matter how good everyone says it is. I am just saying my honest opinion, that it doesn't deserve anything better than 1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"really dissapointed with Carrie","review":"As most of the reviews on this album reveal, she has little emotional understanding of the events and lifechanging situations in which she sings about so openly. I hope for her sake that she keeps trying."},{"rating":"1","title":"pathetic artist!!!","review":"Inside your heaven is the only song on this album worth listening too! She needs to help herself by singing with more passion. it's her own fault. I just wish that she would see that is is a beautiful girl. If only she would sing every song like she sings 'Jesus Take the Wheel' then we'd have something! The other ones are just dreadful, and it isn't my fault that she put out a bad album, and its my prerogative to write this review that her album is awful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"she is a mediocre artist!","review":"In general, I would have to say that I've wasted my money on this buy.

As a musician, Carrie has great phrasing and expression, and also possesses a handful of controlled vocal nuances. You feel that she has thought through and carefully crafted each song.While she has a very pleasant sweetness to her voice, she has range/flexibility and proves she is able to growl in \\"Before He Cheats.\\" She has created a solid, well-knit and consistent-sounding CD. The track placements were also great - each song contributed somewhat to the track preceding and following.My only reservation on this CD is \\"I ain't in Checotah anymore.\\" The tune is very catchy but it borders on \\"too Country Cheeseball\\" for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tremendous Debut!","review":"The whole CD is great. I can't stop listening! What a great, pure, and refreshing voice!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disregard the 5 star reviews..","review":"I find it interesting that people have inflicted such lies about this CD. It is not a good cd, it doesn't not have a good production crew, and the lyrical selection is even worse. I would suggest turning away now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hillary Duff Goes Country !","review":"If you are under the age of 13, this is a great album. If you like real music by people who can actually \\"write their own material,\\" go buy a Martina McBride or Sugarland CD. This girl is selling a good amount of CD's, but if you gave ANYONE the amount of publicity she's had the past 6 months they would sell CD's as well (see Ashley Simpson). The song's on this album are very boring and slow."},{"rating":"1","title":"gorgeous woman, but havent we had enough of this?","review":"ok first I just wanna say that if the 1 star in this review is worth anything, it's for Carrie Underwood's looks, because she is very very hot and I enjoy looking at her... however, I think American Idol is really starting to wear out its welcome.. and of course if it doesnt make it bad enough that American Idol squeezes out annoying pop singers, Carrie is... a country singer... Yep, country, that means whiny sappy songs about how the pickup trucks won't start so we can't go see Jeff Gordon win the NASCAR race at Dover Downs... boo hoo hoo....So yea, just stick with Carrie's music videos, and if you actually want to hear something close to country that doesn't suck, may I suggest Rebel Meets Rebel, David Allan Coe's collision with Pantera.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull dull dull and more dull, don't waste your time on this","review":"This is a very boring same old same old cd from a singer with no personality whatsoever. Every song sounds the same and is instantly forgettable. Kelly rocks and you should check her out. That's where it's at. The contrast is laughable. Carrie Underwood just doesn't have what it takes. Some Hearts is a horrible song. It irritates tremendously. It will make your ears bleed. The song Wasted? You will surely feel you have wasted your money on this one. Fans of good music, check out Breakaway by Kelly Clarkson."},{"rating":"1","title":"She really isn't very good...","review":"I never enjoyed her single and I hated her album! Yuck, just not worth it. Save your money for something else..."},{"rating":"1","title":"her five minutes of fame are over","review":"Carrie, please stop trying to nudge yourself into country. You are an amateur and country doesn't need it. I've given you a fair chance, and you are just another one of those singers who fades in the backround and never seems to come back out. It's because you just aren't talented enough to make a dent in the industry. It has nothing to do with you personally, just your singing ability. This CD has more ballads than it does hits. Of course, its hard to relate to any of these songs because of their limited circumstance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carrie Underwood","review":"Carrie Underwood Stinks! I don't like this CD at all, she needs to work on her vocals."},{"rating":"2","title":"American Idol","review":"I was so happy when Carrie won American Idol! She is just an amazing singer and beautiful young lady. She has such a pretty voice. I think that she has a good cd out and will make many more! Go Carrie!!! Carrie's voice is just simply so incredible. Her live performances on American Idol finale are so strong even after weeks competitions.Carrie is the REAL DEAL, GET ON BOARD!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Carrie Underwood's voice shines!","review":"I loved Carrie's singing voice on American Idol. However, I never thought we got to hear it enough and so I was very excited to get this cd and I was not disappointed. I wouldve loved to have seen a LITTLE more pop music on it (rather than mostly country) and wouldve loved a duet with Bo Bice as a treat, but overall the cd is a definitely a showcase for her amazing voice. It shows that Carrie is more than capable of holding her own against all the current country favorites. (Faith Hill, Martina McBride, LeeAnn Rimes, etc.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing and enjoyable","review":"To start off this is a great album. She is a wonderful singer who has a stong, powerful voice. Some of the best songs are \\"Jesus Take The Wheel\\" \\"Before He Cheats\\" and \\"Start With Godobye\\". The only problem with this album is that it needed and still needs more promotion."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Rock, Carrie!","review":"No wonder Billy Currington said that you are his Idol now.

If you like Faith Hill and Leanne Rhimes, then you will like Carrie Underwood."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Truth: Amazing Vocal...","review":"First of all, I am located in Asia, We watch AI4, and I grew to respect Miss Underwood through out the competition.Country has not been popular here, but only few crossovers get to succseed to hit the top 40 charts, so I am not that familiar with country music, but I grew to respect more of this genre while watching Carrie perform some on the show.When I received her album today and listened a few times, I am amazed on how talented this young lady is, and listening to her songs I also realized that her vocal performance are amazing.Few songs have succsessfuly got stuck in my head, I dont often get this... so this is a good thing. I like 75% of the songs in her album, very enjoyable to listen.So for people who are still wondering if it is worth to buy because this is pop country... I say you have nothing to loose but will gain an enjoyable music to listen at any time of the day on all occasion."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"Unoriginal, very non-compelling music. I recently purchased this CD and wish I didn't. I expected better, but it seems like she's a puppet to a larger corporate system. The music has NO appeal and has nothing to distinguish itself from other bland music.I am so disappointed in today's music. No thought, no compassion... this is a prime example. Do not buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"I wish I could say otherwise, but this sweet, beautiful young woman is nothing but mere fluffer. She has no talent whatsoever and it's practically due to her emotional or lack there of state.

I hate this music, every song sounds all the same to me. She needs to learn something about music and stop being afake lypsyncher. She's a very bad blonde."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bubblegum is all she can do....","review":"Its true, the whole thing is bubblegum. It takes practically not alent to do bubblegum, and thats all she can do, therefore, it isn't impressive and its just flat out bad. She sucks even at her best genre, country. Thats gotta hurt..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where do people get off saying its a Great CD????????","review":"This cd is not great to say the least.... She sounds the same throughout the album and is squelling in a high pitched horror.. Please people tell the truth she is a one star singer and will be gone as fast as you say Carrie.."},{"rating":"1","title":"She's no Idol","review":"Blonde generic very dull, can't compete with the likes of the people who she tries to imitate because she has no personality or drive. She doesn't need music. She uses it. There has only been one American Idol and that is Kelly. Look at the awesome success Breakaway is having and Carrie thinks she can duplicate that, but she can't because she can't even measure up to Kelly on any of her music. There is not one truly good song on this cd. I'm really upset because my grandmother decided to get me this because she likes boring sappy music. I thought she would know better. I love rock and I love Kelly. Of course, I already have Breakaway. But I'd rather have 10 copies of the same thing than Carrie's which I gave to my dog to play with."},{"rating":"1","title":"SORRY","review":"This is just simply cookie cutter music!

It's terrible. I played it once, and I'm going to return it to the store by Tuesday. Once people hear her jittery voice and these poorly written songsas. I haven't been this horrified by a singer in a long time. She is the most run-in the mill singer i've heard in ages. This girl is headed for the biggest flop in history, against Madonna pschh please. Each song on this CD is worse than the last one, and the first one ain't good. I can't even pick a worst. They're all just awful. Anyone who buys this will be disappointed, that I can guarantee you, whether they're fans of country music or not. It is one sided. I see some good reviews on here. The only thing I can say is, why don't you really tell the truth, and say how bad this cd truly is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another CD from a mediocre artist...","review":"I don't believe most of these reviews. All I know is this is a mediocre album. Ther isn't much that seperates it from the croud. Except maybe one song, that being, Jesus, Take the Wheel. Its a typical AI follow up cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"She has a black soul.... I hate this CD it makes me depressed","review":"I thought she was supposed to sing country, by definition the music of the lord. She minus well sing hard metal because her lyrics are depressing and forlorn. They make me cry and make me depressed. I really dislike the way she does this so very harshly. It hurts an old hag like my heart. Hopefully I will feel better once I return it to the store..Mary Lue Finnius."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contrived. Not fun. Terrible production.","review":"I'm not giving a bad review just to bash Carrie. I kind of liked her on American Idol.But this album is such a let down. I feel like she recorded it for right wing America because that's what's in right now. I listened, and i won't be buying. I've persauaded several people not to buy it as well, becuase it is dissapointing, with horrible production, and obvious lyrics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just awful","review":"I don't get this. She is horrible, she is completely bonkers for releasing this trash. I can't even believe how horrible it is. The worst song is Lessons Learned and the Best Song is Inside Your Heaven because it's the last song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible!","review":"This is by far the best album I've listened to in years! Carrie is truly an amazing musician and her vocals are flawless. I'm sure we'll be seeing a lot more of Miss Underwood in the future! She's done America proud and has opened the world up to country music. Definitely get the album...it's well-worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful CD!!!","review":"Growing up I listened to the Beatles a lot but not much newer stuff. Then I started watching American Idol and was captivated by the talented voice of Carrie Underwood. \\"Some Hearts\\" does not disappoint. It has 14 very well-crafted pop/country songs. The best of which is probably \\"Jesus, Take The Wheel\\". A song which has a great message but doesn't come across as preachy. Everyone can relate to it. It's also cool to see someone born not even 2 months after me doing so well for herself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT","review":"Some Hearts is my FAVORITE CD of all time! I love every song and even Inside Your Heaven is okay, but it's not the best song and I still think Angels or Trouble or something from IDol should have been on in place of that song, but it's not Carrie's fault!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"She's inside our heaven!","review":"Extremely brilliant job! Good first album!Her vocals really come out in this album.Can't believe she can pull her voice for over 20 seconds without any flat or not so good notes.Bravo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST IDOL EVEEEEERRR!!!!!","review":"This new CD is amazing. In fact, I'm listening to it right now in my dorm room haha....anyway, all of the songs are fantastic, honestly, any of these songs could be released as singles. My favorites are \\"Wasted\\", \\"Some Hearts\\", \\"Lessons Learned\\", as well as \\"That's Where It Is\\". But truly, the CD is simply amazing. A MUST BUY!!!! SO GET UP, AND GO GET IT!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Saw her at the Grand Ole Opry and bought her album","review":"It is an awesome album, every song sounds great! There really isn't much more to say about it. 5 stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted, Jesus, Take the Wheel, The Night Before","review":"The best songs EVAR! Just kidding, they're actually the worst songs on the album. In fact, she needs to get some voice lessons, her voice cracked about 5 times on this CD. Every song sounds the same, if you actually liked this girl you would tell the truth and let her know that she stinks. You are being decieved by rabid Carrie fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst album of 2005","review":"She sounds awful on wasted, constricted on Dont forget.. and she sounds like a bublegum pop artist on some hearts. She is terrible all i had to do was listen to 3 songs and i knew. Give it up Underwood, you can't sing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree with Mary Todd, people are stealing my reviews!","review":"People are stealing my reviews and copying my comments. If amazon doesn't put an end to this I won't be shopping here anymore. I'm sorry but it's true. The truth is that Carrie's album is sub par., and that if she wants ot gain country fans, like she has taken a gander at, then she will need to fail."},{"rating":"1","title":"She fails!","review":"She'll never be good enough! I don't think that she can ever be good enough after the profound dissapointment from her last album. please keep me updated with her latest releases. Anyway, she should've tried harder. most artists are judged on their debut album and she just acts as if its nothing else! She just complains about how horrible her lif once was. Please, shes only 18 years old. Grow up little girl and stop complaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album sucks!","review":"Wow, some loser is actually wasting their time rewriting other peoples reviews!

Anyway, this CD sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sombody stole my review so i'm writing another one","review":"I'm sorry but i'm not going to stand by while somebody copies my review and twists my words. The truth about this album will stand. She sounds horrible. Every song is similar, making it hard to point out the differences between them. She sings dryly, with the same, high pitched voice. She lacks range and power. She seems to be like another one of those country singers who lurks into the shadows. Wasted is the best song on the album, of course, but nevertheless, the album is awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carrie shouldn't have started this singing business!!","review":"I wish Carrie never went into singing.

She would be an awesome artist had she just sung with more individuality and boldness. Best of luck to her in the future though, she seems like a perfectly nice girl. Just not too rewarding a career with this dismal outlook."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is a GEM!","review":"As a fan of Americana, I really am not one who likes the changes Country music has seen over the past 10 years or so. The trend toward Country-Pop has been very intimidating to me as my old favorites become more and more dated. Faith Hill, Shania Twain and all the rest rule \\"country\\" these days. I blindly started making the same assumptions about Carrie Underwood, lumping her in with all of the other \\"country-pop\\" singers. I said on many other boards that she was a \\"pop tart\\" and that she was going to ruin and censor Country music.After finally actually listening to the CD this weekend though instead of blindly bashing it, I have done a complete 180 on Carrie. The CD is very good and the girl has an amazing vocal range. I'm really into \\"Before He Cheats\\". It sounds very much like old-school Country! Even the popish songs like \\"Some Hearts\\", \\"Lessons Learned\\" and \\"I Just Can't Live A Lie\\" are good.OK, you guys win! I'm impressed! My Carrie-bashing days are all but over."},{"rating":"2","title":"I go Yeah Yeah Yeah","review":"Solid album! I love alot of teacks in this album especially Jesus Take The Wheel!

Get it to number one!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST DEBUT ALBUM EVER !!!","review":"Wow!!! What can't i say? Some Hearts is the best debut album ever. All of the songs are amazing. I think Carrie will be a super star. This is a country album but this girl can sing anything she wants. Her vocals are just unbelievable!!! This album was cataloged as the 2006 Album of the Year in Billboard.Carrie is also the reigning CMA Female Vocalist of the Year, which is one of the highest honors for any country artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"My New Favorite!","review":"Carrie Underwood was my favorite on American Idol, so I knew that I was going to buy her CD. What I didn't know was that I would like it so much. She is an amazing country singer. This is definitely her genre. Her voice is strong enough, though, that if she does decide to be a cross-over singer it would work.The songs on this album are soulful and heartfelt. I know that most of the songs were not written by her, but listening to her sing them make me feel like she is putting her heart and soul into the song. She's going to be a huge star someday.I would recommend buying this album if you liked her on the show and/or are a fan of country music. She is a strong singer."},{"rating":"1","title":"kelly clarkson is the real winner of all seasons and","review":"bo should've won! i voted for him all night, and he still didn't win.

They don't care that there are interesting and creative artists aplenty out there for those willing to discover them - no, they want nothing but vacant bimbos who happen to have nothing but a good voice, singing over generic pabulum that they didn't write or produce. The only good thing to come out of the Carrie Underwood/Clay Aiken/Ashlee Simpson/Britney genre is the fact that their careers are over in less than a year. I, on the other hand, will continue to enjoy CD's that I still love after 5, 10 and 15 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible the majority of people know","review":"You little tykes can spam up a page can't you? Well I just would like to say that this cd is completely sub par. Jesus take the wheel is such a bunch of bolognia, she throws her cheesy conservative views on us, what a burden. She didn't even write any of this music, she CO wrote one song, how awful is that? All of these songs are typical, generic, boring, disgusting, ugly, gross, hideous, pathetic, simple, dumb, closed minded, however you want to say it. She doesn't impress me in the least, and the majority of people i've talked to have hated this album and gave it away. Everyone hates it and most of people hate her, nobody liked her at all since AI, and now a few people like her but they are just little teeny boppers.

Get lost little girl, go back and milk a cow, the music industry doesn't need you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop polluting the reviews with 5 stars!","review":"You are lying!

Lets give this Carrie a try. I went through every other track on this release and found nothing. No kick, no energy. I can't even play this while I'm driving, not for just one song. I need music that gets me going. All the songs are so mellow. I regret buying it and I was wrong trying to do what a few people are trying to talk me into doing and that is listening to country.

Kelly is better","review":"Kelly did amaing all though the show american idol, and her cd was fantastic and mature. Carrie did great on the show too but on this CD she sounds awful.

It sounds like bad pop if you ask me, it isn't catchy to start with, and it doesn't leave an impression on you. The songs get old very fast, beware. Anybody who isn't obsessed with Carrie gets tired of her, sorry the personality / soul isn't there. Grow some spirit, Carrie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Carrie has a nice voice, so I was expecting this cd to at least be enjoyable. Unfortunately it sounds way over-produced, which is unnecessary because she can actually sing. It sounds like her voice has been processed through a machine. There's absolutely no passion or feeling. Very few of the songs are catchy. Every track is pretty medicore, except for the title track which is kind of awful. It's a pretty forgettable album, and I'm irritated that I wasted my money on it. Hopefully her next album will be A LOT better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not here to just bash Carrie.","review":"I'm not here to bash Carrie Underwood or her new album by any means. She, in a way, deserved to win American Idol by all means, and she has a beautiful voice. This album was just dissapointing, though. Her first single is the only really good track. Better luck for Carrie in the future, as she seems like a perfectly nice woman. She just needs her own style, like other reviewers have said. Though I do like her, if you were looking for a better American Idol effort, go for Kelly Clarkson's Breakaway album, which is definately an outstanding winner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated.","review":"I expected this CD to be at the very least good if not great.

Well maybe not all of it, she will have much success in country, but if placed in any other genre she would fail horribly. She is just too boring to succeed in anything else.

Anyone thinking about buying this should consider a real country album like Gretchen Wilson-she doesn't sell out and sing pop song's on her album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Music by a Terrible Artist","review":"1 star. She fails to impress me in any way. Her first single 'Jesus, Take the Wheel' is meant to be sung with power, and she fails to do that. She only sings with her poor vocal chords. Which fail to carry her beyond amateurism. I hope that she improves or else, she'll be taking the short road to failure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good For Insomnia","review":"This CD is boring. It was like I was listening to one long boring song. It wasn't funky, groovy, or mellow at all. Carrie Underwood has no personality and she's as interesting as oatmeal at the end of the month. I can't see her bringing anything new to the table at all. She's not going to be as big as Fantasia or Kelly. Carrie will fade into oblivion just like Reuben. Next!"},{"rating":"1","title":"really bad","review":"I bought this CD because I bought a few other American Idol CD's and I thought they were good, it wasn't the case.

I wouldn't buy this for my daughter any day of the week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont Forget to Remember Me is the only memorable song","review":"The rest sound VERY similar.

It wasn't wise of her to choose ballads to sing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Informative, but..","review":"Good look at the scene, some interesting remarks and trivia, but the section in the back that purports to be a psychedelic music buyer's guide is simply terrible. I mean, according to that part of the work, Santana is a horrible act, Cream are the most overrated band in history, The Doors were only good for the debut album, King Crimson is totally bad.. etc, etc...music is a subjective thing, true, but come on..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Informative, yet lack of skill in writing.","review":"This book was pretty sufficient in that it gave quite an exploration of a wide variety of bands. Though the problem is that these authors are too cynical and too snooty to cover this in a full length book. When they are critical of a scene, they use big words but are then able to describe why."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful but rewatchable","review":"This gem from 1979 combines some really awful mutant bear effects with an environmental twist. It seems some big, bad paper mills have been polluting the upper Maine area for years, and now the effects of this pollution, such as giant tadpoles, inedible fish, and of course the monster bear, are all coming home. Indian tribes are complaining, too, and Robert Foxworth and his pregnant wife Talia Shire travel up there to make sense of the mess. John Frankenheimer had descended a long way down the ladder when this film came out, and despite its sheer awfulness, it is compulsively re-watchable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just kill the confounded bear already!!","review":"Ahh, yet another B-rated monster movie. Just like many others of its kind, it sucks. While it had its scary moments, I looked to it more to be a movie where you sit down with some friends and poke fun at the funny parts (i.e. the bear throwing the old man around, the part where the bear hit the kid in the sleeping bad and he flew at about 500 mi/hr into a rock, etc.) and rewind to see them over again. This often prompts me to say in a Marv Albert type voice, \\"Let's see that again!\\" All in all, it had a good plot, but it was just boring. If this movie were remade today with the advancements we have with special effects, this movie could be saved from the burning pits of B-rated movie Hell and possibly grip my interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful 70's Eco Tripe","review":"I can't belive that I was actually scared by the so-called \\"monster\\" in this film almost 20 years ago.

Overall this movie is so poor it was terribly funny. The acting is atrocious and the overall quality was a pile of dung. If you want a great movie to laugh about and make fun of with some buddies this is it."},{"rating":"1","title":"MUTANT MISERY","review":"Considering the pedigree of this late 70s film, it should have turned out much better: a script by David Seltzer (the original OMEN) and director John Frankenheimer (MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE original). However, PROPHECY falls flat on its face, becoming a tired, dull and disjointed thriller focusing on the effects of mercury poisoning.Ghetto doctor Robert Foxworth and his cellist wife Talia Shire are asked to go to the New England forests to decipher any ill effects from the large paper mill there. Native Americans led by Armand Assante and Victoria Racimo are protesting the cutting down of their forests, and when several people start turning up dead, the Indians are blamed. Turns out however that the mercury being dumped into the water supply is creating savage deformed mutants, including some of the hokiest creatures ever assembled. The main monster is an overgrown bear. There's little suspense or novelty in this film and the performances all look called in. A real disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"bear's a wimp- he should've done that to THEIR faces","review":"the title of this message sums it up. All 70's-80's horror flicks suck big time. This bear should have done that to THIER faces he is a bear after all. Grizzly bears(esp mutant ones) can pretty much win every fight and would maim the victim eventually. A human cutting up a bear with a knife and drowning it? c'mon, man! Watch \\"Grizzly\\" instead. Yeah it's early 70's feldercarbon, but it is very disturbing to the eye(s)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"\\"Prophecy\\" might have been a good monster movie-but they forgot to create a good monster.

I saw this film back in 1980 and it scared the pants off of me and I viewed it again in almost 32 years later and it's still good. The acting was superb and they storyline was great. Can't wait for it to be released on Amazon instant Video."},{"rating":"2","title":"B-movie to the Max","review":"This was one of the first horror movies I had ever seen. To be honest, it scared the crap,out of me as a child. I remember being genuinely terrified when the boy in the yellow sleeping bag was swatted into the rock by that hideous mutant bear (played by Kevin Peter Hall, who played Predator). I finally got around to watching it again after some years and i still get chills from creepy music and spooky forest shots. Probably the most unsettling thing about the movie is the bizarre huffing noise the monster makes. If I heard that out in the woods, I would probably pee myself. I'm pleasantly surprised to see how popular the film is nowadays; I always notice it being played on AMC and Showtime. I'm sure that if a little more time and money went into the movie, it would be even more popular. This is certainly one of the coolest B- movies I've ever seen. I would recommend watching this with the lights out and a bowl of popcorn in lap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious!","review":"A giant rubber bear with a melted face chases people around in the woods and hilarity ensues. The sleeping bag scene will make you laugh out loud. My favorite part of the movie occurs when the characters consult with \\"Grandfather,\\" a sage and wise old Indian shaman who resembles \\"Ernie Douglas\\" from the TV show \\"My Three Sons.\\" The fact that \\"Ernie\\" keeps staring and grinning at the camera makes it that much more funny. When the characters are chased into a cabin, they begin sealing up doors and windows with a multitude of hammers and nails that seemingly appear out of thin air. And when things get really dicey, they flee into an extensive underground tunnel system located conveniently under the floorboards. Hey, it could happen!Amazing to believe that this mess was directed by John Frankenheimer.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No CGI = horror at its best.","review":"I first saw this movie as a child and it scared the living crap outta me. As I grew up and watched many horror movies along the way, this movie always stuck in my head. The way they shot the monster and its movements, especially in the night scenes were just horrifying. I thought this movie was out of print and so I haven't seen the movie since I was a child. I recently bought it on amazon. Even though I'm a 34 yr old man, I still found my self scared and tense the entire movie. I consider this one of my favorite all time movies. I you're not sure about buying it, then find a place to rent it...I guarantee you'll buy it soon after."},{"rating":"1","title":"Politically correct horror movie?","review":"I like a good,solid, horror flick as much or better than the next fanboy.Unfortunately,Prophecy: The Monster Movie is a shining example of what occurs when you bring environmental political correctness into the mix.No mad scientists or supernatural creatures of the night.Instead we get a mercury poisoned grizzly bear that attacks a couple of scientists in the wilderness of the northeast.Stupid script and wooden acting make this the worst movie I have ever seen in all of my years upon the earth.(And I have seen some bad ones).I originally saw this in a theater and this was the first time I walked out and told the management I wanted a refund.I can't even imagine the zealots from Earth First sticking around and watching this dead fish rot on screen.I would be hard pressed to choose between having to watch this movie or have somebody use a hot soldering iron to burn their initials on my scrotum.To sum it up,yes,it sucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slept like a Baby!!","review":"I drifted off into a deep sleep after listening to this tape.

I know he's trying, but I guess someone telling me to \\"go to sleep\\" over and over doesn't work for me. His calmness meditation CD actually works better for me, maybe because it doesn't get me thinking about sleep. I think a \\"sleep\\" CD almost brings out performance anxiety in me or something. I can't recommend this one, based on my own experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good to fall asleep the first time at night.","review":"As I said in the title, this works quite well at helping me fall asleep the first time that I use it at night.

It does help me to sleep through the night. I'm glad I bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not very useful","review":"The claim that this somehow puts you in a trance or a state like hypnosis is bunk. It helps marginally to get you relaxed but not nearly as good as a decent book for pleasure reading. Honestly, I think what the speaker is doing more or less is trying to bore you until you doze off.I'd have given this 1 star, but I figure it's helping some people, so I didn't want to be overly negative based on my own experience.I ultimately got a prescription product that is working well. If you have mild or occasional insomnia, perhaps this will help you, but I had to turn elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Voice is irritating","review":"I bought the tapes Deep Sleep Every Night and A Guided Meditation several years ago and had to give them away because his voice is distracting and irritating.

THIS IS NOT SUBLIMINAL. I've used subliminal messaging in the past and the point of it being subliminal is that you aren't supposed to hear the person speaking.

The steering column couldn't be screwed in because the hole was not drilled the correct way. I did ask for a replacement, and it is on it's way. I am hoping that the second one is better because my son was looking forward to using it on the 2 feet of snow we had.I returned the original sled and received a replacement that was perfect.

It also includes a behind-the-scenes from her movie \\"Crossroads\\". The only bad thing about this DVD is that it is only like 30 minutes, whereas her previous ones were more close to a full hour at least. And also, there is nothing in here that you can't see on TV.

And then there's \\"Not A Girl Not Yet A Woman\\"...no argument there. Then Behind Crossroads. Which is interesting...but not. And then her \\"Overprotected\\" performance. And that's it.

By that time, you can't take it back. It would be ridiculous to waste any amount of money on this skimpy DVD.

They would be wasting money to make another DVD with the same concert on it, so people really shouldn't leave a bad review, if they aren't using their common sense.

I didn't even read it until I bought the book at the age of 16. Any time since then that a person has asked me how they can learn to draw super heroes, I always reference this book. I tell them to skip the reading, draw everything, and then go back to read it, then draw everything after they do that.It's an easy read and was truely inspirational to me in developing my own style of comic art.

I grew up reading Marvel comics and had the good fortune that my parents went grocery shopping at a small neighborhood store where the owner allowed me to read the comics while they shopped.Therefore, I read this book not as an aspiring artist, but as someone who is interested in and can appreciate the artistic talent that went into making Marvel comics the success that it is. And from that perspective, this is an excellent book. In a few captions and example illustrations, the many ways in which the dramatic effect can be enhanced are demonstrated. Using these techniques the superheroes appear more heroic and the villains even more villainous.If you are like me and just appreciate Marvel comics or want to become a better artist, then this is a book that will be of great value to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"How to draw comics the Marvel way is good but old!","review":"How to draw comics the Marvel Way is a good book but it's very old information.

I like this How to draw comics the Marvel Way! book written by Stan Lee with artwork by John Buseama, but the books information is too old. I think comic book artists today use better materials besides paint brushes and india ink. You buy Markers with india ink in them at an artsupply store. there are other things in this book that do not appy to comic books in 2008 as well.

In short, it's as instructional as a Lee Ames book, and that's not saying much. Besides, in light of the new direction that comic books are going these days, it's a bit dated. If you really want to get into comics, here are four great books to get you started: The Encyclopedia of Cartooning Techniques (an overview of cartooning, from technical stuff to business aspects), The Encyclopedia of Fantasy and Science Art Techniques, Chris Hart's How To Draw Animation (because animation helps a lot, kids!), and let's not forget Wil Eisner's great book that started it all!

However when it does get to drawing figures it certainly gives lots of good examples.You won't be Jim Lee when you are done with this book, and you probably won't be drawing any of the \\"bad girl\\" characters made popular in the 90's.

I recently had an EKG quiz, and totally bombed it. Then I got Thaler's, and got almost every question right on the make-up exam. The problem with this book is that it doesn't go into enough detail to help you understand major important points of each EKG issue. For example, for left bundle branch block, it's important to know that you need to look at leads V5 and V6. Thaler tells you this; Dubin doesn't.

The level of detail and well grounded review of EKG tracings allow you to better understand the physics behind the waves and build upon it to help understand the more complex topics to follow.However, I have never read any other EKG books, so I cannot compare it with other texts.

Now in its sixth edition, it's been around quite a while (the basic principles have changed little in 30 years). I have to say, this book lives up to the hype as an educational tool. The author does a good job with USEFUL diagrams (and a lot of them are fun!), review questions and repetition with key points, giving you the basics without being too sketchy... he starts from the very beginning, how much time is in one of those little squares, and builds from there, covering rate, rhythm, vectors, and then goes into hypertrophy and infarctions/ischemia.As a couple of small quibbles, he could expand the MI section a bit, it seems to be a little more rushed than some of the other areas. In addition, more practice EKGs would be nice, though there are other books and online stuff for that.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"If you've never seen an EKG before, this book is perfect.

It explains everything in such easy to understand language, unlike many medical texts which seem to throw as much jargon as they can at you. I feel like I could hand this to a person with no medical knowledge and after a week, they could read an EKG pretty damn accurately. Although it's 300+ pages solely on EKGs, every page is about 1/3 filled with an illustration, and the type is large and spaced out. Aka, its a very quick read.

I struggled with EKG interpretation even after reading this book. Other classmates expressed the same feelings. A large reason for this is that Dubin uses a ridiculous fill-in-the-blank approach that favors rote memorization over true understanding. It actually becomes more distracting to learn with this method than to just read an narrative explanation.Judging from the favorable reviews listed here, this book is probably better suited for other medical personnel such as paramedics, nurses, and technicians.

Wow...no wonder she IS a disney star and doing NOTHING now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Resistible","review":"One star is too much to give Jessica Simpson's latest cd, \\"This Is The Remix.\\" This album had hardly any publicity and is more like a higher priced cd single than an album. Sadly some tracks have more than one remix which makes this cd a waste of money. I am a Jessica fan and have her two previous cds which by the way are great. Please don't waste your money on this album/single and buy something worth buying like Britney's latest, \\"Britney\\" or \\"Fever,\\" by Kylie Minogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can do without this!!!","review":"I'm a Jessica Simpson fan, and even I don't find this worth buying! Sure, I like I Wanna Love You Forever (Soul Solution Radio Remix), Irresistible (feat. Lil' Bow Wow), and A Little Bit (Greek Club Mix). But the rest of the tracks are club mixes consisting of mostly a background beat, and not much in the way of lyrics. They seem to go on for a good half hour!! Great for a D.J., but not for the rest of the public!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a Remix Album Worth Owning.","review":"This is the type of Remix album that I've been waiting for. After getting Jennifer Lopez's and Destinys Child I was very disappointed. While there songs where just variations on the original, Jessica Simpsons remixes or Dance Club remixes. Jessica gets the full dance remix treatment from some of the club scens top remixers such as Soul Solution, Lenny B, and Hex Hector. The best dance remixes are Lenny B's remix of I Think I'm in Love With You, Hex Hectors remix of Irresistable, and Chris the Greeks remix of A Little Bit. Jessicas voice is already powerful, but the remixers go all out making her voice soar above the techno beats. The only problem is that there are only 7 tracks. Where is Where You Are? Her duet with Nich Lachey.Other than that, a must have for all Jessica Simpson fans and club music fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dance track Diva","review":"As previous reviewers have noted, this album has been released probably due to the success of J Lo's remix album and DC disappointment remix album.Let's be clear on Jessica Simpson's version. This is not an album but rather a maxi-single packaged into an EP album. Included are 4 versions of I Wanna Love You Forever, two mixes of Simply Irresistible and the track A Little Bit.Dance club fans will notice the Hex Hector Club Mix of Simply Irresistible. The other version is with Lil Bow Wow. Again, another artist branching out of her normal audience to try and capture another audience, i.e. Jennifer Lopez. It works for some and doesn't for others, I will let you decide on this version.Overall, a great cd to dance around the house or jam out in the car. Jessica has vocals that soar beyond Britney. These teen divas in training have some powerful vocals and Jessica is one of them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"so she isn't perfect..........","review":"Okay she is no Mariah Carey (although often compared to her. Jessica doesn't song write as well as her.) She has Britney Spears appeal (although not as good as her.) Not as smart as Mandy Moore (wow it's a pattern) and doesn't have good voice compared to Christina Aguilera. She is average at all of them making her not have something that makes her the best. She does have the best realtiy show out of all of them. She is good at the moment as she is playing her cards well. Good for you Jessica Simpson."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOTAL BS","review":"Total B*%#@&!t. If women do not like working in pornography, or the adult industry then don't do it, get a regular job.

But there is absolutely nothing good about this phone; hissing background white noise, static reception, and the people on the other end rate their reception as muffled.The AT&T; brand name attracted me to this phone. Shame that they would put out such a chinzy product. . . . . Since then I have bought a $4 phone at the grocery store of all places. Works great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk! Junk!

I just reach over and grab it and say 'hello'... no fanfare, no weird buttons to push... sits in my hand quite comfortably.I always buy a cord detangler for a corded phone, and I am willing to spend the extra $$ for this necessary accessory. Otherwise the cord spirals until nearly impossible to unwind.However, one thing I cannot tolerate is a white noise and static in the background. Apparently it is only at my end, but with the other person on a crappy cell phone, it becomes nearly impossible to decipher the other person's words.I previously bought AT&T; phones --two speaker answering phones in my office that I love!-- with no problems whatsoever. Those are a bit wide for the space I have, but maybe I will be happier with a phone that works properly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works But Ugly","review":"I felt I needed to review this phone because you cannot tell from the picture that the plastic which the casing is made from is that cheap (non-slick) plastic -- kind of like what cheap toys are made from. It looks and feels cheap and not easy to keep clean like the AT&T 205 Slimline. The phone works fine but does not have a lighted keypad like the earlier one.

In it we have a femme fatale, a dodgy Scotsman, and a very old manor house that has a terrible curse. This is an exciting little story, and I really enjoyed it, even though I had figured out who the killer was right away. The things that I didn't figure out came out as the plot developed, and they were interesting and varied enough to keep my interest. There is darkness and danger here, and the heroine is very appealing. This is a pretty good little story."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best financial books I've ever read","review":"I am a financial advisor and have read many personal finance books.

I like old blues alright, but it can get repetitive. The dixieland tracks start on track 9 and continue throughout the cd. Louis Armstrong, Sidney Bechet, Eva Taylor and others are featured here, as this was very well their first gig. I'm pretty young, and haven't heard all that much dixieland. In fact, this is pretty much the only real dixieland I've heard, so I can't really compare it to much other dixieland. But I love the 20's, and this cd is worth buying even if you never listen to it.

She played fantastic and I was hoping I could fine a cd by her. I was totally disappointed. If the calibur of playing was as outstanding when playing with Yanni, her cd would have flown off the shelf. She was and probably still is dynomite but this cd does not reflect it at all.

The woman they call the dark lady, could've been a little creepier. All she did was wear some white face paint with black spread under her eyes. Also the film, every 5 to 10 seconds would stop and start 1 second ahead, like I was watching the movie through a strobe light. I got used to it after about a half hour. But all in all the movie was very good for what they had to work with. The ending, all though a little confusing at first gave me chills. Lots of cool partying scenes and camping scenes. The farmer with the pitch fork is pretty creepy as well. So if you like a good slasher / ghost movie pick this up for Halloween. Maybe pick up a six pack to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Creek","review":"Ok, some guys and gals go camping in a desserted town called blood creek and disturb a legendary spirit.

I bought this CD and have it playing in the lobby of my law office (and my car). It creates a great and relaxing atmosphere and everyone likes it. Now that I'm finally tuned in to this great and beautifully stylizing singer, I'm starting to notice her everywhere -- most recently, in \\"Saving Private Ryan,\\" she was being played over the loudspeakers in a French town. The soldiers paused and the fellow who spoke French explained to the others the song of sad lament. She was and is perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Edith Piaf","review":"This CD is better than I expected. Very good quality. It was excellent as background listening for our recent Fondue party.

Better go and buy her previous albums :/"},{"rating":"2","title":"A healthy dose of Passion!","review":"Geri Halliwell's \\"Passion\\" is, I believe, her best effort yet. It starts with the light jazz of the title track and never lets go. The singles \\"Desire\\" and \\"Ride It\\" are instant classics.

This was the perfect \\"summer\\" CD, just like Stylistic was, back in 2003My only complaint is that there is a bit too much of a \\"Hollaback Girl\\", cheerleader-like influence on some of the songs. A few of them have cheerleader beats that you can't really dance to (unless you like doing cartwheels and basket tosses in the club, lol) and even some cheerleader-like chanting in the background.

Boring, tabloid type writing, with mutiple grammar and spelling mistakes.

At 13 cents EXTRA per stamp, when you factor in the cost of the labels, it is a total waste of money. I would rather run to the post office and use the stamp machine to buy 100 stamps and save 13 bucks. There is never a line at the stamp machine so it is no big deal. As for shipping labels, you can only ship items under 1 pound UNLESS of course you join one of their monthly premium plans or a minimum of $10 a month. So basically you end up paying just as much or more than you would with a postage meter. I personally will be returning this back to the store."},{"rating":"2","title":"neat gadget for your home office","review":"i dont mail that much, but i still prefer a nice printed label to addressing by hand. although not really difficult, inserting the rolls is a pain, that why i would recommend anybody that wants to print labels and postage the twin turbo. plug ins for the new mac office 2008 are not out until march i was told, so basically its the included software which does an ok job, but is not really fancy or feature rich (at least the mac version). only giving 4 stars because the labels seem overpriced to me but thats probably the old razor and razorblade gimmick."},{"rating":"2","title":"easy setup but pricey","review":"Have had several Dymo labelwriters before, but purchased this for the ability to print stamps without changing the labels.

If I was using this in a business it would be too expensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best labeler","review":"I find this has been the best address labeler that I have purchased.

I would highly recommend the twin as you can avoid having to switch rolls every time you need a different type of label. I keep stamps on the right side, and then mailing labels on the left. Works like a charm.I wish it had the ability to connect directly to a db of contacts rather than importing. The stamp printing ability is great, you get a free Endicia account, however I wish they would let you set the EXACT value of the stamp like I can with our old postage meter. I'm planning on getting rid of the meter (it's around $50/mo) so this baby should pay for itself in 4 months or less.Pitney Bowes better get their act together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dymo LabelWriter is a Winner","review":"This dual label printer works great.

Instead, it's given me more headaches than I know what to do with. My mac didn't even recognize the first one, so I contacted Dymo about it. They immediately issued a RMA and sent me a new one. The new one was recognized right away and I was able to print. Well, when I tried to print postage, the stamps jammed. It happens, so I opened the case to take care of the jam and when I pulled the lever down to release them, it twisted. It would not twist back. The other side did the same.It's very cheaply made and I don't know how anyone else is able to work with these without breaking them. Needless to say, I'm returning the second one and looking for alternatives."},{"rating":"1","title":"It costs you money","review":"I have installed the software twice that runs the stamp printing. I can still only print one stamp at a time. If I choose to print multiple stamps, such as six stamps, it will print four stamps and quit working. The dymo will show an error in the printer screen. The program printing crashes. Nothing resolves it except turning off the dymo and rebooting the computer. It is close to worthless and is costing me money. I am going back to requesting stamps from the Post Office. No loss there. I have spent hours trying to resolve this and Dymo and Endicia point fingers to the other. Now Endicia gives me about another hours worth of work to do to try to resolve. Their software is poorly written. I am using a computer less than a year old. I would rather lick them, if they still offered stamps like that, than to have to spend hours trying to get their software to work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vivid wine Decanter","review":"The wine Decanter I just purchased from Amazon. com. is exactly what I wanted.

Otherwise, I am happy with the purchase and not unhappy enough to return it. It is a large, pretty piece of glass! The mouth/neck is large. More so than I thought from the picture. It is a very \\"manly\\" size and weight decanter. One feature is that it is large enough to fit the neck of an average bottle in the spout to drain completely and the bottle shoulder acts as a stopper. A large avacado is also a good fit!

I ordered them Sunday and they arrived Wednesday, so I was impressed with the speedy delivery. However, when I opened up the package, the back post that goes into the ear was badly bent. I went to fix one of them (not using a lot of pressure or force at all) and the whole inside part of the rose came completely off and would not go back in. Thinking I would try to superglue it back together I turn to the next earring. I pick it up, and the middle pearl falls off!!! I was so disappointed. I tried bending and supergluing last night with not much luck. They are very pretty and I hope I can get them fixed. They look exactly like the picture, just don't breathe on them or they will fall apart!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Narration!","review":"I should say, this is the most enjoyable British history I have ever read. Although more than 800 pgs, you would only find it is difficult to put down the book once you begin to read. Though not an academic reference in strict sense, the book can help you obtain a general understanding of the thousands years' history of a country which has been so prominent in human civilization. I trust that your further interest on this topic would be raised after going through the whole length of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleh","review":"This book needs to be edited, horribly. There are many grammatical errors along with some words being completely left out. Not to mention, she has a tendency to jump back and forth, which is VERY confusing. When I am reading about how a king is defending his country against the Danes, I don't want the story to all of the sudden change into a story about when he is in hiding! (I'm only on page 72 and I'm already annoyed) After reading some of the other reviews, I would advise you NOT use this book for a paper, find another source. I am reading this book for fun and after I am done I am going to find another book by a more reputable historian."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost New","review":"Book arrived with dented edge on front cover and DJ was stetched a bit.

It is a thorough history without being tedious. It doesn't just focus on major events, there are many other things of interest besides who was king and who came next. For example, the explanation of why the Treasury of England was/is called The Exchequer, why counties are called counties, where the word sheriff comes from. Fun stuff like that. With the major facts and many interesting things, it is a good overview of the history of Britain. The rulers and other players are presented as real people, I get a feel for their personalities. The charts of the kings, in the back before the index, are helpful. The book itself is lovely, with cream colored pages and clear type.I have not finished reading the book yet, but I find time to read some every day. It is a real pleasure.I paid full price for this book and it is definitely worth it.I look forward to Rebecca Fraser's next book.

It was fun to watch a movie filmed right here in my home town Ogden Utah, even though it was filmed at my rival high school, Ogden High. I went to Ben Lomond High School. I rated the movie a 5, mostly because of all the familiar faces in the movie. It was fun to see family and friends in a Hollywood motion picture. But, I felt the movie had a good plot as well.

Even though this movie is very entertaining (especially for those rainy days) and hysterical, there are some parts that just, well... drag I guess.

From the moment that Jerry hits the alarm clock and Tangerine Dream simultaneously kicks off on the soundtrack, it's obvious that this film will be one to remember. I always smile when I think of Jer placing his wet shirt in the microwave along wth a poptart. He's a resourceful guy, and nothing's gonna get him down which also alludes to the conclusion of the film in which Jerry's wits and resourcefulness pull him through and ensure his victory. The portrayal of cliques and high school life is right on, even down to the actress that plays Jerry's dream girl. Who wouldn't want a girl like that? The only part at which Jerry disappointed me was when he rejected Karen in preference for the goth chick - she's cool and all, but Karen's ALL that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO SMALL!","review":"I bought this for my almost 3-year old son.

Musicians can really respect this album because musically, the guys in Sikth are brilliant. Every song blows me away with technicality and unfamiliarity. Lyrically, the album has it's ups and downs but when you learn to accept Sikth for what they are this album is a 10 out of 10. This album can make you want to put a hole into a wall at times and float off into space at others. Never have I heard an album like this and after hearing \\"Death of a Dead Day\\" off the new album I have no fingernails in anticipation of it's release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good band, bad CD","review":"I just bought this new from HMV and tried to play it in my car.

On this third one, the screen is slightly tilted and one of the keys popped out, so I need to take it back to BestBuy for repair.If you are looking for an advice and recommendation (from a software professional), I am warning you about this computer. Do NOT waste your money on this computer.Besides its extremely poor quality, original CD's don't come with the computer.

Sony now freely admits the cd recovery disk program included with the machine does not work, in fact has never worked, and they still want you to shell out 60 bucks for the cd recovery kit, which takes up to four weeks for delivery.The Keyboard on my unit arrived with the 'delete' key not working, and Sony told me that since I had purchased it mail order, I would have to send it to them for repair, and it would take three mothns MINIMUM to fix. I have instead learned to live without a delete key.Overall, a very poor experience with Sony. I will stick to Toshiba or Dell in the future, companies who were far more supportive of their products and customers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book - 3.5 stars","review":"This book took a few chapters for me to get into, but once I did, I found it to be quite engaging. It is even more timely as more events are seen in which man-made space objects crash to earth. The intrigue builds very nicely throughout, although the resolution at the end seems a bit too abrupt in comparison to the pacing throughout the rest of the book, thus causing me to mark down a notch from the full 4 star rating. Characterization is very good here. It's nice to see scientists as round characters and protagonists in a novel!

This camera has the \\"green\\" feature and makes it nice not to have to select 4 things before you shoot, and the results are awesome! The SD card has come down in price significantly so you can afford to have 2gig or 4 gig of space which is very nice when you have the large file sizes for the best Pics.The large screen is also excellent. Their are only two draw backs for this camera, like ALL cameras battery consumption will hurt you so invest in Re-chargables. The other is no view finder, not a big deal to me but if the Sun is behind you, you may have a hard time seeing what's on the screen. Overall, you can't beat the quality at this price."},{"rating":"1","title":"BetterWorld Books","review":"This book was old and used, and they charged me almost $50 for it.I think they could be a little more reasonable that that.

The film tries to be like Halloween and Friday the 13th. The acting is really bad and the plot is weak. The only good thing is the killer's diffrent cosume changes. The direction is very bad. Maybe it's becouse the movie is to 80's and also 70's. I think only true horror film fans will like this film. I herd they where making a remake so maybe it might be better then the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good.","review":"I wasn't that impressed with this movie. A couple of decent scenes but pales in comparison to some of the classics of the genre such as Halloween and Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Compared to those films, Terror Train might as well be Finding Nemo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slighlty Derailed!!","review":"A very unhappy young man who had a prank pulled on him seeks revenge in a rather gory way by jumping on a party train.This young man seems to change costumes every time he commits his homicides. Ben Johnson adds a bit of a touch of class to the proceedings. David Copperfield is on the train to amuse us all.The cinematography is rather well done and it makes the suspense a bit meatier as we travel the tracks to a slasher destiny.This film was made in Canada...its shows...CP"},{"rating":"2","title":"A STANDOUT","review":"If this movie were to come out today, it would be a hit. There is so much more in a bloody towel or a blood trail rather than someone being disemboweled every three seconds. This is a classic . This movie tells a story, as opposed to a superhuman killer who only wants antoher sequel. Jammie Lee Curtis is always a believable plus. This movie carried a ring of realism that this could actually happen in it. One can easily relate to one character or another. I would recommend this movie to fans of the first Friday the 13th movie, Halloween 1,2, H2O, My Bloody Valentine and Prom Night. If you are a big fan of the superkillers franchises like Feddy Krueger,Jason and the Jamie Lee Curtisless Halloweens, then you may not like this one. This one is a throwback to the days when the good guys prevailed over the evil killers before they singned longterm contracts. Get this one for your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty lame","review":"It was a copy of Halloween and it used Jamie Lee Curtis to make some money it was confusing and was written verry messy just see this movie and you will see what I mean"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terror Train","review":"Product arrived very fast. This movie constantly has you guessing over who the true killer is and once you do the action is very exciting and scary at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"great horror classic","review":"I really liked this movie alot. I love all of Jamie Lee Curtis' horror films. She is such a wonderful actress and always pleasant to see onscreen. This movie came out in 1980, when horror movies were at their best and plentiful in amount. This movie dosen't have a whole lot of gore in it, but it did scare the pants off me a couple times. I have the DVD edition that I purchased from Amazon in April of 2007, and am truly excited to see that this is now available on blu-ray. I will be getting the blu-ray edition of this, but $20.00 is still a bit pricey for this one. Hopefully, it will go on sale soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST-HAVE","review":"This film is a must-have for any horror film collector. Nail-biting suspense film that delivers without all the typical blood & gore of films of its genre.I'd initially seen this at the cinema when it was first released & consider it one of the finest ever made! The atmosphere is eerie & creepy. The perfect setting for this film & its plot. I wonder whatever became of Derek McKinnon & what he looks like today. He portrayed his part well, as had most of the cast. I strongly recommend seeing this film to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"A LOST GEM !","review":"Roger Spottiswoode's \\"TERROR TRAIN\\" is a childhood favorite of mine,so when I found out it was comeing to dvd I was stoked!

Why? Jamie Lee Curtis, who really could do no wrong in horror films around this period, is the star of the film. I LOVE Halloween I and II, Prom Night, and The Fog. That being said, 4 out of 5 ain't bad, and this is the one out of 5 you should forget about. This movie is an endless bore; nothing happens, basically a cruel prank at the beginning explaining the killers motives, then about and hour and a half of kids walking around on a train, some drinking and dancing, a few short (not scary or suspenseful) murder scenes here and there. By the time the movie is over you just won't care anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"fun game, received in terrible condition","review":"Great game, however, received in terrible condition.

Wasn't so much of a problem on the PS2 version as a Gibson SG is realatively symetrical, but playing a Gibson Explorer upside down is very uncomfortable.To add insult to injury, Guitar Hero II actually has a left handed guitarist playing a lefty Les Paul on the front cover of the box. Great way to alienate 15% of your target audience.For future designs, it might be cool to make the volume controls and whammy bar detachable and reconfigurable for either a right or left handed guitarist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Pointless","review":"In the time it takes to play this game, you could actually pick up a real guitar and learn to play the songs.

Features include all the songs from the PS2 verion plus 10 exclusive songs, downloadable content, acheievements & online leaderboards.I already own the PS2 version, but the thought of playing in HD with online leaderboards was more than enough to make me purchase GHII again. However, the first one I bought was defective. The game ran slowly and stuttered, and the whammy bar on the guitar was completely jacked. Returned it for another and it works perfectly fine now.Nothing beats playing Guitar Hero II with your friends and a case of your favorite beverage. It is truly the ultimate party game that everyone can enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Version of Guitar Hero!","review":"I own both this Xbox360 version and the original PS2 version and this Xbox360 version blows away the original!! The graphics are greatly improved and the ability to download more songs via Xbox live is amazing! The Xbox Live feature also keeps track of your song scores and posts them online so you can compare yourself to other Guitar Hero players around the world!!Now as for the Guitar controller, it is a little more difficult to play due to the shape / design. The rear strap needs to either be tucked in front or behind the guitar and will NOT lay against the bottom base of the guitar. However it only took a small amount of time to get used to and I am now playing even better than on the PS2!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock on, baby!","review":"If you're not into shooter-type games (and therefore not into Halo 3 on the Xbox 360), then this game is the best reason to buy an Xbox 360.Love love love this game.

Not 'Guitar Sim', more 'Arcade'(it's not like playing a real guitar). Stayed up until 3am playing first weekend I got it. I do wish there were more songs, and VERY disappointed they are not going to make the 80s pack available for the XBOX 360. I hope they release those for GH III.

If you have any lag it could mess up your whole session. So if you were to play it over line then it could lag and be annoying and they could really never make it lag free. This is the reason they didn't make online co-op."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great game","review":"If you liked guitar hero 2 for the ps2, you'll love this one. It's the exact same thing except they add some songs and extras and made the graphics better. The guitar controller is very good, having a xbox guide button and mic port so you could still use your friend's list and talk in private chats and messages. My only complaint is that star power is a little harder to activate. ( what i mean is you have to tip the guitar more then before) but gameplay easily overcomes it. Some people complain that the ps2 version was better, but how could that be when this one is exactly the same except with more extras in it?

Which seems ridiculous for a 5.8 GHz phone. Most troubling, however was that my call waiting caller ID didn't work. It worked on other phones, just not this one.When I say I loved this phone, I meant that I loved it enough to go and buy another set, thinking that the problem was just with the first one I bought, but even on the second one cw/cid didn't work.

I hate these sumps. The box doesn't have a gasket sealing it. So it leaks if the water overflows or soap foams up in it.Then there's hassle of getting it open for cleaning. It uses four screws into plastic to attach the lid. This means any time you want to service the sump (as in, clean out the gunk) you have to use a screwdriver. Then you have to spend extra time fishing around in the bilge to find any screws you drop. This means you probably won't clean it as often. Eventually the plastic screw holes strip out and won't hold the lid down properly.The ports are fragile. Even a little bit of pressure breaks the plastic.It's just a bad design.

The tape also assumes a certain amount of knowledge about grooming and grooming tools; she tells you the name of the tools but not why she choose them or which breeds to use them on. I was expecting a step by step video including expert tips on grooming but it was more a \\"show\\" with occasional comments tossed out. The groomer almost seemed bored with her job!

The old/original candy cigarettes crunched when you bit into one, and only with biting it did you discover the mild grit and the slightly chalky taste.The only similarities between the candy cigarettes of the 1960s and the product being sold here is the shape of the candy, and maybe the packaging. There's no flavor in this product (and I really do mean no flavor) and the texture is all wrong. Biting into one = no crunch, no grit, no chalky flavor. It just melts into a glob in your molars that feels (but doesn't taste like) confectioners sugar."},{"rating":"2","title":"My candy cigarettes","review":"As always, I received my product promptly and will be a regular customer.

Mostly, this seems due to the tale occurring from the point of Tomoe, who puts her bushido before her own wants and needs. Very rarely, that flatness interferes (I think) with the storytelling.

Bryce 5 has an easy to learn interface that allows you to move and alter objects, change atmosphere, and change camera views without having to beat it with a stick. The program lets you save objects, textures, and atmospheres you've created into the program so that they're always there when you come back. It also comes with alot of preset object and textures you can use, so you can create an image the first time you open the program. This isn't the program you want if your trying to do complex character animation, but it's really good for landscapes, architecture, and background. If your not sure this product is for you go to a few 3D sites and look at images people have made with Bryce 5.

The animations you can make are really cool as well, from simple, like a screw driving in to a 2x4, to complex, like a full length cartoon, Bryce 5 can do it, you can model cars from terrain plains, make \\"monsters\\" out of primitives, the boolean operations can make some wicked stuff. I highly recommend it, and I challenge you to master it..just when you think you have...guess what, you find something new you can do..your imagination and computer are your only limits!

I'm sorry, but this isn't jazz and it never will be. After hearing recordings such as \\"Conversin' with the Elders,\\" I'm only reminded of the fact that I'm happy for the bebop movement of the late '40s through mid '60s.

Okay, fine. This album is for the Iron Butterfly fan with balls enough to step outside of their comfort range. Erik's songs are brilliant, and Hard Miseree is as good of a hard rock song as has ever been written. Ingle's absence proves to be about as relevant as Denny Laine's was in the Moody Blues. One keyboardist was more than able to fill Ingle's shoes...whereas TWO guitar players weren't enough to fill erik's.

I've also received the Dictionary of Louisiana French which I like but not as much as this dictionary by Rev. Jules O. Daigle. Daigle's dictionary is much easier to handle due to it's size and quicker to reference. I would suggest this dictionary to be bought along with the Cajun Self-Taught book and CD's because you can get them at a better price together, however, the dictionary alone is a valuable asset to have. Please understand that I'm not trying to convey any negative sentiment regarding the Dictionary of Louisiana French. It has a wealth of information, more so than this dictionary, but I use it when I can't find what I'm looking for in Daigle's dictionary due to the ease of quick reference in his book along with the fact that I can take his dictionary anywhere due to it's size."},{"rating":"1","title":"An honest appraisal.","review":"Although I'm a lover of books, always have been, I've never written a review before, mostly b/c nothing I've read has really moved me to do so. . . until now.

These sardines come neatly packed approximately 5 to a can. They have always tasted fresh with no fishy taste. As an added bonus they are low in sodium, only 45mg/can. Most canned sardines are high in sodium. The sardines are good eaten right from the can or in a sandwich with tomatoes or scallions. Sometimes I add a small amount of olive oil as the fish can be a tad dry. Excellent sardines. An additional note: For what it is worth the sardines processed in Portugal are far superior to those processed in Morocco.

For those of us who enjoy reading aloud to our children, this is a terrible and disappointing choice.I agree 100 percent with some of the other reviewers--this book is meant for adults, not children.

If you have a smal mind that cannot accomodate something even slightly unorthodox, as this wonderful book is, then you probably gave birth to children who are similarly myopic. However, if you have some imagination, then your kids probably do, and you'll love this book. If you like things to be strange and unexpected, you'll like this. If you need everything to fit neatly into your preconceived notions, this probably isn't for you. If you don't mind an author taking you for a ride, then read this book.

Additionally, my friend's USB 2.0 webcam won't work with the keyboard yet works fine in other ports so it's not the webcam he uses that is the problem. I'm very disappointed because the features of this keyboard were just what was wanted. It has 2 USB 2.0 ports but useless if a 2.0 device plugs into one?

The keys feel cheap (actually, the entire keyboard felt cheap and light) and you have to press pretty darn hard to type anything.

The graphics aren't the best, but they aren't lacking; they are just average. If you were into the old Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle's side scrolling games, you will probably think of this game on a low level because of it's quality. The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle games are extremely better than this. I'd only recommend it if you are a die-hard X-men fan, or if you enjoy playing the same game over and over.

I completed the game 4 times within one day using hte 4 characters. I got it refunded the next day. The plot (is aweful) and the mutant power each of the character has does not help very much. Wolferine is the easiest to use, and rouge is the most difficult character. Personally I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, save up your cash to buy some other games. Frankly, it isnot even worth one star."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an awsome game.","review":"This is an awsome game.

I am about half done, I enjoy a wide variety of books. Variety is the spice of life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be called The Marriage of Lou Boldt","review":"What I'd really like to know is who did Ridley Pearson pay to write this book for him? Whoever she is, she should go back to her day job. I'm a big fan of Pearson's and the Lou Boldt books but this one fell way short. Not only did it feel/sound like it was written by some woman pretending to be Ridley Pearson, but the story was just plain BLAH. I got the feeling the author really wanted to explore or yet again test Boldt's marriage but then had to come up with a cheesy, not well thought out crime to be the backdrop for this. Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contrivance","review":"Pearson likes to take technology or science and fashion a plot around cutting edge discoveries. This time the science is old,and the ultimate solution is unexplained and leaves the reader unsatisfied. The relationship between Boldt and his wife, with all they have been through, just doesn't feel right in this one. He's done better."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Ridley Pearson?","review":"Having read all of Ridley Pearson's books and thoroughly enjoyed every one, I'm wondering if he really wrote The Body of David Hayes. It just does not measure up to his previous novels. Other reviewers have pointed out the timeline discrepancy, and I could not get \\"connected\\" with the characters as I have in the past. And to think, this is the first Pearson novel I've purchased in hardback!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I'll make this very short and sweet. The only reason I finished this book is because I love the Lou Boldt series and didn't want to skip over even one. If this had been a stand alone book, there's no way I would have kept going with it. This has got to be one of the the most boring, tedious books I've ever tried to get through. I feel like Ridley Pearson didn't really have his heart in this one. I know, I know, not all books are going to be wonderful and even our favorite authors miss sometimes, but this book, in my opinion wasn't worth the time at all. Hopefully, his next Lou Boldt/Daphne Matthews novel will be much better. And, I don't think that focusing this book on Liz Boldt was a great idea. The idea of having the plot involve Liz's former lover, David Hayes initially sounded pretty good but just fell flat on its face early on. The David Hayes character wasn't even hardly in it. Oh, and what's up with the title anyway? Better luck next time Ridley."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book has an almost unintelligible plot","review":"Ridley Pearson shoots for the moon here. He tries for a nice literary prose style, a plot that unfolds like a map of Manhattan, and character studies worthy of the greatest actors.However... for the scope of this novel, the huge story it tries to tell, it is in the end a couple hundred pages too short. By this I mean Pearson is too stacato and hurried. Components of the story rush by in a blur and after one development piles ontop of another you will find yourself wondering what the hell just happened. This isn't a state you will find yourself in at the end of the book, you will find yourself here several times. The story jumps around from one line of thought to another and in the end you will feel like your mind has been in a high speed bumper car chase.Not the best Pearson book you will come across."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent fast read","review":"Another excellent read from Pearson. The bookmoves FAST.Some parts of the ending seem far fetched, but oh wellit was a fun ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Read","review":"As usual Ridley Pearson has another hit.

I enjoyed it very much."},{"rating":"1","title":"CAN'T BE A LEGIT PART OF THE BOLDT/LAMOIA /MATTHEWS SERIES","review":"This book came from an alternate universe, where an alternate Ridley wrote an alternate Boldt/LaMOia/Matthews series--this book being the ninth book. This doesn't conform to the rest of the series at all. In this book, Liz is younger than she is in Art of Deception, and so are the Boldt children (based on the information that John and Daphne have worked together 9 years in Art of Deception according to John in ch 29 of Art of Deception) And Undercurrents is the first Boldt?LaMoia/Matthews series."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WORTH THE EXCRUCIATING WAIT!!!!!!!","review":"I should have expected nothing after the First Victim but Middle of Nowhere and Art of Deception set me up to hopefully learn more about John and Daphne and their budding relationship and more about Liz. But then Ridley made it seem like those two books didn't even exist with this whiney diatribe about how horrible Lou's life is with a \\"cheating\\" wife and how he doesn't understand how his lover Daphne could go off with someone such as John LaMoia. Puhleeeeeeeeeeeeeze!!!!!And Has Ridley spent anytime in the Seattle area recently--I don't think so!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book sucked big time","review":"After reading a couple of Pearson's books, I was looking forward to this one that was received as a gift. Oh, what a disappointment. If I wanted to read some chick lit, I'd have grabbed one of the Whatshername Plum books. I lost count of 'feelings' conversations in BoDH. Gag me, already. The book was padded as hell with overly long, boring dialog. Like many of today's authors of action/thriller/mystery, this is another example of throwing in girl junk into a novel in an attempt to sell books to that demographic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Tricks","review":"In one sense, this book is an easy read. In another, it doesn't make much sense. I kept looking back to see if I missed something on the previous page(s). When an author withholds information that would allow the reader to understand what's going on, and never explains suppositions that guide central characters' judgments and actions relative to each other, the reader is faced with wading through writing tricks masquerading as suspense and character development. That's what we have here. Pretty thin stuff. In the end, the main character Lou Boldt is described as lieing in the post incident police investigation. The author doesn't even offer us that writer's gimmick to tie together the story (as well as exposing true police procedure).The consensus of reviewers is that other Pearson novels in this series are better. I'll have to check one more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of his best by a long shot","review":"Ridley Pearson is a real hit or miss author and this one is a miss. This resembles a plot for a soap opera and not a thriller.The only thrill is when it finally ends and I confess I skimmedthe last 20 or so pages because I just didn't care how Liz gotout of her jam. Boldt is supposed to be madly scrambling to savehis marriage, but he still finds time to be irritated thatDaphne has moved on with his friend, LaMoia. The whole Lou/Lizbit has run its course, and LaMoia was infinitely more interesting before finding domestic bliss. We need a little action in the next book, Ridley!"},{"rating":"1","title":"MAKE A DECISION, RIDLEY!!!!!","review":"Either write romantic suspense where all the stories have happy endings and the couples get together and stay together or right a gritty police procedural with real human emotions. don't try to combine the two--this effort was a mediocre one at best. The Art of Deception was much better.And did you review any of your previous works in the series, before writing this--because it doesn't fit the timeline that the other books set out. Liz's affair with David Hayes couldn't have happened six years ago--by my alculations, that would have made it in the middle of No Witnesses--a good example of your writing. And you established in that book, and in Art of Deception that LIz knew about Daphne.Finally, Lou whines too much and lies too much to himself about his feelings. Either get rid of him, or demote him to minor character status and bring on John and Daphne. I wish I got a copy of the connecting chapter; maybe that would explain a few things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible...","review":"The instructions were completely wrong.

The actual iron itself isn't too bad, and it straightened my hair really well, which is super hard to do, being that my hair is incredibly thick, even after I blowdry it. HOWEVER, the ends of my hair got all caught up where the glass ends and heat protection material begins. It made this ripping noise, and there was my hair on the \\"smooth\\" glass!!! This product would have been WAY better if they had made the plates smooth on the ends. Now I have shredded hair, and have to go to the salon to get all the split ends trimmed! Thanks Conair!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid at all costs!","review":"I bought this straightener to replace an older metal plate model. I was enticed by the promise of shiny smooth hair as the package suggested (note to self: never believe a company's own hype). Sure, it heated up fast, but I had to put it to the highest setting to get it hot enough to work on my hair (loose curls, but fine texture). When I used it on my hair, however, it felt as if the plates were ripping my hair to shreds. The edges of the glass plates are rough, not smooth, which is a big no-no with hair styling appliances. Horrible, horrible, horrible product. I was surprised that this came from Conair, a well-known and long-lived maker of hair tools. I could have laid my wet hair under a set of rough bricks and achieved the same results."},{"rating":"1","title":"This item STINKS!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I bought this one because the one i been using which was bought at a beauty supply store and VERY EXPENSIVE was broken! someone dropped it on the floor. So i needed one fast since it was already 9:00 at night! well i had several to choose from and decided to get this one. Thinking that since it was a new product and the plates were made from glass it would work miracles. I was so disappointed when i used it! it wasn't that hot and when it put my hair through it it made this snapping noise like it was cutting my hair. when i was done the strip that i straightened was frizzy and it made it look like i had more split ends, UGLY!!! I put it back in the box and just blowed dried my hair with a round brush. Even that worked better.I gave it one star because at least it heated up in less then 60 seconds! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Your hair will be straight...and on the floor!","review":"I bought this flat iron a couple of months ago as I was fascinated with its glass technology. My hair was pretty straight, but it also ripped out the ends. See, the glass isn't the only thing touching your hair; there is some kind of border (so you don't burn yourself I guess) around the glass, and the glass is glued in or something. There is too much friction between the glass and the border (it's not smooth there at ALL) so it rips your hair out. Also, whatever coating is around the border thing starts to come off, which is really making the surface harsh on hair. I stopped using mine (I only used it a few times) so I can keep my hair. I recommend upgrading to a ceramic ion flat iron. I guess when it comes to hair, higher prices do equal higher quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY!!","review":"I had recently saw the new conair shiny styles on tv and in stores. Never owning a flat iron before i decided to give it a try. It worked for a month. I decided that i shouldent straighten my hair any more but i changed my mind when i saw this. It looked like it would work well and it was cheap so i bought it. I was a little disapointed with the way it yanked at my hair but it loooked great.

I do not use styling products often, but I did try this several times, only to notice it seems to not only fry my hair, but it breaks the hair off! It seems the hair can sometimes get caught somehow and just breaks off! And when you smooth your hair, yes, that does work, but it becomes somewhat frizzy, broken off. It actually damages your hair!Do not use this product, I hate to give a product such a terrible review, but I am so unhappy with this! It is truly bad for people with fine, fragile hair. So, either spend a little more money and buy a really good hair straightener (preferably not Conair) or get a perm! Just my two cents..."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY!","review":"Okay, I own one of these, and it is like the worst flat iron ever. It caught my hair at the ends and frayed it so my hair had a ton of splits. I could see all of the broken ends and damage it did to my hair, and it did.t straighten it too well either. If you want to have frayed, damaged, thin hair, buy this product. You are better off with another flat iron."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like it!","review":"I really like this iron. I've had one for a couple of years now and finally most of the flocking that surrounds the glass has worn off, so here I am to buy another one after trying two others. I have had no trouble at all with it pulling or breaking my hair. My favorite part is the flocking (kinda like a cheap velvet)as it guides my hair (straight but curls up at the ends, medium length and fine) through the iron so it comes out straight. With my iron that does't have a comb attached to the side my hair gets flattened in the way it goes into the iron, which isn't straight. The one with a comb on it totally rips my hair out. The downside to this iron (if you have longer hair) is that it is thin, I'd like to see it in a 1\\" or even better 1.5\\" size too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stocking stuffer","review":"Wonderful.

I admit, I was a little surprised by what I thought could easily be seen as racial themes. Half my class is Latino and they didn't seem upset by it- they were howling with laughter.

Every time we listen to it we laugh out loud and quote some of the lines. We have enjoyed it so much I am now buying the book so we can see the pictures! We find it quite hilarious. I understand the worry that it perpetuates stereotypes of hispanics and latinos because of the words used but I trust that my daughter will not make a leap to linking a fictional siamese cat and chihuahas to real people. To her it's just a funny story with great word sounds. To me it's an imaginative story about an adorable little cat who drives his mom crazy with his antics. An enthusiastic thumbs up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My 4 yr old -- no, our WHOLE family -- Loves this book","review":"I bought this book while we were on a road trip vacation; I saw the cover and read the title which made me immediately decide to purchase it.

She was enchanted by the kitten on the cover. When I took the book home to read it to her and my five year old nephew, I was appalled by the blatant racism in the book. The reader is told to say the words in a \\"Spanish accent\\". Really? Which Spanish accent? I suppose not the accent of Spain, the originator of the language since the phonetic nonsense written on the pages seems to most closely resemble a mock Mexican accent. I see many people seem to like this book, and that's fine for them, but I am not comfortable having such an obvious racist item in my home.Additionally, there is no plot to the story. Skippy is kissed and adored by his mother, even though he blantantly disobeys her command not to go in his closet. What? Didn't she spend all day punishing him for not listening? There is nothing redeeming about this book at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe if this is your child's ONLY exposure to Spanish...","review":"...then the invented words would be a problem. As a bilingual teacher, and the mother of two children who are exposed to a lot of Spanish, and are on their way to becoming bilingual, I think this book has a place within a variety of books with Spanish words and Mexican culture. Have you ever read \\"A Birthday for Francis\\" by Russell Hoban? His little badger character says that \\"cake\\" is spelled \\"rxpy\\" or something like that, and first and second graders find that HILARIOUS! This is the same sort of thing - crazy mixed up words that are clearly NOT Spanish, and kids are laughing because they are in on the JOKE. The rest of it is the little \\"fuzzy britches\\"' imagination. Absolutely, this should not be your child's ONLY exposure to Spanish and Mexican culture, but it is really a great book for kids who get the jokes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning - Worst Book Ever!!!!","review":"My 5 y.o. daughter insisted on buying this book at her school book fair. The librarian said it was a great book and other parents at the book fair remarked on what a great book it was also. However, when I read it to my 5 y.o. and 8 y.o. they both hated it - they did not get it. They thought the story was hard to follow and that Skippito was too weird. They did not understand the rhyming (if thats what you want to call it?)and both complained it lacked the telling of a story - plot. Neither child wants to read it again.I agree with all of the above and would like to add some complaints of my own. This book is highly offensive to me as a Mexican-American. It is demeaning and degrading in respect to the Spanish language and hispanic culture. Skippito is not a hero or a role model but a bad caricature of the Taco Bell dog.I feel bad that I exposed my children to this book that is not well written or funny.

Even my son's preschool teacher said she is uncomfortable with these books for that reason. It's a shame, really. SJJ could have been a classic.

I was horrified by its racism, and tried to read over the \\"Spanish accent,\\" but there was no salvaging this book. It's a mishmash of stereotypes and stupid mockery of Spanish. Then I thought, OK, maybe I'm just a PC nutbag? I was relieved to see all the one-star reviews (though right now, 155 people have given it 5 stars).It's also badly written and confusing (Skippyjon's mom keeps his birthday pinata in his closet--filled--then tells him he can't go into it? What?). What on earth were those E.B. White awards people thinking? And what librarian thought this was a good purchase?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Appalling and offensive","review":"I bought this book for a class on children's literature I was taking, figuring I'd just give it to my niece when I was done. There's no way I'd give this book to her now that I've read it, though. It's full of fake \\"Spanish\\", stereotypes, and is just a terrible example to give kids. They might find it funny, but they are also learning that sterotypes are okay and funny. I'm usually pretty \\"whatever goes\\" but this one was too much for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous!","review":"We checked this book out from the library, and have to get our own copy to avoid being book bandits. We have fun reading it and best of all, it has gotten my 4 yr. old daughter interested in learning Spanish! I had been trying to teach her before, but Skippyjon made her want to learn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Skippyjonjones is AWESOME!","review":"This has to be the best children's book I have ever read to my daughter. It is very entertaining and comical. I think the people who were offended by it lack imagination and apparently have some wounds that need healing. As for the taco bell dog...omg...taco bell uses a chiauaha as their logo persay and all of a sudden it's off limits to anyone else that wants to use that species of dog?? That's ridiculous.I definately reccommend this book to parents and their children. It's creative and fun and you can't get enough. My daughter loves to read this book over and over. If a book can strike an interest in a child and make them want to read then I say there is nothing wrong with that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Word fun","review":"As the mother of bilingual sons, I was a little concerned about the streotyping when I saw this in the library. But I took it home anyway, as we own a Siamese. It turned out to be a romp through both languages, with alot of English words skewered to make them rhyme.My 4-year-old hasn't mastered rhymes yet, and was bored by the plot, which is a little esoteric. It takes 2 readings to figure out what happened. But my 8-year-old loves the book for the word play and silly situations. Having been to Machu Picchu, he loves the reference to it in the password. And he loves being able to understand the Spanish words.As a bonus, I have used the book to discuss consequences of disobedience."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have!","review":"I am a senior in college and am going to be an Elementary school teacher. I am currently interning in a Kindergarten class and they love Skippyjon Jones.I had to read it to them several times because they enjoy the accent and the songs so much. I have two students in my class who are from a hispanic background and they weren't offended by the story. In fact, they were laughing harder then anyone else! Skippyjon Jones is a book that will get kids to want to read. Our school book fair had Skippyjon Jones for sale and almost all of my class bought a copy to have at home. The parents say they are getting tired of reading it every night! Some of my students even had me show their mom and dad how they were supposed to do the voices...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I could give zero stars","review":"Wow. It's difficult to put into words how embarrassing and horrifying this book is. You will feel like an absolute jerk trying to read it to a child. Luckily I didn't have to- I attended a conference on educational literature that used this book as an example of demeaning racism in children's literature. A few weeks later, one of my children picked it up at a book fair and wanted me to buy it, based on the cover which is pretty cute. I tried to take off my educator lens and put on my parent lens to see if there was more to the book than what I'd been told, and it's just as bad as the presenters said. It's really awful. I can't believe the author has produced sequels to this embarrassing book. I can't believe her publisher thinks this is a good idea. Wow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Book to Read Outloud","review":"My daughter had to have this book last year after hearing it read at school. I don't know who loves it more! The first time I read it without her and couldn't stop laughing. This is a MUST have book."},{"rating":"2","title":"So much fun to read!!","review":"This is hands down the most adorable, funny, different and fun reads I've seen in a while. I love reading this to my son and acting out all the characters, and playing up the variation between whispering and exclaiming. All the fun words are very entertaining and keeps it interesting for adults and kids alike. And my son has always loved word play himself. It's an really imaginiative story too, that comes out of Skippyjon Jones daydreams and play in his bedroom while he's in the \\"doghouse.\\" The way it concludes and it all makes sense in the end is great too. I think this will easily be a family favorite for us."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is offensive !!!!!","review":"This is the worst book I've ever read. We read the book in class where the students are librarians, elementary school teachers and people from different ethnic groups. Guess what happened? None of us liked the book, at all.The book portrays so many Mexican stereotypes and the language is excessively bad, with many made up words they don't even exist.Buy you children good books, not a book that makes fun of other ethnic groups in the US.Do you want your child to laugh and enjoy a Latino book? Buy: \\"Abuelo and the three bears\\", \\"Borreguita and the Coyote\\", \\"The Empanadas that abuela made\\", among many others.This book is very ofensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skippyjon Jones is not appropriate, nor \\"multi-cultural\\"","review":"Before I read this book to my kids, I would have wanted to know that the book was incredibly horrible. Who's writing the rave reviews out there? It's not only racist, but just plain bad. Adding -o doesn't make it Spanish, or exciting to read. It's lazy writing that depends on end rhymes and stereotypes to carry the plot along.I've never written a review for Amazon before, but seeing that this book was rated so highly really got me thinking. Are there any checks and balances to make sure Amazon book reviews aren't getting pumped up by authors, publishers, etc?"},{"rating":"1","title":"No flow to it.","review":"Whether you think it's \\"racist\\" or not (I hate how that word is thrown around these days . . . racist means that you think your race is superior to all others, not that you can't point out differences among cultures) it's a substandard book. It looked so cute, so I bought it from a book order, but one reading had me tossing it aside. It rambles on, doees not strike me as funny in any way (and I am a great lover of books of all kinds), my 5-year-old son was not impressed. We are getting rid of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much for 5 year old","review":"After reading many reviews on this book, I thought this would be a good read for my 5 year old daughter. Boy was I wrong! This book was terrible. The rhyming was choppy and the storyline was hard to follow, even if you understood many of the Spanish words inside. The story itself was original, but the pictures on the pages where also all over the place as well as the words so my daughter lost her interest. A waste of money, I will not be buying any more books in this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is this book so popular?","review":"Thank you S. Martinez. Finally, a review that mirrors what I've been thinking ever since I first received a free copy of this book a couple years ago from the author at Book Expo America. Now I see it in stores, at book fairs and it receives nothing but rave reviews. Why? It is a fun concept and I can see how it would produce some laughs, but it does seem to be a lot like the Taco Bell dog. I'm not overly PC, but I still am trying to figure out how this book gets away with its characterizations. It's easy to see how people would find it offensive. I'm biased to the books we publish at Bubblegum Books, but this is the first negative review I've ever posted so it's not about being vindictive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mexicans LOVE beans! Didn't you know?","review":"I was halfway through reading this to my daughter when I realized that I was tempering my volume because I didn't want my neighbor to hear me through the wall of my row house. What a pile of racist crap. Mexicans party and sleep all day and eat a lot of beans, apparently.Before you dismiss me as a humorless PC drone who hates fun, ask yourself: would you read this book to your kid in front of an actual Mexican?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Racist","review":"As many have already mentioned these books are not cute, cheeky, and fun, they are racist. It is insulting to have him say -ito at the end of the english words. These books are full of stereotypes and and tripe."},{"rating":"1","title":"serious?","review":"one of the most socially acceptable forms of racisit literature i have ever read. and its for children.i have read thru 4 different skippyjonjones books and each just get worse and worse.not a book for my children.they do not need to be led to believe that mexicans are full of pinto beans and talk in broken english with everything ending in \\"ito\\" as portrayed in these books. author, you should be ashamed of yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Filming of A Seminar","review":"Hanshi Minobu MIKI did not authorize the production of this video and receives none of it's profits.The filming cuts in and out and wobbles around. Just when Hanshi MIKI is about to make an important point, the filming stops and resumes just as he finishes, and it cuts off an important demonstration of technique. It's very frustrating to watch.Also the poor quality of the video equipment shows."},{"rating":"2","title":"great intro to discourse theory/ etc.","review":"This is a handy little text. It hits the main points of a great deal of current postmodern thought along with related issues in discourse theory. As a primer I'd call this a must for doctoral students, and really useful for emerging scholars unfamiliar with the literature on cultural criticism"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Genuine Latter-Day Californio","review":"Leo Carrillo the story teller far outshines the actor. You won't find a solidly informative biography here:there are no dates, little about his immediate family and next to nothing about his contemporary extended family. But the book fully and satisfyingly confirms and delivers on historian Leonard Pitt's characterization of Carrillo as the last to embody the Californios' outlook and culture even while his generation is rapidly assimilating.You'll find here historical as well as apocryphal vignettes and anecdotes transmitted as Californio family folklore, engagingly narrated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I don't buy a lot of knives but I have always liked Buck knives when I buy one. They were well made, covered by a great warranty, and were just a great piece of American craftsmanship.

EVEN IF IT IS NOW MADE IN (UGH) CHINA!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value.","review":"Made in China, as expected for a low priced knife. But still nicely made for the price.The fit and finish aren't perfect, with a couple of ruff spots at the corners where the bolsters meet the scales. The blades open and close with an appropriate click, clack, though the sheets foot blade spring is a little weak. The scales are finished nicely, and it feels good in the hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but disappointing","review":"Bucks have been my knife of choice for decades. Bought this one for my grandson. I was angered to see that it was manufactured in China, but the quality appears to be up to usual Buck standards.

As I journeyed into the town of Blakewood, Pennsylvania, I had to keep turning the page to see how each tale ended and the other began, until I learned the secret of the town that never existed. I recommend this book to anyone who loves a suspenseful mystery with a twist! I was on the edge of my imagination throughout the book trying to guess what would come next, and I was wonderfully surprised! The Blakewood Chronicles is a definite MUST READ!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST GAME EVER!!","review":"Okay so I may be a 14 year old gamer but seriously Power Rangers? Well where to start? Let's see the sound is absolutely awful, the game has sluggish controls, so easy that even your gran could beat it, and definetely does not use the Game Boy Advance to it's full potential. Especially graphics wise. Thankfully I never brought this game ( I wasn't planning to anyway) in fact I just happened to try it out at my local games store. Even for five year olds this game is really bad. They would be way better off with something like wario Land 4 that is excellent.even I love that game! Power Rangers on GBA could only be less enjoyable if it squirted sulphuric acid into your face.

I've been a huge fan of the manufactured-on-demand (MOD) DVDs from Warner Archive, Sony and MGM, wherein we finally get oft-requested movies that might not have huge sales in the long run. The MOD releases have usually been remastered for HD or, at least, were transferred in a 16:9 widescreen format for optimum quality. NOT SO WITH THIS RELEASE!It appears that, while Lionsgate has the rights from Miramax, the only version of the film they have is NOT a 16:9 image. The picture quality appears taken from the VHS mastering done well over ten years ago. The colors bleed and the the image is letterboxed in a 4:3 format, so there goes AV quality out the window.Honestly I was excited for this purchase, since it's one of the last Almodovar movies not available in the US, but this is hardly worth the $19.98 retail price, considering it's lack of quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pedro Almodovar love-hate styles","review":"One again we have Pedro Almodovar, a spanish director that mixes drama in very dark humor. Here we learn about the relationship of a mother and daughter after 16 years of departure from each other. Vanity, love and regrets are emotionally mixed in this \\"fun to watch\\" Spanish movies. There is also a participation of Miguel Bose, a famous spanish pop rocker in the enterpretation of a drag singer . Pedro Almodovar usually repeats his actors in his movies, Law of desire, Kika, Tie me up! tie me down! and Women on a verge of a nervous breakdown, among others. It's a good movie to watch but it is a very adult drama situation, rated R for adults. Enjoy..."},{"rating":"1","title":"When did Amazon start selling bootleg DVDs?","review":"HIGH HEELSis one of my favorite Almodóvar films, so I didn't mind having to wait due to the DVD being on \\"backorder\\" status. Was thrilled when I finally received it though suspicious of the packaging. Something about the blurry image on the front of the box and the type face seemed \\"off\\" for a Miramax DVD.After playing the disc, I was dismayed to find that the video looked as though it had been copied from a VHS tape and it \\"caught\\" and skipped at regular intervals throughout playback. It was IMPOSSIBLE to watch.So very disappointed that Amazon would sell such a shoddy product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Women, their problems, and more women with their problems...","review":"...typical Almodovar. If you happen to like him for that, then, you will enjoy this film. I like the fact that Almodovar keeps his style unchanged, from working with virtually same group of actors every time to using the same combination of colors every time. This repeatition creates a sence of continuity and familiarity, which allows us to enjoy every film to its fullest.While this film is not Almodovar's funniest one, it is definitely one of the most exploring, when it comes to the parent-child relationships.And again, Almodovar, is at his best, when he talks about women... Just how in the world does he manage that? Well, it does not matter how; what matters is that he DOES."},{"rating":"2","title":"A view inside to women's soul","review":"I saw that movie years ago when still living in Brazil. It's such a pity people here don't have the same chance to see Almovar's movies. This is one of his masterfull pieces, a dark humor showing the deep inside of human's souls mixing tragedy with comedy where the \\"non sense\\" is the absolute sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeping Busy","review":"I think this was a great accessory to my Prima Papa. A toy my daughter could not throw on the floor for me to pick up, she really enjoyed playing with the phone. Just remember to take it off before feeding your baby or you will have something else to clean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of a Waste of Money","review":"Okay, so I wanted my daughter to get used to her Peg Perego High chair on a playtime level so that she can be in the kitchen with me while I'm cooking even when I'm not feeding her. I thought this would be great since it's the ONLY accessory for this highchair that you can get. Couple problems with it: (1) it rests vertically on the tray instead of horizontally so my 6 month old can't reach past the first dail and lever. The way it's pictured is not the way it's mounted on your chair. Imagine the pink dial at your baby's hands and the green phone above that, etc. (2) the actual toys are kind of weak. the dial is the only thing that makes sounds and the rest of the buttons can barely be pressed. Maybe when she's older, she can pretend something with it, but if you're purchasing this for an infant, my suggestion is put your baby's toys on the tray and leave this toy alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get it near food.","review":"So, I've had this thing for a few weeks. My only suggestion - don't get it near baby food.It's a high-chair tray, but apparently you should use it only when your little one is sitting there watching you eat. Because if he eats, and gets any gunk on it (which every baby will), it will ruin the little paper stickers that are all over the tray. Which kind of ruins the \\"niceness\\" of the tray. I would recommend that you just skip it, and put a few plastic toys on a regular tray. Not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor, cheap design","review":"I agree with the review that mentioned the short cord for the phone and the do-nothing buttons at the top. I would add that the graphics on the tray are simple paper decals, which are a poor choice for something to go on a baby tray. In no time they will be stained and torn and there's nothing you can do about it.I threw ours away after the bell underneath the phone got wet and then rusted. Really, the only advantage to this tray is that it is sized correctly to clip onto the main tray. I can think of nothing else positive about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Order new but received used","review":"I was running out of toys that could keep my son busy during feeding so it makes sense to purchase this item. The goal is to makes meal times enjoyable for both of us. As it turns out, I received this item in a worn out box and what comes out of that worn out box is worn out activity tray. I purchased this item directly from Amazon website but no where on its website indicated that I am buying a used Peg Pegego activity tray. This is the first time something like this happened to me. I have not even have this issue buying from ebay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Activity Tray disappointment","review":"I ordered this for our Prima Pappa Diner chair. With the photos provided i thought it looked great but was disappointed to find that the 4 buttons near the top had no real function, the phone had a very short cord and could not be used as pretend phone, and the clock had no sound when turning the hands.Would not recommend this unit!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Crossroads","review":"I know the the book was used, but the cover was nasty with some kind of food on the front and back cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, ridiculous price tag","review":"This book served its purpose for my creative writing course as an undergraduate. The essays were as helpful as any writing book can be, and it's a textbook I've continued to hold onto. I liked the setup of the book, dealing with different different genres, and the exercises were helpful.That being said, it's barely worth $30, let alone what it gets jacked up to because we can call it a textbook. It's thin and made of average paper. At least I found it worth keeping after what I spent on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very shallow side-scrolling game","review":"Clearly I'm in the minority with my opinion, but I simply don't see the appeal of this game. Encountering enemies becomes repetitive very fast and they quickly become a nuisance more than any kind of real challenge. Fighting is overly simplistic and each level offers little in the way of variety or challenges. The music is weak; hardly SNES caliber at all. On the plus side, Spiderman is animated very, very well, but the backgrounds are dark and lifeless. You won't see much background activity or details.Simply put, it's a shallow game. There are better side-scrollers out there. Try a Mario game, Wario Land 4, or (my personal favorite) Castlevania: Circle of the Moon."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the same","review":"this game is pretty fun but they could have made it alot better.OK it [stinks] I mean all you do is go straight and kill people and that gets really boring after a while.It's like super mario but with spideys powers the bosses are really easy too I mean all you do is web them up and hit them.

The game involves Spidey going out to buy Mary-Jane a fishbowl but he gets caught up in rumble downtown as several of his enemies run riot. It's up to him to sort them out.In 7 very short levels the game is over. And you'll be left with your jaw hanging open that a game can be so easy. The beat-em-up aspect of the game is pretty lame, all the bad guys look the same, the music is often bland, the level design is dated and the gameplay even less engaging than Spider-Man vs the Kingpin on the Sega Genesis 10 years previous.If you see this game on sale for a matter of pennies then go for it.

The best out there. It has the new Advanced Game Boy graphics. You will find 3-d things in it. The game play is astonishing. I have beaten it twice but I still find it fun to play because of all of the moves. It comes with fighting combos that are much easier than the Mortal Kombat combos that require things like left-right-jump-punch-left-down. It has good replay quality because the difficulty level is alot harder when changed. I highly recommend this instant classic to be the first game you buy.

Amazon's delivery was speedy and successful.These books are beautifully presented on quality paper. I thought that having up to four novels in one binding might make them too bulky to read comfortably - but I was wrong. They are well-proportioned, not too heavy or bulky and easy to read. The paper is good quality, font and type clear.There is only one small blight on the reading experience, which may trouble a pedant, but it does not trouble me. I have only read one of the novels so far - The Fortune of War - and in this version, I am pretty sure that I detected perhaps 3-4 typographical errors, or small glitches with the printing. I did not keep track of the, or note where they are exactly and I cannot now recall the detail.

This edition is nicely presented on good paper, but I quickly found that I could not enjoy the books because I kept coming across passages that didn't make sense to me. Eventually I checked with one of the existing books I have and found that this edition contains numerous errors - bad punctuation, words missing etc - which spoil the enjoyment. I have given the set away and returned to collecting the books one at a time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgraceful typesetting","review":"Although the novels are of course magnificent, the typesetting of this collection is the worst I've ever seen in professional publishing. The quality varies substantially. Ten or twenty pages may pass with few noticable errors, to be followed by ten or twenty more with three or four howlers per page.The publishers should be ashamed of themselves. A fine author brought by the lee by lubberly work!Follow the advice of others and buy the earlier single volume editions."},{"rating":"1","title":"A travesty...","review":"...to say the least. How anyone could think that such an edition should be published is beyond me. Too many typos to count. The publisher should voluntarily stop producing this horrendous edition of this remarkable series. Stick to the original, individual books to enjoy this series as it was meant to be read."},{"rating":"1","title":"My poor rating is for this published edition of a brilliant series and not for the author's content","review":"A brilliant work of literature, poorly published. The publisher gets 2 stars for selecting wonderful content, using a decent typeface and providing an omnibus edition which is quite needed. And that's all. Barely proofread at all, there are numerous typo's evident to folks who have read these books previously. Difficult to tell who is saying what because of the way \\"voices\\" are presented.If you have the books already and you're not heading off on some interstellar travel where storage space would be a consideration, stick with what you have already.If you have never read the Aubrey/Maturin novels, pick an earlier edition. Truly they're wonderful. The man was a brilliant writer with an unsurpassed command of prose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfyingly complete","review":"How satisfying to have all the Aubrey/Maturin books in a nicely printed, hardcover edition. While volumes which contain multiple books are often unwieldy and difficult to hold, these are quite pleasant in the hand. If you are fascinated by Patrick O'Brian's recreation of early 19th. century life at sea (and on land as well), these are a must."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good stories, poor package","review":"Print is too small, pages are too thin and books are too thick to hold.Good stories, buy the paperbacks."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I bought the series after I read the good reviews from Amazon. Having only 2 Patrick O'Brian's books, I thought this would be a good buy to read all his Aubrey-Maturin novels. The collection despite its economical price has very bad editing. There are numerous typos, misspelled words, misquotations and missing words.Quite a disappointment. Shoddy work from Norton's editor."},{"rating":"2","title":"OBrian Novels","review":"Excellent series and always captures the mind and puts you in the place the author wants you to be. You get a real tatse of the early shipping history and events. At the end of each of the novels its time to get another and continue reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Visit another age...","review":"Reading Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey/Maturin series truly is like visiting another age. Becoming a part of the perilous life of a sea Captain and a doctor during the age of sail.For fans of the books and for new readers like myself, I cannot recommend this set highly enough. Beautifully bound and presented editions in a gorgeous case - they look marvelous on my bookshelf. And if the cost of 20 books intimidated you - this set will cost you a third of the price of buying the books individually.Be warned though, these editions incorporate four books in each - they are not books to be carried about in your purse!Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"First and Best nautical books I've read.","review":"I had a friend in the Navy recommend \\"Master and Commander\\" to me, but not having much interest in sailing vessels, I didn't look into it further. However, one time I was wandering around the book shop and picked up a copy, and got hooked. Went back and bought the full series, and must say they are a great read! Particularly the first three volumes are very fascinating, and give you a feel of life at sea. They have also inspired me to look for further books in this genre, which is saying something by itself.On the physical books themselves, a prior reviewer has commented that there are typos, and there are a few, and the hardcover is perhaps a bit thinner/floppier than one would wish, but the case and dustjackets are nice, and the convenience and compactness of the volumes can't be beat. Would highly recommend them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aubrey/Maturin Patrick O'Brian Series","review":"I have read three of Partick O'Brian's books and if you are of fan of historical works or of high seas addventures these books are a must have.

I expected more from Dorian Recordings, the folks who brought us the Baltimore Consort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible pictures","review":"Picked up the C-725 from Office Max and did some test picture taking indoors. I operated the camera in AUTO mode as this was to be a gift for my daughter who wanted a point and shoot camera. I picked Olympus as I have had 2 earlier models of Olympus cameras and they always took excellent pictures. Almost all of the 20 pictures I took were terrible. Most of the pictures were out of focus and also, many were over-saturated with the light from the flash. My other Olympus cameras did not have these kind of problems when shooting the same scene indoors. Did Olympus design this thing or did they buy some third party piece of garbage? Other reviewers have made similar comments but I had to try one as I could not beleive this was the norm for Olympus. It went back to the store right away."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is a great book for Magic players.","review":"This book discusses just about every form of decks there are, and tips on making these decks.

After finding a pair in a retail store and looking at small Christmas tree lights with them, I easily saw what I was supposed to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Panasonic doesn't make this product anymore","review":"I bought this massager and had a terrible experience after using it for a couple of months. It stopped working and charging. I contacted the seller asking money back or a replacement and they asked me to contact Panasonic. Upon contacting panasonic, those guys simply sent me a different model (which costed me $15 to ship it to them ). It was ridiculous the way Amazon handled this whole replacement I wanted to get done and the seller was also dumb enough to understand the problem I was facing. I say stay away from this model!!!! This has now discouraged me from buying any electronics from Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Speakers","review":"I love these speakers. They're extremely easy to set up since they come with color-coded cables and everything is clearly marked. Once they're set up, they have great sound and excellent bass. Bass is sparse in cheaper speaker systems, but these have plenty of punch. They sound great, and work well for movies too. Overall, I'm very pleased with this purchase and highly recommend them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very stylish set of speakers, lacking in the mid department","review":"73Watt RMS continuous and 100 Watt RMS Peak sounds great. Speakers really have a great look to them. Don't take up much space at all. Decent Base and treble, though the mid range department is a lil lacking..YOu might find yourself tweaking your card or software equalizers to produce a decent mid range sound. Luckily I have additional Mid range speakers connected to this system to compensate for this (using a Channel Splitter)I am def. happy with this purchase and for only R799, you won't have to break the bank."},{"rating":"1","title":"This speaker system is a waste of time and money","review":"THE ALTEC LANSING ACS48 IS MUCH BETTER THAN THIS.

This live recording has prompted a newfound respect for the band. The songs are replicated quite accurately and the vocals, had they not been up to par, would have destroyed this recording. Fortunately, Gavin Hayes does a remarkable job of maintaining great voice throughout and proves that Dredg is serious about their music. The selection of songs is great and makes for a perfect addition to the Dredg library. It would have been great if this concert was filmed for a DVD. Maybe that's next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent live CD","review":"Dredg is clearly a step above most bands.

Not 49 as claimed. Basket on my machine is 50-51mm..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well, but could be improved","review":"I received the tamper in a timely manner. It is well made and has an appropriate weight for pressing coffee. It feels good in my hand and allows me to obtain a proper press and twist. As a matter of preference, I found that I do not like that the edges of the main press plate are rounded. This leaves a bit of a \\"high\\" edge in the espresso cup. My preference would be to have the bottom a bit flatter so that I get a more even press. Also, if the surface were flatter it would fit my 49mm cup a little tighter. All-in-all, I am pleased with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as descried","review":"Delivered promptly even during festive season. The tamper looks exactly as it appears the picture and feels weighty as it should be. Dimensions accurate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solidly made and works well","review":"I found that the plastic scoop/tamper that came with my espresso machine just wasn't cutting it. So I started looking for a tamper that would do a more thorough job and keep my espresso from getting too much extra water in the brew. I liked this one because it was red, fit the size of my brew basket and was a reasonable price. It does work well and has enough heft to it to pack down the grounds evenly without any gaps. And the red is a nice addition to my kitchen!"},{"rating":"1","title":"too small","review":"This tamp is not a commercial tamp and was too small for our nuova simonelli aurelia porta filters. May be good for home espresso machines but will not work for commercial machines."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works, but looks like crap.","review":"This arrived very early, but the red jewel at the top was cracked.

It's going back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not 49mm","review":"This tamper is a good fair priced tamper. The only problem is that it is only 47.5mm. It may not seem like a lot, but a mm can make a huge difference in your espresso. Also it's not completely flat, its slightly rounded on the bottom and the edges are rounded. The problem with this is that when you tamp, the grounds go up the sides and overflow over the edge of the filter basket. I would not recommend buying this tamper unless your basket is 48mm."},{"rating":"2","title":"looking good","review":"i bought this tamper because of the price and the size, it looks good in hand and the size should just do it for my need.i gave it 4 starts because somewhere near its red top, it has a minor chip, otherwise i would hit the 5 stars no questions asked"},{"rating":"1","title":"Suitable for 10 year olds","review":"There's just not much to this that anyone who thought about robots for 30 minutes couldn't have figured out.

Maybe that's accurate, but I'd like to think we have other resources that might give us a fighting chance. I wish the book had explored more options/possibilities. A robot uprising is far more likely than a zombie uprising, of course, and I'm sure will be more difficult to deal with; given that, this guide isn't really any help."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe I bought this book","review":"I expected a serious discussion of surviving in a Post-singularity world and instead this book is a flip and comedic riff.

There is very little in the way of step by step instruction, and it is more of an outline that a survival guide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Defend yourself","review":"In the ever looming robot uprising, we now have a book to help survive this inevitable event. Daniel Wilson gives us a straightfaced humorous book on what, where, and how the robot uprising is going to take place. Good thing Wilson is a PhD candidate in robotics and data mining, thus he knows what he's talking about in this entirely plausible, yet lighthearted, possibilities. He explains the rudimentary functions and purposes of our robots as well as, albeit simplistic temrinology, ways to defeat them.With this book and the Zombie Survival Guide, we have some of our bases covered for future uprisings and revolts. Well worth the read and the book looks great. Gloss pages, great cover art (mine is the one with Optimus Prime silhouette), and the pages (on mine anyway) are red metallic leafing... very handsome book (wow that statement is wrong in so many ways). Pick it up, defend yourself, and ensure your survival!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous","review":"Unlike the sweeping landscapes we all have become accustomed to seeing, Christopher takes a focused look at the \\"ingredients\\" of those landscapes...namely tress and foliage. The vibrant colors are breathtaking and to see his perspective through tighter composition yields a look at nature I had not \\"seen\\".While some of the shots may not have that \\"in your face\\" drama, the colors and textures are much more appealing and appreciated after a few moments of viewing. As a product photographer, my \\"world\\" is within my studio; all controlled and placed as I want to capture them.

I have experimented with several methods and texts, and this book was recommended to me, so I tried it. I am not at all pleased. Most of my students complained about having to read it, and I couldn't really fault them. As they pointed out, the tone is \\"childish\\" and the book is repetitive. It treats them at a level far beneath their abilities, and the readings included were not very helpful or challenging. In all, it has some clear sections (Profile, Newspaper, Argument) that some may find helpful, but I think it aims way beneath the needed level of intelligence to engage students in thinking and writing at an advanced level."},{"rating":"1","title":"max's review","review":"I thought this CD was a horrible deal.

It seems like the main character just sleeps, beats himself up, visits the King of Storyville, laments on the loss of his girlfriend and, oh, inquires about some dead people...and starts the process all over again the next day."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine mystery and a great homage to New Orleans jazz and history","review":"It would be ideal if you have some New Orleans jazz CDs playing in the background while you read this, but if you are at all familiar with music by Jelly Roll Morton and the like, you will practically hear it in your mind. The mystery involves the murder of several musicians and will have you entranced. The use of Jelly Roll Morton as a character along with the suggestion that another character is a youthful Louis Armstrong enhances the story for those who are jazz fans. Of course, this is also a must for those interested in New Orleans history. Ultimately, though, it's a well plotted mystery recommended to all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Homeschooling","review":"Wow! I am so impressed with this book. I have read a lot of books on homeschooling and this book sums it all up. I wish I had this when we first started 7 years ago. It makes a great gift for new homeschoolers. This book covers several topics and gives practical application and ideas to go with it. If I had to choose only one book on homeschooling, this would be it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good, all-encompassing book on homeschooling","review":"This is a great book that addresses all aspects of homeschooling. Usually, when people ask me questions about homeschooling, I suggest books about why you should homeschool, books about ways to homeschool, books about how to choose curriculum, and so on. Now I can recommend this book as the one book that addresses enough information that you could read it and begin your homeschooling journey quite easily.Obviously, one book will never address all issues as thoroughly as a stack of ten books, but for someone who's overwhelmed at the thought of homeschooling or who wants a \\"quick start\\" guide so that they can jump right in and get going, this is an exceptional choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Preachy and condescending","review":"I read this book eagerly thinking it would give me great tips on doing home school in an easier manner. It does do that, but the writer's style is extremely off-putting. Though I am a Christian, I could not stand the implications that if one let their children read anything other than the KJV of the Bible or let their children watch TV, they were not being good parents or good Christians. Too much for me to wade through to get to the good stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought...","review":"Because of the title-Easy Homeschooling Technique\\"s\\" I thought the book would be about different homeschooling technique\\"s\\". It's not. It's about 1 technique. Very disapointing if you are already relatively happy with what you are doing and just looking for some fresh ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way short, and antiquated remastering","review":"This collection is one of those \\"budget discs\\" and only has 10 tracks, weighing in at less than 30 minutes. It is also quite old, and the remastering has been greatly improved since this CD came out. Look for one of the many newer collections that have far more tracks, sound much better, and are just as cheap. Just make sure it is made by Decca/MCA and not a bootleg import company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boys Life 5","review":"Just like boys Briefs 1-5.

Then have them skate in eight detailed skate parks, where you earn points for tricks, earn cash for stunts, collecting the letters SKATE and various other things to buy new boards, tricks and stats. The graphics are better than the first game, with more detailed animations, but not nearly as good as Playstation's graphics. There are more modes in Pro Skater 2, such as creating your own skater and even your own skate park, however because of N64's memory limitation one skate park pretty much takes up a half a controller pack! There are even full songs, rather than just looped sound clips like the first game. However, the music might get annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Hi,I'm Paul Celaya.i got this game because of my grades.I like it because you can makeparks and skaters.Also i LOVE the new moves[this game has 1,000 new tricks,even a Manual].im Telling you, this game is ALSOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tony Hawks Pro Skater 2","review":"...the only thing i like to do is to Play Video Games And this Game By Far is the Best video Game that i Have ever played in my short lifetime.

Roy Dupuis as Michael is in my opinion the real star of La Femme Nikita and this book contained some terrific photos of Mr. Dupuis that I had not seen before. You will also find information on Alberta Watson, Eugene Robert Glazer and the rest of the cast. The episode descriptions were excellent and I found myself shaking my head in agreement with every one of them. Great job, there is something here for everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"more La Femme Nikita.............less Peta Wilson","review":"The title of this book is deceiving. It suggests that it is a biography of Peta Wilson, when only the first chapter is about Peta and the rest is about the show, the cast of La Femme Nikita and a chronology of each episode. It is not what I hoped it to be and wouldn't recommend to a reader looking for a biography of Peta Wilson because this book falls way short of that expectation. I wanted the biography and didn't get what I paid for................"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little book about the tv-series La Femme Nikita","review":"I purchased this as a small companion to the soundtrack CD.

Truly disappointing that there are none, but this is a must-read for those addicted to travel writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Johnny B at large","review":"This starts out rather slow. Even slow for Johnny B. Once he gets off the bed it picks up. His discription of \\"dysfunctional family\\" is worth it. Dad's denial and brother's equally crazy lifestyle, gives John some rivaling material to work with, and yes he seems a little more normal than they are. The squirt gun caught me off guard, but the way he explains it - well I'm not sure he really explains it at all. It's fun either way. The dumpster is great in that I'm glad to know there is only 1459 books of a particular title left int he world today. Thanks to Johnny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work as advertised","review":"i bought it to help me get my printer and 3 PCs networked with a linksys router. the application crashed several times and the UI was really hard to navigate. it ended up taking up time, rather than saving it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Learning How to Learn","review":"As an educator and Ph.D. memory researcher I was disappointed in the narrow focus of the book. I rated this two stars only because the techniques work, in a very narrow and limited sense and the reader has a huge amount of time. If you're merely looking to memorize a lot of information, data and not make application of it, then this is the book for you. However, if you, your students or children need to THINK, problem solve, and analyze, you will obtain only a very limited set of skills with this book. Teaching usable learning skills is far more broad and complex than this book represents, which seems to lean rather heavily at times on being a sales pitch for Lucas. I found the techniques old and not the break-throughs that were hyped."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect & As Described","review":"These came just as pictured and are very good quality. There are little footies at the toes (you cannot tell from the picture) which is nice so the nets do not feel awkward when worn. I am tall and thin and I can pull these all the way up my thigh if I wish. The unfinished tops are great because you can wear them with a garter belt and they do not have that annoying plastic crap that cuts off everyone's circulation and causes the inevitable \\"muffin leg\\" no matter how skinny, large, or fit you are. I would buy these again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fishnets","review":"Shipping was very fast! Product is as expected and better. Has re-enforced toe so your toes don't slide out and get pinched.

Super easy to wear, perfect product for any body type or occasion you would need fishnets for."},{"rating":"2","title":"So cute and sexy!","review":"I love the way these look, and my lover agrees. In case it's not clear to everyone, these will not stay up on their own, and are specifically made to be worn with garters--and they look damn sexy that way! My only complaint is that the netting came loose from the solid toe part of the stocking (made that way so your toes aren't poking out of them) after one wear. It's nothing I can't fix, but they are a little delicate, so be gentle with them. They look adorable in mary janes, pumps, and any other feminine shoe style. All in all, a good purchase, and you can't beat the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"stinks!","review":"This one smells soooo bad. The Calming scented one smells great!

Within 2 days the flimsy metal part of the handle had bent. Within another day the entire toaster was not functioning at all. I regret not going to the store to buy this item, as I would have been able to feel how lightweight and flimsy the construction was. Oh well, back to browning my bread on the stove top."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont bother ordering this book!","review":"I returned this book because the print quality was awful.

If you're expecting a dark, antihero samurai drama like the premise suggests, you will be sorely disappointed. Although the basic plot is potentially interesting, the dialogue is contrived, the acting is extremely overdone, the sets are amateuristic, and the action sequences are slow and stagey. It's like a bad TV episode. I am a big fan of the genre, but I could not sit through this film in its entirety."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maclaren makes good stuff","review":"We bought this for our Chicco car seat. None of the stroller frames say they fit the Chicco Keyfit carseat, but Chicco said this one and a couple of others would work--not by snapping in but by using the belt over the top.We have used this constantly--at grocery stores, on walking paths, for any kind of shopping. The wheels turn better than most other strollers I have pushed and the whole thing feels lighter even though that car seat is one of the heaviest out there. It can handle a little \\"off-roading.\\" It's easy to fold and especially easy to unfold. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely convenient","review":"I purchased the Chicco Keyfit 30 travel system, however after having a c-section I HATED the huge stroller. I found this & i cannot imagine having to use the Chicco stroller now. This is extremely light, easy to use and the basket holds my big diaper bag as well as shopping bags. We take it on long walks, to church, shopping, wherever. Its easy enough for my 8 year old to open & close it. I dont like that after my baby is out of the car seat I'll have no further use for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I miss it!","review":"I bought this stroller to be able to fly alone with my son and it was our best purchase to date! The Graco SnugRide fit right in without any adjustments--although I think you have to make some adjustments to the stroller to accomodate other brands. The shopping basket is large enough to hold my son's biggest diaper bag, my coat and purse, and other little odds and ends. It maneuvers very well, and is so much easier to use than our bigger, heavier Rock Star Baby stroller. My son just outgrew his car seat, though, and I miss this stroller! I bought another Maclaren, the Techno XT, because I loved the Easy Traveller so much!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Like it!!","review":"The Easy Traveller is great. The only downside is that there isn't a compartment for your drinks or keys, etc. It does come with a detachable bottle holder. The basket is nice and large. Very lightweight to easily put in and out of car."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!!","review":"Maclaren Easy Traveller Stroller Black and SilverThis stroller is exactly what I was looking for. It is lightweight and easy to use. I don't kick the wheels when I walk (I almost always do with any other stroller), it works great with Britax (it locks in over the bar in the back). It is so easy to use and so manuverable that I couldn't be happier. I am dreading when my infant outgrows his car seat and I have to move on to a different stroller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the Britax Companion","review":"We were thrilled that Maclaren came out with an infant car seat stroller frame...especially since it is marketed to accomodate the Britax Companion. To our dismay, the Easy Traveler does NOT safely hold the Companion and the stroller we received is actually defective. My husband is active duty military & we live in Japan, so we depend on online shopping. Because the shipping time is so long we are outside of our 30 day return time...so now we have to deal directly with Maclaren. Well, actually an authorized repair company for Maclaren. Not sure where we'll find one in JAPAN! The stroller is over priced and it's a hassel to deal with this company. We are crossing our fingers that nothing goes wrong with our Techno XT."},{"rating":"1","title":"This store is drastically overcharging for the Easy Traveller.","review":"It should cost $70, and is available elsewhere online for the list price.

I've since gone out and bought two other, older titles, by Gary Bartz. Great sax player who likes to explore the boundaries of jazz and other genres. Although this album is titled \\"The Blues Chronicles,\\" by no means is it a typical blues album. Not at all. One man's blues is another man's jazz. Or in the case of this album, a hodge-podge of jazz, soul, blues, hip-hop, and even a dash of reggae. If that sounds like this album is \\"all over the place,\\" don't let that deter you from listening. It's actually a very cohesive collection of songs that transports the listener. Well done, Mr. Bartz!"},{"rating":"1","title":"For the price, you should get more than water, right?!","review":"Like the previous reviewer, I too noticed a difference in the consistency of the bubbles. So I contacted California Baby via email, and heard a response right away from someone named \\"Sue\\" who promised that she would send me a postage paid envelope for me to return the defective bottles I had. Problem is, she didn't follow through, and has not to this day. So after a month of my twins crying for bubbles, I moved on to another product. I feel like I got gipped! My advice...the customer service department at CA Baby doesn't care if you are happy with their product...so move on unless you want to pay $9 a bottle for water!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great bubble bath","review":"we use the california baby bubble baths. light and happy has a very sweet and subtle scent that stays with you but doesn't overwhelm. we really like this bubble bath in particular, but california baby puts out good stuff in general.we use many of the california baby products on our baby and ourselves.i would definitely recommend california baby bubble baths. light and happy bubble bath delivers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lyrics. voice. music.

Not since James Taylor has there been such a poet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soulful Singer Indeed!","review":"I learned about Duncan Sheik like most people did, \\"Barely Breathing\\". When I got the album I was expecting \\"pop\\" songs like you would hear on the radio. Instead, I got beautifully crafted, well-sang songs. Duncan is truly ahead of his time. He is a brillant songwriter and definately unappreciated among \\"the masses\\". I am a dedicated fan and look forward to hearing more of his work (and seeing him live). \\"Days Go By\\" is my favorite so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"...is this what music has come to...?","review":"Maybe it's just me...but this record really just isn't any good. Duncan Sheik CAN sing--I'll give him that--but as far as a songwriter he, well, he isn't. He would do much better to have someone write songs for him. Some one like Diane Warren or Gretchen Peters. If he could get some good material, then he just might be a big star. Still, I do like his voice. Very smooth. And coupled with a pretty face, he just might be big someday, if, like I said, he could get someone to write songs for him. Can anyone say TEEN IDOL? Sure, I knew that you could...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"The first 3 songs are good and keep your interests up, but the rest of the songs are slow and I had a hard time not falling asleep. Hopefully Duncan will realize that the upbeat songs that got airplay is his best style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music for the Emotional Core","review":"I originally bought this CD because my wife wanted it, she having heard it somewhere and liking the song \\"Barely Breathing.\\" I didn't expect much for the only reason that I am very partial to instrumental music. However, this album caught me by surprise with its moody vibe. The melodies that Sheik writes along with his naked baritone voice evoke a deep emotional ache and awareness that is reminiscent of early Jackson Browne works. The musicianship, arrangements and production are top notch.This CD is \\"blue\\", but not bluezy in the genre sense. If you like music that moves you to your emotion core where you feel most alive, than this recording is well worth a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"A primer for Duncan Sheik","review":"For those who are just now finding out about Duncan Sheik, this CD may be his most polished. Which is a bad thing when thinking about Duncan's music. Here, many of the tracks feel like they're prepared for radio (a couple made it to the air waves). The rest of the album is a bit slow, though very beautiful. There are a few songs (\\"home\\", \\"reasons for living\\", \\"out of order\\", and \\"end of outside\\") that reveal his true direction. If you like the eclectic Duncan Sheik, I suggest Humming and Phantom Moon. If his politically minded minimalism is what you're after, go for the last two albums (Daylight and White Limousine). Both of these albums have a nice mix of grunge, uplift, cynicism, and some delicate love songs. Personally, I prefer the organic music of Phantom Moon. Hope this helps.p.s. be sure to see him live. He always sounds great live and typically has a great band with him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a fan","review":"Sorry to say but I just don't see what's so great about good ol' Duncan.

I couldn't believe how wonderful it was during the first three songs and was making a mental note of the number of CDs that I was going to buy to give to friends to share his great work. Then..... the rest of the CD played. It put me to sleep and I was emarrassed that I was going to buy this to hand out to people.

(In fact, my husband and I just saw him live at a small bar in Philly, and I must say, it was probably the best concert I've been to.) Duncan's voice is so calming, but powerful at the same time.

I grew up in El Paso, TX, so I like to use the UTEP Miners, and every time you kick off in the Sun Bowl, you see an \\"M\\" painted on the mountains in the background, which really exists. I am sure you will see the same type of detail in your hometown stadium. This type of detail is what makes the game fun.

Sometime the Fighting Irish song also. This upset me but I still play the game. The realism of the BCS standing are very weak as well. I can have the worst team in college, based on a weak conference schedule, and still play for the National Title which is held in the Rose Bowl./Not in real life/ The Bowl games are not held where they are suppose to be held at. For instance the Peach Bowl is held in the Georgia Dome.... NNNNOOOTTT. It is held at Georgia Tech Stadium.

Also, with NCAA 2002, you get the Heisman Trophy, all of the bowl games, the BCS, the AP and Coaches polls, mascots, fight songs, chants, and the ESPN crew (although I would like to see Chris Fowler integrated into the game, maybe a halftime roundup from around the nation)."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate this game","review":"I waited and waited for this game and when I finally gpt it I was very dissapointed.

Was well worth my hunt to find this out of print copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted time I'll never get back....","review":"After reading alot of reviews about various Silent Hill games, I was intrigued about the prospect of playing a horror-type game and decided to buy one used (thankgod I didn't buy Silent Hill 2 new) and give it a try. I can honestly say this was probably one of the worse games I have ever ever played in my life. Very slow...monotonous play and music...awkward to navigate/control the character...the essence of boring really...the list of disapointment is very long. I gave it 2 hrs of my attention to see if it got better and finally had to turn it off, selling it back that same day.Overall, my suggestion is that if you are a person who enjoys games like \\"God of War\\", do not even bother with this game. I have not tried the other games in the Silent Hill series, but really don't see the point. If you do enjoy this series, you are more patient than I. The idea of a horror game is cool, but Silent Hill does not do that description justice, sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most Booooring Game Ever!","review":"This is one of the worst games I've ever played. Sure, graphics and sound f/x are awesome, but gameplay is boring and even desperate at times. If you like wasting your time getting lost over and over searching for items and locations this is the game for you, otherwise just borrow it from a friend and see for yourself how bad it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"These other reviewers must work for the company...","review":"I bought this game based on the rave reviews it had received on Amazon. I owned it for about 6 hours and then exchanged it for another game because it was a huge disappointment. There is plenty of \\"territory\\" to cover in the game, but it is very limited. Hardly any doors open, you must stay on the beaten path. The \\"camera angles\\" are annoying as all hell. It is not \\"first-person\\" perspective; instead it is \\"cinema\\" style, from all kinds of alternating angles. Makes it disconcerting to say the least when you are trying to control the direction of the little man on the screen.Let's just say that I have never had such a sinking feeling of regret as when I got home and tries this game. Thank god the store allowed me to exchange an opened video game.Don't believe the hype! Buy Smuggler's Run or Red Faction instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a great game..for the money of some game price too.,","review":"Silent hill is excellent. From the high-res graphics that move at 16,000 frames per second to the awesome PRo-tools built 512-bit sound this game rocks. Although some parts can be a bit tricky, dont get upset to quick as there is quite a bit of surprises like Marlon Brando as the voice of Scooter your side-kick robotic walrus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long Silent Walk","review":"I picked up this game, hoping to engage in a compelling and spooky challenge, but I have to say, it bored me senseless. I spent the first two hours simply walking and walking and running and walking through annoying fog. The controls are wonky and often my James would spend a lot of his walking time going in the wrong direction or turning in circles. After two hours of play the only things that happened were finding a map, looking down a well, and meeting a girl in a cemetary, oh, and burning a hell of a lot of virtual calories. I did kill one monster, but only after travelling miles down a path and then having to retrace my steps. I have no desire to turn this game on again and find out anything more. Absolute borefest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been better","review":"After seeing the XBOX preview movie for Silent Hill 2, it's apparent how lacking the PS2 version is in the graphics department. If you are picking up an XBOX, you'd be much smarter to wait for the XBOX version. Otherwise, a worthwhile PS2 game."},{"rating":"1","title":"A BIG let down!","review":"I could not wait to get this game and started playing it as soon as it arrived. I thought I was going to love it since it involved puzzles and had a horror story quality. I was so disappointed. The story line had so much potential. The character was hard to control and the game was set up so that it dictated you're movement. It took me quite awhile to actually get into the game. Finally it stated to get really interesting then it ended only to leave me very angry. I was very upset with the ending!! I have heard that you can get different endings under different settings, but the idea of having to sit through all that again does not interest me at all! I would reccomend renting this game, NOT buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"cubanboyrican silent hill 2","review":"to me its was a great game and youll love it take it from me i own all four of them i beat the first 3 i havent beaten silent hill 4 if you own ps2 or xbox pick up these games!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Great Game","review":"Ive only had this game for two days but I have to say Konami did a great job putting this together. The starting of the game isnt as scary as the first but when you get further into the game it grows on you and you might not play with the lights off anymore(like I did).

The game started out slow and boring. I spent an hour just walking around (by-the-way there is no way for the character to run). It's all walking and not normal walking either more like a slow old man walk. So you have to spend 10 minutes just to walk to the other side of town....I can only hear dogs barking in the background and I wanted to find them so could kill them or something. If you like slow boring games get it. Passing off JUNK like this should be illegal.

That is, until I played this nasty little gem for PS2. Holy crap! I literally had nightmares about this stuff. Very Lovecraftian. The dank atmosphere is brilliant, and the foggy unseen images are brutal. Definitely NOT for the squeemish.In my opinion, the best of the 3 Silent Hill games."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Great Game. It will scare you.","review":"This game is great. It has a superb storyline and monster list. The constant running around can get annoying at times but don't let it get to you because the game is stunning none the less. While confusing at times the storyline has two levels to it, the obvious and the religious. I could make a huge statement about how deep this game and the others in the series can be but there are other places to get a plot synopsis. Unfortuanetly, this game does not really tye into the first and third games in the ways of storyline but don't worry you will not be disappointed. These make it a great game on multiple levels and keep you playing to learn more about the littler things not easily noticed your first time through. All in all a great game and a must have. Goodbye and happy gaming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest game I have ever played","review":"This is my favorite game I have ever played on any system, and I own Silent Hill 1, too. They are both good games, but beyond the music, the graphics, and the many endings, this games has the most extensive, beautiful, fascinating, and--of course--the scariest damn story I have ever seen in a game. This is better than most movies I have seen! You MUST try this game. Buy it cn computer, even. It is definitely worth the time. The ending is amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great price","review":"Our son was so happy. Silent hill fan and the new games are not cheap. Looked great, played great.

It has ok controls, they could get a little messed up sometimes. Nice graphics that although are good they dont live up to what the ps2 could do. It is a scary game. Itsso scary that i was scared to turn corners. But in the middle of the game, at the hospital, it just lost all scariness. It got almost funny. I beat the game in a week. You could set the difficult levels so it makes it harder at the riddles and the monsters. There are 5 endings so you might want to play it over. Overall i give it around a 3 and a half to A 4."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for those who love Psychedelic things","review":"I wasn't sure what to expect when I bought this game. The graphics in the beginning didn't seem that great- especially for the PS2. However- great graphics or not, I was blown away by the mystery behind Silent Hill. This isn't one of your bubble gum games that you buy when all of your friends buy it. It is a depressing and grotesque tour about a man who returns to Silent Hill in search of his wife (receiving a letter from her), who actually died a year before. This is strange and he finds Silent Hill to be not like the place he visited once with his wife while they were taking a vacation there. Silent Hill is now a gloomy, run down, ghost town. Strange is the place- as well as the people you meet there. If you like movies like Jacob's Ladder - you'll love this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I love this game because it has a great story and it looks beautiful. I love that it has so many endings - up to 6, depending on which version you have. Some people dont like that you have to collect so many items and solze puzzles and stuff. Well, I liked it. Most of the puzzles are easy and none of them are very hard so if you cant do them then youre a moron. I think the people that didnt like this game were expecting something else when they got it. Resident Evil, perhaps? Well go get RE then. SH2 is scary because it creates a scary atmosphere. I dont mean to generalize but it seems like most of the people who hated SH2 are below normal intelligence. Maybe because most of them are little kids. At any rate, this game rocks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow, tiresome and overrated.","review":"I gave this game all the second chances I could to let it hook me, I really did, but it failed. Why?THE BAD: Slow gameplay (walk around huge areas for hours looking for tiny pieces of info, intermittently bashing creatures ad nauseam). Repetitive. Delays with the animations (esp. when fighting). Terrible camera angles.THE GOOD: Gorgeous game, great mood and best sound yet on PS2. That, however, does not a great game make. Maybe I'm not the genre's biggest fan, but the \\"find the key to open the door to fight the monster to get another key\\" style of gameplay is TIRED."},{"rating":"2","title":"what a creepy experience","review":"This game was a lot of fun to play. Do yourself a favor and play through it at least once without the use of the strategy guide. You'll have a much more enjoyable experience without it. I have played throught it three times, and have seen three different endings. This is the only weak part of the game, as none of the endings I have seen so far live up to the inner game story and they leave you wondering about far too much at the end of the game. Other than that small complaint, Silent Hill 2 is a great game that horror genre buffs will have a hard time putting down."},{"rating":"2","title":"One great game....one great game this is","review":"Let me begin to tell you that this is by far the best game of 2001 (but it will likely be surpassed by Metal Gear 2), the graphics are the best, the sound is sooo real!!...i literally jumped of my seat when i heard a creature crawling in the night....this is the most twisted, macabre, phsycologically disturbed game i have ever played, and it really messes with your mind, i am afraid to play this game alone or in the dark...if you like good games, play, no, buy this game!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Typical Game","review":"Being a sequal to one of the best games I have ever played, Silent Hill 2 came short in many areas. First off the plot was rather dull and I was never really scared that much. If you liked the first one then I would NOT rent or buy the second. To be on the good side, the graphics were amazing. But then the voice acting was horrible. So, I guess it depends on what you like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interestingly Boring","review":"I'm new to Playstation and have been spending alot of time reviewing and trying out new games to try and find my niche'. This game is definitely not it! The graphics are grainy. The character's movements are awkward. There are lots of eerie noises but u don't see anything, at least not in the begining - I couldn't get past a hour or so to find out more. The inventory screen is terrible to use. The map is useful but all I did was spend time trying to find my way around town. Perhaps it gets better, but like any good book, if it don't get me by the end of the first page, I'm done. I was very quickly done with this game. So far I like Tombraider 4 and the Devil May Cry. I also hated Resident Evil, which I will review in that section."},{"rating":"1","title":"Resident evil is just a plain better game in this Genre","review":"While Silent Hill 2 becomes bearable once the plot starts to move (you spend about 20 minutes walking around with no interactions at the beginning of the game) it just doesn't measure up in graphics, story, monsters, puzzles, or scare factor that resident evil has. Resident evil makes you jump out of your seat practically from the start. Silent hill has you yawning as your character follows a path for about 10 minutes to the first save point. The game play here is a little easier to master than RE, however. Younger players may have a shorter learning curve on silent hill than on resident evil. If you're not already an avid fan of this genre, rent it first. If you can't have enough of the horror/thriller type games than go ahead and get it though you may be underwhelmed and waiting to jump out of your seats in vain."},{"rating":"1","title":"A slow unchallenging scavenger hunt.","review":"This game takes forever to develop any sense of interest for the player. The first hour of the game is nothing more than a directionless, plot less scavenger hunt of unrelated items. Only to be met with a senseless but super easy puzzle and boss.This game was disappointing. Also the graphics are average. What is most disappointing about the graphics is the overabundant use of fog effects. The player cannot see more than a few feet in front of his face for the entirety of the game. Instead of coming off as creepy, it is a hassle and really eliminates the pleasure of the locations. With the powerful rendering hardware of the PS2 behind it, it seems senseless to clutter the screen with fog ALL the time. Some say that that's ambience. It just is a lack of game development to me. This game is a big disappointment.It is too slow and disjointed to make any progress in the game yeild any pleasure for the player.I do not recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Game Ever. Gorgeous","review":"I first played Silent Hill 2 a couple of years ago and immediately fell in love with it. The storyline is what gets to me everytime. If you lost the love of your life to sickness and got a letter from them three years later, would you not search for them at every cost? James literally goes to the abyss and back to find Mary and discovers a secret that could shatter his entire world. Brilliant game, beautifully written. Buy it immediately!"},{"rating":"2","title":"REALLY GREAT","review":"This game has a great story, great graphics, and great gameplay. It's really bone-chilling but really fun at the same time. GORY!!! There are two really nasty scenes but other then that it's a great game. Hope you like it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Game Ever","review":"This game is so beautiful it should be illegal. The storyline is dark and romantic and I get completely engrossed in it whenever I play. My favorite shot is when we arrive at the hotel after rowing across the lake. It still gives me chills after all these years. The best game in the series and it leaves a haunting impression."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks good/Plays bad","review":"A very good looking game with good backround music and sounds. Playing the game however means runnung all over, and not really getting any ware. The puzzels are complicated, and keep you from really enjoying the game. Rent it before you buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as creepy as the first","review":"Because I found the first Silent Hill one of the most frightening games that I had ever played, I sat in anticapation to see what the second had to offer, hell, I even wanted the game even BEFORE I got the Playstation 2 system. The first game frightened me, the second pretty much bored me. The first fifteen minutes or so of SH2 you find yourself running down some foggy path and, if you remembered the first game, wondering when are the creepy sound effects and eerie scenary going to take place. The creatures are frightening at first, but after fighting the same ones for at least an hour, they tend to get stupid. And where the first one followed the main character through what he percieved to be reality and a dark, nightmare world, this one doesn't. After an hour or so I stoppped playing, highly dissappointed and wishing that I had bought either Code Name: Veronica or Devil May Cry instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST SIENT HILL EVER","review":"i went out yesterday and bought this game cause i loved the first one. i played for 2 hours and was amazed by the graphics. the fog in the game is much better than the first one. the town of silent hill looks just a bit different(anyone notice that?). i highly recommend this game to anyone who loves strategy games. resident evil: code veronica x is a must have too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good!","review":"I was expecting and hoping this game would be alot better. The damn fog makes it so you cant see anything, its not scary because the game is so foggy you barely see anything, and its really hard to know where you are going so you need to look at your map every 10 seconds. The game would be alot better if there wasnt as much fog and if there was a more realistic story.Story: 2Graphics: 9Gameplay: 4Overall: 3"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game but satonic graphics","review":"this game is awesome but has sick graphics. who could bare to look at them"},{"rating":"2","title":"Its Okay!!","review":"I bought Silent Hill 2 a few weeks back and oh boy, was I impressed. The graphics are amazing and the gameplay is even better. But the only aspect of the game, which botherd me was the entire theme of the game. Its Physcologically terrifying, as it just broadens your horizon of fear. Well if youre in for a thrill that will scare the \\"Hell\\" out of you, GO GET IT!!Im 17 and honestly speaking, the game did send a shiver down my back. But you eventually loose the initial fear.Overall I would give Konami a Big Thumbs up!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Starts off kinda lame, but stick with it.","review":"When I first started playing this game( after about 10 minites or so) I thought is was boring and mellow.Then the game takes a turn and soon your battling Alien-Demon like creaters. You beat them to death with a pipe. In return they throw-up on you before they go down. If you don't step on them right away they will crawl away in a spider like fashion. The objective of Silent Hill 2 on the other hand is to find a missing woman who is supposed to be dead and rotten away. The chilling combo of weird nosies, Great graphices, and those Alien-demon things is what makes Silent Hill 2 one of the most exiticing games I have ever played. Horror and Scince Fiction fans should buy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Silent Hill 2","review":"While differing greatly from Silent Hill 1 and 3, Silent Hill 2 is a strong standing game in its own right. The plot of this game is stronger, more stiumulating and interesting than 90% of the other games and movies out there. Gripping to the end, this is a game NO survival-horror fan should miss. If you're confused at the end, or have unanswered questions (and you will)find Silent Hill Forum and join us in trying to figure it out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nerve-Wracking","review":"This game has more than lived up to my expectations. The first Silent Hill was enjoyably creepy, but this one is even more so. During some parts of the game, I find myself almost hoping every door I try to open remains stuck, so I don't have to face what might be on the other side. The graphics for the most part are beautiful, the sound effects are all very appropriate and add quite a bit to9 my apprehension for what's coming. Prior to getting the game, I really didn't believe the reviews that said \\"Don't play this with the lights off\\". But I have found that to be very true sometimes--I have been very tempted to keep them on. This is much more of a \\"shivers and tingles\\" kind of scary then the jump out of your seat RE kind of scary, and I approve!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT PS2 TITLE but....","review":"This is one of the best (...) PS2's games I have played but, there are a couple things I don't understand, like how long after does Silent Hill 2 take place after the first one? Or does it take place before? and also aquiring all endings are extremly difficult and requires strict guidelines, one simple small mistake could lead you to an ending you have aquired already, it's a pain (...) and can get very frustrating after putting an X amount of hours into one gameplay mode just to get an ending you already seen, and not to mention the flashlight isn't as bright as it should be, this version seemed like James was carrying a cheap wax candle around, but overall the game was great, it's 50x scarier than it's predecesor, and bigger and badder monsters, and cut scenes were done and placed perfectly, anyway, hope this helps someone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Super CD!","review":"This CD has been putting our family to sleep every night since we brought our daughter home from the hospital almost eight years ago. We have had to give this CD to family who have heard it as well. This is the perfect balance of relaxing music, with just a taste of nature sounds.

We have got to buy a couple more, so when our daughter goes on sleepovers she can take her copy along!"},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money","review":"Unfortunately, this cd follows the formula of so many other nature cd's, namely: 1. write some sappy, ..., synthesized music, 2. intersperse it with a few nature sounds, but only so the music dominates, and 3. hey! you've got a nature cd! Yeah, this stuff will put you to sleep, but only because its so bad. Actually, the first time I listened to it I was kept awake wondering why I had wasted money on such [stuff], and how much could I get for it in a yard sale. The selections all sound as if they should be theme songs for afternoon movies on Lifetime television, and if you didn't read the titles you would have a tough time telling many of them apart. The final selection is especially laughable, as it consists of grasshoppers and birds chirping in a thunderstorm (again, overshadowed by bad music). Hello, what's wrong with this picture? Bottom line, don't waste your money. I'm sorry I bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biased and full of conjectures","review":"This is, on the whole, a disappointing book.

I bought it for the Content Knowledge test and found it to be very useful in directing my review for the test. The list of topics IS long, but fairly exhaustive. I found the list of culture topics to be very helpful, as it gave me suggestions of people/places/things to study- many of which appeared on the actual test. The listening practice section on the CD (practice test) is easier than the actual test, but definitely helps you to know what to expect. The testing strategies weren't very useful to me, as they aren't very specific and don't tell anything that you didn't know from taking other tests. Also, half of the book is information for a test I wasn't taking.Overall, I definitely recommend buying the book to help prepare for the test- and buy it here for cheaper. Use it to outline your review topics and to get a feel for the format of the actual test."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only useful PRAXIS Spanish content review","review":"I haven't found anything quite as useful as this book to study for the Spanish Content PRAXIS. There is only one practice test, which is my primary complaint, but the test gives you a really great idea of how much studying you need to do. There is also a very detailed section of the book with a list of the topics that may appear on the test (grammr, history, literature, culture, etc) so I used that to study. I haven't taken the test yet, but I anticipate I'll do well.I recommend studying the list of topics before taking the practice test.

My only complaint is that it took over 2 weeks for it to arrive. When I contacted the seller to inquire about this, someone did respond promptly, explaining that they choose a certain shipping status--Media Rate, I think they called it--via USPS, which is why the shipping cost is so low. In the same message, they reminded me to please give a positive review, since their business depends on positive reviews. I didn't like that.

I love this C.D. and I have to give it the seal.-FM"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what the doctor ordered","review":"I enjoyed reading \\"A Magical Christmas\\". During the pre-Christmas rush it was fun to read something timelyand light with a simple plot. Many would argue that it was too light and predictable; but when one is busy, running around getting ready for the holidays it was a great diversion from the craziness. It is a \\" feel good\\" story with anuncomplicated, relatable theme. I would recommend it highly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to gritty vampire movies","review":"Great movie. I love vampire movies in general, but this was a good return to the grittier movie. Plus, who wouldn't like to see Wesley Snipes and Stephen Dorff battle it out? This is by far the best movie in the trilogy, but they're all good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye popping special effects, great story!!","review":"By far the best vampire film I have ever seen! Wesley Snipes plays Blade, a half vampire half man on a mission to destroy all vampires, find a healing for himself, and find the vampire who killed his mother and made his what he is. Great special effects and fighting. This is for any fan of horror/action. Rent this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"awsome,Loved the action","review":"It was one of the best movies I ever saw.I am an action movie Buff.Next to the die hard and the steven segaul movies,Its up there with them. Thanks Gary Betters,older but alive"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT MOVIE!","review":"This is a great movie with plenty of action, great fight scenes and lots of gore and blood. It moves at a fast pace and holds attention throughout. Wesley Snipes is great in this role and is the perfect choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just when you thought the comic based movie was dead...","review":"Finally, a movie that compares with the original Batman. Fight scenes are well choreographed and the cinemetography is to die for. A definate recommendation for those looking for something new and different."},{"rating":"2","title":"BLADE IS BRILLIANTLY CRAFTED!!!!!!!!!","review":"So its not perfect...But its damn close. I heard dozens of people say this movie sucks, but it was better then Spawn. I loved Blade. The first 40 minutes and the last 50 minutes are worth every second. Stephen Dorff is OUTSTANDING as Frost, but maybe a little miscasting mistake was made on Wesley's side. But if Wesley declined then Will Smith would have gotten the role (I'm guessing). I love the final showdown. Great ending which hints to a sequel and cant wait till it comes out. Blade is fantastic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where was the writing?","review":"I thought this movie had great action, great special effects, and terrible writing. Everything that happens in the movie is a cheesy, overdone cliche - but if you don't care about well-written movies, it's an entertaining action flick. I personally thought it was terrible, but some people love this kind of movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"Especially if you have any interest in Vampires in fiction or movies. Blade totally mishandles the genre. I mean vampires in the sulight because they're wearing coverup? Give me a break. And could the plot have been more predictable? Just what was the point of N'Bushe Wright's characther, Dr. Karen Jenson? She certainly didn't add anything to the film, unless you count that conspicuously added plot twist that foils all those evil vampires in the end--the plot twist which was, I might add, about the lamest development in the entire movie. Now I really like Wesley Snipes and Stephen Dorff, but not even they could make this movie fly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uhhhhh.... whaaaaaaat?","review":"I really hope the people who wrote the reviews here aren't a random sampling of the population. The bad guys had the \\"cowboys and indians disease\\" in that they couldn't hit the broadside of a barn with a machine gun, the acting was mostly bad, there were ridiculous amounts of blood, the plot was somewhat inconsistent, and I fail to see how a god could be vulnerable to chemical reactions. I thought the beginning scene was somewhat clever, but from there the entire movie went downhill.Fortunately, if you turn your brain off the movie can be entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"This movie wasn't as good as everyone says it is. The action was phony, Snipes did a bad acting job, and there was more gore than I expected. I also found it hard to believe that a man could walk down the street in broad daylight with the handle of a sword sticking out the back of his coat without anyone noticing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bite me!","review":"If you're into vampires, martial arts & action, then meet the black Arnold Schwarzenegger.LOLYeah, Arnold's no vampire which is why they cast Wesley.The whole movie rocks until the end, then you get cheesy digital effects ( e.g. the red marshmellow man )."},{"rating":"1","title":"No No No","review":"the original ratio is 1:2,35 = cinemascope also on DVD, But here on Blu-ray is the ratio fu..ing 1:1,78 = 16:9 TV-widescreen) my question is WHY !!!!! don't buy is blu-ray !!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Blu-Ray!!","review":"I was very excited to get this movie on blu-ray since it is one of my favorite vampire movies and man was it a let down. I've had the dvd version of this movie for years and I sold that copy to get it on blu-ray and was in for quite a shock. The transfer looked worse than a dvd and the big kick in the face is that it isn't even in widescreen!!! WTF!! I have never bought a blu-ray where they took the original widescreen version and made it a pan and scan version. This is just unacceptable!!!! I guess that I will just have to go back and buy the dvd version. Stay away from this blu-ray release at all cost!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the ticket","review":"I found this movie to be distrubing. The night club where blood is sprayed down onto the part goers was completely disgusting. There is only one thing that I will admitt, the graphics to the movie were cool.

To those of you who did think that this was an awesome movie, sorry, I just don't see it that way."},{"rating":"1","title":"What'd I miss?","review":"The only thing I liked about this film was Snipes! As usual, he is the best thing in any movie he appears in. Dorf is really unbelievable as the bad guy. But the whole vampire scenario is too weird for me.

Wesley Snipes is an actor of questionable acting skills. The character is someone you can't root for or even remotely like. This movie is way, way overrated.

Not a good movie at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!","review":"Garbage! Pure Garbage. What was this film lacking? Oh Yea: Plot, Interesting Characters, Detail,any sense of story,and good acying.

Stephen Dorff was just absolutely great as Deacon Frost! I love Stephen. Wesley was great in there too. The special effects goes great along with the whole movie. Just rent or buy this movie! I think it's a must see! The soundtrack is really good too! Have fun and enjoy the movie..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guns, Vampires, Swords... what more could you want?","review":"Blade is a vampire movie, and action movie, and at times, a comedy. Because of the vampire twist a lot of people will shy away from this very well done movie, but they shouldn't. The story is well thought out, with an ending that does the movie.. and the viewers justice. Wesley Snipes is on to something special with this new breed of action movies. A horror/action/sci-fi movie that has something for everone. If your in the mood for an excellent action flick that rates as high as any... check out Blade. 5 Big stars for the movie that combines Dracula, Highlander, and the comedy of any Lethal Weapon movie out there. CHECK IT OUT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seriously Hype Movie","review":"Blade is definately the best movie of 98.With this movie Wesley Snipes proves he's still on top of his game. The movie had everything, action packed martial arts and even a hint of comedy. The scenes were incrediable. Not giving away anything, but the first scene will be your favorite. The movie was the bomb from the beginning to the end, you'll be upset that it had to finish.Whatever you do make it a priority to see this movie. It won't disappoint you, you'll be talking about it for weeks!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"quite good","review":"i liked this film more than i thought i would. it was better than Interview with a Vampire because at least here they dont say that \\"God doesnt exist.\\" Sorry Antonio Banderas, but that was the wrong thing to say!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable Action...","review":"Well, I don't think the story will get very high praise, but the intense and violent action makes it an entertaining movie to watch..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Vampire movie","review":"This just plain out good, way better than any other movie like it out there.

They are supernatural and should stay that way."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome!","review":"Wesley Snipes Stephen Dorff were born for this movie! Snipes is the perfect Blade, and Stephen! Talk about an evil mother...! And it had an original plot (cudos to the creators)! If you like solid action flicks, see this movie! I've made it a perminant and welcome addition to my video collection! If you really enjoy vampire films, you should also see John Carpenter's Vampires. Its much gorier, and a bit comical in some respects, but its still a solid movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome","review":"This is one of the best movies of all time. What can i say? But this movie rocks. The two leader actors are wonderful in this movie. It is a must see feature."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?","review":"Come on now, this movie blows. Not much of a storyline, and whats up with all the blood and gore? I don't remember any of that in the comic. However, it's full of fast action and mind boggling special effects, so it ain't all bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good action and effects,but poor acting and story","review":"I rented this to compare it with John Carpenter's Vampires and it falls apart when matched up. I has more blinding fast action scenes and some really cool effects (and some bad computer effects too).Wesley Snipes didn't even play the quiet butt kicker very well. He made this weird grimace throughout the whole movie,and had no personality or acting skills. Steven Dorff was just as bad.He looked and acted like a disheveled college kid who stayed up all night to study,than a vampire. I didn't really see a story,just quick MTV style action set-pieces.Oh well,rent it if you like action and hate good characters,story,and logic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adrenaline Rush Action","review":"Blade was a treat to watch. I took my girlfrind, who though we were going to \\"Ever After\\", and she loved it too. The begining 10 minutes and the last 15 are the best. After the movie I left the theatre ready to fight a few vampires myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top-of-the-Line Vampire Movie!!!","review":"Blade has to be labeled as one of the best vampire movies of all-time. In my opinion, the movie was very solid (plot-wise) from the beginning to the end. The only lame part had to do with the vampires using sunblock to prevent themselves from melting in daylight. With regards to the acting, nobody could have put on a better performance than Wesley Snipes. The fighting sequences in this movie were outstanding. I would go as far as to say that it was Bruce-Lee caliber fighting! In addition, if anybody were going to breakthrough from this movie, it would have to be Stephen Dorff. His acting in this movie should win him over as the next Gary Oldman for villain roles. I would recommend buying this DVD because you would be getting more than your money's worth. Aside from the movie, the DVD is filled with excellent features, production notes, artwork, etc. Know your role, and buy this DVD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Vampire of the new Millenium","review":"It seems that vampires have come of the times and are trying to adapt themselves to the new genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bloody Amazing!","review":"This is one of the few vamp movies out there that keeps you on your toes through the entire movie.

And the cast is HOT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Blade the best movie of '98","review":"This action packed thriller is a must see for vampire killer movie fans. It had the perfect cast starring Westly Snipes (Blade) and much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a slow moment","review":"This movie really has it all: superheroes, vampires, martial arts, an old guru, special effects, an awesome techno soundtrack, and a better-than-average comic story that successfully mixes tongue-in-cheek antics with Batmanesque characters. Snipes and Kristoffersen are a good hero/mentor duo. There is not a boring minute in this film. Go for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Want that Samurai!","review":"Lets just say that this has to be one of the best vampire movies I have seen up to date! The gore is great, the action is superb and the Rave scene in the begining is just awesome! The music gives the movie a great dark feeling to it, yet it energizes you to cheer when he dices a vampire to pieces. I think Wesley Snipes portrays Blade superbly! Even though he doesent say much, he doesen't have to! His dark coat, and shades with the armour popping out, gives the enemy the message that Blade is not someone you can fool with! The samurai is the coolest! I want one! Truly a great movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Blade is the man","review":"Blade has to be the best vampire movie since From dusk till dawn.I cant wait for the video.I've seen it twice already and definitly buying the video and can't wait for the sequel-David Watkins,Ireland"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding movie","review":"\\"I give her 50/50 do you remember Mr Crispy at the hospital\\" great halloween movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT MARVEL COMICS MOVIE! ONE OF THE BEST!","review":"It is a shame that so many of Marvels better known characters didn't get the fantastic movie treatment that Blade did. This is one exciting movie. Wesley Snipes does a fine job as the title character. The first film is far better than the sequels,but they are all good films. This is the one to watch!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Slicing through the competition","review":"From the superbly choreographed opening scene to the fight-packed finale, Blade is an action movie par excellence. Production design and cinematography are also excellent. The actors themselves are largely workmanlike in their performance, but this is balanced by the frenetic multiple style martial arts action. The extras on the DVD include three fairly lengthy documentaries/commentaries as well as support material. As to the DVD itself, the titles are a little hard to read, but the film-to-digital transfer shows few MPEG artifacts. The Dolby Digital soundtrack is crisp."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of blood, action, and its based on a comic book!!!!!!!!","review":"I saw this movie in the theaters and instantly loved it! I bought it at blockbuster and watched it and I still love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ultimate Hip Action Flick of the 90's!","review":"Quintessentially cast, and seemlessly directed, this epic of a lifetime will be popular for years to come. Wesley Snipes adapts his role as Blade with expert adeptness, and Stephen Dorff is wonderful as the ever so malicious FROST. Also notable are the performances by Arly Jover as the soltry Mercury, and Kris Kristofferson as Whistler. The action is intense, the gore is abundant, and the movie is a must-see! Go get it now! NOW!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty much another comic book to movie conversion...","review":"I've never been a fan of comic book super heroes including comic to movie conversions such as Judge Dredd and Barb Wire. I enjoyed the Superman movie many years ago and that was about it. Somehow vampires and karate just don't seem to go together. I prefer the more gothic Salem's Lot and Dracula styles. I enjoy slasher/blood/gore/supernatural movies and I think my favourite has to be Wes Craven's Scream."},{"rating":"1","title":"HIDEOUS, COMPLETELY, UTTERLY HORRIBLE","review":"This film being popular is proof that the average American moviegoer is a moron. Flimsy, uninspired plot. Grandiose, \\"seen-it-before\\", effects. Snipes does a great injustice to Martial Arts with his wooden, constipated, attempt at showing any kung fu prowess. Snipe's moves are so stiff, I imagine rigor mortis not being much more rigid. Instead of this nonsense, go watch a Hong Kong Jet Li or Gordon Lu movie if you want to watch real kung fu."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"IT STUNK\\"","review":"i THOUGHT IT WAS A VERY STUPID MOVIE AND COULD HAVE BEEN DOWN A LOT BETTER.NOT ENOUGH ACTION.THE WHOLE PLOT WAS STUPID.

It's illogical and silly. This film is made for kids under 10. I don't understand why some people (pls don't take it personally) would give it a thumb up for special effect. You can tell these effects is made of low budget worksatation by very limited resources. Nothing can compare to Terminator, Jurassic Park, Godzilla, etc... I couldn't sit for over 120 mins for this movie. Really waste of time. But enjoy the alternative ending. I think the studios should follow suit like this DVD. Great features, creative. Too bad that I don't like this movie, otherwise, I think it's worth of keeping one."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WORST VAMPIRE MOVIE!","review":"Why do everybody like this movie, saying this is ''the best vampire movie''. What a big joke for sure! But i can understand, those people are mostly teenagers who didn't have the pleasure to watch the ''real vampires movies'', specially THE LOST BOYS-the cult teen movie of the 80s and some others great ones, like Fright Night, The Fearless Vampire Killers (a classic), Interview with the Vampire (not so good, but much better than Blade). It's just a matter of search, look and you find, at least five vampire movies better than Blade. The best of all, is certanly, The Lost Boys"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY ALL THE SUCCESS?

(Sorry, couldn't resist.) Wesley Snipes is buffed up, but with no place to go. I can't imagine a more one dimensional performance than the one he mailed in on this movie. Come to mention it, just about the entire cast seemed to sleepwalk their way through this. Stephen Dorff was the notable exception, with a solid and sinister performance. In defense of the movie, there are some very stylish camera work, such as the \\"bloody disco\\" scenes. Soundtrack pretty much rocks, and a nice use of Kung-Fu fight coreography and Japanese manga images help out. But still not enough to really recommend this movie as anything other than 2 hours worth of mind numbing fluff.

That is unless you want to clean up afterwards."},{"rating":"1","title":"A WASTE OF TIME","review":"I cannot believe I wasted my time on this movie. It was such a disapointment. There was barely any dialogue. Wesley Snipes said, what, maybe 5 words in the whole movie. The ending didn't even make sense.

This was a ridiculous, cheesy, big fat waste of money of a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"I collect Vampire movies but this was dreadful.

DO NOT BUY THIS DISC!!! This is some weird French version. I've been waiting for Blade and Blade 2 for years so I was happy when I saw this come out. But when I put the disc in my player it goes straight to the movie. There are no menus on this disc. Not even a chapter list. The disc has no subtitles. The picture quality in the first 5 minutes or so is horrible. It gets better later but still not up to the standards set by most BD's. The audio quality is complete crap also. The lossless track sounded no better than the Dolby Digital version.And the worst thing? The picture is just a zoomed in version of a 4:3 presentation so you're missing a lot of image on the right and left sides. What a pile of crap. I had pre-ordered Blade 2 but once I saw this one I immediately cancelled my pre-order.Hopefully there will be a better US release in the future. This one sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is for the Canadian Blu-ray","review":"The movie is the incorrect aspect ratio and it's distracting. Sadly that isn't the only video issue. The picture quality if horrible almost as if the movie wasn't only cropped, but also stretched. No special features. The movie itself is awesome. Great action and effects that mostly hold up to today's standards. I recommend the movie itself, but be sure to buy the American version. (It was available when I ordered.

But the Blade series is slowly slipping into the while Batman downfall. Blade 2 started it all, where the filmakers give us less story and plot and mystery, and exchange it for flashy gaudy colorful sets and mindless action. In batman 1, the color scheme was simple, black, white, and grey. It had a sort of haunting theme to it, which i liked a lot. In blade 2, we are with black and white and gray, with a little bit of tan thrown into it. Which also creates the haunting effect of a good movie. Then batman made Batman returns and batman forever, and if u didn't notice, batman turned into a haunting superhero to nothing but a kids action figure. I just hope in blade 3 they stick to the same story and plot line, and give it some of the same color scheme that made the first blade movie so scary and likeable. Hopefully you people will know what i mean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"I've seen this movie atleast 200 times and I have only watched one other movie that many times and that's The Matrix!

Udo Kier is everywhere and is wonderful of course. But Wesley Snipes is just too much, and Kris Kristofferson is ridiculous. This whole film is ridiculous. I hear they are making a sequel, too, which is even more discouraging. What a waste of resources. Stephen Dorff is probably the only remotely appealing part of this film. The best part, though, was a quote from Snipes (probably attempting to be so wise and witty), \\"Some m----- f----- always has to try to ice skate uphill.\\" Or something positively ridiculous like this. This is campy and weird, and for that reason alone it might be entertaining (but I kept falling asleep)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A BETTER CHOICE THERE MUST BE","review":"There can be only 1... wait.. wrong movie. so.

The beginning promises a lot, with appropriate dark visuals, a well-created and intriguing atmosphere and some well-done action sequences. Sadly, after the first minutes the plot gets derivative and predictable, wretching an interesting and original concept. This urban, futuristic and edgy look at vampires ends up being a letdown, consisting in sequences of random fight scenes with plenty of gore moments, loud music, cardboard characters and campy acting. This is unfortunate, since it has some creative visual elements, which aren\`t enough to make it more than a bad b-movie that\`s just way too ridiculous to take seriously. It\`s not entertaining, either, not even in a so-bad-it's-good-way, so the disappointment is even bigger. Innocuous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blade is a must see!","review":"You don't even have to like comic books to enjoy Blade, featuring Wesley Snipes! The first 10 minutes are more action packed than other blockbusters like Bad Boys, and that is partly what makes this movie a huge success.After watching this movie again today, it struck me how many other action movies of that time period (late 90's) copy from Blade. There is a scene where Snipes meets Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff) in a park and Frost dodges bullets from Snipes assault weapon. Does the Matrix ring a bell?Other than X-Men 2 & Spider Man 2, this is my favorite Marvel Comics movie adaptation! For every succesful film, seems like there are 3 or 4 duds from Marvel ie, Daredevil, Fantastic 4, Punisher, The Avengers, Ghost Rider, for example.I've been a big fan of Wesley Snipes since Major League and he brings Blade, slicing to life!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blade steelbook","review":"Package had no protection!!

Commentary with star/producer, Wesley Snipes, you also hear from the production designers, composer, and a bunch of other folks involved with the production. There is even a brief history of the origin of the comic book character. Also included are extended and deleted scenes, alternate endings(with unpolished effects), and a slew of interviews with various above the line crew members, including the President of New Line Cinema.

Lenora saw racism behind ever door and Porter was the stereotypical white apologetic liberal. The only scene I enjoyed was the one where Lenora's friends - Pauline and Cleo met Porter for the first time when they showed up unexpectedly at Lenora's place.

When the story was told from Porter's angle it came across too too Politically Correct and not convincing. Even his southern family were PC. The advancement from dating to marriage again was not convincing and rushed.

The passing game is the most flawed. You absolutely cannot complete a pass with any quarterback on any team. I have not played one game where I had more passing yards than rushing yards and scored more than 2 touchdowns. The AI always picks off your passes or else your recievers drop them. However, the rushing game is very well done. The running back moves look much more realistic and they'd have to be since the run will be 75% of your offense.

Your saves are limited, and you have extremely low ammo. The directional buttons are extremely strange and you spend the first hours of the game learning how to move your character.

It's definitely the best one of the series, but it's still the same kind of game: run away from zombies, conserve ammo, find better guns, and follow an expanding plot that finally leads you to a giant underground base or something.

As said by many reviewers (i.e. gameshark.com), the character controls are so painful to a modern gamer that during a battle scene, you'll throw your gamepad on the floor."},{"rating":"1","title":"B.O.R.I.N.G","review":"Don't be fooled by the epic opening FMV, unless you enjoy wandering for hours searching for keys (or adventure game interpretations of keys), working though a boring and convoluted story, and above all not being scared; steer clear.The visuals may have been cutting edge on the dreamcast, but they're pretty bland and washed out on PS2, (not to say that the game should be judged completely on its looks, but it doesn't help)Voice acting is pretty bad, and dialogue is boring.Most disappointing is that none of the monsters are really scary, the best they get is mildly weird/gross.My Opinion: Resident Evil: CVX is boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little too easy","review":"After playing all of the Resident Evil games this one no doubt fits into the category that the 2 and 3. The puzzles are a little too easy and the items don't really need to be searched for because it is almost as though they are just given to you. The most difficult thing that I did notice was the lack of ammo in this game and that can come back to haunt you if you save at the wrong spot and then have to square off with one of the bosses. Especially in the end where you need to pump some serious ammo into the queen to even have her change form. All in all a very addicting game and it offered up hours of enjoyment. The scenes were really good although the love triangle is a bit much, and strange incestual vibe given off between Chris and Claire can get a little wierd at times."},{"rating":"2","title":"BIG JOHN","review":"This ... game was the best in its series. the graphics were great and the puzzles were crusifying.

I have one thing to say,GET THIS ... GAME!..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Game EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This game is amazing. Zombie dogs, Hunters, Poisonous Hunters, Tyrant, Nosferatu, Alexia, queen spider, spiders, Zombies, Albanoids, Alfred, Bats, Bandersnatches, Gulpworm, ants, Wesker and probably more are the freakiest, most terrifying things I've ever fought. The stunning CG and real-time graphics are by far the best ps2 has to offer so far. The gameplay and frightening atmospheres are stunning. Chris and Claire Redfield, the two best characters, are back, and are kicking some A$$. And of course a classic ending...the fight between Wesker and Chris. If you want an amzing game, buy this!- Evan, the most devoted fan to the RE series."},{"rating":"1","title":"ugh...","review":"well, i loved RE2 and RE3 and i assumed this one would be just as good.

AND THE MONSTERS ARE GREAT !! I GOT THIS GAME AS SOON AS I GOT THE PS 2 !MY ADVICE IS TO USE YOUR GUN ON ZOMBIES FROM A DISTANCE , AND SHOTGUN AT CLOSE RANGE WHEN OUTNUMBERED .BUT AIM UP -AND IT BLOWS THEIR HEADS OFF . SO IT ONLY WASTES ONE SHOTGUN SHELL.USE GRENADE ROUNDS ON THE HUNTERS . IT ONLY TAKES TWO TO FINISH THEM OFF . AND USE YOUR LIGHTER FOR POORLY LIT AREAS- THAT WAY YOU DON'T GET ATTACKED BY SURPRISE .DEFINATELY PICK THIS ONE UP !!AND PLAY IT WITH ALL THE LIGHTS OFF !YOU'LL WANT TO KEEP PLAYING IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN .... ONE OF THE BEST PS 2 GAMES OUT THERE !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"what's with all the good reviews?","review":"This is by far the stupidest game ever made.

Not Only Is It Scary, But It Is a great romance story as well. Trust Me This game will havee you on the edge of your seat. The Only thing that really ticked me off about this game was.....steve. I think he was a hottie (yes i am a girl) plus claire and him would make a good couple, personally i [don't think it] was a good idea to kill steve."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing New","review":"This game series has gotten old. RE 1 was awesome. RE 2 was even better, RE 3 was pretty good, but by RE CVX, it's just old. It's the same old solve a puzzle, shoot a freakish creature. Nothing new. I quit playing about a quarter of the way through. If you're a die hard RE fan, then get it. But if you're just a run of the mill PS2 player like me who doesn't follow any game series religiously, then pass this one up."},{"rating":"2","title":"KEEPS YOU ON THE EDGE","review":"This is one of the best games ever, you won't regret the money you paid, pretty horrifyng game and great cut scenes.

The graphics and voice-overs dont bother me, what bothers me is the you are constantly running out of ammo, health and patience. This is the 3rd time that I have had to restart the game over to see if I could save more ammo to kill that monsters in the airplane which by the way is practically invincible. This game is extremely difficult and limited amo and health does not help matters. My recomendation is to rent the game first and don't expect it to be like the other resident evil games."},{"rating":"1","title":"frustrating","review":"I have been a Resident Evil fan for quite some time so when I bought my PS2 this is one of the very first games that I bought.I am very dissapointed, graphics are O.K and the voice- over's don't bother me at all what bothers me is that you are constantly running out of ammo, health and patience, the game is too hard to beat, I have tried many times without any success and I am still stuck in the airplane trying to kill the big zombie dude which by the way is impossible, he never dies. This is the third time that I have started the game all over to see if I could save some more ammo and health. My recommendation is to rent the game first and see if you can handle it, and don't espect it to be like the old resident evil games."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for a person looking to shoot **** up!","review":"If you are looking for a good shootem up game that has a great storyline with it, don't buy this game. The best part of the game was the demo of Devil May Cry which is unbelievable. Resident Evil however is horrible grafics for playstation 2 and worse controls. In the time it takes to open a door you could run to your firdge and back and still wait and you go through lots of doors. If you are looking into this game for the holidays I would Seriously suggest get Devil May Cry instead because it doesn't have the hard controls and it has amazing graffics"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!","review":"My husband and I were really looking forward to playing this game and so rented it from the local video store. We were blown away by how awful this game is. We didn't even feel it was worth it to finish it and so returned it before seeing the end. The controls are some of the worst I've seen. I had an easier time with the original Mario Bros. The voice-overs were terrible, the storyline is predictable and almost identical to every other survival horror game. The game ceases to be scarey because boredom and frustration set in. You are constantly running out of ammo, out of health (if you can even find anything in the poor lighting), and out of patience. The game will keep you constantly running from one building to another to fit the pieces of the puzzle together. This is the sign of a game made without the designer using any creativity or intelligence. I don't know what Capcom was thinking, this is absolutely terrible. I wouldn't recommend this tripe to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Resident Evil genre is in full swing here!!","review":"Not much has changed as far as the controls go here, but there is new turns in game sequences that Dreamcast players didn't experience when it was orginally released for them.

I think the biggest problem, if you call it a problem, is that Belinda strays too far with her other tracks from the established sound of her previous albums. Which isn't a bad thing, but I think it may have turned many people off. Still, for something different and interesting to listen to, check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album is her best!","review":"This album is nothing short of amazing. I rarely like a cd as a wholw but this was it for me. Every song is perfection and that is really hard to come by this day in age. I especially liked the songs, I Plead Insanity, Little Black Book, Love Revolution, and Do You Feel Like I Feel. Very Highly Recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent album, but not her best","review":"This is Belinda's fourth album and quite different from her first three solo albums. It is in general harder and livelier than her previous ones and quite an optimistic album. One can feel that Belinda had quite some fun and joy during the making of this album.Best Tracks on this album are \\"I Plead Insanity\\" (what a beat!), \\"Love Revolution\\", \\"Loneliness Game\\" (the softest song on the album, a reminder of her past) and the title track \\"Live Your Life Be Free\\".The album contains 11 tracks with a total length of 51:09. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"Don't bother buying this one unless you enjoy run-on sentences and grammatical errors.

The plot moves along with a few twists as we learn more about the circumstances of the mother and the daughter.A bittersweet film that slowly grabs your attention and refuses to let go. The filming in Australia is understated and much of it takes place in a travel trailer/mobile home park along the beach.Overall one of the best films I have seen. Highly recomended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"hot, hot, hot!","review":"Wow...after my recent trip to the Dominican Republic, I fell in love with this passionate music.

You should have seen the look on the faces of the guys in the El Camino when they looked over with a start as I was yelping out a Bachata shout! Anyway, I highly recommend this cd.

The writer & director, if they are going to tell a story, they should finish their story however they think is appropriate and not leave it up to the audience to create their own ending. This ambiguity laden story telling style is a self-righteous attempt to be clever, intelligent and complex. But instead shows a lack of direction. The acting was flat, lacking emotion and depth.

Although the large print is nice, I thought the larger print would be larger than other kindle font settings."},{"rating":"1","title":"difficult to use","review":"I bought this book for my Mother to use and I must say I was terriby dissatisfied with it. It is a great book if you just want to read from beginning to end, but to use while in church it is useless. I got the large print since my mother has trouble seeing the smaller prints, but when she wanted to find a passage or verse she had to type it in and she couldn't read the small print to see what she was typing..I tried it out myself and I consider myself somewhat computer savy, but I couldn't even navigate to certain books and verses.

There are many songs on this CD that are classics and its not as heavy as there past eforts perhaps a little more popular but by no means a sell out .

We were REALLY looking forward to this album, but it's been a big disappointment. It's not because Bo's voice doesn't sound good, because he has an awesome voice. It's just that, for being a rocker, he doesn't rock too much. His songs all sound about the same with very little variation. I only had one that I would actually listen to on purpose, the rest just fade into the background. If you don't believe me, click 'listen to all' above, and just let the songs play for a few seconds before clicking on the next song. They all just sound blah. I am anxiously awaiting his next one in the hopes that he does better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Choosing an Idol","review":"I'll be the first to say I voted for Bo the entire time on American Idol. A person's attitude or the way they come across to me is important and helps me relate to their artistry no matter whether it is a book, music or art. It doesn't mean I don't like quirky artists in their own rights - I do and own the gamut on a CD collection.For a first album, I am thoroughly satisfied with this CD and it will play often. I seriously doubt it is going to be off much in the next couple weeks. The title song The Real Thing is catchy, done well, and suits Bo's voice completely. The whole CD makes me feel good and I haven't found a song I wanted to skip over. So far, The Real Thing and Valley of Angels are my favorites, but I like it all. I'll definitely be in line for his second CD.Bo appears to be a genuine nice, decent human being and it's great to hear good music from him!

There are only a couple of songs that i don't just completely love. The rest are phenomenal. There is truly something for everyone on this cd.

I never really thought it would be a Neil Young, even if I was hoping for it, but something less overprocessed and airbrushed in the production itself would have been an improvment for me, even with the same songs.Oh, and the album cover... to me... looks like he's channeling Constantine"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, No, Bo! Disappointing debut CD","review":"Thanks, Amazon, for letting me listen to samples of these tracks before I bought this CD. I was incredibly disappointed. The growly, throaty, low-voiced Bo I saw on American Idol is nowhere to be found. Instead there is a higher voice, multiple tracks that overrun Bo's main melody, and unexpectedly soft, melodic music. Glad no one bought this for me from my Christmas list.

He sounds exactly the same as every other mainstream male rock singer in 2005 - all of his songs have indistinct verses that surge into an anthemic chorus where all the heavy guitars kick in, inching the volume up to a point where it becomes a glossy wall of digital sound that drowns out his vocals. The music is tightly wound and meticulously clean, the antithesis to Bice's loose, earthy appeal"},{"rating":"1","title":"not too good","review":"really thought Bo's first cd was going to be great.I was let down.There is not one song on here that grabs you.Well not me.Hay!I bought it.So can you"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought it would be....big disappointment..","review":"While I am not a regular American Idol veiwer or a fan, upon channel surfing and hearing this guy sing, I thought, finally a guy that is gonna come out of this rediculous contest and do something real. Well, was I wrong. This CD, while the vocals ARE good (hence the 2 stars), the songs are awful. the same old regurgitated \\"new rock\\" junk that has already been recycled and remade way too many times.

I voted and texted voted thousands of times EVERY WEEK for Bo! I had my WHOLE entire street voting for Bo even if they didn't watch Idol, as a favor to me, to support Bo.And this is the result? I bought 10 copies of The Real Thing and I was so excited. I didn't listen to any samples and wanted to be surprised when I first listened to it. Boy, was I surprised!!!Bo's voice is swallowed up by over production and really derivative lyrics and chorus. I can't imagine how awful it must have been for Bo to be forced these songs.Idol producers, what a travesty you have done here! I don't blame Bo, he obviously had NO choice but to sing this mellow, bland, and completely ridiculous lyrics!!I can only hope that Bo will be able to make a 2nd album and show some creativity or at least be able to hear his beautiful voice more!

This is a pop album. Fluffy pop/rock if you want to be charitable. There's no \\"rock\\" in the album, and certainly no southern rock. It's not only that the songs are generic pop, but they also made Bo's voice generic. If I had listened to the tracks without knowing who was singing, I wouldn't have known it was Bo"},{"rating":"1","title":"GENERIC, BoRING","review":"He needs to get some voice lessons. He's just a fad, his five minutes will be over when the next American Idol starts. This CD stinks, its manufactured, generic music that all sounds the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I expected a much better CD from this year's AI runner-up. Something that showcased his soulful voice. Instead it's track after track of generic pop songs that has him straining at the upper end of his range. Not a good thing, this real thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"bo the rocker?","review":"Wow. I loved bo's style on idol. Who knew he'd make a borderline cheesy pop album. Lets hope he has more of a voice on the next one. I swore I'd buy this as soon as it came out. Im glad I listened to someone elses first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ring in the Holidays with \\"The Real Thing\\"","review":"I can't believe how AMAZING this album turned out. I was skeptical from the beginning. But I'm pleasantly surprised at how good this is. This album exceeded all of my expectations. Bo delivers the goods times ten on \\"The Real Thing.\\" I'm impressed from start to finished. If you're looking for a great stocking stuffer for the holidays. Look no further than here. This CD is perfect for all of the Pop/Rock music fans on your shopping list.FAVORITES:The Real ThingYou're EverythingU Make Me BetterLie It's AlrightHold On To MeWilling To Try"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Bo","review":"Loved it. The songs where Bo sings in a lower note are the best. The Real Thing is a good, pop song, but it's not the best song on the CD. I hope he releases several other songs as singles. This is the best AI debut album to date. Well done, Bo!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Catchy but disappointing","review":"I was a huge fan of Bo on AI4, and was really looking forward to this CD. I've listened to it a couple times, and I am disappointed. The strength and ability that I saw and heard on stage has not translated at all to this product. Even though the songs are catchy, they all pretty much sound the same. I am hoping that he was tightly controlled by the AI people, and that his best work is ahead of him. This just sounds like 11 Nickelback songs. There is not one song on here that captures his energy or even approaches his southern rock roots. Even though I voted for Bo, and I'm a rock fan from way back, Carrie's album turned out better. Pity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good singer","review":"I really like this album, Bo rocks! He can just keep up the awesome work and as long as he does i'll be here buying his stuff. He sold very well, he didn't sell amazingly well like Carrie(who's also very talented) but he did sell well, and I think he has a bright future. Hopefully he'll have more input on his next album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very strong album, I am very happy","review":"Incredible debut! Awesome work on his part, he kept it up throughout the whole thing. You never feel pressured, he loves singing and it shows. It rocks so much you have no idea! =)"},{"rating":"2","title":"SLICE OF BICE SO NICE","review":"Check this cd out. So many amazing tunes to choose from. I can't even pick a favorite. This is a great first album that showcases Bice's versatility, passion and amazing vocals. Love the songs and the fact that Bo wrote some of them. Truly gifted, man. Rock on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great debut!!","review":"Just got my cd (actually it's the dualdisc, which is recommended if you really want to hear the \\"real\\" Bo!) and just love it! It does showcase a more pop side of Bo Bice but there are still some really great rock tunes on there. The best is \\"Willing to try\\" which Richie Sambora helped write, it's terrific...Bo's voice is all gravelly on this one, so good! I think this is a great debut cd...don't listen to all the nay-sayers who are slamming the man, give the CD a spin and make up your own minds. Here's wishing for many years of creativity for Bo..support him now so he can make even better, more personal CDs in the future!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great voice, bad songs.","review":"Bo sang Whipping Post and Vehicle on American Idol and blew the house down. Those are the kind of songs he's meant to do. Of course he has the voice to sing anything but that doesn't mean he should. These songs are pop crap and everything that is wrong with radio today. I hope he didn't have much to do with picking these songs. Slick, over produced, unoriginal lyrics, just a really disappointing cd. If you're looking for an excellent cd with Bo Bice, track down a copy of the cd (Recipe for Flavor) he recorded with his band Sugar Money prior to American Idol. ------ After listening to the album several times it's slightly less awful and I do love Bo's song Valley of Angels. However, I still think most of the album is lukewarm."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's The Only Thing I Listen To Now","review":"I loved Bo on AI and I love this CD. Bo's voice is magnificent on all of the songs. He is a true star. I can't wait for the video and the tour!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A CD worth listening too","review":"First off, toss away the preconceived notions, good and bad, you have of Bo Bice and then listen to this cd with an open mind.This isn't a southern rock cd - but it is good. It's very good. With only one or two (at the most) skippable tracks and atleast 5 radio worthy songs throughout the cd, this is a cd you will have in your cd player for months to come.It has a nice variety of styles of music - and Bo adjusts to all of them well.Very good for a debut cd. I highly recomment the dualdisc over the cd for the simple pleasure of the 3 bonus tracks it contains.I'm not disappointed - not in the least. Congrats to Bo on an album he can be proud of."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated Star!","review":"3.5 stars??? are you crazy! This is one of the best Cd's out there today! Bo rocks, and this CD is one you can listen to over and over, and people of any age would love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Debut CD","review":"I think Bo and his producers have put together an excellent debut CD. Every song is good. There is not a dull one in the bunch. If you like contemporary Pop/Rock, then I wouldn't hesitate to pick up this album. I'm not disappointed. This is the type of CD that I was expecting. Bo sounds great and I'm so thrilled to finally own his album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bo Bice - neutered","review":"This album could have been Bo's opportunity to bring southern rock n roll back to the mainstream. Instead, he sings a bunch of mediocre mainstream rock/pop songs that neuter the energy and rawness that made Bo a breath of fresh air on American Idol.A good example of the neutering on the album is U Make Me Better. This is the best song (which is probably not saying much). It starts with a great rock riff, which gets repeated occasionally.I thought this song would really rock!But then the verse slows everything down and it turns into a typical \\"heartache\\" song that wouldn't be out of place on a Backstreet Boys album. We don't need more songs like this. We need rock n roll, Bo!Clearly this is the work of producers/songwriters telling Bo what to do and not an album of what Bo would do if he was unleashed. Hopefully his second album will exhibit all the roots of his rock n roll experience, none of which is here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy for Bo to support next CD and Bo's voice","review":"I am a Bo fan but here's my problem with the album: The whole thing can get very monotonous, which makes it hard for me to find a \\"favorite\\" that actually stands out.Despite my disappointment, like many others, I bought the album to support Bo, in hopes that he'll get his chance to \\"breakaway\\" on the second effort. I still think Bo has an incredible amount of potential, and I'm not going to hold this album as a strike against him"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nobody should have to sing this junk!","review":"Bo Bice sounds just like all the other good singers out there, but there's just nothing special here that stands out to me. It's as though the music industry has a big cookie cutter that they use to just produce the exact same sound and talent. Geez, can we get something new, nice and different for a change? Bo just does nothing for me - same old thing.Not one song on this cd can ever win an award or make it big for him so I dont' know what will happen. Bo sings Willing to try good but then can't hit the high notes, why bother putting high notes on when he can't sing high? bad decision, poor Bo, no clue what he's doing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who is this person pretending to be Bo Bice?","review":"I only gave this CD 2 stars because it is Bo.This CD is milksop. It pains me to say that, as I am a Bo fan. I could not tell when one song ended and the next began. It is no better than the lindsay lohan or ashlee simpson pop pablum.Also, WHO IS THE MAN ON THE COVER OF THIS CD? What did they do with our Bo?!? I could not believe it. The back of the CD is more like the Bo I watched for weeks on end. I am so disappointed.I went to the SugarMoney site and ordered their 5-song cd. That is much better than this over produced drivel. At least it sounds like Bo.I hope he can survive Clive Davis's pop-conveyor belt producing, and come out on the other side and play his own music. Curses on Clive Davis! Curses!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely dissapointing...","review":"Being very excited for this albums release, I was very dissapointed by the result. All of the Southern influence has been taking out him and besides the song written by Chad Kroeger, all generally sound like a continous Bon Jovi song with all the fun taken out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Epiphany: My Abundant Idol Knowledge Disturbs Me","review":"As bland as expected from an American Idol contestant, but not what should have been from one of the more dynamic ones. Generic, marketable country/rock, diet-southern fried chicken, Blues-less; all sung in a pleasant enough voice from a pleasant enough young believer. But from the man who gave us an electrifying a cappella 'Within A Dream' this year, this should have been an explosive debut. His 'Inside Your Heaven' towers above Carrie Underwood's, but analogizing two attempts of the same dreadful dirge isn't really saying anything, is it? Besides, she's the most soporific of all AI winners. In an American Idol realm, not as insulting as Clay Aiken, not as populist as Kelly Clarkson. But not as funky as Fantasia, or as exquisite as LaToya London. Beats Ruben by an Alabama mile, though [on CD, that is]. My grade: B-"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Bo","review":"This is sad. The reason I liked Bo in the first place was because he was a rocker. Now they want to make him a pop star. And some of those notes he pretends to hit are definitely computer generated, because he cannot go that high. Hint to RCA. Leave Bo to the southern Rock, Constantine is the one for vocal gymnastics. His next one needs to be better, or else there is no way he is getting any where with this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Real nothing on this one, sorry guys, Idol fans only will like this not music fans","review":"The name of the CD is ironic in that it is about as authentic as a three dollar bill. It is a pretty generic pop-rock CD that could have been produced by any of the male contestants Big disapointment. Too bad, hope he can have a career after this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dual Disc is the Way to Go","review":"I like most of this CD, (VALLEY OF ANGELS, HOLD ON TO ME, WILLING TO TRY, REMEMBER ME and IT'S MY LIFE are my picks) but, I love the DVD side extras. WHISKEY, WOMEN AND TIME, CINNAMON AND NOVOCAINE AND SINNER IN A SIN are fantastic and the video is a giggle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bo's music","review":"Pretty good music Bo made. Not what he did on the tv show though at all. Better to try harder next time and not be fake like this though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Woah, not much to say, it's as bad as you would fear and then some","review":"I'm surprised Bo only co-wrote/wrote two songs on the album itself though; since he's supposedly the \\"real experienced rocker\\" type I would've expected more. Seems like his material was mostly relegated to the dual disc, either because it's not commercial enough or not good enough or both.After listening to the 2 tunes (which on this album of subpar pop ), it's clear that they are not good enough as single material. Hope this pop cliche avenue bodes well for the powers that be behind this commercialization of Bo Bice. I ain't buying the next CD until I Hear all of the audio clips, Now that is the REAL deal!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Perfect Name...","review":"...for the \\"Name Game\\": \\"Bo Bo Bo Bice, Banana Bana Bo Bice...\\"As for the music, well...let's not even go there...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse CD to come from American Idol","review":"I was so looking forward to this CD. What a waste of money. Every song sounds the same and the lyrics are just lame. The only song even remotley close to being any good is Valley of Angels.

With that cutesy-pop photo cover, Bo must be trying to be the \\"Scott Baio\\" of the music scene. Some of these tunes had potential but the lyrics are geared toward 12 year olds. Yeah, you like the girl, we got it the first 8 songs- sing about something else. Some of the music is good and the vocals aren't bad, but since the lyrics ruin them, it's just not the worth the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad but have to be honest","review":"Despite my disappointment, like many others, I bought the album to support Bo, in hopes that he'll get his chance to \\"breakaway\\" on the second effort.

But no, it was real and it's bad. A total flop for the Bice-man/ sorry, better luck next time. I'm giving this back to my Dad and making him buy me another CD! If I wanted a Bon Jovi album, I could have searched the bargain bins and gotten one myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Real Thing Review","review":"This isn't a good album. I'm sorry, but it's not. The production is cheesy, and the vocals just don't work. Many of the songs on the Real Thing sound like those that stars such as Avril or Kelly or Ashlee passed on and they got dumped on Bo. Many of the songs especially the first 8, are kind of forgettable, to be honest. Some of the songs, Bo's voice sound computerized, espeically on The Real Thing the first song, not sure if that's the back up singer or what's going on. Not really good, sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"from an Idol fan","review":"OMG!! Bice fans STOP bashing Constantine and Anthony on EVERY website!! It's really dumb! I bought Bo's cd and I WAS going to give it a very nice and good job 3 stars but now it's getting one star from me! It's cute that Bice fans are giving it 5 stars, I have to laugh and I didn't even give Con a fake 5 star rating, but hey guess you have to to help him, I get it! lol.Bo seems like a nice guy even if his songs are boring except for the first song on this cd. He sings great on The REal Thing but c'mon POPPER Bo where's the soul, the blues, the funk? It's missing and you can do much better on the next one and I hope your fans will grow up along with you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This album is not outselling Carrie's..it is not selling also..the qua;ity tells it all..","review":"Bo has changes his tyle already..he dunno who he is..he's no longer the Bo we know..Lyrics no meaning..Songs sounded so similar one after another..voice sounded so 'enhanced' by new technology..no good no good..BAD QUALITY album..there's only one reason why..he cant sing.."},{"rating":"1","title":"I made list","review":"Here's the list so you can see what is best.1.

Not the rocking Bon Jovi of the 80's or early 90's but the latest AC Bon Jovi, that's what you'll get on Bo's CD.No surprise than that Bo's CD is actually tied for worst album of the year with Bon Jovi, by Rolling Stone. So, again if you like something more pop than Bon Jovi and none of the rock of the old Bon Jovi, you will like Bo's cd.Bon Jovi lost their spark about 8 years ago and have never rebounded. 1 star from me for Bo's Cd. It simply doesn't stand up to even Bon Jovi or other current artists in the genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"No point","review":"I don't understand Bo's cd at all. There's just no reason to buy it unless you already like him and don't care what he sings. If you are the type that would buy a cd if Bo sang even commercials, then you will probably love this cd. Everyone else, save your money and download the last song, it's not bad. Rest are just nothing special and some are just downright bad.Bo has nothing to say on this album, it's too bad. Maybe they are saving the better songs for his next album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bubblegum for the pre-teens, they'll love it","review":"I was semi glad Bo didnt win AI...simply because I knew what chessy popish stuff they'd make him do..So when he didnt win I was thinking..Yes..now he dosent have to fit their mold and he can just make a awsome album...well Clive my friend..WHAT HAVE YOU DONE!!!!.....This cd is cheesy! Yes they have made him more radio friendly..but to what expense? bO loses his whole identity in this cd.I have bought Kelly,Ruben, clay,Fantasia, and Carrie's cds and even though not all were good..all stayed true to themselves and the music they loved.And sadly Bo was the one I least expected to change for anyone..yet he did exactley that with this cd.I will always be a fan of the \\"real\\" bo and I guess If I want to hear him I can pop in a AI tape and enjoy and wonder \\"what could have been.......\\"Definitely NOT THE REAL THING,unless you mean real pop bubblegum!"},{"rating":"1","title":"pointless music","review":"There is nothing on this cd that indicates Bo has any true talent. There is no vision here. It's old, boring rock. I bought Bo's and Carrie's CD, Carrie's is far superior. Carrie is a true star -- a stunningly pretty voice and and even prettier face. Her debut album already selling more than 3 million copies. Bo will never come close to that. Plus, why release and album anyway. There is no market for Bo or his very dated, tired sound.

The great thing is he is just as good live as he is on this CD. Although the first tune is a bit on the pop side, the rest brings out the great southern quality of Bice's voice. Hope he can keep it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Debut CD","review":"I love this cd, especially tracks 7, 9, 10 and 11. I love the whole cd, but these 4 are my absolute favourites.

Bo is so natural and funny - you cannot help but love him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love BO not this 'Bo'.","review":"I pre-ordered Bo's CD through Amazon. I have to say I'm pretty disappointed. The first several songs all sound the same. The lyrics are sometimes sort of bad - \\"I'd eat off the floor for you.\\" - wow, if some guy said that to me to prove how he felt for me, I'm not sure I'd take it as a compliment! Without looking to see what track was playing, I had trouble distinguishing those first few songs - just the same thing, over and over, about how great the girl is, she's the best, she's the whole universe, the other guy treats her like crap, I'll treat you better, please baby please, etc., on and on...boring!! I wish there were other songs that did not have to with begging and pleading for some girl's affections. How about a song that just tells a story (and not a LOVE story!)? Don't get me wrong, I can be a mushy romantic, but sometimes too much of a good thing is...too much"},{"rating":"2","title":"Go Bo!","review":"I was reluctant to purchace this CD, even though I loved Bo on American Idol, but I loved it.

You have to give the CD a chance, if it doesn't get you the first time it will grow on you. Bo is unbelievably talented... he has contractual obligations and yes, this CD does reflect that, but I can't get enough if it. I listen to it every day and have grown to like it more each time. His voice is fresh and raw and I know his next CD will be superb. Buy it, it's worth it and he proves something other Idol winners, with the exception of Kelly Clarkson, couldn't, that he can sing anything ... he makes every song addicting. Way to go Bo!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Bo - Dislike this CD","review":"I loved Bo on the show but I'm very disappointed in this CD.

Bo is not orginal at all! Shameful shameful, I am so sad for him! This could be the end!People, buy the dualdisc you at least get some video of Bo so you know it's him not some cheap dumb singer like they made on this Cd.I Think Idol is punishing Bo like they did with the other runner ups and they gave him all the bad songs!I am never watching Idol again!!

I have to change it but remember people it's unreasonable to expect Bo to put out anything other than what Clive wants him to put out on his first CD. Give the man a break. He was doomed before he started anyway because of the Rock albatross around his neck and how he has to \\"represent\\".

Go to sites like Jam! and Entertainment Weekly which give this a thumbs down and you will get the truth, this is a missed opportunity all the way around. There are moments that Bo sounds good but horrible lyrics make this so laughable, \\"I'm out of gas\\" he sings on \\"Lie... it's alright\\" mimicking a girl who lies, well- he's REALLY out of gas on this one. Then he does all gospel at the end, but why bother? He's given us stale tired cliches and forgettable tunes up until then- maybe it's a prayer for forgiveness for this atrocity. He's got a lot of praying to do because this is AWFUL."},{"rating":"1","title":"what my Mom said.

The songs do fit and blend well together, it's one long big run of sappy, midtempo been there done that a million times. Small bright spot comes in track 11. Unfortunately it's too late as most listeners may not make it that far. No wonder the stigma still exists for Bo Bice, it's becasue of poor or forced choices. ouch.Nothing new brought to pop and or pop/rock. Bo's vocals are backseat to the laughably bad songwriting and overpowering instruments."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO Bo it's ain't real it's machinery slop!","review":"What the heck did they do to Bo???I didn't want to buy Rick Sprinfield meets Bon Jovi!

Bo sounded great on the American Idol Red Cross Charity CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Comedy Record","review":"Oh, boy! This thing is unintentionally hilarious! It is sooooooo bad, it's funny. Bo Bice said \\"We're making a rock-n-roll record\\"- Really, Bo? This poppy junk is rock-n-roll? You have serious perception issues if you think that. It's about as rock-n-roll as the Partridge Family.The lyrics on this seem like they were written by a twelve year old! \\"Lie.. it's alright\\" is so cheesy bad- there is no reason for something like this to be on any album. All the songs sound the same, and it's all about love, love, love over and over and over again until you're sick. He has NOTHING to say. It is such an assembly line piece. It is terrible. But I'm not going to tell people not to buy it, I think you should! Please buy this so you can rest easy it is as awful as everyone says it is, and it's so bad, you will laugh like crazy, so it's not totally worthless, you get a good laugh - that's worth something these days, right?"},{"rating":"1","title":"BO-ring","review":"I was quite disappointed in this CD -- not in Bice's vocals, but the insipid songs and lyrics.

I love it, it's just incredible. Keep it up! Rock ON! Woah you rock, keep it up forever. Awesome album"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was expecting","review":"This album was not what I was hoping for at all, after hearing Bo sing the southern rock and upbeat songs from American Idol. Obviously he was doing covers, but I was hoping to hear more like that in his album. This album is trying to be mainstream pop and fails, the lyrics are mundane and 2 of the songs actually sound like the same song rewritten.I can only hope that he can create something better in his second effort, because this fell very short of my expectations for him. His voice was overdubbed or something in alot of the songs, it almost didn't even sound like him.I gave it 2 stars because it's Bo, and I KNOW he can do better. This material was just wrong for him.. It almost sounded like a Bon Jovi album that didn't make it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bo needs to find his place","review":"Just watched Blades of Glory and searched for more of Bo online. Listened to a few selections hoping to find his throaty bluesy Skynard voice and found a guy trying to emerge from the guitars screaming.

I too will wait for the next album where we hear the baritone give us his heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"The truly talented, Bo Bice...","review":"I too waited patiently for this cd to come out, and it was well worth the wait. Slightly calmer than anticipated, it took me a listen or two to appreciate all the songs. Now, it is the only cd I listen to - over and over again. In my car cd player I have this cd set on repeat and do not change it. This cd is a must have for anyone who fell inlove with Bo during American Idol."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is even better than I dreamed it would be!","review":"I have been a Bo Fan for a long time. I got to see his benefit concert for Katrina Victims in Birmingham, Alabama a couple of months ago and I realized what a huge star he would become. This CD gets better and better with each listening and I can't turn it off! I HIGHLY recommend it and will be anxiously awaiting the next CD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland as toast","review":"This album is awful, and it has a lower rating than Diana DeGarmo's and Justin Guarini's albums- so maybe you should buy that first before this flop runner-up.This album is a snore carnival.

About 60 of us. She is obviously a big fan of American Idol. I am a big music fan and enjoy many styles of music. I had no pre-conceived notions about what I would be hearing. I was hoping to find something positive to say about this CD but I have none. I won't be able to tell my friend the truth about what kind of music her hard earned money has been wasted on.All I can do is come here and let others know that you will enjoy this CD if you are a Bo Bice fan. Other than that, it's a waste of money and I'll be shocked if anyone outside of Idol will listen to this CD more than once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Real Thing REALLY alienating Fans","review":"They threw everything that worked for Bo on the show out the window - the Southern rock, the blues, the classicism - and shoehorned him into a bland alt-rock setting somewhere between Nickelback and Bon Jovi. Clearly, the idea behind this is that what appeals to the show's audience won't appeal to the record-buying public, particularly to teens, but instead of building on the audience Bo had on the show, The Real Thing alienates them"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tepid and uninteresting","review":"This effort by Bo was very disappointing. The guy singing on the CD has nothing to do with the totally out of control guy I saw on the American Idol stage. The songs DO all sound the same and not one of them makes me want to listen to this CD again. It's gone into my pile of stupid purchases and will be priced at a futureyard sale for about 50 cents. When I think of the wonderful heart and soul he brought to the stage in songs that showcased his country rock and roll roots and then I hear the pap on this CD, I know Bo is heading in the wrong direction. I'm not particularly fond of the hard rocker Bo either, but think his best vocals will be found in country rock and soul."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not distinctive, not Bo at all","review":"I'm listening to Bo's album and I have to say that I'm pretty disappointed. I really wanted to support both Bo and his debut album, but I can't in good conscience give it a high rating. It's honestly pretty bland and boring. I don't hear anything on it that is distinctively Bo at all. The performer that I got to know and love on the show isn't to be heard on this album"},{"rating":"1","title":"TOTAL MISFIRE!! Shame on producers!","review":"Full of formula, copycat, nothing really stands out, it's a total mess. Cliche-ridden, bad writing, most songs sound the same, a total miss. Hopefully,Bo Bice will get it right the next time.(I really don't even think it's worth 2 stars but I felt really bad for him and it's not his fault)."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star for ONE good song","review":"This cd is full of filler. Most of the songs sound like throw-away material that Bon Jovi or Nickelback didn't want to bother putting on their own Cd's. The lyrics are written so silly and simplistic and unoriginal, childish and boring. The most original song is \\"Lie, It's allright\\" and even that song is overdone and out of Bo Bice's vocal abilities to master at all.Over-production and copy cat vocals are rampant on this CD. Apprently Bo Bice hasn't decided if he wants to be Gavin DeGraw, Ryan Cabrera, or the replacement back up singer for Bon Jovi.Generic, boring and absolutely nothing new or original on this Cd. Exactly what American Idols will love. They'll buy whatever is put out there so quality is not important. Therefore one star for the Cd reaching it's goals.Make junk and people will buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not all girls deserve to win","review":"You people always choose girls over boys.

Get this for any avid pop/rock/Bo/AI fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"WTF happened to him???","review":"Just look at the cover art, that's extremely handsome, cute man is not the one we met in American Idol, but that's not all, the music sounds like anything on the radio. He sounds like a pure copy of groups like Nickelback, Creed or Matchbox 20, which i think is bad because i don't think he listen to those groups nor he wants to sound like them...Bo Bice has talent, right now all we can do is wait for him to take his career in his own way without the \\"American Idol\\" contract...."},{"rating":"1","title":"The \\"Unreal\\" Thing would be a more fitting title","review":"The \\"Real\\" thing captured many of us when he got up on the idol stage and made \\"Whipping Post\\" forever his song. Rocker, edgy, raw and passionate Bo is the man we voted for week after week. This is what many of us were expecting on his CD. This watered down, neutered Bo is nothing like \\"The Real Thing\\".I love Bo, I think he has incredible talent and all that's needed to be a mega-star but Clive Davis and company have done him and his fans a terrible diservice with this CD. It's generic pop-rock fluff that would sound the same if anyone else recorded it. Cliche after cliche, one standard guitar riff after another and the unemotional choruses sung by a man who's been forced to sing stuff he obviously has absolutely no passion about."},{"rating":"2","title":"good album","review":"During American Idol, Bo Bice won over fans with his Southern Charm and his amazing live performances. His debut Album \\"The real thing\\" doesn't disappoint, with a solid collection of pop/rock songs. The vocals are fantastic, the lyrics are well written and all the songs are great.Standout songs include: \\"It's my life\\", \\"willing to try\\", \\"the real thing\\" and the best song on the album \\"Valley of angels\\", which is co-written by Bo. Bo's soulful voice really shines on this CD, and combined with good song writing, this is a great Cd to buy for christmas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gotta Love Bo Bice","review":"I picked this up the day it came out. I have been listening to it in my car every day this week on my way to work (I have a long commute and can almost listen to the whole thing each way). I love all the songs on the CD. Track 3, \\"U Make Me Better\\", is my favorite but I love them all. The only bad thing I have to say is that it is a bit over-produced. Sometimes the music is so loud that it kind of overpowers his voice. I love his soulful, gritty voice so I just crank up the volume so I can hear his vocals better. I wish they would have included the song he did a capella on American Idol. It gave me chills. But I expected this to be a little down-the-line, standard album. I think they are going to see how this CD does before letting him spread his wings a little on the next CD. I can't wait!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this a joke?","review":"I thought Bo was making a rock album? This CD sounds like Barry Manilow trying to sing some pop songs with electric guitars all over the place overpowering his voice! Feel bad for the guy, Bo maybe coming in 4th or 5th would have been better for you. What a waste. I don't know if I should laugh or feel bad for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Honest Opinion","review":"Yes, I am a Carrie AND Bo fan. And frankly I am getting rather tired of all the bashing between the two. It is really repetitive and immature and I really hope that the ridiculous \\"feud\\" will end soon. Now that that's been said, I have to say that I enjoyed this debut CD. It had a good mix of soulful ballads and rock songs. Although it may seem to be like a rip off of other artists, I could still hear the uniqueness of his voice, and that aspect of it really makes this CD worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great voice going to waste","review":"This album is just a collection of boring, soft, ready-for-radio irrelevant songs. After a while the songs start to sound almost the same, faceless mainstream rock. Too much collaborators, too little Bo. A little bit more freedom would have resulted in a much more interesting album. It's like a soundtrack to a some trendy TV show.The guy does his best with the songs he's been given. He has such a good rock voice that it is a shame to hear it going to waste with a pile of generic unmemorable songs. Afterall this is a guy that became popular singing songs he liked that were almost entirely alien (Allman Brothers, Badlands, Jim Croce...) to the core audience of American Idol.Next time let the guy really do his thing. The demos with his band Sugar Money are way superior. \\"The Real Thing\\"? I don't think so, maybe the next album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bo is pretty cool guy","review":"He rocks!

BUYER BEWARE!!","review":"I have to say I was diappointed \\"Vehicle\\" was not included because I thought it was his best song he sang, though I was not unhappy that he did not include \\"Inside Your Heaven\\" but listening to this so-called music, I wonder why he bothered not including it when everything else is about as sugary and fake as that song was. I could understand if everything else was cutting edge, but this is just bad elevator music.

I enjoyed Bo on the show and thought I would take a chance and buy his album without hearing any of the songs. I popped in the CD, listened for a minute, found myself hitting the forward button to get to the next song hoping something would WOW me. Nothing did.The verses on Remember Me started off really great and I thought, this song will be amazing, then came the chorus to ruin all hope. I never heard Bo sound more whiny and terrible than on the chorus of this song. I dont' know if he is singing out of his range or what but it was bad to hear.I gave this CD to my 12 year old sister and she said she liked 2 of the songs so at least the CD is not a total waste for my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just read this from somewhere and i think its really true...","review":"If ever Bo's album sell more than Carrie..it's because of the following 3 reasons:***The date of released is very near Christmas(Unlike Carrie's) and parents bought this for them..or give them money to buy..***Bo has more adult fans than Carrie does..and this means they can afford to buy more than one record..(i got one Bo's fan friend who bought 10 identical ones..he was 28 years old)..***Bo's base fans is bigger than Carrie's...coz he came from a bigger place...he got more relatives..and btw..Bo's family is richer!

Horrid debut for Bice- lackluster songs, weak seemingly computer generated vocals, stupid lyrics, no melody- there is a reason why it's getting bad reviews from magazines, it's NOT GOOD. I would sample some of these songs before you buy it, this is so no rock - it's more like schlock.This must have been a great present for Underwood fans. Any anxiety that Bice might take the spotlight away from her deservedly great album was laid to rest when they heard this awful junk. They must be sleeping like \\"babies.\\"This is horrible.

Too bad for him and he can sing on a few songs,but he can't sing up high and needs to stop trying, it hurts my ear to listen to him. Nobody would give this music a second chance if bo wasn't on IDol and had the older women screaming for him. Too bad they they want him to try and see his soul and looks like he did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing !","review":"After watching Bice on American Idol, I thought finally here is a new young talent that can rock. I was disappointed with the product we were presented with. Not only is \\"Vehicle\\" not on the disc, but there are no signs of the Skynyrd style southern rock that he sang on the show. It appears that yet another artist has been corporate-ized. All top 40 pop kind of stuff. My wife even noticed that the songs all kind of sound alike. Oh well, I'm sure the teen girls will go for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thumbs Up","review":"I was sceptical at first as to wether or not I would like the cd, I must say I LOVE IT!

I liked Carrie too, but I prefer rock over country.This album is okay. I guess I just expected more from Bo. It sounds to me as if he rushed the album to market. Not a bad strategy if you want to capitalize on the momentum from the show, but that strategy does not usually produce great songs.The Real Thing is a great song, but that is the only song I would put in that category. My recommendation would be to preview the songs on iTunes and just buy the ones you want. It is probably not worth it to buy the whole album.I expect his next album to be better...I know he has it in him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bo Bice","review":"I'm not usually a fan of rock music, but loved Bo on American Idol.

This cd is what he said he would never do - generic pop music. The songs are ok, the singing is ok - but it could be anybody. Carrie, on the other hand, has proven why she won AI.

Except I now know it's not a flower but a fungus. The only different song is the last one, the others sound so much alike, I can't remember them separately. Carrie's album, though, I loved right away. Do they put these albums out so close together to compete with each other? If so, big mistake, they should not do that in the future because her album is so much better than this one, it is embarrassing.Rotten cover photo (They have him looking like a girl), rotten songs, rotten singing, rotten music. Rotten everything."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sad waste of great talent","review":"The only interesting song is the title song, \\"The Real Thing\\". The rest of the CD was full of un-noteworthy, boring songs, not written by him, (he did collaborate on one). The songs were also not the style of songs I had come to expect to hear - as soulful and gritty as the songs he sang on the show, \\"American Idol\\". I waited excitedly for this CD to come out, but was sadly dissappointed. Maybe he and his producers were too rushed to put out a good product. I hope his next one is better, but I'll borrow and listen to friend's copy, to decide if it's worth buying my own.M.

It's the only use you will get out of it because I would be surprised if anyone would want to hear the horrid music again after one time. I would like to blame Clive Davis but Bo said \\"I had alot of input\\"- well, that's sad because if he had alot of input, it only goes to show he is much less talented than I thought and I was tricked watching the show thinking this guy had potential. Bad bad songs. He doesn't sing them well. The overdone guitars are like out of some bad 80's album.

If I was not introduced to him through AI and had not seen some of his live performances, this is not an album that I would have bought. What would make me happy is if he releases an album good enough so that I could say no matter how he became known to me I would have bought this album and as of yet he has not done that"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Santa!!!","review":"I got this as a Christmas gift but my friend was leaving on vacation so we opened them early. Okay- I never watched that show American Idol but I'm willing to give anything a chance and my friend likes to push the show on people but said this guy was different. I'm sorry, but it's terrible and I'm going to try to exchange it for Green Day's new live one because I did not like ONE song on this whole CD!!I like heavy rock but I don't mind pop/rock but this is just drivel. It's so manufactured but in a bad way, and the lyrics, they are sappy and I'm a lyric kind of girl, I like rap, punk, too but this is just soap opera stuff. If you like mindless pop tunes get it, if you want something with more life, then avoid this like the flu. I've been a bad girl this year, but even I don't deserve this ash and brimstone!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The UNreal thing!!!!!!!","review":"\\"Be true to yourself\\". They said that on the show.Bo said he's not a pop singer.???????????????????? What about this music then?But this CD's songs and style are not true to Bo! Bo, hang in there. I hope you will be able to make the CD you want to make."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not there","review":"I loved Bo on the Show and I thought Carrie was ok. I thought they were definately the 2nd and 3rd best singers to ever hit the show. Kelly #1, Carrie #2, and Bo #3 - and 2nd and 3rd best performers, Kelly #1, Bo #2, and Carrie #3. That being said I expected Bo's album to be a blow away smash it - and this just isn't \\"the real thing\\" - sorry Bo, try again."},{"rating":"1","title":"you had to know this was coming.....","review":"I can't blame Bo for this CD but it is really boring. It got 2 stars from me only because it is Bo. Very typical AI first release. No soul - all commercial pop & ballads. What I don't understand is if they allowed Carrie to break the mold and put out a decent first country CD, why couldn't they have let Bo do a rocking CD? Oh well, this is not a surprise and it is always nice to hear Bo's voice. I bought it to support him but I can't say that I'll listen to it again.... I'll just wait for him to put out his next (and hopefully REAL) CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all what I excepted..","review":"I always thought Bo had a good voice and could sing good, but something, just something, isn't right with this CD. I don't get it. Bo seemed exciting and whatnot and this CD is boring. I do think he sings good but this CD, it sounds as if he's mumbling and they words wern't clear! It's a DISSAPOINTMENT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Edge?","review":"I am a Bo fan and was eager for this CD. I'm disappointed: none of the songs measure up to his Vehicle release or even to the Brown Skinned Girl track on the Santana album. Though he does a passable job with the songs he was given, they are generally smooth, mundane tunes - not one track has an edge. Maybe these tracks are decent fodder for pop radio stations, but this CD won't get much play time in my home. This all said, I am still a fan of Bo's voice & style and hope this release does well so he gets to put together a sophomore CD that is true to his southern rock potential."},{"rating":"1","title":"Funny how things work out","review":"It's funny and strange, I always voted for Bo in Idol 5 and Diana in Idol 4 yet I liked Fantasia's album better and now I think Carrie did a much better job than Bo in their debuts. I think it is because Carrie remained true to herself.This is the heart of what is wrong with \\"The Real Thing.\\" It comes across very phony and not true to Bo at all. He goes for a very Pop vocal/mechanized sound that is the antithesis of what he was all about. There are a few okay songs, such as \\"Remember Me\\" and \\"Willing to Try,\\" but it's certainly nothing like what you hoped Bo would do. It is a huge and utter disappointment. There is an abyss between what we were told we were getting and what ended up in our hands. I suggest Bo do a simple Accoustic or Piano album next time where he can shine instead of trying too hard to please the pop crowd. That's not where I thought his heart was, and I'm surprised he gave in so easily. 2 out of 5 stars. Better luck next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinks like dogpoo on hot concrete","review":"This album is some sort of bad joke on Bo's fans. He calls it the real thing yet at times he seems like he is doing a bad impression of Kelly Clarkson and then other times a bad impression of Bon Jovi. Who can know what is real or not?The songs are really bad. The first single is kinda catchy, that's why I bought the album, though it's nothing that great. I like \\"It's my Life\\" but that's about it- the rest sound the same, he should have called the album \\"processed cheese\\" because that is what it is. We Bo fans would buy it regardless, I think Clive Davis knew that so did not care about us or what we wanted. What a shame. Wait for his second album, if he gets a chance to do one, this one is the pits."},{"rating":"1","title":"not too good","review":"I really think the song writers have come up with some really good lyrics, and the tunes are good,but I truly hear them being song by other artists. I know to some Bo is the best thing on earth. To me I get Nothing! Sorry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks Bo!","review":"Bo Bice should have won Idol 4. I bought Carrie's album too and like it. I have to say there are songs of hers that I do skip because they do not have the same quality as other songs on the album. I can't say that about Bo's album. My husband and I have different tastes in music sometimes but when it comes to \\"The Real Thing\\" we like all the songs and never skip any of them. It doesn't matter whether he sings pop, rock or country..in my book, good is good and bad is bad. Bo is talented no matter what style you want to brand him with."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!!","review":"First listen thru, I was listening for the rock, and did not find the kind of music I expected. Second listen, I realized that the music was different than expected, but awesome!This is one of the very few albums that I own that I can say I LOVE every single song. I listen to it all the time, and purchased several copies for Christmas gifts.After hearing this album, I am even more anxious to have Bo in concert nearby so I can attend.BO ROCKS!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Idol Debut Album","review":"There is not one bad song on this album. Is it terrific. I can't stop listening to it. Love \\"You're Everything\\" and \\"Valley of Angels.\\" MUST BUY !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hugely disappointing","review":"Anyone who truly appreciated Bo's talent as a southern rock singer/songwriter will detest this album. It is absolutely horrible. I was so excited to get it, then heard the songs and couldn't believe my ears. Every song sounds exactly the same, they are all too high and too fast. From the list of well-known songwriters I would expect better (though I think he is a better songwriter than any of them). Really bad move by the record company. Why would they turn away from the music that made Bo popular in the first place?! I can only hope his next release is his own, because this is surely not the cd he would have wanted to make.The ONLY good thing on this cd is the ONLY song Bo wrote - Valley of Angels. It is honestly the only song that enables us to glimpse the Bo we all became fans of.I still recommend buying the cd, just because no one should take other peoples' word on music - you like what you like."},{"rating":"1","title":"listened to it once","review":"i have had this and listened to it once. yeah he has a great voice, but i didn't find anything that wanted me to come back to listen to it again"},{"rating":"1","title":"Let him sing his own songs, record company!","review":"After listening to what Bo could do on \\"American Idol,\\" especially the song he sung a capella, I decided to snatch up this album as soon as it hit the market. Egad! Where's the Bo I know?! I was certainly disappointed. After getting the album, I happened to watch an interview story where cameras followed Bo in the making of this thing. It was a terrible choice on the part of the studio/producer/record company/whoever's ultimate decision this was to not let Bo sing his own songs on this album. He's a great song-writer and can put his fantastic voice into his own songs with so much more heart than this album delivered. If you want just another album with so-so songs on it, go for it. If you want the real Bo, hope and pray that the undoubtedly stagnant sales from this album don't stop him from making a second album that demonstrates his true ability. I am not impressed with the square hole he got crammed into on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bo is the real thing!!","review":"Just got a copy of the CD and have to say that it's fantastic! All of the songs have the potential to be top 40 hits and get lots of radio airplay. My favorites are \\"Willing to try\\" and \\"Valley of Angels.\\" I'm so proud of Bo and wish him continued success in the future...now got out and buy this CD!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunate","review":"Grading this one low for the missed potential. With his age and experience, I was expecting more. Much more. Unfortunately, this album is completely generic. Only with 'Valley of Angels' does the listener get a hint of what might be the real Bo. Then again, Bo has said he's happy with the album, so maybe this is the real Bo. Too bad if true, because, like countless others, it would mean he has nothing interesting to bring to the table. White noise would have been more engaging."},{"rating":"1","title":"When will Idol learn!!","review":"P know American Idol tries to get these cds out in a hurry but that is not necessarily a good thing. I liked Bo's voice, it sounds a lot better than it did on the show. That's why I gave a star. The songs stink, too much alike. I'm just telling it like it is. This is a filler cd. You have Idol to thank for that. Rush jobs hardly ever create great art."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"So what?\\" songs","review":"I thought Bo Bice was going to awe us all with his debut album. Instead, I was left wondering why he bothered to record this CD. The only song worth listening to is \\"Valley of Angels,\\" as it reflects the true style of the real Bo; the rest of the songs are very forgettable. We know Bo Bice can do better, so I am already looking forward to his next CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is Bo??","review":"I really wanted to like this cd. The Bo Bice from American Idol is a great singer. I had the privilege of seeing him on the tour and he is an outstanding musician with commanding stage presence. The only hint of that Bo Bice on this album is the last track. I am sure the producers were trying to make this cd more marketable and radio friendly. Maybe it will be...time will tell. But I hope he gets a shot to record his own music in his own style in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misstep","review":"I think this album was a terrible misstep on the part of 19. Maybe marketing to a younger audience will prove to be a financially wise move, but it's an artistic mistake. I really hope Bo can come back and do an album in his own style. Seriously, this is pretty depressing."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWLFUL !!!","review":"THE CD SUCKS...NOT ROCK...NOT BO...TERRIBLE SOUND...TERRIBLE LYRICS...TERRIBLE SONGS...TERRIBLE CD COVER...WHAT SHOULD I SAY EXCEPT...IT SUCKS!!! SAVE YOUR MONEY !!! IDOL ROCK NEEDS TO BE LEFT IN CONSTANTINES HANDS !!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the Rock?","review":"Bo had a wonderful voice on American Idol; however this Cd doesn't do him justice. for some reason BO sold out, and went out of the Rock genre into teen pop.Although the CD had its highlights, the other tracks all sounded the same. It was almost impossible to Distingish tracks from one another. the Highlights Are: The Real Thing ( though it is pop), willing to try, and Valley of Angels are all good.One warning for Bo fans, this Cd is NOT a Bo Cd! He is completly out of his element. Hopefully his sophmore Album will be better. The way it looks they may not be one, thanks to low record sales from this garbage. If you want to buy this, then buy it next week when it will be in the bargain bend at your local department store along with other America Idol failers like Diana Degarmo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the Dual Disc","review":"Don't waste your money on the CD but buy the Dual Disc version. The songs (Not Bo's singing) are terrible. Almost every song is you did me wrong or I did you wrong or why don't we love each other. The only good song is Valley of Angels which was written by him. However if you get the Dual Disc, you can play the dvd side which he sings songs he wrote. If you are a Bo Bice fan you are going to be disappointed in the CD songs but happy with the dvd songs that show what he is really about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confused Identity clear from this album","review":"I would characterize The Real Thing as a sort of catch-all commercial rock album (recognizing that \\"commercial\\" and \\"rock\\" seem kind of antithetical to each other). It's catch-all in that the album offers a taste of pop metal, alt rock, emo, pop rock and country/Southern rock. The catch-all nature is a bit of a problem for me, because it deprives a guy who established a clear and coherent identity while on AI of what really distinguished him on the show. It turns Bo into an imitator (of the likes of Bon Jovi, Nickelback, Switchfoot, etc.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the CD, can't wait for the concert!","review":"The more that I listen to this CD, the more I love it. Right from the first listen I loved every track. That is so rare these days to buy a CD and find that every song on it moves you in one way or another. My favorite songs seem to change just about every day. Since picking it up on Dec. 13th and now having heard it, oh say 100 times, I really like U Make Me Better and Hold On To Me. There's a nice mix on this CD of just how talented Bo Bice is and it's demonstrated with the smooth easy voice to some of the more rough rock tracks. Very SEXY to my little ole' ears. YOU NAME THE DATE AND TIME FOR THE CONCERT AND BO I WILL BE THERE!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome album for people of all ages!","review":"You can give one to your mom, you can give one to your dad!

Yes they have made him more radio friendly..but to what expense? bO loses his whole identity in this cd.I have baught Kelly,Ruben, clay,Fantasia, and Carrie's cds and even though not all were good..all stayed true to themselves and the music they loved.And sadley Bo was the one I least expected to change for anyone..yet he did exactley that with this cd.I will always be a fan of the \\"real\\" bo and I guess If I want to hear him I can pop in a AI tape and enjoy and wonder \\"what could have been......."},{"rating":"1","title":"A guy needs to make a buck, dig?","review":"This music is homoginized.

And do i blame Bo for saying to Clive Davis...\\"yes...I would like you to produce a record for me with smooth session men and catchy top 40 songs and get a good solid start on a career in music...\\"Of course not. i expected no better than this anyway. I like the guy and I like his voice and i hope after he get sick of this dribble in a few years he puts out a record with soul and guitars cracking and balls.I have not quit on you Bo..but I cannot keep this baby food down."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT rock just typical pop fluff filler","review":"That album is just another pop-product.

Yikes. He looks effeminate.And titling it \\"The Real Thing\\" wasn't so bright. He may have been touted on AI as the real rocker, but he's still a rocker who went on American Idol. I would think that outside AI, that illegitimatizes any rocker reality, and gives a \\"this is a joke\\" air to the CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can have it both ways","review":"I hear both sides from the Bo sites. Some people say they just want Bo to outsell Carrie and dont' care how or what kind of music he makes as long as he does. Others are wanting him to make more bluesy, creative, rock and dont' care about sales.What do I think?: I certainly don't think a desire to see Bo succeed is in tension with an opinion that his album blows bigtime!I bought it but argh, it just drives me up the wall."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 Star for Bo's trying, his fans dont' care about quality anyway so it won't matter","review":"Bo Bice's album only gets 1 star from me, no matter how many crazy and untrue 5 star reviews the diehard Bo fans posts. It is NOT a 5 star album by any means. It's cute that his fans are dillusional to think it is. They can give it 4 stars if they love it but 5 is just laughable..lol!

Rocker, edgy, raw and passionate Bo is the man we voted for week after week. This is what many of us were expecting on his CD. This watered down, neutered Bo is nothing like \\"The Real Thing\\".I love Bo, I think he has incredible talent and all that's needed to be a mega-star but Clive Davis and company have done him and his fans a terrible diservice with this CD. It's generic pop-rock fluff that would sound the same if anyone else recorded it. Cliche after cliche, one standard guitar riff after another and the unemotional choruses sung by a man who's been forced to sing stuff he obviously has absolutely no passion about."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!","review":"Bo Bice does not disappoint!Whoever labeled this pop music, obviously doesn't know what pop music is!

This cd reminds me of why Bo was my favorite to win. There are only two slow songs on the cd, the rest are mid to up tempo. While it is hard to really pick a favorite song I have to say that I have two, one is Valley Of Angels (which Bo co-wrote). The second one is You're Everything, I like love songs, I just hate it when those songs are slow, and You're Everything is a love song but with one hell of a beat.This album was the best ten bucks I have spent in a while and I will be suggesting it to my family and friends.

I have to admit, though, \\"Lie... it's alright\\" is so terrible, it is almost fun to hear. If you like bland Bon Jovi tunes that even they would not record, this is for you. Overdone vocals fed like spaguetti through a process machine, stupid words, BAD BAD tunes.

It's not too surprising that Kroeger didn't save that gem for his band.

I read this book and the world on blood and found many editorial mistakes. It was like reading a book that wasn't related at all to the first. There were flashbacks that mentioned things that never occured in the first book as well as mentioning that Selene didn't know Whistler's wife. I was really dissapointed in this book. An I also agree with the previous posting about his use of the Dianic name in his Witchcraft. As a practicing witch, I was rather offended by Nasaw's lack of research into the religion and the way he portrayed the rituals. I had high hopes after the world on blood but this book was just a let down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!!..a must for all who love vampires story.","review":"I enjoy the story so much which is a rarity for me because i could never find a good, enjoyable story about VAMPIRES.This story is particularly interesting for me because of the way the author potray the logic behind the myths of vampires legend per se which i could accept.

However, if you just want to have fun for ten minutes and catch a few fish, they have made it too hard. Yes, serious fisherman might enjoy this aspect, but one of the reasons I don't enjoy real fishing is that I don't like to spend hours just waiting for a bite. They could have had easy, medium and hard settings for the different desires of people.

Not a good buy in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely, Just Lovely!","review":"To be honest, I only bought this CD because of one song I had been trying to find for years (Funkanova by Wood, Brass & Steel). I must say I was pleasently surprised by almost all of the 23 tracks in this set. I knew I was getting excellent music in songs like Expansions,In The Bottle, Life On Mars, etc. But it was the other tracks that made this purchase the BOMB! I've had this CD for only 1 day so far and it has went from house, to car, to computer at work...and will no doubt go back in the car for my trip home. Nothing against smooth jazz, but if you want something very smooth that won't put you to sleep, this is it. Also, nothing against Ronnie Laws or Side Effect(I own almost all of thier music), but the Willie Bobo version of Always There on this CD is the best I've heard.

Action scenes are amazing, the acting is just about perfect, but unfortunately the plot is outlandish and just not believable. This takes away from the immersion quite a bit. Eagle Eye is worth watching, especially for it's long but incredibly entertaining action sequences. Just don't expect a very believable plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Explosive, Noisy mess","review":"I know quite a few people that like this movie, and I have to respect their opinions even if I don't agree with them. Like \\"Quantum of Solace\\" this movie was simply an explosive, noisy mess. Hollywood thinks that the more explosions they have in an action film the better the film will be.

Just more explosions...more chase scenes...more explosions...more chase scenes...more mindless drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be warned...","review":"This movie was good and entertaining and I really enjoyed watching it... until the end. The ending of this movie is terrible! Quite possibly the worst ending to a movie I have ever seen and as a movie freak I have seen alot of movies and alot of terrible endings. I think Shia Labeouf is becoming a great actor and Spielberg is a genius but this was just ridiculous. The ending turned a good entertaining movie into complete garbage. I give this movie 2 stars because I'd say if you really want to see it it might be worth watching once but just be ready to leave disappointed at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"You knew liberal hollywood would make this movie eventually...","review":"Whoever mentioned liberal paranoia in their review about this flick was dead on....Gov't control over our electronics is probably high on every liberals 'scare list'. The other absolutely striking thing about it, is it could probably win an award for THE most stupidly outlandish plot ever conceived, and that is saying something. Even I can overlook blatant absurdity in a movie, if there is still something redeeming in it, like cool action scenes or fx, etc...This movie changed that. It's that absurd, and no amount of action comes close to saving it.

Okay, the successful brother has died and Shia LaBoeuf, playing his lackadaisical twin, is catapulted into a frenzy of running and dodging assaults on him during which he meets a woman who is doing the same in order to keep her son safe. It appears his brother's death is suspicious and it becomes apparent Eagle Eye, the all-seeing version of Hal the computer in the film of the future--2001--is simultaneously persecuting and saving his bacon. Why bring the living twin into it at all? He wouldn't have known anything of his brother's suspicious death if he had been let alone.

This movie interestingly blends elements from John Badham's WarGames and Alfred Hitchcock's The Man Who Knew Too Much with today's technological,political,and social realities. Could it have been better?Yes. Director D.J. Caruso may have sacrificed some of the movies dramatic potential to thriller and action formulas. But I still think the end result was very good. I found the scenes between Jerry and Rachel on the bus and in the freighter to be particularly charming. I just wish the makers had focused a little bit more on the human interactions and a little less on the chases and explosions. Even so, this is the only fault I can find with the movie.

Billy Bob is in it looking skinnier than ever with his horrible 'natural' looking hair piece. Rosario Dawson and Michael 'The Shield' Chick-lets round out the cast but I find it hard to review their performances because the movie was so dumb it was mind numbing.This is one of those Bruckheimer type 'THRILL RIDES' that is devoid of an intelligent story and that is full of roller coaster ride like effects.STUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUPID!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is Spielberg (Exec.

Of course, then you're left with the realization that you'll never get those wasted 2 hours back. Honestly, there is not one redeeming aspect of this film that I can identify, which is surprising given the fantastic cast. Special FX-driven action movies need to be moderately plausible and at the same time not take themselves too seriously. \\"Eagle Eye\\" fails miserably on both counts, adding insult to injury by insulting the audience's intelligence throughout its arduous 2 hour length. With Spielberg as an executive producer on this one, and given last year's Indian Jones installment, I'm given to wonder if Mr. Spielberg might be losing his touch."},{"rating":"2","title":"It could happen","review":"Shia is becoming one of my favorite actors.

This thriller starts off promisingly enough, with a hapless loser (Shia Lebeouf)thrown into a world of intrigue by an unseen puppetmaster telling him what to do.

Those were just the first three problems. I wanted a thriller, not a fantasy where nothing is impossible. I don't mind Wiley Coyote running off the cliff and standing there scratching his head if I am watching a cartoon, but somebody doing the equivalent in what is supposed to be a thriller ruins it.

So, as I watched it, I found I liked it. I thought the story was pretty interesting, although maybe just a tad cliche with the whole AI-gone-rogue thing.

My wife knows how much I enjoy reading Hollywood biographies, especially the early stars, so naturally she assumed I would like this one. In truth, I found myself skipping large sections of the book. This really isn't about Hollywood or Ms. Young's stellar career. Instead, it's a feel-good spiritual tome, clearly the story Ms. Young WANTS you to know. The problem is with her choice of biographer. Ms. Anderson seems a competent writer, but as she admits, this was her first biography project and she just doesn't have the critical eye. For her to make the assertion that Loretta Young, and not Katherine Hepburn, was the true love of Spencer Tracy's life is simply beyond belief.If you're a person of deep religious faith, buy this book.

This book would have been far better promoted as a commentary on Loretta Young and her relationship with god. Certainly those readers wanting to know about her experiences in Hollywood in the 1930s would be disappointed. Her screen career was largely glossed over - we are talking about a woman who worked with pioneers such as Lon Chaney - you'd barely know it from this book. Similarly, there was little on her relationship with her sisters or any comments of substance about their lives or careers. Even the more 'scandalous' elements of her life were only worth a couple of pages - the rest of the book was more like a conversion exercise. Whilst the religious element was obviously something that influenced who she was as a person, the author did not delve beyond this. It is an injustice if this is the best that can be offered in her memory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insight Into A Legend","review":"This is a reasonably well-written book about Loretta Young's fascinating life, career, family, and personal struggles. Heavily laden with references to Mrs. Young's Catholic faith and a bit repetitious, it provides, nonetheless, a compelling picture of a single-minded woman and talented actress who was determined to be true to herself and her personal convictions, even to the point of denying herself plum acting roles and her biological daughter's maternity and paternity. For those who have enjoyed Mrs. Young on the big or small screen and wondered what was going on behind those blue eyes, diaphanous gowns, and quiet demeanor, you are in for a few surprises. Authorized by the actress herself, this is a must read for Loretta Young fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"A saccharine take on a gutsy woman","review":"I admire many things about Loretta Young. Her choice of Joan Wester Anderson as her biographer, however, reveals Miss Young's weakness for carefully airbrushing her life story.

In this book, he is telling you stories, you will meet Stacy the most intelligent dog in his life, Wolf the most feared in the dogs' world, you will learn what happens when too dogs meet each other, the difference between wolf and jackal, how men meet dog at the very beginning....In every case, you will never be disappointed by Konrad Lorenz."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grand Duchess doll outfit","review":"Love the Russian image for the Carpatina fantacy adventures.

Your probobly saying its just anoher stupid old gundam game, well I have news for you... its not!

Needless to say it's the only PS2 game I've felt the need to trade in.If you like Gundam, you'll probably love it anyway, so my warning to you will probably go unheaded. (...), if you are going to buy it, you may as well buy it used because every store I've seen that sells used PS2 games has piles of this game lying around (I wonder why???).As a video game, it just wasn't fun and I found the controls were ackward and the graphics aren't that great for a PS2 game.I really really did try to like this game, but just coulldn't.There are so many better videogames out there for the PS2, don't waste your time on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun game, but way too short","review":"This was my first PS2 game. I love the graphics and the storyline. It takes you quickly through the Mobile Suit Gundam storyline as Amuro Rei. Once you have gone through the story line you open up a tactics mode where you can unlock other Federation and Zeon suits and pilot them. I oftene enjoy doing that now since I find some of the Zeon suits to be amazing. The storyline is good, but I wish they had finished the Mobile Suit Gundam story. It was over way too soon, but it is still fun to go back and do the story mode again. Definitely, worth while, especially until I can save up the money to buy the newer Gundam PS2 games. If you like Gundam or just fighting with giant robots with good graphics then buy this game. Keep the faith, dExtrosien"},{"rating":"1","title":"A pure exploitation of die-hard Gundam fans","review":"This game is an affront to Gundam fans and even Gundam fandom. Sorry to say, but the fact is that this is a sloppy, clunky cash-in on the Gundam name in order to leech dollars from we Gundam fans who are starving for quality liscenced products. The only reason that this game even gets one star is because it does have that classic Gundam venier. Beyond that, it's a sham. The controls are clunky and woefully unresponsive, the hit detection is so sloppy that a battle against a mere Zaku is a chore bigger than the Big Zam, and the in-game graphics are just plain ugly. Apparently when making this game, the developers painted everything bad red, because this game is three times worse than even the most ungrateful fan deserves. As a long time fan of all the various Gundam universes, especially the Universal Century, I can only be grateful that later games would help return this shameful chapter to the shadows of obscurity where it belongs."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game stinks.","review":"This is the worst game ever created.

I rented the game and beat it in a few days but after you beat the game you get to do this thing where you get to use all of the other moble suites ( guncannon, zaku, and even one of the suites from 08 ms team).you should rent first. but it is a very good game so you might want to buy it.

The graphics did not enpress me that much either. I'm not really a Gundam fan, though I have seen a few episodes and they were pretty cool, but the only reason most people like this game is because they are hard core Gundam fans and will buy anything with a Gundam label on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eye-candy but not much beyond that.","review":"Starting off with the positives, it is a very nice graphical game. Very nice cutaway movie scenes in story mode, which provide something of a history/detail for those not familiar with Gundam. In game graphics are very nice. Not the absolute best, but very nicely done. Sound effects are pretty good too. Explosions look read, weapon firing is nice, and collapsing buildings during combat look pretty good.However, the controls of the game are absolutely HORRIBLE. The potential of it being a great game goes out the window with this very bad control set up. Very difficult to control the Gundam suit in the more advanced levels, where control is needed. The \\"targeting\\" option was a total waste to include, for it targets where the enemy used to be (after they move the instant you fire) rather then following.Lousy controls make the game almost unplayable. The excellent graphics were wasted because of this. The game goes back on the shelf to collect dust."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing. . .","review":"If you are a gundam fan, you'll want to walk, feed, and sleep with this game, even if you are not, you'll turn into one because of this game!

Gameplay was good for my taste, and the graphics back then were awsome to me. If your not a gundam fan, thats not a problem here, story mode features cut scenes from the show, from the beginning all the way to the end. And mission mode will introduce you to other Gundam Series set in the UC, most notably Blue Destiny. There are even trailers of the other sereis if your interested in Gundam and wanna check it out. Overall I gave this game a 4/5 for pretty good graphics, fun story mode, & ummmm well its Gundam."},{"rating":"1","title":"this game SHOULD BE RENTED FIRST!","review":"If your a gundam wing fan youmight consider even after I say this. It's not like a mecha game like armored core. It has REAL BAD CONTROLS REALLY AWKWARD ONES! Nothing like armored core. Amuro is a little cry baby. you have to be him. Atleast they should make it that you could be the gun tank or something. Also it's just a hit and slash game. The only way you would consider to buy this game is if you want to see the movie clips. once you beat a mission their clips. OTHERWISE IT\\"S THE WORST GAME ON EARTH! IN amazon it's rated good makes you think it's good. But listen to this try other sites you know and get reviews. They will be real low ratings. Try... for this game it talks how... it is. I didn't listen to it and wasted a good 50 dollars! If you don't listen to me atleast rent it before you lose all your money! Because of the controls it's really hard to beat the game. You won't beat the game. You'll get sick and tired of it first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice production but bad gameplay","review":"This game looks decent but not up to PS2 standards. The gameplay sucks-no analog support for moving your mech. The auto targeting is worthless against anything that moves. The mech moves so slow, too slow to fit any fighting game genre but unfortunately that's all this game is in the end. The anime and pure CG stuff does look good and justifies the DVD palyback hardware in the PS2. Only Gundam fans will like this. Anyone else that says it's good is lying or stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Recommended","review":"This game was rather poorly constructed with graphics hardly worthy of the PS2 console, awkward controls, and it's stunning simplicity.

For a more juvenile crowd, I suppose Time Windows would be more appealing, but for the most part, I felt that it was a lot worse than her other books. It's just not as interesting, with a lot of down-time. The big mystery doesn't really kick in majorly until halfway through the book. The characters are pretty cookie-cutter, uninteresting, standard characters, nothing special. Parts are very predictable (although some of the bigger twists at the very end, they are pretty impossible to predict). It's really just not Reiss's best work, and the ending left me cringing--worse even than the \\"it was all a dream\\" ending.Rating: I'd say 2/5 compared to her other books, 3/5 in general."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moral Realism, A Defense","review":"I found the arguments remarkably incomplete; a somewhat simplistic treatment of a very interesting subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Size unclear","review":"I think the sizing on these socks is not clearly stated.

The extra padding in these socks is worth every penny if you're playing a demanding sport such as tennis. Buy multiple pairs and rotate them for extended wear. Even if you don't do this, these socks last longer than any I've ever owned. I wear the longer sock on cooler days and the shorter sock when my legs are fully exposed, thus allowing for a more natural tan. Because I live in a warm, sunny climate, I wear the mini more frequently, but I buy both styles. I live in Maine in the summer and use the longer version more frequently there.

My favorite song is Angelina and so many of the songs make ya wanna get up and dance around and sing along. Most of the slow songs give insight to the sensitivity of Mr. Belfonte. Definately a fun CD that is sure to be a party hit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get Out of My Head!","review":"First thing's first, not 100% of this album deserves 5 stars. 1 song is downright painful, a little over 1/2 are ok, and the rest are incredible. I was expecting 20-ish tracks just like my favorite upbeat calypso songs. That is not what this album is. It also includes Belafonte's slower songs, many of which are the album's low points.So why in the world would I give 5 starts for such a lackluster combination? Because those songs that are great make the whole purchase well worth it. The stand-out tracks are so good and so infectious that I had to stop listening to the album for a few days because I couldn't stop singing them to myself. Fun, fun, fun music!I'd list which songs I think are worth it so you can just buy those tracks if you agree with this review, but I'm sure opinions will differ as to which are the best tracks. Also, some tracks I didn't think I'd like have become my favorites after subsequent listenings.Bottom line: I'm very happy with my purchase of this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harry Belafonte","review":"The sound is terrible.

That way, you would get the benefits of the good bacteria that naturally comes with sauerkraut. But, I realize that the packaging methods are much dicier that way.

He wrote three seminal studies of three of the greatest and most influential of the patristic writers, Origen, Gregory of Nyssa and Maximus the Confessor, and he drew the core principles of his own systematic thinking from the writing of these giants of Christian metaphysics and spirituality. This book is the second of these studies, and it simply is one of the best and most perceptive analyses of St. Gregory in print. Everything Balthasar says about beauty as a key to theology and spirituality, for example, can be found in the writings of St. Gregory of Nyssa, the patristic apostle of beauty as a Divine attribute and gift. This book is a must for both those interested in St. Gregory and for those looking for an insight into von Balthasar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Classical","review":"I have a nylon string Cordoba A/E Classical Guitar... it has a different size hole than standards!

Each section covers its subject thoroughly and with authority: a lengthy treatise on brumation; a thoughtful couple of pages on stress; even a serious investigation of commercial snake sausages (ick!) under feeding. That thoroughness also carries over to the lavishly illustrated section covering color and pattern morphs: we not only get a picture and a brief description, but also the history of how that given morph came about (and by whom). So we discover, for example, that a pewter corn is a combination of bloodred and charcoal (anerythristic B), that butter is an amelanistic caramel, that a milk snake phase is a selectively bred Miami phase, and so on. With so much useful and interesting information in this book, every hobbyist with corn snakes simply has to have it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great resource for corn owners","review":"I recently bought my first pet Corn, and picked this guide up as a reference for my new baby snake. This book is considered the bible of corn snake ownership, and for good reason. It's massively thorough, covering every topic a new snake owner needs to know about, as well as some other interesting stuff. I particularly enjoyed the section on genetics and the history of the different morphs.My only nitpick is that the authors state a lot of their personal opinions about the value of different colors and patterns as if they're universal--they actually call dark colors \\"ugly\\" at one point, whereas I find them the most appealing. It would be better if they could remain objective, and simply present the facts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Handy to Have Around!","review":"I Bought this book the day I got my corn snake, Sayuri.

We've played Old Maid and Go Fish with ease but have yet to tackle Animal Rummy (more because my boy was too hopped up on Xmas gift fun to listen to the rules than for any other reason).

In particular the effect of established opinions on the nature of war and how it should be waged, and the reaction of succeeding generations to these established opinions is very interesting. Specifically, the military theories developed during the Enlightenment and the reaction of military theorists to the victories of Napoleon (such as Clausewitz) were of special interest. As Professor Gat himself remarks, there is a tendency to treat the period before Clausewitz as a kind of intellectual void, during which there was no discussion of the theory and practice of war at all.

The sad thing is that it was known before the invasion. At least if you opened your eyes. But the author justifies any attack on any country that MIGHT pose some danger in the far future.

There are many discoveries here and it is obvious from the intro that the editors tried their best to search for those finds that other anthologies overlooked.

I recommend this book to any one who wants a true account of the Rise of Reza Shah and the history of Iran during and preceding his rule."},{"rating":"1","title":"gossip and old chestnuts as history","review":"This is an example of \\" oriental\\" history writing : using old chestnuts and gossip curerent in Tehran's aristocratic circles as history. The issue of the rivalry between the British and Russian empires in Iran, and the threat that they both posed to Iran's very survival as an independent nation-state is left aside in favour of anecdotes and innuendos. The only way to enjoy this book is to forget that its subject is history and to read it as a collection of little tales circulating in the Iranian capital in the forties and fifties. The author, assuming a nationalist pose, repeats, parrot-like, the rumours spread by the British and their agents as part of a strategy to drag the Iranian leadership in mud and thus promote the myth of their own invincibility.

Sherian"},{"rating":"1","title":"Iran and the Rise of Reza Shah : From Qajar Collapse to","review":"This book is for general public and casual reading.

Above all it requires a vision, one that Ghani singularly lacks. Mr. Ghani faithfully reports what he has read in the British archives but is incapable of analyzing the events he narrates.AN INTERESTED READER"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great with PSP","review":"I bought this card for use with a PSP and it works great.

I'm one of them, and I'm glad I did.So if you're easily scared into believing in the Boogeyman, go pay more for Sony.

Very few latino artists have succeeded in crossing over from Latino music to Spanish music and those who did succeed were already superstars like Shakira, Thalia, JLo and Ricardo Arjona. Perhaps she should try singing pop music in English where neither talent nor a voice is required, she could make it on her looks alone.

The reader comes away from the book feeling like nothing was accomplished. The best character in the novel barely works. The Bloody Cobbler who is victimized by a stupid name but has the best lines in the entire novel, struggles to save this book from being a total waste of paper. He fails.

Even though SotBR has two co-authors, I found it hard to discern any difference in writing style, so my reading was never disrupted. The cover of SotBR is also good, I actually have it as my computer background, successfully depicting Soth's state of mind. The final icing on the cake for me, was the fact that my copy is rather unique - it is signed by the authors and actually has some bizzare misprinting scattered here and there. Four stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Difficult to follow, great as a whole.","review":"If you aren't into the character of Lord Soth or into the DragonLance world, this book is not for you. Taken by itself this book is a slow read and terribly involved. When taken as a whole of the DragonLance world, it is almost required reading. You can see Lord Soth going from being a virtual prisoner to the demiplane of Ravenloft to regaining his sanity and attempting to be the first Darklord to escape back to his home land."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book to judge by the title","review":"After having read the previous novel, Knight of the Black Rose, this was really disappointing. Nothing describes this book better than the title. Lord Soth (the black rose in the title) really is a \\"spectre\\" in this book, his role in the novel is so small he's almost a minor character. Large sections of this book focus exclusively on new characters that are neither interesting nor believable. It's a shame that instead of developing a novel that revolves around an interesting character, like Lord Soth, the authors instead chose to write a novel where he's stuck in the background."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for Soth fans","review":"Great book!

This engrossing book removes some of the mystery enshrouding this phenomenal man's background. Lefort's interviews with teachers and co-students uncover many fascinating aspects of Sufi research and practices, such as the use of plants for psychological screening and the existence of baraka, an energy (or substance?) that sounds like the Force in Star Wars. His interviews and conversations include tantalizing references to Sufi impacts on Morris Dancing, garden design, and contemporary music. Anyone interested in the real history of Jesus, as opposed to the Sunday school version, will also be intrigued by Lefort's discovery of connections between Gurdjieff's \\"dervish dancing\\" and similar techniques used by Jesus."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is a Real Effort to read Rafael Lefort","review":"This book claims finding Gurdjieff's teaching in the Walled Garden of Truth. This is not based on a serious study of Gurdjieff, but on something else. However, the book has value as entertainment and can be read as a substitute for the Mullah Nasr Eddin stories, although it lacks much of the humour.Many claims have been made to the origins of Gurdjieff's teaching and traces of it can be also found in many, also in Sufism.The book came out in 1966 and one could suspect that the 'teachers of Gurdjieff' had already died by 1966 (before he died himself in 1949). Unless... the writer had some means of communicating with the dead, which indeed could be a 'Real Effort'...."},{"rating":"1","title":"a little Distasteful of shah","review":"I really like indres shah i read most of his work. but this book Well i know what shaw was trying to do. of course to take down the cult of personality around gurdijeff which i wholeheartedly agree with, and also to show the folly of the seeker but i felt this was done in a s dis-tasteful and insulting way as well as mean sprited it could have executed better is all. was it a expose on the phycology of the seeker? a axe grinding expose? i dont know you decide"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dishonest","review":"Written by Omar Shah, Idris Shah's brother, this book has nothing to do with Gurdjieff. The intention was to \\"collect\\" lost sheep after J.G. Bennett gave Coombe Springs to Idris Shah. So the basic message of this book is: Gurdjieff is dead, long lives sufism. Which basically is a kind of advertisement. The question arising: Advertising for what? Who is in need for advertisment? Or is this spiritual competition? Some claim, that Gurdjieff was a member of a certain sufi order, and this sufi order is now represented by I. Shah. This is nonsense. And it throws a strange shadow onto whoever is in need to spread rumors of this kind.The title of this book is a lie. Kind of conning instead of cunning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where Are The Women?","review":"No women anywhere, but loads of anti-west propaganda, laced with anti-secularist, anti-science, authoritarian blather. It's the usual misleading Idries Shah take on Sufism (he's the real author). Don't bother with it. Read something substantial instead, like maybe Henry Corbin or Seyyed Hossein Nasr or William Chittick . This isn't Sufism or Islam or spirituality.

My main point is that - Although I like the Ken Burns set, and use it as a resource to teach college classes - they don't have a clue about what Miles was up to from 1969 on. Another chapter is needed, and this works! This is a nice documentary, which shows that Miles was anything but a \\"pop sellout\\" as depicted in Burns.

He's not the singer Sinatra was, but he has a marvelous relaxed style all his own. The band backing him on this CD is made up of some of the very best West Coast jazz musicians of the 50s. Art Pepper, on alto sax, puts in one of his finest performances here. As I said, a lot of these tunes are familiar to the point of being cliches, but these renditions have an authenticity that keeps them from ever being boring, and when a lesser known gem like Winter Moon comes up it's a revelation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good music","review":"Good music because it was Hoagy Carmichael and there was one song that I really wanted on the CD and had not found anywhere else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyers Beware","review":"These are the same songs from Totally Buble.From review of Totally BubleAlthough this CD is Michael Buble who does have a great voice, and shows to be a big star some day, he DID NOT wish to have this CD released!

He's just not that kind of person to say such a thing seriously. (He may have been kidding around, as it's much like him to do so.)Either way, songs like \\"That's How It Goes\\" and \\"I Get A Kick Out Of You\\" are true classics, and can be a major relief during a long car ride or even while prancing around cleaning the house.

It's worse than that evil GB game we all know and want to shove a rocket up that Pika-pika...ahem.Second, though the class system is very well done, they probably would have been better off lengthening the game by using classes more like the DW7 ones, with class increases and all that.I wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone who hasn't played it somewhere else before.

It's not necessarily a book you have to read, one step at a time, but the chapters are fairly well labeled, so you can feel free to skip around and read the chapters that are most pertinent to your situation. The approach they take is conservative, and they sometimes give several possibilities regarding issues that are not just black and white.

If you want your children to grow up an enter into marriage with a healthy/positive attitude about sex, this and the God's Design for Sex series are the tools for you. This book is not an easy read.

It is about a middle child girl whos name is Zinny. She discovers an overgrown trail behind her house. When she first found it she knew in order to uncover the whole trail it would definitely be a summer project! As fun as revealing the Trail would be, Zinny did not know that this trail would open a box of answered questions about her family.I really enjoyed this book. It kept me interested the whole time I read it and amazed. It showed me how much courage a thirteen year old girl could have. I feel like she was telling a story of how some children felt about their families today.Overall, I definitely recommend this book mainly to a young teenage girl who loves to read about adventure and fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Forced to Read Sharon Chreech's Novel!","review":"I rate this book with boys in mind. This book is quite pointless and boring.It's meant to help kids understand how hard growing up can be, but she does an awful job.Sharon Creech, the author of Chasing Redbird, makes books mostly for females. Sentimental people will find this book great but for the not-so-touchable you'll find it boring and repetitive.If you like books with death and love and all that cheesy stuff you'll like this non-creative, day-by-day story! The thrills in this story are when someone is sick. The pathetic idea of this story may interest the heart-warming readers.Many loving characters are in this simple story. Possibly too much love. The story is set on a farm in Kentucky, which is a nice setting. Death comes too often repeating itself. First goes one family member. Whoosh! There goes another and another. In my opinion this book would rate a 2 star because of the repetitive, non-creative, uncomfortable, pointless story. It's in the dumps!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love, love, love this book!","review":"I LOVE this book. After being a big fan of Creech I was given this book for Christmas. At first I wasn't too sure, but started to read it anyway. I decided (rather frivolously) after about 30 pages that I \\"didn't like it\\". Then, maybe 3 months later I picked it up again as a last resort. I started completely over and read it all that day! Since then I have read it about 3 or 4 times. I would recommend this book to any girl (or parents of a girl) over 12 who wants to read a really good book.

The plot jumps around alot, and takes some really big leaps into fantasy land. This girls parents actually let her spend weeks camping in unknown countryside, by herself, without ANY adult supervision at all, Just because she feels she NEEDS to. Would your parents let YOU do this? Talk about \\"Oh my god I have a hangnail, so now I have to climb Everest.\\" I am normally a big fan of Sharon Creech's Books, but this one kept getting worse. I liked the story about Rose (her cousin) and Aunt Jessie, but she elaborated on it so much that, by the end of the book, it had cycled down into something completely unreal. This book also lacked Sharon Creech's usual humourous touches. O.k., her siblings, Ha HA, but really they just don't cut it. For anyone who is contemplating buying this book, don't. Go out and get Walk Two Moons or Absolutely Normal Chaos, buy something good for a change."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"If you like to be bored read this book!

This package is slightly more complete than the previous, though it too manages to omit 'Can We', arguably one of the group's shining moments. Conversely, it includes some of the trio's minor hits, chief among them the sparkling and highly underrated 'It's All About U', from the group's uneven sophomore effort. Also noteworthy are the extensive liner notes, reduced to a meager paragraph on the GREATEST HITS cd, but here lengthy and quite informative.Of the two collections, this remains overall more complete."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally Reunited!","review":"One of the best girl groups ever, this collection is ESSENTIAL for any R&B fan - going back to the early 90's when R&B was at it's finest!..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!!!","review":"This was a perfect fit and installation couldn't be easier. Installed on 2008 tundra. The only thing I suggest is mounting it a little lower than the instructions tell you to, 1/4 inch lower or so. It makes it fit a little closer to the top of the tailgate. It may not shed water off as well as they intended by mounting it lower but a little water seeping into the bed isnt going hurt anything I keep in there. Installation took only 20 min or less and that was with me repositioning the tracks a second time to get a closer fit at the tailgate.

The book's only flaw is that it should have had a rigorous examination by a fact-checker and a copy editor; there are minor errors in facts, spellings of names, titles etc., which unfortunately detract from its overall excellence."},{"rating":"2","title":"unsung hero","review":"This is an excellent portrayal of the life of Galbraith, set in the surrounding economic and political history of his lifetime. I highly recommend it for these reasons.In addition, a theme of Galbraith's understanding of the combination of economic and social and political currents is made clear. Impressively the lack of appreciation by the political and military figures in the US government during different presidencies, as well as the political bias affecting Galbraiths peers in the academic world comes through.In a world full of people nursing their own ends in the Air Force, government party line, and econometric biases, Galbraith's genious went often neglected or countered. But he remained able to speak to the public at large in his writings, providing a guidance of uncommon sense in his lifetime. This book presents his case admirably."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'LL PROBABLY WEAR THIS ONE OUT TOO.","review":"While economist Parker's writing style is not as wryly entertaining as Galbraith's, he presents a lucid and engrossing overview of Galbraith's life experiences as they influenced the evolution of his economic philosophy, as well as his political and social philosophies. Galbraith's biography is skillfully presented against the background of more traditional economic thought with which he was regularly in contention. I judge it every bit as readable and understandable for a noneconomist like myself as for someone in the field. For anyone interested in Galbraith, in Keynesianism, or the history of progressive politics and economics, this work is an absolute must. I refer to mine regularly. This, in fact, is my second copy, having worn out the first."},{"rating":"2","title":"sweet romance","review":"The Virgin Bride is Miranda Lee's 51st romance novel. Owing to a crisis of conscience, Dr Jason Steel abandons the prestigious job in a gung-ho bulk-billing Sydney medical practice and Adele, the beautiful, brilliant, sexy doctor he'd been about to marry, for a share in a GP practice in the sedate southern NSW country town of Tindley. And when his patient, elderly sweet shop owner, Ivy Churchill, passes on after succumbing to cancer, he decides that marrying Ivy's niece, Emma, would be a sensible thing to do. He understands that Emma is still in love with the town's bad boy, Dean Ratchitt, even after he betrayed her with another woman, but he decides love is not necessary for a marriage to succeed. But both Emma and Jason have something to learn about trust before they can be happy. Another sweet romance from Miranda Lee."},{"rating":"2","title":"Look at this book!","review":"I have to give this guy props on his photography. Most of the images were with 35mm slide film and the quality of photographs he took are really outstanding. The photographs are technically about perfect and the women are also gorgeous.

Didn't see it again, but couldn't forget it. So, when we got home I ordered from [...]. I was so impressed with the book I wrote the author a fan letter (that is a first for me!)I have lived in Seattle for over fifty years, but didn't know the story of Kenmore Air. The past few years, I've seen more and more of their planes--especially while boating 'up north.' I finally got curious.This book is as much about starting and running a business, as about the small float planes and I found it fascinating. I recommend it as a good, and informative read. Meaty enough for the boardroom and easy enough for the beach."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Elvis","review":"Wonderful album. I love elvis' music and have listened to it since his beginning.

This game is SO boring that it doesn't even deserve to be played. If you want a game goto Digital Press and pick up a copy of Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins. This game is the worst game ever in that matter; if you want your 10/10 get an original game boy w/ all of the Super Mario Land Games."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate random dungeons","review":"I was not fortunate enough to have played the SNES game, but I thought this game was a major snore. I really hate random dungeons. Actually, I'm not thrilled with dungeons at all, but these were longer and more tedious than any I had ever dealt with before. The story was bland and the characters were not well defined. It's also full of spelling and grammatical errors that should have been caught if they'd spent more time on it. Altogether, this game struck me as a rushed job by people who don't really care about it. The save system stinks too. I hate only being able to save my game at certain times, I can't guarantee I'll have several uninterrupted hours to play and I like to be able to stop when I need to. Also, the story sequences take way too long."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am the author...","review":"...and I apologize to those who were not happy with this book. This book had such promise when it started but at some point an author loses control of the final product even though it's their name on the cover. The editing and editorial process of this book was such a horrific experience (keep in mind this was my 3rd book with these publishers) that it has turned me off from doing any future work with this organization. This book was written during a \\"changing of the guard\\" at the publisher's and it showed in how the author(s), and their work, is treated. It is sad, if not heartbreaking, but when content is sacrificed because the editorial staff does not listen to the author the result is sadly self-evident."},{"rating":"1","title":"LAN Switching First-Step","review":"I bought Lan Switching first-step and Computer Networking First-Step (by Wendell Odom) at the same time. I found that every single page written by Mr. Odom very refreshing, easy to read and understand.

What you sent was the wrong accumulator. I bought one locally from Advanced Auto Parts for $20 less than you charged.I also purchased 30 pounds of 134R (freon) from you for $299. Could have bought it from Advanced Auto Parts for $250.I also bought an A/C air compressor from you which came with the wrong pulleys on it and took all day (and lots of cussing) getting the one I took off the old compressor installed on yours.All these parts were available right here, no waiting, cheaper!!I won't order any more car parts from Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to rate","review":"This book is hard to rate.It has the \\"Richard Jewell, suspected Atlanta bomber\\"-type plot line, of a schoolteacher first hailed as a hero, and then dragged through the mud as a suspect in a bombing.In one sense the book is \\"reported,\\" but the author does a good job of portraying the main character's life frustrations as a single parent struggling to be a good father and good schoolteacher. The author also catches the bizarre aspect of life, where the teacher's innocuous actions of visiting the bathroom and not immediately telling the police about his bookbag, together with a few details of his prior life, are suddenly magnified into proof that he's the bomber.On the other hand, there's the tiresome \\"Muslim bomber\\" stereotype, and the ending sequence which is both unbelievable and disappointing.It's definitely readable but has significant flaws."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really disappointed","review":"Very dissatisfying read. Could not identify with any of the characters. Way too much time spent on the terroists plot. Too little on the investigation and activities of the newspaper involvement. Really thought it inapproprate for the times with all the school involved crimes.However, did finish the book, wanted to see what happened in the end. Didn't like the end!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomplete","review":"Having read this book post-9/11, I found some of the references to Afganistan and the mindset of the bomber and his comrades very interesting. However, I was disappointed that many of the characters were described so vividly but then they disappear and never are mentioned again. So what was the point? I gave this book to my mother-in-law. I told her that I didn't want it back. It's not a \\"keeper\\" and I don't recommend purchasing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry I read it","review":"I found Man of the Hour to be very unsatisfying. The action scenes were not suspenseful. The characters, particularly the school children, were painfully stereotypical. Nor were any characters particularly likable. I'm sure Blauner was going for an \\"imperfect hero\\" type in his protagonist, because he bluntly tells us this during the course of the story (his symbolism is about an inch deep,) but, wow, he could have tried to make him at least realistic. The teacher's supposedly \\"hip\\" style of talking to the children and his quest to \\"connect\\" with them is sadly unimaginative and sometimes just plain embarrassing to read. Most frustrating is Blauner's penchant for telling us what people are feeling or why they're performing particular acts. I'd much rather observe their behavior myself and draw my own conclusions. Blauner's obtuse narrative style makes for a very impersonal and unchallenging book. On the plus side, it's pretty short."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Substance","review":"With all due respect to the author, there is not much to say about this one. The plot is not interesting and it doesn't seem like a lot of thought went into the story. This book could have been written in 20 pages. Very disappointing. Don't be fooled by the references on the back cover. The only by-product is it makes you appreciate Richard Jewel's (person accused of bombing the '96 Olympics in Atlantic) situation. Spend you time and money elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suprisingly Good","review":"I picked this book up from a second hand book store for something to read on the train into work. Well I could not put this book down until I finished it. The book has the intrigue and action of the film 'Seige' without the marshal Law . The teacher who gets framed, the students blaming him, the FBI being the FBI. Lastly the parents not wanting the teacher in the vicinty of their children. He has to find the real bomber before he loses self control and his own life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intrigue, Action, all around great suspense story","review":"Peter Blauner has a great writing ability to keep the reader on the edge of their seat. The story tells a tale of mistakes and hatred. It all starts out when a boy named Nasser bombs a school bus and a teacher is a main suspect for the case, and then he is blamed for it, and he's searching for the truth. If you like action books that are really and keep you on the edge of your seat, this is for you. BUY IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Blauner's the Best!","review":"I've read all of Blauner's books and it is a mystery to me why he isn't one of America's favorite writers. \\"Man of the Hour\\" has everything that makes Blauner great. First off, a super exciting and realistic story. Second, note perfect dialogue - think Elmore Leonard with an edge. And finally, complex and sympathetic characters you can really root for. Having said all that, the best thing about \\"Man of the Hour\\" is that it's a great read. I polished it off in two days. That good. My advice to Blauner: Put some nitro in that pen of yours and hurry it up a little. I'm sick of waiting three years between books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting study of society vs. media","review":"This book started off on a strange foot, but it eventually settled into a beautifully written essay on American consumption of gossip and our willingness to take the side of the majority. It angered me beyond words, much as Tom Wolfe did with some parts of \\"A Man in Full.\\" A good little thriller, but it is more of a social study of media manipulation."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT THRILLER","review":"This is a very good thriller about a hard-working high school English teacher who is thrust into the media spotlight as the hero de jour when he saves a student from a school bus bombing. However, the media attention eventually fades and the teacher becomes the number one suspect in a federal investigation. Good plotting and character portrayals. My only criticism is that much of the high school student dialogue is unrealistic and the ending was a tad forced. Good examination of heroism."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Math of Gambling","review":"A nice book that covers games that Sklansky thinks the smart player can win, poker, blackjack among others. Most valuable for the teachings of odds versus probability and other math equations that help the player know whether he has the best of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Difficult, complicated but of good use","review":"Though some of the \\"games\\" discussed by the author is out of date, his exhaustive elaboration on the direct relationship of winning with \\"probability\\" is straight to the point. About 1/5 of the book is dedicated to high maths about probability. In case you find the book too difficult, (as in my case), it shows that you (and me) dont belong to there, and we can never be pro gamblers who can win consistently in the long run against the unfavorable odds set by the casinos. But if you are determined to be successful in gambling, this book is certainly an acid test of your aptitude and talent.Anyway, a good read, in particular for gamblers, both winning and losing ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"If you are looking for a book about the math (probability) in gambling this is the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great on my vintage lawn tractor!","review":"Well made bowl filter for underneath the gas tank on a riding mower or small tractor.

Not sturdy enough for the price!","review":"I bought this for my 86 pound lab because he injured his knee and I didn't want him jumping on and off my bed. He might have used it if it were steadier, but it wobbles so much that he quite reasonably doesn't trust it to put his weight on it. He would nudge it out of the way rather than try to use it. For the price I paid I expected something made a little better. Very disappointed and am returning it. Might be fine for smaller dogs or cats because it is the right height for a taller bed, but I would not recommend this for big dogs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the money","review":"I bought this a while ago but never got around to writing a review.

I will say that if you love music that is thought provoking and very visual, get this album. And don't even think about being cheap and ripping it off the net somewhere in... mp3 form.

Definitely a 4.5 star rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Any true hip hop fan will absolutely love this album. In the midst of the all-to-common lyrics boasting material possessions, this album uses a less glamorous approach and a deep pool of lyrical content.

Possibly the rebirth of hip hop, with a new, soulful feel."},{"rating":"2","title":"COP IT !!!","review":"This album is one of the best hip-hop albums ever, along with Little Brother's The Listening. The production is amazing thanks to Nicolay, and MC Phonte and JL bless the tracks with dope lyrics that blend perfectly with Nicolays soulful, head bopping beats. Every track is good, but some of my fav tracks are: Sincere, Be Alright, Brave New World, it's really hard to pick favorites, because they're all so great. If you like The Roots, Common, Talib Kweli, De La Soul, ATCQ, SV and the like, then I strongly suggest you cop this album if you haven't already. You won't regret it !!

Nicolay, the producer, does some amazing things for 2004. Synths, solid drums, and killer hooks carry this album (as well as Phonte's excellent lyrics). The album has a mellow laid-back hip-hop with a touch of R&B; feel to it. At times it sounds like a Tribe Called Quest or even a Mos Def album.All of the tracks are great, I've never had to skip any when playing the album.

I learn all this new stuff, but don't know what to do first. Then, I have an excuse that FEAR uses and I stop myself.I have read books by a few other authors, but this one is by far top of the list.

Errors abound. One small error is Dawson confuses interest rate with mortgage constant. If one is not prepared to feed one's investment, the difference is between making a profit (mortgage constant) and going broke (interest rate).Many of Dawson's statements make it difficult to believe he has ever actually purchased and owned real estate for investment.

It delivers a serious dose of lactic acid, buffered with ammonia. You smell like ammonia for ten minutes after applying, but it fades.I used it religiously twice a day, after showering and before bed, and within a week my skin was dramatically smoother, and the angry red dots were fading. This is easily the most effective skin smoother you can buy in a drugstore. It's not pretty, it doesn't smell good, but it works. Seriously, I wouldn't be reviewing a moisturizer online unless it were amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended by my Dermatologist","review":"I have had small, mostly invisible bumps on the backs of my arms forever.

I am 23 and have had enough of being embarrassed of my upper arms. After much research, I decided to break the bank and purchase this expensive lotion. It is now middle of June and I have seen little to no improvement to my KP... I'm hesitant to say this, but I feel like it has gotten worse. The lotion is very thick and is a great moisturizer, however it is sticky which makes me feel \\"clammy\\". I have tried using it on patches of eczema and it does give relief to the very dry skin. I am also not fond of the smell; it isn't strong, but it is noticeable, which makes me wonder if others can smell it. I've given this product 2 stars because it is a great moisturizer, but did not work for the reason for purchase, which was my KP."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the money","review":"I bought this product after reading customer reviews, as they indicated this product is good for treating KP. I have been using it twice a day on my arms and calves and I have noticed a significant difference! Although it's expensive, a little goes a long way so I think the tube will last me quite a while.

Changing the ingredients makes no sense when the original was so wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great moisturizer, odd smell","review":"I unfortunately was blessed with fair, sensitive skin. Due to this I am prone to break outs and deal with KP on the back of my upper arms. Success that I've found is a series of treatments that I have found work good for me. After showering (right before I exit) I use Hibiclens to clean the areas affected by my KP. Exfoliating plus the Hibiclens cleans and sanitizes the area from dead skin, oils, bacteria, etc. After the shower I apply the AmLactin, and even hours later my skin is still soft and smooth. The downsides to this product would be the smell, it's not attractive by any means (like Palmer's Cocoa Butter is) but it does not 'flare-up' or irritate my skin like greasy moisturizers do (again, like the Palmer's Cocoa Butter). I wouldn't call this a cure-all for KP or dry skin sufferers, but this lotion is quality and worth purchasing again.

There were three songs on the CD that I remember from the movie and found tolerable.

As the others said, I bought this album to hear a few of the ... scene scores, like that amazing laid back trancy piano set The Transporter is listening to when he gets a flat tire in his car. I also liked the music when he puts the beatdown on the thugs in that house, and the bus fight scene as well. But what do we get? The same thing that's starting to happen in a LOT of martial arts/fighting movies today, a soundtrack CD full of rap. And not only that, but rap that WASN'T EVEN PLAYED IN THE ...MOVIE!!!!! Where's the breakbeats? Where's the Trance? It seems that the soundtrack producers think that we want to hear this stupid ghetto thug rap ...

For those familiar with her Broadway work, you can expect the same standard of vocal performance, but do not in any way expect this to be another album of theatre standards. All songs on the record were written by Ripley herself, and all are good. Alice shows incredible insights with her lyrics, and the delivery of the songs-singing and playing guitar- is amazing. A personal favorite of mine is \\"Suburbia\\", a song that could have been written as the theme song of my own childhood. Or anybody who grew up in the 'burbs for that matter. Simple, yet insightful and clever. Another personal favorite of mine is \\"Everything's Fine\\", a song that describes repeating that ever familiar phrase when things are anything but fine. The lyrics on this one are amazing. \\"Keeps Her Love\\" and \\"Pieces\\" are also wonderful. But so is the rest of this record. Do yourself a favor and buy Everythings Fine today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everythings Wonderful!","review":"Finally, one of Broadway's best has released her solo cd!

He must of meant some other Viking game called Rune: Viking Warlord cause this game was awful not awesome. The loading time, the crazy controls, the lack of a descent story are all reasons to avoid this title like the black plague. I mean it - the only reason I gave it one star is cause that was the worst I could. The best thing about this title is the time it gives you while it is loading. For instance you could clean your room, walk your dog, mow the lawn, paint the house, wash your car, and even sleep in the amount of time it takes between each level. This is really an awful title. Sorry if you already bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game is a waste on most every level","review":"...I admit, the programmers did their homework and many facets of the game are right out of Norse mythology for the most part.

The only good thing about this game, is that I rented it first, praise the Viking Warlord."},{"rating":"1","title":"RUNE VIKING WARLORD","review":"Yes I know I wrote already but, I also forgot to mention the loading time of this game is about 1/2 a min every time it loads.

A perfect snapshot of failed ideas in the early 3D eras. It makes the complaints about camera and control in modern 3D action games seem like nitpicking, as Urban Chaos is all but unplayable with its set up.Even basic functions like jumping, or punching are so poorly mishandled, it makes you wonder if the developers were really thinking they had something cool, or simply going through the motions w/ a limited skill set and lack of funding."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Comic Look at Siblings!","review":"Megin a.k.a. Megamouth and Greg a.k.a. Grosso are brother and sister growing up in suburban Philadelphia. This book is a light-hearted most of the time obvservation of sibling rivalry in a family. Jerry Spinelli has written other winners like \\"Loser,\\" \\"Stargirl,\\" and \\"Maniac Magee.\\" I have to say that this book is okay for young readers and adults who appreciate the lighter side of life.The relationship and situation between Megin and Greg remind me of a sitcom on television. Each sibling takes turns in this book about the way they look at things. It's not ingenious writing but it's well to do for it's audience. I think it could be better. As Spinelli kept writing his books, he does get better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who Put That Hair On My Toothbrush?","review":"I would recommend this book to someone who enjoys seeing two very different people talk about the same subject. You can really focus on this book and connect with the characters. Every couple of chapters, there was a surprise that grabbed your attention even more. There are a lot of funny scenes and weird but believable events. A few of the chapters end with a cliffhanger. For example, on of the chapters where Megin is the narrator, it ends with \`It was a long time before I looked up and finally, finally saw the girl from California.\\" I really enjoyed reading this book and would read other books by Jerry Spinelli because I like his style of writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book! Shows the realistic side to family life!","review":"I absolutely love this book! I first read it when I was 9 and I am still reading over and over at 14. I can compare myself to Megan and Greg in so many ways. Who Put That Hair in My Toothbrush? teaches numerous life lessons about making friends, learning to love siblings, etc., etc., etc. This book brought out so many emotions in me, from laughter to sadness and is at the top of my list, for all ages!"},{"rating":"1","title":"sort of disappointing","review":"Frankly, folks, Spinelli can do lots better than this! He's proven it with books like Crash, Loser, and (most of) Stargirl. So what in the world happened to him here??? Both of the main characters here are incredibly immature. I think junior high and high schoolers should be insulted by a story that portrays them as so shallow! The constant name-calling, whining, lying, and so forth really got on my nerves. True, toward the end one tragedy and another near-tragedy bring Greg and Megin closer together. But by then you may not like them enough to care. And a couple of Spinelli's much more likeable minor characters, such as Megin's \\"adopted grandmother\\" Emilie Bain, are hardly developed. What GOT INTO Spinelli here? This book is tremendously skippable. Read Crash instead. \\"Sibling rivalry\\" gets a fairer portrayal there, even though it's not the book's main theme."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Witty","review":"This book was very entertaining and funny.

It will have some occasional gorey or language, but overall I would say the age level for this is 11+. It may not be nearly as good or intense as the movies, but overall it is heartbeating at parts. Charlie Higson did a good job in this book, it's similair to the Regular James Bond, but he's younger. Their currently is 3 in the series, with Blood Fever being the 2nd, and Double Or Die the 3rd. There are some scary parts, intense reads, and some bullying, but overall I think you would like it. 5 Stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Start of a Terrific New Series","review":"The young Bond is at boarding school at Eton where he finds himself in the middle of his first mystery. While in Scotland, James finds that his enemy George Hellebore from school is visiting as well. A young boy goes missing and the clues link the abduction near the Hellebore Estate and to the work of a madman that is working to create a genetically altered cross between human and beast.This adventurous new series will appeal to both young and older Bond fans. Silverfin is the beginning of a fun series that will give readers a chance to see into the life of James Bond before his 007 womanizing days.Silverfin is undoubtedly a great beginning to a fantastic new adventure series. Terrifically crafted characters and an adventurous plot make for a page-turning read that will please Bond fans of all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME","review":"I really liked the book.

Higson traces Bond's early life adding flesh to the occassional references to his childhood in Fleming's stories. Like all the Bond books and short stories, this one is a page turner. The end of one chapter compels the reader to move onto the next. I recommend this book to longtime Bond fans as well as youthful readers who merely like a good action tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fast moving thriller with some knowing winks to Bond fans","review":"A cross between Ian Flemming and Enid Blyton, this is a great introduction to young Bond, despite a couple of fairly disturbing scenes that might not be suitable for preteens.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silverfin","review":"Do you like bloody details and action? Then read this book it is full of it.

Last, James goes to visit his aunt and uncle. On the train he meets Red Kelly and helps him. James finds out that George is on the train. One night James and George run into each other and George jumps him and is about to kill him when Red Kelly shows up and saves James.

James Bond isn't a secret agent yet, because he is a teenager. But that doesn't mean that he can't have great adventures. The book starts out with James going to school in Scotland. One day after school he was walking a long after school and he stumbles on an old castle ruled by Lord Hellebore. Lord Hellebore is also the head master of Eton. Eton is the school James is going to. I don't want to give the book away but Lord Hellebore is creating a killing monster and James has to stop it.I would recommend this book to any one that likes lots of action and adventure. If I had to rate these book from 1 to 10 it would be a 9. The only bad part about this book is when the characters are talking about stuff. The rest of the book is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"This ain't no Jimmy Bond!","review":"Don't waste your money. This was written by an author in his sleep assuring it didn't get in the way of his real job. It is a very turgid and fractured piece of writing, where themes with the hint of promise are not fully explored leaving the book plastic and vacuous in feel, like a hermetically sealed meal. Only few - VERY few - characters are well-defined with some sense of past associated to their current actions. Worst of all is that the very good work developed in Mr Higson's Silverfin has not been capitalised upon. In the first book we felt the era in which Eton had existed - now it is just a pastiche; a short nod before getting into the Bond-movie like action. A great shame, and anyone really taking time to give this nonsense five stars would also possibly be shopping tonight at the Supermarket for that hermetically sealed meal!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring book has no insight into James Bond whatsoever","review":"This was an incredibly disappointing book. The young James Bond in this snoozetome could have been anyone. There was not a hint of a trace of a mist of whom James would grow up to become. Not only that, but the story is dull and silly.

Amazon needs a zero-star rating for totally worthless material like Silverfin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silverfin","review":"A nice idea of having young Bond and I can see the potential market. However the story was poorly written and in the past. The modern Bond of toady had to have been born in the late sixties. This bond was born in 1920 si the stuff is old.

It should have been AMAZING but it wasn't.The whole of the first half is exactly like one of those old books for girls about what life is like at their fancy school. Then there is some action eventually (if you haven't given up by then through boredom). The main problem is that even the action is not exciting because the character of James Bond himself is comepletely dull. Not even dull - not there at all.If you're looking for something great to read you should go straight for the Alex Rider series, as the other reviewers have said. Also, you have probably already read those, so go for Jimmy Coates: Assassin? by Joe Craig - it's just as good as Alex Rider and way better than Silverfin."},{"rating":"1","title":"I AM DISGRACED!THIS IS NOT CLOSE TOJAMES BOND","review":"AT ALL!

I received it for my birthday after suggesting that I might be interested in a long-zoom digital camera with image stabilization. This is my third digital camera. I liked my 3x Olympus, 3 megapixel but thought I would like the additional features that I just mentioned. To begin, I hate everything about the Easy-Share program. The image stabilization does little or nothing for me. Even a tripod is not paticularly useful because the camera lacks opportunity for remote shutter release, the camera IS slow, the flash is weak. In most of the scene modes (and flash), the shutter is too slow for me to hand hold. The movie mode has great picture and sound but movies can't be burned to DVD for showing on a conventional DVD player. To me, that means this feature is next to useless. Controls are too complicated. About all that I can say for it is that it looks good. I'm just glad that I still have my Olympus!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Digital Camera Ever!!!

Now I can't even return it back to the store because my 30 days have expired. I will now have to try and sell this piece of junk on eBay for less money and hope somebody buys this thing \\"as is\\".

I chose this camera for the zoom for sporting events. The pictures at the zoom range are almost always out of focus because it is so hard to hold the camera still while trying to get an action shot. Then the down time between shots is so long, forget quick action shots in a row. Also the delay after pressing the shutter is so long the shot is missed most of the time. The good thing is the quality of a posed picture is very crisp but again because of the delay, many times eyes are closed due to the flash.

What a joke. This book is a big disappointment. His attempts at humor seem to be the main point of the book and more often then not they are neither funny nor illuminating. In fact these constant clumsy attempts to lighten up an otherwise serious subject are a big distraction. It was so bad that I couldnt stand to read past the first few chapters...touture.

If I had to use it for a study guide for the knowledge test I would have wasted alot of time and energy doing so. It is a very good book, but due to his extensive illustrations and coverage it would have been more of a distraction then help in learning the necessaryinformation for the written test. This book goes further into the facts then necessary for scoring well on the knowledge test.His illustrations, humor, detail and perspective are excellent which is why it makes it more suitable as a referance book after the fact."},{"rating":"2","title":"A useful training manual","review":"I found Machado's book to be extremely useful in most areas. While its true that he sometimes burns too many calories focusing on humor, the explanations of HOW and WHY with regards to systems, procedures, and regulations are excellent. Trying to memorize data from Gleim's was putting me into a coma, but my retention of information is vastly improved using Machado's book. The book is written in a conversational tone that mirrors the kind of diaglogue you might have with your CFI. I also found the abundant diagrams to be very helpful; and the frequent anecdotes and short stories help reinforce points as well as make my own errors seem pretty minor. I'm quite glad I bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterful - A Must Have!","review":"I have to agree with the positive comments about Machado's book. The first thing I thought while reading it was \\"Dummies\\"-style. I love \\"Dummies\\" books. They clearly explain the concepts and identify the nice-to-knows and the must-knows. Machado's book does very much the same thing and it's sheer size ensures virtually everything is adequately covered.As for the corniness some may have reported, well humor is certainly subjective particularly when used as edutainment. If his objective was to write a comedy manuscript I might be critical. Since the objective is aviation instruction, I think it's masterful - nothing less. It's a must have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"There are better","review":"There are better learning tools than this. Jansen computer course for instance.

I had the King tapes (CDs actually), but when I needed clarification or real insight, I picked up Machado's handbook.

However, he does tend to be pretty wordy. I found a great combination to be Gleim's test prep book and this one.The Gleim books give you the bare minimum of information, very quickly. Then for the places I needed more meat... this book was the perfect source--It explains things in a couple of different ways so if one of them doesn't do it for you, one of the others should.In fact, I still use it when I need something explained in english. It was a great addition to my library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably not worth your time","review":"In our super literate and conscientious read group, only 1 of 5 completed this novel. Vidal's knowledge of the period is impressive but his voice so arch and almost parodistic that one remains at too great a remove from the characters and their fates.

The video rendering could have been done better (the Dora video doesn't looks so hot on a big screen TV).

You will marvel at their choices, rejoice at the outcomes or mourne their fates... do not think you will escape the conclusion dry-eyed.And at the end, like the legions of Margaret Weis' fans, you will also want to raise a bloodsword to the courage of Lady Maigrey, Lord Sagan and Dion Starfire!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE (!!!!!!!!!) this book!

It's a great history of science piece that also provides context and commentary on the implications (known and projected) of what we know so far. I read a lot of books on science, biochemistry and health-related research. I wish I could add many more books with the turn of phrase and depth of insight of this book to my list.

Makes you think about the important processes on the planet."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I've ever read","review":"As another reviewer stated, this really is a life-changing book. I read it after taking a course in biochemistry and it had even more impact on me in tying a lot of fascinating concepts together.The most amazing thing about this book is how influential mitochondria are on our lives and subsequently how little we (you!) know about them. They're why we(eukaryotes AND warm-blooded animals)'re here, why we're large, why bacteria can't become like us, why we have gender, why we have sex and why we die. Fascinating stuff--definitely a book you should buy (especially considering the title is quite a conversation starter too)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mitochondria is the reason","review":"Mitochondria is the reason there are no prokaryotic mice. If we calculate the actual measured energy per gene in prokaryotes andeukaryotes of similar size, taking into consideration the measured metabolic rates per cell and the known ploidy, then the actual power per gene of both Epulopiscium and Thiomargarita falls in the range of 15,000 to 50,000 times lower than A. proteus. This is in the same order of magnitude as Lane's calculated values, and would be expected to be lower, given that the larger part of the cell volume in these giant prokaryotes is metabolically inert. One might argue that this metabolic inertia is in fact forced upon these giant bacteria by the exorbitant energetic costs of maintaining all those additional genomes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Choppy","review":"There wasn't much in the book that I wasn't aware of before. This book is really fragmented. It just seems choppy and it doesn't have that flow that good and informative books tend to have.Also, I find it interesting that some people attack negative comments on a book they really like.

Put their money into catchy Book Titles and chapter headings but let us down by shorting us on substance and thought provoking content. This is a badly done review of poorly understood literature. There is nothing to this book that is either new or interesting and definitely nothing that will keep you awake except the nagging thought of why did I wast good money on this drivel? Take the chance to \\"take a look inside\\" and read some of it before you buy....What I should have done."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing but esoteric","review":"most reviews have been resoundingly positive and i won't deviate from that here. I will say this, I have a degree in chemistry and took biochem in college and found some of the chapters in the first parts of this book fairly advanced. i had to read sections a few times to follow properly. having said that, i think more science books should be written like this. this is at the the opposite end of the spectrum from \\"a short history of nearly everything\\" or other general science books. if you're interested in seriously learning about mitochondria, biochemical principles and the origin of life from a chemical standpoint i think nick lane does a great job and I'm very grateful he wrote this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good science book","review":"This book was recommended to me by several AP Biology teachers as a good background to help prepare students for the AP Biology test and college. It's NOT a test-prep book. Instead, it delves into the mitochondria and the evolution of the eukaryotic cell. This is a key concept in biology, and this book uses lots of current research to explain evolutionary probabilities. It is a dense read - lots of complex big science words, however not as bad as a textbook. Perhaps not the best-seller for the mainstream folk. I do think you'll need an interest in biology or evolutionary histry to make it through the book. If you are interested in biology, then I greatly recommend this book because it helped provide me with a deeper understanding of the cell's evolutionary history, cell respiration (and photosynthesis, by default), cell signalling, and how the cell works together in the body (including some very colonial ideas, like apoptosis and dying for the good of the whole)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great intermediate to advanced workout","review":"This is a great step workout. I love the different intervals - her pushes really get the heart rate up. Her moves are basic but she uses some new and effective combinations which make it more challenging. Her cues are timely and she does preview some moves or uses add-ons to create more complex combinations. Her attitude is upbeat and energetic without being annoying and the music is pretty decent. Her 9 minute core segment was a great finish to the workout. I highly recommend this DVD for any one looking to rev up their step routines."},{"rating":"1","title":"This video is dull...","review":"I love step aerobics, but part of what makes it fun is good music to keep you moving and motivated.

First, it does not address many of the pre-eminent tattooists of the recent past and present. For example, there is no Guy Aitchison, no Aaron Cain, no Dan Hazelton, etc. People like this have been essential to the recent developments of the tattoo. Second, as one of the reviewers below notes, there is not much in the way of written history here. That is both good and bad since it is nice to have all these pictures, but I found my self wanting explanations and background. Third, many of the photos in this book are downright unpleasant in the aesthetic sense. In other words, they depict awful tattoos on people that I don't really want to see naked. I know this is part of the history, but I don't really need to see a close up some guy's private parts tattooed with a devil head.

The Serta mattress has a 30 year warranty for the same price vs. the MDB 5 year limited warranty.

I'm not sure if that's where she sleeps for the most part, or what, but I'm getting a new mattress here soon. It is also very loud when I lay her down, it sounds like she's laying on plastic bags. I've never had a mattress sound like that, not even the super cheap one from Walmart that we had for my oldest.If you're going to get a mattress, get a Sealy. My middle daughter has one that was one of my friends' who's daughter is almost 6 and the thing is almost brand new.

It makes the sheets easy to change... along with the fact that after about three or four months of use, I could fold it in half if I wanted to. It's saggy, soft, and like another reviewer said, it is smashed down on one side and thick on the other, even though I've turned it, flipped it and tried to \\"fluff\\" it to get the batting back to the other side. I don't know how this is even safe to put a baby to sleep on since babies need a firm surface. \\"Ultra Firm\\" is a complete lie. Don't waste your money on this mattress. It's cheap for a reason.

This book is liable to disappoint, however. The setting is rural South, not 5th Ward Houston, and the young men seem more chaotic than inchoate. Mouse, however, remains his murderous loyal self and drives the action.Mosley's difficulty lies in portraying the secondary characters of this novel. They fall largely in three buckets - old-style holy roller good, blood evil, and grotesque. The stereotyping of rural blacks is blatant enough that Mosley seems to uphold the prejudices of 1920's redneck bigots. Fortunately he redeems this broad brush on several occasions with jewels of description and language, and a few twists of sympathy for his characters.Not a best effort - worth reading out of the library, but not buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Mosley's Best","review":"This book, which constitutes the backgrounds of the allegiance between Mouse and Easy (two of popular modern literature's more interesting protagonists) not only fills in historical blanks, but is a great read all by itself. Mouse and Easy travel south (along with two hitchhikers) to try and pursuade Mouses's cruel stepfather to finance Mouse's wedding. By the end of the novel however, the stepfather and one of the hitchikers are dead, and Easy must deal with the fact that he took money to keep his mouth shut about the killings. What's most interesting is that Mosley wrote this book in the eighties, before he was published at all, and then could not sell it until the marketability of black authors had been established. Overall, a very worthwhile buy"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you are a real 'Easy' fan avoid this one!","review":"I was very disappointed in this book - the plot is weak and the ties to the past are very stretched and actually repetitive if you have read the other books in this series.

In the mean time, the cultivation of compassion will quieten the mind, relinquish ego clinging and make us nicer people to know.The text is easy to digest and the points are easy to put into practice. In practice, for the novice, Bodhicitta is hard to cultivate and requires diligence and dicipline in ones practice.Although intended for practicing Buddhists any one could benefit from reading this book.

This is a crucial distinction as Wyschogrod wants to argue that Israel has a corporate and corporeal or incarnational sense of its relation to God that need not be expressed in the Aristotelian language of Christian doctrine.The book is, as another reviewer wrote, written with clarity and thought. It is important to know that Wyschogrod pulls no punches with respect to Christianity. He admires the Christian theologian Karl Barth, and like Barth does not shy away from frank criticisms, some of which extend to Jesus, Paul, and Christianity in general. This makes for a lively read that should alert Christians to the idea that something is at stake in these discussions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty but not practical","review":"Not durable for simple every-day use standing on it doing dishes at the sink.

Tracks 7 and 8 were recorded with an entirely different band for Signature after the ban, and the rest of the tracks were all recorded in December 1943. Condon was able to surround himself with a fairly regular set of sidesmen, Max Kaminsky on trumpet and Pee Wee Russell on clarinet were fixtures, but he was also able to attract sympathetic players - and so Benny Morton is on trombone on tracks 9-12, whilst James P. Johnson plays piano on tracks 7 and 8. Above all it sounds as though they were enjoying themselves, not just working through a set of sessions.

That's the only downside. The game has good length, and a fun idea as a plotline. But, there are not too many twists and turns plotwise, so that pulls quite a bit away from re-playability. This ran well with the minimum specs on my system : AMD XP 2800 -- 512 MG DDR RAM -- 128 MG GeFORCE 4 5600. For the sheer shooting power of the game, i would recommend it.

The game itself is cartoonish, so is the plotline and difficulty! You can chose from four superstars to play as to capture the WWF title and rescue Stephanie McMahon. Another fun thing about this game is the details, you can pick up weapons to beat the thugs, and destroy cars, desks, tables and anything else. If you are over 7 years old, I would consider this a total blunder of a game.

The Stone Cold Stunner looke like a bulldog, you will end up breaking your gameboy because you have to keep pressing buttons when you are dizzy.

But he does a terrible job of discussing the underlying cause: U.S. foreign policy. America's self-interest in a \\"stable\\" Mexico meant unquestioning support for the murderous PRI. If the U.S. were really really interested in democracy in Mexico, it would have supported the students in 1968 -- when the Mexican Army opened fire killing hundreds. Why did the U.S. close rank with a murderous government and turn its back on the democratic hopes of the Mexican people? Because the PRI promised stability -- through oppressing human rights, through frustrating democracy. Reding turns a blind eye to our complicity in prolonging the road to democracy by three decades. Reding ignores American culpability in the ability of the Mexican state to oppress its own people.

Without taking up much rack space (they can share 1U of rack space with aTFT7600 Rackmount Monitor and Keyboard) you can connect to 16 machines via a locally-connected keyboard/monitor/mouse or over a network connection. This model has the capability to share a USB storage device with connected machines (if you are using compatible USB device dongles) which makes upgrading software or firmware on multiple servers much easier. The ability to use standard CAT5 ethernet cable to connect the console with the KVM dongles makes running cables so much easier than the old-fashioned KVM cables. The only downside I have found for these KVM consoles is that the network interface requires a static IP address or a bootp server (no DHCP capabilities yet), but in most networked environments this is not a major issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Compressed Fidelity","review":"Of all the CDs I've purchased this one is the lowest quality of fidelity ever.

Like the gamer really cares about every single detail there is to know about the Black Mesa Corporation. The controls are pathetic; the plot is confusing, mediocre, and poorly portrayed; the weapons don't have any special qualities; and the multiplayer is just a joke.

The show is a perfect example of great television. Characters who have depth and provide a voice to a deeper inner insight into human character. Great sets that highlight the best of early 60s design and clothes that set off the time period in a interesting manner. I was put off by the 1st season a bit because of the coldness I saw in the characters and saw them as archetypes rather than more human. This season the show really seems to get going and becomes more interesting.

You put the discs in, and then there's just blackness for an inordinate length of time. You think the disc isn't working, but it is. Then an empty red battery appears on the screen. You follow its progress from not filled in at all to partially filled in, finally to completely filled in. Then more blackness. Then finally a Clorox commercial. More blackness. The MENU doesn't appear until who knows how long. And if you watch an episode and then stop and leave, when you come back, it will not take you to where you left off. Instead, you have to sit through the seemingly endless screen blackness all over again, then the battery slowly filling, then the commercial, etc. etc. I have one of the newest and highest rated blu-ray players out there. And I have not had this problem with any other blu-ray. This is by far the most poorly made blu-ray disc ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Season Two Blu-Ray Unplayable","review":"Just a note of caution: I purchased a copy which proved unplayable on my Samsung BD-P 1400.

I was so excited when this show was airing, watched several episodes just hoping it would get better it never did. The characters are bland with no substance, the plot is always the same. The 60's were better than this show represents by a long shot. It's unreal that this series can be in the second season going on 3. Breaking Bad is great, Rome was superb, Big Love is fantastic, The Tudors, excellant, Damages, intriguing, Dexter is interesting (& those are all the series I have or will have on dvd) but Mad Men is depressing and disappointing to the nth degree."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This is such a well done show.

Having bought, watched and enjoyed Mad Men season 1 from amazon.com, we ordered the season 2 discs from NetFlix. The first set that arrived wouldn't play in either of our DVD players (\\"No Disc\\" error message), so NetFlix shipped a replacement set - same result. We then ordered the season 2 discs from amazon.com - and again the discs wouldn't play. We returned them for credit (excellent service from amazon.com, as always). None of the discs had any obvious flaws or damage - they just wouldn't play. These are the ONLY discs that have ever given us this result; all other DVDs, whether commercial or recorded on our DVR, play perfectly well on both of our machines.

The second season I purchased on blu-ray disc doesn't have a resume feature, allowing you to go back to the place you were at before you stopped and/or shut down. This makes it really inconvenient because you have to sit through the ads, the introductions, the Clorox commercial, the legal disclaimers, etc. before you get back to the episode at which you left off -- and then you have to fast-forward to find exactly where you were in the episode, if you can remember where that is! What a royal pain. I would not recommend this product to anyone.

So much happens to these dynamic characters. We learn more and more about Don Draper (Jon Hamm) and his mysterious past. Meanwhile, Betty (January Jones) becomes an even more unstable and unlikeable character, in my opinion. She has a nervous breakdown and starts acting very out of character, and I hate everything that she does. I do not, however, despise Peggy (Elisabeth Moss) nearly as much as I did in Season 1. She really begins to come into her own this season and he character started growing on me like a fungus. Poor Roger (John Slattery) makes some incredibly stupid decisions regarding his personal life, as does Joan (Christina Hendricks), and I fear that things will just continue to get worse for these characters in Season 3. Sterling Cooper undergoes some significant changes by the end of Season 2, so it will be very interesting to see what happens next. BRING IT ON!!! I love this show!"},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing show","review":"This is one of the best shows on TV. I live in a place where I don't get AMC and this is a great purchase.

It's like a dramatic Seinfeld. A show about nothing other than the lives of the characters. But I have to admit, I really got into it. The acting is great, the characters are interesting and the the detail with which they go about recreating the 60's is truly astonishing. I've been hooked on this show since season 1 and it's definitely worth owning. Season 2 is more of the same, but after you've gotten to know the characters, it's really fun to watch them evolve and see where their self destructive lives lead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mad Men Season 2","review":"Well worth the purchase!

I love when people refer to this show as \\"boring\\". It immediately lets me know that we are not going to get along (unless they're really hot, and then I can fake a conversation, just like on the show).

I'm not a big drama fan, but the whole era just fascinates me; the costumes, the cars, the constant smoking and drinking, and especially the interaction between the women and men, according to their gender roles in the 1960's. And the men look really good in suits so I can't complain. ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mad Men: Season 2","review":"Excellent series. Mad Men cover the time period excellently.

I will watch these episodes over again, too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Season One was a lot better than Season Two.","review":"In Season One, both Don Draper and Peggy Olson have a strong story arc. We get to know Don better through his long-lost brother. And we see Peggy rise from secretary to copywriter. What do we get in Season Two? Almost nothing. Don is back to his old tricks and that's about it. Oh...and he's against dropping the Mohawk Airlines account for the American Airlines account. Really riveting stuff there. And Peggy. Now that she's a copywriter, it seems like the writers didn't know what to do with her during Season Two. I guess the best you can say about her is that she gives free advice to the priest on public speaking. Again--really riveting stuff there. It seemed like Season Two focused more on the supporting characters, such as Sal, Ken and Paul. But why spend so much time with the supportining characters and not enough time with the leads? This was the problem with Season Two and one of the reasons why it was boring. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incompatable DVDs","review":"I purchased season 1-4 of Mad Men for Blu-ray, which we have.

We really enjoyed the first 2 disks on season 1 and are very disappointed that we can't continue watching in sequence.

Back to Tulsa is their best live album and has a ton of songs on it. Their cover of Robert Earl's song at the end of disc two is priceless. Buy it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting Avant-garde Score","review":"This score, performed by the current road orchestra for David Byrne and written by the one-time keyboardist for 8 1/2 Souvenirs, is a beautifully spare companion to Richard Linklater's animated musings. Using Austin artists seems like a natural choice since the film takes place on the streets of Linklater's former stomping ground. Mostly piano and strings, it oscillates between dark broodings and the hopping tango; often, the accordion gives it a decidedly French feel. A great disc to pick up since the movie is mostly music peppered with dialogue (or vice versa). As a result, the cues are long."},{"rating":"2","title":"dreamy but refreshing","review":"I bought this because I loved the movie, both visually and philosophically. The soundtrack goes very well with the movie and is responsible for much of the surreal feel of it. But even listened to independently it's great.The recording is kind of raw, there is little processing, and it may even be considered careless, but that's part of its charm.The sound itself is pretty original (to me anyway). It's strings (one violin, one cello and one double bass, I think), piano and accordeon. The result is refreshing. That's probably the best word to describe this: refreshing, and of course, dreamy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real gem","review":"Kate Schrock is unique. I love her music.

The dog owners fret with anticipation over making sure the dogs are pampered and properly prepped before the show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can your stomach explode if you laugh too hard?!","review":"Christopher Guest has once again shown us that anything he does will probably be worth watching. He has such an eye for people and detail, that virtually everyone can watch his movies and see someone they know in them. With a stellar cast, it's hard to pick just one actor to shower praise on, but Parker Posey once again shows us why she can play the best \\"female dog\\" characters in Hollywood (\\"Dazed and Confused, \\"Will and Grace\\", etc.). The scene with her shopping for a new toy for her mutt are exquisite. Additionally, the scene with Eugene Levy and his wife having to sleep in the utility closet makes my side hurt EVERY time I watch it, which should be the definition of great comedy. Probably the funniest movie released in the last 5 years, bar none!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best in Show","review":"This movie shows a great amount of restraint on how many ways they could have made fun of dog shows and the people involved in them. Actually, it was funnier the second time, because then you get all the little nuances you may have missed the first time around. This could be the sleeper of 2000. I found it to be really funny and if you have EVER seen even 15 minutes of a dog show, this movie is a MUST. I recommend it highly for any age group over the age of 13. It is really great entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feeling down? Pop in this movie for a good laugh!","review":"I rented this movie on DVD for two reasons 1)It had a standard poodle in it (I have a black one myself) and 2) I liked Parker Posey from her As the World Turns days. I enjoyed the movie MUCH more than I expected. It is a great satire on Dog Shows and particularly the dog owners. After watching the movie my husband and I watched it with the commentary and enjoyed it even more after learning all the behind the scenes stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best in Movies","review":"I just watched this movie the way it was meant to be watched, in VHS. On the recommendation of my employer I bought this movie from Amazon but mistakenly ordered a VHS version.The movie is as good as advertised, not roll on the floor laughing funny, but consistently funny throughout. For me Fred Willard was the best of the best with some great lines.Here's a movie with great acting, great pacing, and great script packed into a very reasonable time frame for those of us whose attention wanders or who fall asleep during movies. No danger of either of those things happening during this entertaining film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best in show review","review":"This movie is just plain hilarious. Everyone out there must see it. This is improvisational acting at its' best. A must see."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Best\\" In Show!!!!","review":"This is one of my favorite movies! Guest did wonderfully directing, yet i think he was better as the small town bloodhound owner with the tackle shop. My favorite characters were the two women with the poodle, Rhapsody in White. I feel the acting in this film was wonderful and the actors carried the roles well. I felt they were suited for the job and were great at delivering the comedy. This movie is hilarious from start to finish, you'll love it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Okay","review":"This movie I think could have been so much more. It just seemed to drag on and I chuckled a few times but nothing really struck me as really funny. As far as mockumentarys go, I recommend the far superior \\"Drop Dead Gorgeous\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"It was not well acted. I found it very slow and boring...I would not recommend this movie to anyone. The humor was dry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful","review":"This movie truly mocks people who accept their dogs as another member of their dysfuntional families.Extremely corny (on purpose, I know, but over the top), a little erotic (but almost not in a sexual way), and completely bizarre... I really hated it. I know it was a mockumentary and I could see what it was supposed to be, but it missed the mark.The characters weren't funny at all- They made me confused, but not in a good way. I didn't laugh at their quirks and a lot of them made me uncomfortable. The entire movie was a mistake to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best in Show","review":"This is a great funny movie.

SO MUCH OF IT IS SO TRUE BUT PRESENTED IN A HYSTERICAL WAY. IT'S MUST SEE! PURCHASE AT AMAZON.COM"},{"rating":"2","title":"Never gets old","review":"I used to show dogs and this is a great spoof on the dog show game. It is all exaggerated but so much of it has a ring of truth to it and that is what makes it so funny. I have seen it several times and it still makes me laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic","review":"This movie is a classic. It is a family favorite. Quirky and fun. If you have a dog or like dogs you will love this movie"},{"rating":"1","title":"I've seen it all before","review":"I almost died laughing with \\"This is Spinal Tap\\", and had a really good time with \\"Waiting for Guffman\\". But too much of a good thing can go awry, and the 'mockumentary' style is old news for me. Granted, the movie has some funny moments, but after a while the interviews got to be too predictable. The actors are fantastic, especially Parker Posey as a hysterical and rude dog owner, but their great acting is not enough to carry the movie forward. My favorite part is the duo of show commentators. The American is being all crass and makes bad jokes, while the English tries to endure the aggravation as politely as possible. Other than that, i found it hard to crack a smile here and there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it","review":"Off humor, not really that funny. The movie is very slow in spots. I would skip this one as it is not worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's funny because it's true!","review":"OK, Political correctness aside, this movie hits the mark on a lot of levels. People who are too obsessive with their pets (come on we all know at least one or two of them) are the targets here, not the animals themselves. The owners portrayed in \\"Best of Show\\" rank up there with Trekkies, horse owners, comic book guys and other \\"cults\\" of people, whose lives are lived vicariously through animals or other forms of escape from reality. Guest and the surrounding cast do an excellent job on the character portrayals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious!!!","review":"I loved this movie. The cast was phenomenal and I laughed so hard during most of the movie that my mouth hurt from smiling. Christopher Guest has done it again! Catherine O'Hara is wonderful and Eugene Levy has unbeatable comic genius! Rent or buy it today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A genre of its own, you gotta get into it","review":"The first time I saw this movie, I had no clue what the heck it was supposed to be. I had only bought it because it was on sale and had O' Hara and Coolidge in it.So I guess that after a short while I felt like one of the previous rewievers. I felt like turning it off. But I stuck to it 'til the end and found the movie wasn't that bad at all. It's just a style you rarely see. I have watched it 3 times in a little over a year. You just have to accept it's not a regular movie and then you can enjoy it, well, at least I did.I am going to buy \\"A Mighty Wind\\" next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and all too true","review":"If you've read Vickie Hearne's book \\"Adam's Task,\\" about training and communicating with animals, you'll know that the types of dog-owners in this movie are all too real, especially the neurotic yuppies who make their poor Weimarauner crazy and almost start World War III over a lost squeaky-toy. The idiotic dog-show announcer is a sort of stand-in for the rest of us, since he asks all the stupid questions about dogs that we might think of, but would have too much sense to actually say out loud. Like all good satires, \\"Best in Show\\" makes you think as well as laugh, but do enjoy the laughs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not funny or worth the money","review":"Christopher Guest's films must be an acquired taste. I found this attempt at satire crude and heavy-handed: the purpose seemed to be to exploit every pathetic stereotype and hackneyed joke he could think of, while saying nothing in particular about the sport he was supposedly sending up. Everything about the film suggests it was a real quickie -- even the setting for the \\"big show,\\" which resembled a rented junior high gym. The only truly funny character is the \\"color commentator,\\" whose accent and inappropriate remarks perfectly catch the on-screen persona of a certain retired athlete who for years was a staple of the annual Westminster broadcasts."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was so funny about this movie?","review":"I don't get why people loved this movie. It's all about a bunch of psychotic dog owners who are annoying to watch. Where's the comedy in that? Maybe it's the fact that so many people paid money to see this in the theatres that they all had to laugh out loud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paws Down","review":"I had been waiting for this movie! I was keenly disappointed. I watched it a good 20 minutes, hoping to see the \\"gut-splitting\\" humor promised and turned it off. Glad I only paid rental for it, rather than buying it. Others apparently found it funny, though, so I suggest you see it somewhere before buying it, and decide for yourself. :)Perhaps I expected more dog action, and found mostly dysfunctional people dialog."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best in Show Better than Sleeping Pills","review":"If you like to watch DIRT GROW, then this is the movie for you ! Watched only half of the movie because we didn't want to waste the electricity and our time. Sorry we spent the money on this purchase.If you're still interested in seeing it, wait until the local library offers it ('cause then it would be free)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Save your money. Unless you're a dog freak there's nothing here but the opportunity to see some usually-funny actors embarrass themselves by attempting improvised humour. Funny actors aren't necessarily funny people as this film repeatedly proves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hiliarious with stupid humor","review":"Christopher Guest did a wonderful job with this movie. The characters are very well developed and very funny. This movie has a star packed cast including Parker Posey, Catherine O'Hara, Eugene Levy. The fact that this was filmed in a documentary setting makes this movie a funny form of the Blair Witch craze."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best in the Show really is a Dog","review":"One major problem. Not very funny. Nothing really happens. A rather banal format where various contestants are continually interviewed in litte snippets throughout the film with unimaginative dialogue and mediocre acting. Save your money. Most of all - save your time. Can't imagine why I sat through more than 10 minutes - kept hoping there would be a laugh sooner or later."},{"rating":"1","title":"painful","review":"Dog shows have got to be funny, right? I mean, endless fodder, yes? Not if they're \\"Best in Show\\". I was ready to laugh - all of my friends seem to love this movie - but all I could think when watching it was \\"please kill me\\". Terrible acting from people who try waaay too hard to convey how quirky they must be. You can't force humor, people. I will avoid every movie that is ever compared favorably to this one. May I never have to see another movie as bad as this in my life, unless I'm being punished for something."},{"rating":"2","title":"more humor than hatred","review":"\\"Satire\\" is kind of a strong word for what this movie is. It does poke a good deal of fun at the \\"dog breeding world,\\" or whatever you might call it. To truly appreciate the movie, I think you need to see the \\"real thing\\" -- the annual Eukanuba Tournament of Champions. Joe Garagiola is the \\"color commentator\\" for the real show, and he tries his damndest to say silly, ignorant things -- much like the commentator in the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well . . .","review":"Meh, it was ok. I thought parts were funny, but the dry humor got tiresome after a while. I won't watch it again. (and Jane Lynch is WAY overrated)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh???","review":"I guess I just don't get it. I didn't find this movie that great. The best part is Eugene Levy's two left feet.

A waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even an average comedy","review":"I watched this expecting a great laugh riot and didn't even get an occasional chuckle. The beginning has the hand-held camera feel a la Blair Witch, though the camera seems to become steady about a half-hour into the film. I'd heard that very little of this was actually scripted and it seems evident when watching as the actors seem to be grabbing for words or ideas out of thin air - it was a lot like watching an improv class. The doggies were cute, but in general there was a lot of low-brow humor - a lot of references to previous ..exploits of one of the owners and some very awkward conversation about the psychological effects of a dog seeing it's Mommy and Daddy practicing the Kama Sutra.Anyway, not something I would ever want to see again, but I did manage to stay awake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a movie to ever watch a second time","review":"I rented this movie a while back and even watched it with some more dog loving people than I am.

I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good commercials, bad movie","review":"If you go to a video store, best in show is the worst (Movie) on shelf.

It captures the genuine love, devotion, talent--and eccentricities, obsessivesness, and laugh-out-loud humor of the world of dog shows, the pet owners, and the TV commentators. Best of all--Guest has affection for the subjects he is satirizing, and laughs with them, not at them. The performances of his usual ensemble are extraordinary--both witty and touching. Tightly edited (not a wasted moment), this little film is a comedic treasure that stand up to repeated viewings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely hilarious","review":"Apparently there are some people who have a negative impression of this film. Fine, but its not a slapstick comedy with goofy jokes. It is satirical and the humor is dry. All of the characters are stereotyped which makes this film so funny. Its not about the dogs, its about the characters who own them. I believe that if you do not think this film is funny then you either are comedically impaired, or lacking some IQ points."},{"rating":"2","title":"A work of genius","review":"To me Best in Show is one of the great films of the past decade or so. I have now seen it more than a half dozen times (and very few films hold up to that intense and detailed viewing) and each time that I see it I find more and more things in it to appreciate. Unlike other reviewers, I don't really think that the film is \\"about\\" dog shows. Rather, the dog show environment and culture serve merely as a way of revealing the foibles of different sorts of characters in contemporary culture, as well as the genius of talented writers and performers. It is one of those rare films in which almost every line, facial expression, gesture, and action is perfect and conveys a world of meaning, perspective, and irony. It is really a film in the tradition of great comedy (including Aristophanes, Shakespeare, Mozart, and Balzac) that exhibits compassion toward and understanding of human beings in their predicament as fools, naifs, and self-deceivers."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Best In Show\\" Maybe not Quite the Best In Show","review":"While I find nothing wrong with Christopher Guest's mocumentary films, and most times even find them incredibly funny, \\"Best in Show\\" missed its mark. Guest continously puts his characters in awkwardly funny situations that should make the audience chuckle and laugh, but I just don't see it. The film took itself seriously, which is what most audiences loved, but I just couldn't get into it. The characters are well-rounded and developed, the cinematography is great, but the plot just doesn't go anywhere. The film follows a group of dog show contestants on the road to, and during, a national dog show competition, and that's it. There's no twists. There's no punch lines. There's no relief factor. Just ninety minutes of owners and their dogs. I could have easily gotten the same thing on Animal Planet."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best","review":"If you're a fan of mockumentaries you will sincerely appreciate this film but if you are a die hard dog show lover you won't get it.Sichelle"},{"rating":"2","title":"As funny as a wet dog is smelly!","review":"Where do I start? If you liked Spinal Tap, you'll love Best in Show. The best part of watching the movie in knowing the entire thing is improvised...Fred Willard is absolutely hilarious, and Chris Guest should have added even more footage of Michael McKean and John Michael Higgins...they stole the movie! (Watch the deleted scenes of those guys, too.)

I recommend this crack-up movie to anyone who likes to laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Funny!","review":"Best in Show is a wonderful \\"mockumentary\\" with all the melodramatic wit you would expect from such great improvisational actors.

We're still friends, but I'll never listen to one of his reviews again--our taste must not be compatible.My wife, daughter, and I seldom agree on anything but we unanimously consider this the worst movie we've ever seen. It's the only movie I've ever turned off before the end.On the plus side, watching most of this film has given me a new perspective on cinema. I used to think I knew bad movies. Now I know that most movies are at least pretty good, and it's only a very few that are truly bad. This is one of those very few bad films.Best in Show belongs to a genre of \\"comedies\\" that I find boring at best, but often cruel and mean. Other films of this type are \\"Waiting for Guffman\\", \\"Bottle Rocket\\", etc. If you enjoy watching pathetic people struggle then perhaps you'll appreciate this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best In a Group","review":"Best in Show, like Spinal Tap and other classic comedies is filled with hilarious lines and sequences that deserve repeating among friends over a drink. Watch this movie with a group of friends and know that you have something to laugh about the next time you get together over a chai, soymilk, latte.Don't miss the deleted scenes in the DVD. Christopher Guest's genius is on display with a couple of scenes that are laugh out load funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best in Trilogy","review":"When I reviewed WAITING FOR GUFFMAN, I mentioned that I had BEST IN SHOW and THIS IS SPINAL TAP on order. And if we want to consider them some sort of trilogy, since they're \\"mockumentaries\\" with quite a bit of overlap in their casts... Now that I've seen them all, well, note the title of this review.Humor is subjective, and it's true that movie one goes \\"over the top\\" quite a bit more than WAITING FOR GUFFMAN, as another reviewer noted, it's still my favorite of the three. With GUFFMAN in a close second, I'll add.

If anyone wrote a bad review about this movie, they have to be complete idiots, and enjoy unorginal Jim Carrey humor. Some of the one star reviews on here, almost made me want to puke. What does an 11 year old boy know about REAL humor? He is still laughing at re-runs of Rugrats. Take it from me. This movie is funny as hell, and should be included in any true Comedy DVD collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funniest Film of the Year","review":"Why is this the funniest movie of the year? Because its the most realistic one of the year. In a year of comedies (Road Trip, Scary Movie, Meet the Parents) there is one that sticks out. Best in Show. A tribute (or not) to dog shows and the people involved. Based strictly on improvisation, Guest's actors take characterizing to a whole new level. Creating dialouge, expressions and actions that are so realistic and so believable, the cast comes off as amazing. (in more ways than one) The greatest part about Best in Show (as well as Guffman) is the fact that there are actually people out there like the ones portayed on film. It's avery funny film and yet very sad at the same time. Go rent or buy it today. It's an instant classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Best in Comedy!\\"","review":"Best in Show, I think, is the funniest movie of the year. If not, the best movie of the year of 2001.

I don't give it a fifth star because I think that these reviews are generally inflated. The title line is one of the throw-away gems that saturate this film (my other favorite is one of the dog owners grabbing his dog, staring into her face and shouting \\"don't look at (the other dogs), they're losers!\\"). Like \\"Waiting for Guffman\\" and \\"Spinal Tap\\" before, this movie is funny but without a mean-spirited bone in it's cinematic body. It has genuine affection for its characters, even the truly dis-likeable ones are viewed with a wry smile, not the adolescent sneer of so many other flms. Anyone who loves dogs will love this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hillarious; Great Mock-umentary","review":"This movie is hilarious. If you liked Spinal Tap, you will like this movie. If you are a dog owner, you will probably like this movie.The story is about 4 or 5 different dog owners who are competing in the biggest dog show in the country. Each of the dog owners is a caricature ... of what the writers/actors think that breed's typical owner would be like. There is a redneck, a yuppie couple, a goober, a millionaire's wife who spends all her money/time with her dog, and a gay couple. All of these people come together at the dog show and it makes for a really funny story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Funny","review":"The movie Best In Show is a classic in the mockumentary genre. It is the kind of movie that one can see over and over again and still laugh and laugh. Try not to just fall in love with the two gay guys. McKeanen and Higgins were fantastic as the couple. Of course, there played the cliches, but still they did it so wonderfully that one did not necessarily mind that they were not breaking into any new territory.O'Hara and Levy were just a perfect married couple. She as a woman who is experience in the ways of adult entertaining, and he, a two left footed goof. Ohhh not enough good things to say about them.The only \\"downer\\" character to me was Guest. I just did not particularly find him to be that enjoyable. He was much better in Waiting for Guffman.The amazing part to me about this movie is the fact that there is essentially no script. Just an outline of how the movie is to go, and the actors and actresses take it from there. How wonderful they do."},{"rating":"2","title":"A comedy classic","review":"An incredible send up of dog show culture. One of the best from Christopher Guest and Eugene Levy - and that's saying alot. This will appeal to dog owners, dog show folks and fans of SCTV and wry humor in general. The entire cast delivers at the highest level, the writing is impeccable and shines throughout. Fred Willard's performance in his supporting role is as good as it gets in a comedy. You'll love it from beginning to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the top comedies of all time (in my opinion)","review":"If you haven't seen this movie, rent or buy it now. No. Buy two or three copies. Your friends will love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic","review":"A must see if you are into purebred dogs! If not, you still will enjoy, but it's a bit dry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best In Show","review":"I have given this DVD to many people. If I could I would give it a 5+ I show my dogs and Christopher Guest in his genius way has captured the Breed Ring World of Dogs and the crazy humans participating in it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best in Show","review":"I bought this because I'm a dog lover---anything to do with dogs peaksw my interest...I've seen this in the theater---I bought this for my back-up!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a howling good time!","review":"Best in Show is based on a dog show weekend, the Mayflower Dog Show (clearly a take-off on the Westminster Show at the Garden). The humor is hip and the characters spot-on. I've been showing dogs for 30 years and (gulp) I think that I've met all of the people in this movie! Breeding and showing dogs isn't a hobby, it's a lifestyle...which some people take a little too seriously. We need to remember that there is a fine line between hobby and mental illness. The paraphrase Robert Burns, \\"Oh, to let us see ourselves as others see us!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of the Christopher Guest spoofs","review":"This is the movie that demonstrated the comedy genius of Christopher Guest to me in a new way. Not having grown up with Spinal Tap, and being only familiar with his role in \\"The Princess Bride,\\" I had no idea of the group of improv kings and queens he leads or the creative ways in which they can cause eruptive laughter. Watch it, you won't be sorry! By the way, this is also the movie that introduced me to Jane Lynch. What a great addition to the group!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and entertaining","review":"Very funny movie with an odd bunch of characters. The dogs were fun to watch as well. Cute. Worth a watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie Great Price","review":"Loved this movie and if you get the dvd you get the deleted scenes. Ah it's hilarious he talks about southern dialects in one and ah it's great. Good movie. And the price is wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good laugh","review":"This movie is awkwardly rewarding. Plenty of moments to laugh at. Great acting all around. The dogs all look good and so does Jane Lynch. Worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"best in show hits the spot","review":"I enjoyed this movie as much as any movie I have seen in recent years. It is exactly right on with the characters you would find at a show - dog, cat, horse, or beauty pageants. If you love to show and have a sense of humor, you will love this movie. If you have ever seen the Westminster Dog Show on A & E, you will love this movie. And why has no one mentioned that Fred is lampooning Joe Garagiola's commentary at the Westminster? It's hysterically outrageous and close to the bone so to speak. I can't recommend this too highly to show people. For others, I suppose that if you don't get the joke, it won't be funny, but it might be worth a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Funny Movie!!!","review":"Have loved all of Christopher Guests movies starting with Spinal Tap. The scenes with the ventriloquist puppet \\"Lil' Buddy\\" are very funny as well and too brief (there is another bonus deleted scene that can be found on the DVD). I found the website for the company that made this puppet and was fascinated ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best in Show is the Best!","review":"As a \\"dog show person\\" I wasn't sure what to expect!! Would I be offended? Would it make fun of \\"us\\"? You bet it did, and I loved every minute of it!! I saw it with another dog show friend and we were laughing more than anyone in the theater. You have to enjoy off beat humor, which we do. The funniest movie I have seen in a long, long time. The buzz in the real dog show world is that most people loved it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Two paws down","review":"My husband and I were waiting for this movie to come out in DVD, so the day it did we ran and bought it. BIG MISTAKE! I was expecting a comedy about dog shows, what I got was a mock documentary about the people who show the dogs. Watched it through to the end kept hoping there would be something good I could say about this movie, WELL, I CAN'T!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How can anyone ever like this?","review":"if I could give it zero I would to quote The Comic Book Guy from The Simpsons \\"Worst Movie Ever\\" I rented it on DVD and it had a scratch on it and when about 20 minutes in it stopped playing me and my whole family cheered"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dog-gone Boring","review":"What a waste of time and money for this boring, unfunny movie. No scene or actor tickled my funny bone in this dog of a movie. The script is flat and the actors didn't add any spark.Recommendation: Pass. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst movie i have ever seen","review":"This movie blows, all it incorporates is dry humor interviews. I was tossing and turning every agonizing minute of it until about halfway through. I couldn't stand any more and turned it off and threw away the DVD. This movie is a real loser, no music, no story, no nothing. You wait for it to get better, but it never does. If you really want to buy this movie, do yourself a favor, go buy a video camera and go out to the street corner and make interviews with people walking by, you will be thankful you did. This movie is the worst, most lowest budget, and cheapest made one I have EVER seen. How can anyone find any humor in this DUD, I see all the high reviews, but they must be from some really simple minded people, because this movie is really STUPID. Don't waste your time, money, electricity, or gasoline to see this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what you are hoping for","review":"Perhaps because I am just your average movie goer I didn't see why this movie got such high reviews. I thought it was dry, confusing, and terribly boring. I went with high hopes that it would be a great parody of dog shows and I got a \\"blair witch\\"-like attempt at a mockumentary. It was all I could do not to fall asleep. With only minor humor and a very slow plot, I am certain that only a select few of viewers could enjoy this. The movie is only supported by its cute canine actors which are also the only thing worth seeing in this show. There are far more better movies showing right now, especially comedies, that are worth your time and your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two thumps down!","review":"This movie is totally not funny!terribly lame movie.Warning:Do not rent this movie or buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"it's a shame more people don't know about this book","review":"_Dog Blue_ tells the story of a young boy, Bertie, who has always wanted a pet. Not just any pet. A dog. A blue dog.Bertie fantasizes about his imaginary blue dog to great effect in the simple but articulate illustrations. When our protagonist is confronted with a real life four-legged friend, he is faced with a choice: be disappointed in reality, reject an opportunity, or adjust his expectations. Bertie's reaction is portrayed with humor and sensitivity by Polly Dunbar.A winner for kids 2-8 years old."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trick or Treat, anyone?","review":"I read this book when I was in elementary school and liked it a lot. I recently gave my copy to one of my younger cousins. The girls in a gymnastics class want to have a Halloween party. Jodi is interested in planning the party, but Becky (who is kind of a brat) points out that Jodi is always disorganized and says that she'll never be able to pull it off. Jodi is determined to make the party a success to prove Becky wrong. When something unexpected happens at the party, Jodi finds a way to prove to both herself and the other gymnasts that she can be cool-headed and can handle herself and the situation."},{"rating":"1","title":"All talk, no music","review":"This is a CD of a Jim Carroll nightclub performance where he spews out a little poetry and tells stories in his poetic style. They are mildly interesting stories, but most are not that deep.On this CD, Carroll makes fun of performance art (even though that is what he is doing), talks a lot of about sexual issues (...) and explores the mind of a psychopathic bank robber (the only really deep bit).Most of the time Carroll talks with emotion, but there are times he sounds like he is just reading his material. There are even times he stumbles over words, like he misread them.There is probably nothing on this CD I would want to hear more than once. Carroll is a poet and sometimes rock musician. He had a wild, on the edge childhood. It is featured in the movie the Basketball Diaries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good deal","review":"Good back scratchers. Nice and long and solid.

This has the appearance of a Le Mystere, but definitely does not have the fit and comfort of a real Le Mystere product. When I opened the package I thought it didn't look as well manufactured & when I tried it on, it was uncomfortable.

Blowups of individual video stills are nice looking, but don't convey much of anything about the works. The blurbs are largely superficial. Rush's earlier book \\"New Media in Contemporary Art\\" is a much better survey of the terrain. Harrison's point about Harun Farocki also illustrates a wider point - the conceptual rubric of \\"video art\\" is incoherent and unnecessary. It was a stop-gap introduced in the 60s when this stuff was brand new, but unnecessary and no longer useful today. These are simply Artists. Full stop. They often work in installation, sometimes in film, video, photography, computational playback mechanisms (Stan Douglas)... the term \\"Video Art\\" is now simply marketing jargon."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty interesting","review":"This movie waz pretty cool,it kept me interested throughout the whole movie.It waz definitly worth wat I paid for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total failure, a disgrace!","review":"You put De Niro, Norton and Mila together as bait for the unfortunate viewer/customer who will watch this unexcusable failure of a movie, it is so bad it borders on unbeliavable.People will say this is a \\"indie\\" movie, it has a independent feel to it (maybe it is indeed an indepedent production, I don't know). But htis is no excuse for the simple fact that this movies is atrociously bad. The cast is there just to make you forget how bad it is. But guess what? They don't manage to do it.
