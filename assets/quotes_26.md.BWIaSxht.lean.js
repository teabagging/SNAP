It was a little off-putting to see all of his products listed in the recipes. Granted, it's in his interest to sell his own products, but this seemed a little over the top.

Dishes such as Aldain's Grandmother's Meat and Potato Casserole or a classic Country Captain Chicken dish are presented with the mark of Lagasse's recommendation and family experiences with the dish.

Is it possible to roll back federal and state governments to arrive at a state of affairs suggested by Mr. Murray? I did not feel like he ever answered that question for me.

This is a statement of what makes life a worthwhile endeavor and what is truly important. The book never says life is easy but a responsible life, a full life, is what we can have if we do not give over our lives to systems designed by the state for \\"our own good\\".

Hearing Murray talk about such things as government's duty to provide \\"public goods\\" and our \\"mutual obligations\\" is indeed rare among those who call themselves \\"libertarians.\\" I don't agree with all of Murray's proposals (greater federal involvement in education through universal vouchers, for example), but they are generally well-reasoned. I think this book can serve as a reality-check for those libertarians who believe in recklessly minimizing government as much as possible. Murray argues for a libertarian government on pragmatic grounds; and while his prose is not necessarily inspiring, he does offer an interesting interpretation of libertarianism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sheer juvenile pap","review":"Sorry, I don't normally write reviews like this.

The author knows how to rhetorically abuse feel-good words like \\"freedom\\", but couldn't argue his way out of a paper bag. For all I know there may be defences of libertarianism that make intelligent use of empirical evidence; there are certainly strong philosophical defenses of libertarianism, like Nozick's _Anarchy, State, Utopia_, but alas, Charles Murray's ditzy book is not one of them.

I now use it every night on both my hands and my face. I love it! And so much cheaper (and more effective) than some of the $100+ face creams out there that I have tried.

This creme has actually left permanent grease stains on one of my t-shirts, just from touching my hand to it! If you're into Burt's Bees, stick to their other lotions...this one's an oil spill waiting to happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely do not recommend this product","review":"After reading all the glowing reviews, I decided to give it a try. Frankly, I feel ripped off. First, the consistency. I can't even call this a cream. It is very thick, almost like fat that has hardened up a bit. When I spread it on my hands (a small amount as the label recommends) it didn't spread smoothly. Additionally, my hands were sticky, as if I had spread softened wax on them. The smell is not bad, but it isn't the \\"yummy\\" scent that so many people seem to be drooling over in their reviews. My skin didn't absorb any of it, even when I kept rubbing my hands together for a while, in the hopes that my body heat would \\"soften\\" the consistency. I ended up having to wash my hands with soap, and after that my hands felt itchy in some spots. The jar is going to the trash. This definitely is not what I was expecting after I had read all those fantastic reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much residue","review":"Pros: smells nice, nice texture while putting it on, leaves hands soft if you use overnight.Cons: does not absorb well into the skin, leaves a greasy residue so you can't touch anything for at least an half hour after applying itBottom line: I won't purchase this again, but I am using what I have left. It's a good product for night time treatment of dry and chapped hands (with gloves!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for overnight use","review":"I got this from Burt's \\"hand repair\\" kit. I called BB, and asked the representative whether I should get this Almond/Milk hand creme, or the hand salve for night-time use- she said it's texture/fragrance based choice. I went with the hand repair kit, which included a pair of BB gloves, hand repair creme, lemon cuticle cream, and the almond/milk creme for $8; which was practically the same price as the hand salve anyways.Personally, I wouldn't use this during the daytime. After application, my hands were super \\"greasy\\". I usually put it on along with the lemon cuticle cream, and put on the gloves BB provided in their kit and I go to bed. I wake up the next morning, and take the gloves off and my hands feel soooo soft and nice!At first, I thought the scent was a bit strong, but I got used to it.I don't think I'd ever want to try putting this on my face, but I do put it on my elbows and my kneecaps, and it helps a lot too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Hand Creme","review":"i have been using this product for couple months and i saw the improvement of my hands!i had very rough hands and i think this creme made my hands a little bit softer.the only problems is that this hand creme is very greasy. i read reviews before i bought it,but i was even greasier. after i put it on, i can't not touch anything.i can't go on the computer, and i can't text. so i use it right before i go to sleep.besides, this is a great product for people who have rough hands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible scent","review":"I don't recommend it.

Since it was discontinued, I have been trying to find a hand creme that would duplicate what I loved in Pacquins. Read about Burt's Bees and thought that I would try it. In three words -- Don't buy this! It is extremely greasy -- I was afraid to touch anything after I applied even a small amount. The fragrance is weird! When I put in on and walked into the room where my husband was sitting, he wanted to know what that weird smell was. I really wasted my money on this one. It's going into the trash. I did find a great substitute for Pacquins, however! It's Udderly Smooth Hand Cream. Yes, it was originaly made for cow's udders but it has the same consistency of Pacquins and is NOT GREASY! Works great! I got the Fragrance Free type because I was a little worried about what it would smell like but I've already reordered more and am trying it with fragrance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Severe Allergic Reaction!","review":"The creme is a bit greasy for me, but I used it on my daughters hands and elbows and she immediately broke out into a severe rash.

We thought it just hadn't been assembled properly. We assembled ours in about 15 minutes. It fell apart about as quickly. The back separated from the base causing the doors to come off their hinge pins and it was downhill from there. It goes together easily but comes apart easily as well. Today I saw one at a lodge in Lake Geneva, WI that was being held together with retro-fitted steel hardware.I've seen three. Three had fallen apart. Maybe if you treat them just right they will stay together but it doesn't look like they are suitable for their intended purpose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay if you dont have squirrels","review":"We use this storage shed to keep our garbage cans in. After 5 years I am loking for a new one. The squirrels and other little creatures have eaten away at the \\"hinges\\" and so the doors fall off if you lift the lid up.

Was concerned that it was almost 6\\" when I was trying to replace 20 year-old one we had that was only 4 1/2\\". We have no problem cleaning it as some critiques complained. Goes in dishwasher fine, However, we keep this on our boat so it is usually washed by hand and is easy when using hot soapy waters as soon as you're done using it.

I remember when he did Young Peoples' Concerts many years ago and he made classical music come alive for children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bernstein Favorites: Children's Classics","review":"Favorites for all ages, but a great introduction to the classics for children. I purchased it specifically for use with small classes of four- and five-year-olds. In addition to learning to recognize the instruments of the orchestra, the children imitate the sounds of the instruments (vocal placement), imitate the movement of the characters in Peter and the Wolf, the animals in Carnival (creative thinking and movment), and even learn musical concepts such as dynamics, tempi, and cadences. I would have rated it \\"5 star\\" if Peter and the Wolf was divided into several bands for classroom use in identifying sections and starting a various points. Delightful recording for home or classroom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bernstein Favorites","review":"I am using it with my husband at the nursing home.

His introduction to the characters in \\"Peter and the Wolf\\" via examples of the instruments and charming dialogue are legendary Bernstein.

Not only does Bernstein provide a lacklustre narration all through Peter and the Wolf but there is constant chit chat about the instruments and what you are about to hear etc; before and THROUGH most of the other pieces of music. Very annoying - I would not have bought this CD if I had known this. I just want to listen to the glorious music with my children not listen to some kid wittering on about bassoons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very readable and enjoyable piece of non-fiction","review":"Having been to a few Rainbow Gatherings in my past, Niman's book caught my interest.

People of the Rainbow describes the everyday life of a subculture that still appeals to the best and simplest emotions of human nature. It is well written and the author's and character's voices jump at you with gusto. If you looking for something different and interesting to read, buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"People of the Rainbow is spot on!","review":"As someone who traveled with the Rainbow for a little over a year in the early 1990's, this was spot on! An avid hitchhiker, I built seed camps, kitchens, helped with clean ups and a number of other things. When I went back into \\"regular society\\" I did reminisce those days and think about them often. Most everything I've read about Rainbow has been colored with personal opinions or prejudice and I was very happy to find this book. Michael Niman did an excellent job of portraying and explaining what goes on at a Rainbow gathering. If you've ever wanted to know what it was about, I highly recommend this book.

The game itself expands on the oringal, adding another faction, additional units, new campaigns and maps. The online multiplayer, lacks players, and the age group is mostly confined to young teens, as well a lack of people updating means less people to play against.

You get a brand new faction to play with while the units for the Rebellion and Empire have been tweaked. I'll admit, the vast majority are the same, but there are some puzzling changes. For example, now you can only build the Death Star II and not the Death Star. Why not both? Or, in the first game, you could use Darth Vader's TIE Squadron while you get to use his flagship, the Executor. Again, I don't see why there couldn't have been an option. The graphics are still top notch and the game still has the same core mechanics.I sound pretty negative, but these are minor quibbles in an otherwise great game. The corruption mechanic is an interesting way to play. Overall, I'd say it's worth getting if you can.

I thought it was great the beginning revenge sequence after his wife and son die in a terrorist bombing in a Paris cafe. Unlike most action heros Dennis Quaid can be both macho and sensitive.

Probably one of the best I've seen in a long time, and I don't watch TV much. Dennis Quad was great! A powerful tribute to what was going on in the Balkans. A must see! But, I only gave it four stars, because when Nastassja Kinski was killed I thought that kind of ruined the movie to some degree. That was a sad part. I would have given it five stars though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"Dennis Quaid and Natasa Ninkovic (not Nastassja Kinski!) shine in this drama that unfolds during the horrific Bosnian conflict. You need not know a thing about the background of this film to understand the message director Predrag Antonijevic and screenwriter Oliver Stone are trying to convey. War is hell and there are no winners and losers. The victims ultimately are the purely innocent. Be forewarned, this film is intense and uncompromising. Even though Dennis Quaid has that macho action hero thing going for him, don't expect a RAMBO film here. Do yourself a favor and ignore all the spoilers and just buy this film and watch it with somebody near and dear to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't pass this one by","review":"Chances are you didn't hear about this film when it was released. Due to its extremely limited theatrical release, it's essentially 'straight-to-video'. But don't make the mistake of writing it off as a B-movie. Dennis Quaid gives an award-caliber performance in this very moving war film. This is not fun to watch by any means. While never 'graphic' in a conventional way, this film has scenes of horrific violence and cruelty that are impossible to shake off. Rent or purchase the DVD edition, it includes a director's commentary track.

I recommend \\"Vukovar\\" or \\"Pretty Village Pretty Flame\\" which focus on the effects of war on ethnic harmony between Croats, Serbs and Muslims. \\"Savior\\" simply shows how one man can take his anger out on Muslims in one country because of actions taken by different Muslims in another country.

First of all, who wrote the script--if you can call it a script? The succession of painfully bad lines became unbearable to the point I felt embarrassed for Quaid and the rest of the \\"actors\\".I should really stop reviewing here, because it's just not worth it. I can't resist though by pointing to some serious ethical problems in this cliche film with an unmistakably decarbonated Christian slant. My impression was that the message went like this: let's leave criminals to the good mercy of God Almighty who will redeem them. This guy was a child murderer, and, I might add, a war criminal of the first kind. He belongs in a court room in The Hague (why was he still Rambo-ing around?). Instead he is a \\"savior\\"? Give me a break. In short, the progression of events in this \\"movie\\" was too abrupt, not elaborated and so full of irritating trite.

Hearing about the atrocities committed in Bosnia and Serbia frankly disturbed me, but seeing this movie gives you a visual of what life was really like in the Balkans. I recommend this movie to anyone interested in learning what life is like in a war with no sympathy for a fellow human being. These mass murders were a travesty for all, but it is important to understand the history of this hatred that Serbs, Croats, and Muslims had for each other in order to properly put into context these countries as they stand today, slowly trying to rebuild after such a cruel devestation of their homeland as well as their human spirit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not widescreen format even though cover says so!","review":"The movie was not in widescreen format even though the cover says so!

It's dark, hard to watch still. And it's a rare, beautiful film about a man who has lost his soul and finds it again. Savior shows a man's journey from darkness and being lost---to light and hope. He finds redemption and has a rebirth. I recommend it. Dennis Quade and all the actors are superb.

I then watched it again with directors commentary and am very disappointed with the storyline. It's like taking WW2 and saying the Germans and Jews were equally guilty or to somehow reverse the roles totally.I don't know how or why Oliver Stone would back such a film. The ethnic cleansing by the Serbs of Bosnian Muslims, Croats and Kosovars is clearly documented. Those facts aside the director has done a good job of trying to bring out a human story.Welcome to Sarajevo, No Mans land and Grbavica are much better films."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It","review":"I own several Pedrini cooking tool products. I find they are generally well-made and designed. Unfortunately, this garlic press simply doesn't measure up to the rest of the lineup. It has a solid feel and heft to it, but is flawed for a few reasons. Firstly, the clove holder is very tiny - one can only fit three cloves in at most. Secondly, the grate at the bottom of the clove holder is angled, not flat. This makes it more difficult than it should be to exert maximum pressure to crush the cloves. Lastly, the plastic attachment which can be bent back to push garlic bits out of the grate doesn't even fit properly into the grate holes, so garlic bits remain stuck in them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great history curriculum","review":"We really enjoy reading chapters from this book during lunch.

I did purchase an extra battery which was a smart move, battery life has been good, but hey you never know. I also purchased Sony's Movie Studio 7 to put my video's together and to music.

The concert itself was an amazing experience \\"Gunning Down Romance\\" was a bit melodramatic for me, and Darren went all Elvis with \\"Chained to You\\", and the best thing about the concert was at the end after they sang \\"Affirmation\\" that the audience was deluged with balloons at the concerts end.

The crisp clear sound of Klipsch is built into these speakers giving one a realistic reproduction of subtle sounds, such as a door opening or phone ringing.

I am very pleased with music reproduction when watching Dolby surround music videos and concerts. While the design may leave a little to be desired the acoustics are terrific.

Carolyn Blue is a confusing character, not complex, just confusing. She claims to be in her early 40's but her language and behavior makes her seem more a contemporary of Miss Marple. Maybe the author was trying to show a dichotomy between her prissiness and her adventerous side in solving crime? No, I think that's giving the author too much credit. Also, Carolyn is supposed to be a food editor, but she wasn't familiar with some common ingredients.If I wanted to read a history book, I'd choose one. The history lessons about El Paso and Mexico got in the way of the story. Maybe just a way to fill out a book that would have been more of a short story without the historical data?Finally, the solution of the mystery was a letdown."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious !","review":"It try to keep my review short.The crime story is average, the recipes started my mouth to water but the main plot it simply hilarious.

She's finally decided to throw in the dishtowel - and take on a dream job as food writer. Now her plate is filled with exotic locales, delectable foods, and even a dash of crime, to taste. She could very well get used to this........Carolyn Blue spices things up at a post-production opera party in ElPaso, Texas - where the company's notorious artistic director, Vladislav Gubenko, eats some bad guacamole that disagrees with him right to the death. A scorned soprano admits to maliciously mixing the dish to get back at Vlad for passing her over for her dream role. But Carolyn learns that foul play, not foul food, was the real culprit - and uncovers some unsavory secrets about Gubenko that lead to a full menu of suspects. Now, the heat is on as Carolyn tries to drop the curtain on a friend with a taste for murder................."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Renditions","review":"This is my favorite set of recorded Mozart overtures, bar none. Bruno Weil and Tafelmusik dish up period instrument performances that have bite and heft but which remain brisk and light on their feet. The same goes for Eine kleine Nachtmusik, also on this album. If you prefer a softer, fuller sound to the strings, this may not be the disc for you, but if Mozart with a bit of an edge appeals, buy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great nutcracker","review":"Haven't tried it as a lobster cracker, but it works great as a nut cracker.

This book does this great building justice, the images are crisp and vivid and the text is almost scholarly. Everytime i enter this building i get a shiver and feel the tingle of goose bumps, and am reminded of what a spectacularly beautiful building it is, and how the building seems to hold the most awesome power. The history in its halls and the majesty of its presence makes the most incredible impression, if you are not moved by this building then frankly you need to check your pulse.

We were skeptical but followed the directions and carefully, thoroughly pressed the cap to the water-filled base closed. Within five minutes of normal play the cap popped off and a half gallon of water gushed out onto our family room carpet. It also does not stand up if not filled with water.

I would return it except I used it, So i guess I am stuck with it. I have fresh herbs that I grow in my garden. The first thing I attempted to mince is mint. Instead of cutting, it bruised the the mint leaves mushing them into each-other. \\"Ok so it can't cut mint. Maybe that is because mint is a soft herb. Let's try basil,\\" I thought. But I was wrong Basil was just as horrid. I bought it because it cost less than the OXO version, but I ended up buying the OXO version anyway, since OXO works. I wasted money on this piece of junk, when I could have just spent a few extra dollars on the OXO instead.

The power light goes off and it stops responding. You have to unplug it and then plug it back it. It's ridiculous.

The author's style and content is extremely convoluted. The book starts out full-speed with very detailed technical specifications of XML and hardly any explanation of the fundamentals of this new and exciting language.Not surprisingly, the reader is lost after studying just a few chapters because the succinct specifications are extremely hard to follow and the examples are not illustrative of the point that the authors are trying to make.In conclusion, the authors completely miss the mark by failing to provide a clear and easy to comprehend format for beginners of XML. Maybe, this book is helpful to those who already have a fair amount of understanding of XML."},{"rating":"1","title":"it's not a good book for me.","review":"When I bought this book, I really hoped I could learn something quickly.

All of the fancy formatting, shaded boxes and indexed figures cannot hide the Content which is a dreadfully thought out mix of unnecessarily technical specs with inane, pointless waffle.The book promises (gaurantees) to give you quick answers but after 4 hours of browsing, I had learned nothing I hadn't learned from 10 minutes of online tutorials, if anything I was more confused than when I opened the book.I am a professional developer and have read many technical books, this is one of the worst I have read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time browsing!","review":"I bought the book and (since I started highlighting it) I have promptly called IDG Books for a FULL REFUND.The examples are full of errors. Most can not be entered as they are published, since they are missing elements ('root elements' in most of them). It looks like the authors copied the W3C's recommendation on half the pages and tried to write some code and words for the other pages.The book never even tells the reader to use a text editor to \\"program\\" XML/XSL. It is left up to the reader to figure out how this XML works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing format","review":"I was hoping to pick up a book that would serve as a complete \\"do it yourself\\" manual. The format is a jumble of ideas thrown together which makes the book hard to follow.

I haven't seen a more inept piece of instructional writing in my life.To see how an educational book should be written, I strongly recommend _XML by Example_, 2nd Edition (ISBN: 0789725045). It's not a breeze but uses some common sense.As for the fellow who is so presumptuous to assume that all 14 negative reviewers just \\"breezed through it like a harlequin romance,\\", I'll give him the benefit of the doubt. I'll assume either he's a.) mistaking this for another, similarly titled book, or b.) from another planet.

During my educational career, and my career in IT (which has spanned over 10 years), I have read many technical manuals and \\"how-to\\" guides. This book tries to be both, but does not accomplish either. The examples are full of syntactical and typographical errors and are very often incomplete. One of the key methods for learning is by doing, which you cannot when the examples provided are wrong to begin with.The inclusion of the XML specification is not a bad thing. It helps to know the background behind the syntax. The problem is that this book presents the specification with the instruction as an afterthought, making learning through this guide all but impossible. I purchased the B&N; technical series book on XML and walked away with a better understanding of the basics of the language. Even then this book proved to be impossible to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perfectly Unstructured Writing","review":"I bought this book a while ago and thought that I would read it at leisure but the way the authors dive into topics without presenting a rational explanation is simply absurd. Even the contrast between XML and HTML on page 6 is wonderfully blurry. The book appears structured but revels in throwing coding examples at you without a premise. I know and practice both XHTML and CSS but this book made XML seem like rocket science, which it is not. Please do not buy this book and waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away, grave errors!","review":"I discovered some grave errors that teach you wrong things. For example in the chapter about \\"Determining the Order of Elements\\" the authors describe an example for [49] choice which is against the XML 1.0 spec.

That said, he's surprisingly serious (in the singer/songwriter mold of Billy Joel and Elton John) on the early tracks such as \\"Honest Queen\\" and the shiveringly bracing \\"Tenterfield Saddler\\" (an ode to his grandfather). When disco came in circa 1976, Allen's style changed dramatically, though he never stopped writing quality music in this idiom--and he never lost his nakedly romantic soul. This Best Of CD is addictive and wonderful to hear! One wants it to go on & on--like Allen's non-stop energy--but all good things have to end.

But Avant Garde, with two songs featured here (including the hard-to-find \\"Pop It\\"), became the first hit band on the label. Other standouts include Perpetuum Mobile, Xhile, and Third Door Left. Most of the lyrics are pretty cheesy (typical of Swedes singing in English: \\"It's time for me to set fire to my sorrows\\"), but the music is pure analogue synth fun in the Vince Clarke mode.This album is long out of print; if you can't find it used through Amazon, try Electronic Obsession (http://www.electronic-obsession.se)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dry, uneventful","review":"Absolutely not a sci-fi story unless you want to include the science of publishing books. Characters totally lack dimension and are uninteresting in the first 80% of the book. By the time they take on character, you really don't care what happens to them.

I was very scared and sceptical when finding out that Dez had started a new band, but overjoyed when I heard them. Their sound is brutally hard, fast, and angry. I was blessed with the chance to hang out with Dez after an amazing show recently, and he seemed a lot happier and at peace that he did with Coal Chamber. Now, don't get me wrong, I hope CC doesn't break up, but I am a full supporter of Devildriver, and I hope they gain their much deserved success.

The book builds on an article he wrote back in the beginning of the '80s and does a much better job than the article! The algorithm presented does guarantee to find the global minimum (minima). It does not spend long time searching between thousands of other stationary points. It seems that the future of optimisation might depend heavily on interval arithmetics.

What Collins has accomplished beyond his careful organization of this material, is to capture many of the important nuances found in Wesley's scriptural-based theology. Although deep and profound, this text is composed in such a way as to not only instruct, but also to engage the reader. Wesley's theological convictions are presented in a clear and crisp style to which the student cannot help but become involved, both spiritually and intellectually.

The beginning scream of Smooth Up should have been re-done. I don't know who let it go to press like that but the rest of the song is perfect. The sound quality of the songs from the first couple of albums far surpass the quality of the originals. Marq's voice is still as powerful and clear as when the original songs were recorded. He obviously doesn't sing like that anymore and I love the way his voice has evolved but when re-recording the original songs, he sang them like he did originally.

Myles Berkowitz is truly obnoxious and the only feelings this movie inspired were ones of sympathy for the women who suffer his company. The constant whining about the paltry $60,000 budget and the difficulties of breaking into Hollywood really start to irritate. It's enough of an injustice that someone invested more than $600 in Berkowitz's project. Successful independent films are inventive with artistic merit, but this is no more than self-conscious bitching and moaning by a Hollywood reject. Here's a good rule: low-budget films by Hollywood wannabes make for terrible viewing. Berkowitz seems to fancy himself a Woody Allenesque personality, but he's neither witty, humorous, articulate or intelligent. I'm surprised he has any friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious & Sad","review":"I caught this movie on cable, and while the premise seemed interesting I found myself disliking the Myles, more and more with each scene. He was/is absolutely the most repugnant, self-centered man I have ever had the displeasure of viewing. He was boring, hideously dressed (wearing a plaid shirt and dorky jeans in L.A??? to supposedly meet the woma of his dreams).What really galled me was the fact that crashed a wedding, lied to a woman stating he was a friend of the groom (she was the grooms sister) and then whining that when she found out he didn't even know the groom, she declined to take his calls...well duh!

Instead we are forced to hear Myles spew on about his notions of Hollywood romance. What would have made a better movie was to try and explain how a women like Elizabeth would ever go out with someone as myopic as Myles, then maybe some men would have actually learned something about women A.K.A. love. I gave it 2 stars because the producer lines while probably scripted made me laugh, and I actually made it to the end of the film.

Above that I think it really addresses some of the real issues between men and women. The film also shows how hard it is to make a movie in hollywood and still stay true to your art or concept. The movie also has the interesting side effect of being somewhat romantic.

There was nothing high tech or hollywood about it. I have to give Berkowitz credit for having the guts to turn his ideas into a movie. I'm pretty sure this movie was staged, because if a producer is already that mean in the movie, there's no way he would let a movie be sold that might ruin his reputation. The movie was kind of slow. Only toward the ending does it becomes interesting when you don't know whether Berkowitz will end up with his girlfriend or not. It is funny to see Berkowitz makes a fool out of himself on camera.

What's most pathetic is that he desperately wants to be Woody Allen, but has none of the wit or likeability.

It is a photoshopped image. The fact that you can see \\"between\\" the model's left eye and the mask (suggesting that the mask is that much larger than the face) is just an absolute lie.

I have to admit, I read only the first 50 pages or so, then skimmed it to see how it ended. Predictably. I love Ms. Rowland's attention to detail and portrayal of life in 17th century Japan, but I have problems accepting characters acting totally out of the cultural norm of the times.

Research showed that bad copies are frequent. Hoping that I wouldn't get the bad copy I went ahead and purchased it because I wanted a prime that would be roughly 50mm on my Canon 7d's crop sensor.Boy did I make the wrong choice because I got a bad copy. My kit lens is better/easier to focus. The focus ring was stiff and had play. Focusing with this lens is like painting with cerebral palsy.I am returning this lens and just purchased he Canon 35mm 1.4 L. Its way more expensive but I know that I will never have an issue with this superior lens.If you do buy the sigma 30mm lens make sure you do autofocusing tests to see if you were one of the unlucky many to receive a defective lens.

The canon is sharper and the colors are much more vibrant. The bokeh produced by the canon lens looks better to me. Again, since it's a different length it can't be used in the same places as the sigma.Overall it's a nice and humble lens that helps you make the shot instead of missing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What could have been","review":"I had very high hopes for this lens. And, out of the box, beatifully constructed. Unfortunately, it front focuses repeatedly. This is a known problem with some sigma 35/camera combo's.

If they were unable to calibrate it, I could not return it. Not a risk I wanted to take.I really wanted this lens to work-but it had to go back. If you get a good copy, great. Still, I expect it to work as advertised out of the box. (I had the opposite experience with a Tokina 11-16. There are also some bad copies, apparently, floating around. But mine is excellent. Sharp focus and corners quite sharp wide open.)Since Amazon has a solid return policy, you can order one. If it works well for your body, great. If not, it's only a minor inconvenience to return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"I have tried several lenses on my rebel xt and all though I love my 50 1.4 for single portraits, this lens is amazing.

I own the lens for six months or so, and I am sorry to say - don't like it.Perhaps I received a defective lens, but I keep getting poorly focused photos out of my Nikon D70 with this lens.I must say this was a big surprise for me, build and materials are high quality, it has a nice feeling all over, I owned another Sigma lens (which I really liked - see later) but these focus issues just made me leave the lens at home. I have a moderate collection of other Nikon compatible lenses, all but two are Nikon, the two others are Sigma lenses - this one and a 10-20mm DX zoom (which I love).I also have a Nikon 35mm f/2 lens, which I had for three years or so before I purchased the Sigma 30mm f/1.4, I thought the somewhat wider angle, significantly wider apperture, and HSM AF would be great - they look great on paper, but...

It has good build quality, is fast, comes with a lens hood and case, has a 4 year warranty, has HSM which I believe is similar to Canon's USM and makes for quiet, fast focusing, and is a great focal length (equivalent to 50 mm) for my Canon 30D. I was planning to use it for indoor shots without a flash. HOWEVER, it really does have problems getting the subject in focus. This does not seem to be just a function of the narrow depth-of field. The Canon 50 mm 1.4 (A GREAT lens, by the way) doesn't have this problem at f/1.4. I'm going to try the Canon 28 mm f/1.8."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Low Light Lens for D40","review":"If you own a Nikon D40/x and need a good AF-S low light lens under f/2, this is your only option (Nikon hasn't made a <f/2 lens for the D40/x yet). I've been using the lens for a while now in all different types of situations - it's great for indoor or low light situations, but don't try to get too close to the subject (under 3 feet) as the focus won't be sharp enough. The body is heavy and doesn't feel cheap. I like it so far and am happy with the purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"another front focussing copy...","review":"I tested it and it was front focussing quite badly.

Altamente recomendable, tiene una construcción sólida, incluye el hood y sus prestaciones son impecables. No creo que te arrepientas si elegís este producto que enorgullece a la gente de Sigma."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great lens at an amazing price","review":"Bought this lens last week at amazon for (IMO) an amazing price of $289.It's a great lens for cropped bodies (like my T2i) and an amazing value for the build quality and f1.4 with HSM. The first thing I did was to test for front focusing issues that has been the biggest complaint so far about this lens and am very happy to learn that the copy I got didn't have any of those issues.The lens itself is considerably heavier than the 50mm 1.8 canon lens I have (which must be the lightest and cheapest build wise) and the autofocus was noticeably faster and quieter, but not as quiet as other canon HSM lens (L included) that I tried. The picture quality is amazing and is quite a bit sharper than canon 50mm 1.8 even at 1.4f and I am comparing the canon's 2.0f and higher.Came with the petal shaped lens hood and a zippered carrying case and some leaflets of printed material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seems to have focus issues on my 40D.","review":"I used this lens on my XTi with good results. After upgrading to a 40D, many of my shots were not focused properly. I thought it was the camera but it (apparently) was not. The lens is great from f4 to f16. But from f1.4 to f2.8 the images were not sharp. This was with careful testing using tripod, focus charts, remote shutter release, etc. It's not my failure to understand depth of field. I returned the lens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unusual but fantastic lens","review":"I have the Sigma HSM version of this lens, using it on a Nikon D40x. The Sigma 30mm f1.4 lens is not easy to use, but that is down to the unique characteristics of an extreme wide aperture lens - the user needs to understand photography technique well to get the most out of this type of lens.Once that is done, i.e. you know what you are doing, the lens is fun to use. Great capabilities in low light and takes great pics wide open. Is fine in daylight, but that isnt what you get it for really. The build quality is rock solid and it comes with a nice lens bag too. HSM works very smoothly and quietlyA highly recommended purchase. The Sigma 30mm f1.4 isnt going to be the only lens you use or your main lens, but will be a valued and cherished friend nonetheless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stunningly poor quality control","review":"I purchased 3 copies of this lens from Amazon and not a single one focused properly. I did extensive testing of all 3 versions and all exhibited some amount of backfocusing. I tested the lenses with a focus chart using the center focus point. I also tested them in real-world situations. In all cases the lens failed to focus where I intended.I know that good copies of this lens exist, but I don't know how many more hoops I can jump through to try and get one."},{"rating":"1","title":"So much potential; so little QC","review":"I tried four copies; three were bad, one was awful. This lens has been very favorably reviewed, and I find their 50 f1.4 to be magnificent, so I took a chance. The only thing I can think, based on what I saw in the files, is that in each case, one or more of the elements was out of alignment, because they didn't produce a normally focused image at any focus distance. Something 10 feet away on one side would be in focus, and something fifty feet away on the other side would be. Very strange."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good For Video","review":"The picture quality is amazing, very vibrant and crystal clear. Going to 1.4 is a huge plus for video in low light... however, only buy this if you plan to buy a new one every 3 months. Since for video we can't rely on autofocus and have to manually, constantly, be sliding the focus ring around, it breaks. The focus ring now slips constantly as I try to pul focus, which means if you're shooting something important like a wedding where you only have ONE chance to get the shot, this poorly made focus ring can kill your shot if it decides to slip on you.Buyer beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceeded My Expectations","review":"I am so very happy with this lens I couldn't help but give it 5 stars. I am a hobbyist, but I shoot a whole lot of pictures. I was expecting this lens to be a little hard to focus after reading some of the reviews, but I was wrong. I have taken some of the sharpest pictures I have ever taken with this lens. I have found my sweet spot on the aperture to be at f.8. The pictures are so sharp at that setting. With the aperture at f.1.4 the bokeh is wonderful. I have found that 30MM is a good all around focal length for a prime lens. If anything ever happens to this lens I will surely grieve until I can replace it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Focus Issues, Overpriced","review":"I bought this lens for my D40 (for $375), but ended up returning it. At the time, it was the only auto focusing 30mm prime available for the D40.Upon receiving the lens, I shot with it for a week but kept noticing my focus wasn't quite right. This was much more noticeable in some shots than others. In addition, the lens added a yellow cast to my images.After doing some research, it turns out the Sigma 30mm f1.4 is known to have both focus and cast issues. After doing more extensive tests with a focus chart, it was very apparent my lens was backfocusing about .3-.5\\". Not good. I could have sent it to Sigma to re-calibration, but for that much money, no thanks. In fact, I'll be very cautious of every buying a non-Nikon branded lens again.Luckily, Nikon announced it will be selling it's own 35mm f1.8 at the beginning of March 2009. Oh, and what's even better? It's going to be priced at $199 US. Initial reviews have been very good. I've already pre-ordered mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grinding when focusing & front focusing problems on Canon body","review":"I've gone through three copies of this lens for my Canon 7D body. They were all defective on arrival. The first one had a very nasty grinding when turning the focus ring. Not only was it audible, but also it vibrated the camera somewhat. It was occurred more frequently when pointed down. I didn't bother testing it any further. The second and third copies shared the grinding problem to a lesser degree, but also was front-focusing by about 4mm.Other than these very apparent issues, the lens itself delivers very creamy bokeh and it is pretty sharp in the center when shot open. I just wish it worked as a $500 lens should work. These are just the risks you have to take when buying a third party lens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excelente Lente","review":"Estoy muy contento con el desempeño de este lente, lo utilizo para video con la canon 60D y es perefecto para bajas condiciones de luz, lo recomiendo ampliamente"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this Lens!","review":"This is my first Sigma lens and I was a bit nervous when ordered it. But I was pleasantly surprised with the build quality and sharpness of this lens. I experienced no AF problems. This lens AF as good as any of my Canon lens. It is very usable at f1.4 and becomes extremely sharp if you step it down a couple of steps. The 30mm works extremely well on a crop frame body especially indoors where there is simply not enough room to step back to fit everything in. Oh yeah, I love the fact that it comes with a matching finish hood!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Place all ingredients in a blender and process until smooth.","review":"This is a no-frills idea book.

Mr. Adamshas taken the latter course, and it's no wonder he earned the 2003 Pulitzer prize for this work, largely one of contemplativereflection on that tragic day, interspersed with a bit of Sibelian andIvesian orchestral color. Adams uses collage techniques to great effectin the piece, interweaving the street noises with the readings of victims'names, punctuated by NYPO principal trumpeter Philip Smiths' mournful,questing solo. The real highlight comes when the orchestra and choruseserupt in a Finlandia-meets-Dies Irae moment at the words \\"Light!

Adam's Transmigration comes not even close to those masterpieces. Having heard this piece several times, I can honestly say that its content completely fails to do justice to its chosen subject matter. No catharsis, no peroration, no truly felt sense of loss, just gimmicky mixed media techniques. It just fails to rise to the occasion of such horrible loss.

I thank the Lord for giving Charles Spurgeon such a deep and joyful faith in Him. What a gift of being able to simply express and teach the deep truths of Scripture he had! It is a blessing for me to read each morning's devotional along with my Bible and have a sweet time of worship with the Lord. The evening messages are a wonderful way to close out the day and help me reflect on God's faithfulness. I have bought copies for my daughters, and plan to buy others for friends. I can't praise this book enough! It is indeed faith-building and life changing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Morning and Evening","review":"Every Christian should have a copy of this devotional and read it daily.

Madden clearly loves the game of football, and his exuberance is evident throughout this book. His stories and anecdotes from both his coaching and broadcasting days are both hilarious and insightful. My own favorite part of this book were his reminisces of his days with the Raiders, when he coached that team to their first Superbowl victory. He really makes you feel like you were there!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Madden's first book: Winner","review":"Hey! Wait a minute! This is a really good book. It gets into the heart and mind of one of the NFL's all-time best head coaches and TV color commentators. I first read Hey Wait A Minute in the early 2000s, so found, in a few instances, some of his comments a bit dated (the book, after all, was published in 1984.) 99% of Madden's observations about football and life in general remain valid and interesting. Tales of his playing days, college and Oakland Raiders coaching experiences and early CBS broadcasting career with Pat Summerall make for a lively and well told story. Recommended without reservation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hey, wait a minute, I wrote a book","review":"This book was about John Madden life when he was a coach. It talks about how after ten years of coach the Oakland Raiders. The book also talks about when he was playing football in high school and college and also when he got darfted to the NFL but during summer camp he tore his ACL and could not play football. It talks about how he started broadcasting for CBS. So throuhgout the book it talks his live and the thing he went through to get to where he was and where he is today."},{"rating":"1","title":"It sux","review":"This book sucks, HARD.

Ask my husband. I want a perfectly sliced piece ... not too thick, but certainly a little thicker than a piece of cellophane. Which, unfortunately, is what this slicer gives. It promises thin slices, but instead gives you rice-paper thin bits that manage to get through the blade opening.

Even for med-soft cheeses like cheddar or jack. It bends back on itself as you press down & slice, your slices come out uneven and even a knife is easier.

The story was original, the writting was witty without being overly verbose and the characters were interesting. The author obviously knows Manhattan intimately as many of the locations were recogniziable. Her descriptions of the mansion interiors are done in great detail, one can almost feel the dampness of the wine cellar. I look forward to the next work from Ms. McDonald."},{"rating":"2","title":"Obessions","review":"For those who love Anne Rice, P.S. McDonald has created a compelling story mixing elements of the supernatural with sharp observations on human nature. Ms. McDonald's beautiful, young protagonist, Charlotte (Charley) Alden, is pitted against the seductive power of Marowe Marrennt who is not what he appears to be. She is drawn into an obsessive love that threatens to destroy her. Set in New York, the story takes place in Charley's elegant brownstone and in Marowe's Gothic mansion somewhere on the west side of Manhattan. Marowe's mansion provides a meeting place for members of the strange race of Roanes who crave his rare wines. This is a page turner that you just can't put down. This is an excellent vacation read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced garbage.","review":"The top pops off. The metal is warped and thin.

Not a very satisfying ending makes me think this is probably based on a true story. A grand story by a great story teller, with human drama and difficult choices."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most disappointed","review":"I don't know if I'll be able to finish this book because the author so completely and transparently dislikes Carl Sagan.

The author's account of current history is completely distorted by his narrow and limited viewpoint.

I'll stay with Doris Kearns Goodwin."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mean perspective","review":"Very bad, indeed!

That is all you can expect. /[...]Failing to attain your compass,[...]they will endeavour to anatomize your morals,/To find blemishes and mischiefs, petty scandals, petty quarrels,/ All of which will surely draw you nearer to them. Not the light/ You have to the world imparted, but your sins, your guilt, your spite,/ Tiredness, ill-health, or weakness, anything that is unworth/ And is fatally inherent in a mortal lump of earth./ All the pretty smarts and worries of a much tormented mind/ Will atract them more than any plans you have ever designed[...]' (from 'First Epistle', by Mihai Eminescu(1850-1889), translated by L.Levitchi)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overdoes it","review":"I think it was a forgone conclusion (to gain top marks) in our Journalism studies to gain the reputation of an honest and unswayed critic by finding things to criticize on ALL counts whether the criticism was fair or not.

What surprises me are those reviews who refer to this book as a hatchet job. Really? I always liked Sagan from his tv appearances, Contact ( book and movie )and Cosmos (especially Cosmos) and after reading this book I can say I like him even more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oversimplification of a complex personality","review":"I was extremely disappointed in this book. It reminded me of a high school term paper how it continuously reflected back on the New York's World Fair and \\"Pete can Fix It\\" analogies for being the primary contributors to Sagan's personality. The author both applauds and criticizes Sagan for being a creative thinker. The criticism is for not being educated enough in some fields that he wrote about in his \\"popular\\" books. The author claims to be a fan of Carl Sagan but I don't totally believe that after reading this book. Unfortunately, I don't feel the author has enough depth in his personality to write a quality biography. This came off as superficial and an oversimplification, to which I am very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Sagan-Haters Only","review":"This \\"biography\\" is one, long malicious attack upon Carl Sagan.Keay Davidson obviously detests Sagan - so much so that I don't know why he would wrire a book about someone he hates so much.Only someone who hates Sagan could enjoy this book - but anyone who hates Sagan wouldn't be buying/reading a biography about him anyway.This book has no real audience. I would rate it ZERO stars if I were able.If you like anything Carl did, please look elsewhere for a biography and do not waste a penny or a second on this unfathomably putrid piece of attack-journalism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carl Sagan: A Character Assassination","review":"Just pure crap. The author tries to persuade you (using a college freshman's understanding of psychology and philosophy) that Carl Sagan was an egomaniacal tyrant who only knew how to use people because he wanted to impress his demanding mother.Skip this and read the better written and balanced biography by a real science writer, William Poundstone, who knows how to research and didn't just rely on the opinions of Carl Sagan's rivals and ex-wifes to paint a more complete picture of a great scientist and humanist.The definite biography on Carl Sagan:Carl Sagan: A Life in the Cosmos by William Poundstone"},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO MUCH ABOUT THE SCIENCE AND NOT ENOUGH ABOUT THE MAN","review":"This book attempts to tell the story of Carl Sagan but all too often gets distracted by the science. Long complicated passages (too complicated for some amatuers) go into the science and detracts from the proposed main theme of the book, Carl Sagan. The book also is very disjointed, the author in his narraritve will skip years, even decades, in a single paragraph. And there is little insight into Sagan himself and no details on his major achievment, \\"Cosmos.\\" This is a long,boring disapointing book about a fascinating man, all the more the pity. Save your money and go rent Cosmos or read one of Sagan's book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good book to read","review":"The chapters on Sagan's early years of Ok, but the author digresses too much and the end result is the flow of the chapters is choppy and sometimes hard to follow. Outside of this minor inconvenience the rest of the book is a joy to read, especially for diehard Sagan fans like me. The author does a good job in paintng a picture of Sagan( warts and all) that makes the reader have a better understanding of his subject. The chapters on Contact and Cosmos were the best and the insights into Sagan's character make the book an excellent buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"This down-to-earth Sagan is more appealing","review":"As a younger planetary scientist, I was greatly edified by this account of Carl's life. Its weaving of human life stories with scientific milestones was a great corrective to the distorted picture of intellectual progress one gets from just reading peer-reviewed literature and hearing talks at conferences! To wit, I remember Sagan's late close colleague, Jim Pollack, from his sagacious presence at meetings that I attended as a grad student. It took Davidson's account, however, for me to know the human side of this man! Sagan's humanity also emerges here, via recorded memories of wives, kids, and colleagues. Together, these accounts paint a portrait that is more appealing for being less sycophantic. I was energized by this book to live life with greater zeal, as a scientist *and* as a person!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please compare this book with Poundstone's before buying.","review":"With two Sagan biographies out this year, I recommend looking them both over carefully before buying one. Of course, you can always read both. Since you are reading this, may I suggest you click over to the reviews of the Poundstone book, particularly that submitted by Nathan Cohen? I agree with it, although my information is of a much poorer quality. Perhaps neither of these books entirely succeeds in setting Sagan in context, or explaining his importance in the intellectual life of the late 20th century. Sagan was, inter alia, a one man refutation of Snow's thesis of the two cultures, and perhaps the true heir of Vannevar Bush's American optimism about the endless frontier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Given the choice, try William Poundstone's book instead.","review":"Being a fan of biographies in general and Carl Sagan in particular, I have to say that this book was extremely disappointing. Davidson apparently felt that he was obligated to insert as many negative comments about Sagan as possible in the guise of presenting a balanced view of the man. Is it surprising that Sagan's ex-wife, Lynn Margulis, had almost nothing nice to say about him? Given that Davidson quotes her extensively throughout the book, one is led to believe that her statements are facts rather than opinions - or, more precisely, accusations. Davidson, while acknowledging Sagan's talents and intellectual achievements, also implies repeatedly that Sagan was egotistical, self-centered and self-serving in virtually everything he did. I doubt that anyone who has read Sagan's books would agree. My advice to those who want to read a biography about Sagan is to try Poundstone's book. I haven't read it yet, but it can't be worse than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed as I did not pull a Jeter","review":"Let's face it, if you are buying a box of 1993 Score Select to bust, you are seeking a Derek Jeter rookie card. The 1993 Score Select Jeter is one of his more affordable rookie cards at $12 per card, which suggests that the card should be an easy pull. I opened one box of this stuff recently and found ZERO Derek Jeter rookie cards. The box was factory sealed so I know it was not searched / tampered with. Instead of Jeter, I got roughly three or four Michael Tucker rookies - Oh Joy! Given my underwhelming box busting experience, I say caveat emptor to those looking to bust a box of this stuff. These boxes sell well over $35 in most instances, luckily I paid around $25 including shipping, so the box is not likely to pay for itself. Bottom line is that I would call this a high risk / low reward box busting opportunity.

I would called this hip-house if any. From 'Number One' to 'Medicine Man' to my favorite track 'Hideaway' this CD does not get any better.I have to agree with the first reviewer that there is a PRINCE-ISH to most of the songs, but, if he was making this good music now in days, the story will be other., in fact...

Intonation is superb, and articulation is wonderful--highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS CD!","review":"I will admit that both Wynton Marsalis and Kathleen Battle are great musicians, but baroque music is not their forte. If you want to hear this music performed beautifully and in a baroque style (and on period instruments!), buy the Art of the Baroque Trumpet vol. 3 with Niklas Eklund and Susanna Ryden. All of the best pieces from this CD are on that one as well, Handel's Eternal Source and Let the Bright Seraphim, Scarlatti's Su le Sponde del Tebro and Arie con Tromba Solo, Stradella's Il Barcheggio, and Perderi's Pace una Volta. Eklund plays on a baroque trumpet with 8 feet of tubing. His is richer and more beautiful than anything that can be produced on a modern piccolo trumpet (only two feet long), and Susanna Ryden's smooth pure voice accompanies it perfectly. There is very good musicianship on this CD, but it does not fit the style of the music at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Battle and Marsalis Shine","review":"During the 90'S Kathleen Battle did CD after CD with a famous instrumentalist. Some of these CD's were ill fated, like her Bach Album. Thankfully, this outstanding baroque performance rose above those others. She and Marsalis clearly have a chemistry. Battle has incredibly coloratura flexibility and for once shows fabulous breath control throughout the pieces. The material doesnt overwhelm her as sometimes happened. She has all the opportunity to show off her shining high notes and pure tone. More importantly the pieces dont all sound the same, the diverse composers and selections vary between dazzling and slow and tender.

Too bad I just couldn't. When the author refers to quotes from her own books as \\"(a character) entering something into the canon,\\" you know something's not right. Though the book is helpful in compiling most of the instances of magic in the books so far, the overuse of quotes and the dull writing make this a chore to work through.

The sound is totally flat and lifeless, nothing at all like the electrifying live shows I've seen. The CD has exactly the same mix, too.

If the intension was to bring to light an album just like Oh Mercy, Dylan would have hired Daniel Lanois amd say \\"let's make Oh Mercy 2\\", but that was never the intension.The album has great songs, such as Born in Time, which is a left over of Oh Mercy, and the title song Under the Red Sky has got George Harrison's always competent guitar working. Some songs are weightlight, such as Wiggle Wiggle, and having Slash from the former great Gun'n'Roses really doesn't add much.The album itself, heard today, is very similar to Love and Theft in its sonority and themes.

Once again, Dylan asks you to go back and reconceptualize who he his and who you are.

Despite guest appearances by the likes of Elton John and George Harrison, this album never gets off the ground. The songwriting is the worst of Dylan's long and fabled career. (The single was called \\"Wiggle Wiggle,\\" for God's sake!) Consistently lackluster performances fail to inject any energy into what is worse-than-mediocre material to begin with. In my opinion, there are only two reasons to actually own this horrendous album: either because you are a fanatical Dylan completist (I am), or because you're morbidly curious to see just how far a great singer/songwriter can fall in an off-year. Dylan promises that the much-anticipated second volume of his memoir, \\"Chronicles,\\" will deal in part with the sessions at which this travesty was recorded.

I hate the Battlefield series. 0 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst game","review":"This game was a let down. At first it was kinda cool, because of the characters I remembered as a child. But after 30 minutes that wore off, and it wasn't even close to BF1942. They did nothing to expand on the gameplay.The weapons have no feel of power, just blah... I didn't have high hopes, I was expecting a game to be at least as good as BF1942 or Call of Duty, but it didn't come close."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Kid's BF1942","review":"This game is kind of confusing to me. In some ways it appears to be a very dumbed down bf1942 with a Star Wars'y thing going on.But at the same time, some of the complexity of the character classes adds an element that is more tactical than bf1942. (The pilot class for instance)The multiplayer browser absolutely sucks.The graphics....if your playing on the PC, it's obvious this is a console port.I played it pretty hard for about a week or two, and then went back to BF vietnam.If you have the $40 to spare for a cheap thrill for a week or so, I say go for it. However, if your gaming budget is tight, I recommend the UT2004's, or the Battlefield series over this. They offer much more replayablility, and have massive mod support, which I doubt this game will ever have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow..would be fun if amazon ever shipped me the game.","review":"Hmm ordered it a week ago and they (AMAZON) still haven't shipped it... Hopefully the reason is that they are going to send me a version that works..read online many of the cds are bad... anyhow..if the game is anything like 1942 i'll be happy..however hearing it locks to 20fps on online sounds scary.. oh well... maybe by xmas this will finally ship!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hello","review":"Readers should be aware, the game hasn't come out and already its getting 5 stars. They will probly slap a $15-20 dollar monthly charge. Wait till the game comes out then trust reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"As said several times before, this game is weak. The ONLY thing going for it is the Star Wars theme. There's no real strategy and the classes are poorly balanced. What's more, the air vehicles have a terrible control interface. For real multiplayer FPS action, go with UTK2004. It has a ton of game types, much better graphics, much better mfr support and a huge fan base and community support. Get UTK2004 and the Star Wars mod from fileplanet.Furthermore, the installer is buggy (documented on their web site). This product clearly missed the quality assurance cycle.Star Wars Battelfront blows and I'm sorry I paid the $$ for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beta at best","review":"This looks to be a cool game. Unfortunately, the release was so dependant in corresponding with the DVD trilogy release that Lucas Arts has released a Beta version of a game. The game plays okay, but the controls are bad compared to BF1942 or BFV.Even worse, the consoles are weak at best. The multiplayer consoles are the weakest since the original Doom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun , but new one is better","review":"This game is awesome and it logged sevearl of my hours until the new one released. It reminds me of BF1942 but in a star-warsy kinda way. If your system can handle the Battlefront II then go grab it, but if not, this one is plenty of fun too, just the computers AI is not all that great in single player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simplistic","review":"I hadn't played any of the Battlefield games so I didn't know what to expect.What I found is pretty simplistic. The game just doesn't have the tactical options and complexity of Tribes 2 or Joint Ops.Its a pretty game to look at, and its fun to play in the Star Wars Universe but it seems like a game for nintendo players compared to the team shooters I'm used to playing.The multiplayer interface and chat systems are just plain painful. This game was obviously designed for console and thrown at the PC market incomplete."},{"rating":"2","title":"omg i pwnz joO!","review":"This is one of the tighest games ive played in years, it also have practically no learning curve. in only my 3rd game ever i had 30 kills and 7 deaths. anyone can get good at this game.there are two teams, and you can be on the empire or rebels. each team has 5 different classes of soldiers. the empire team even gets the ever so infamous darktrooper from the expanded universe series. must buy! go get it now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-rated","review":"This is a pure melee game. It's unco-ordinated, plotless and the movements/controls are out of date compared to other FPS's. If you're looking for all out shooting, without much teamplay or strategy then try Unreal Tournament.For those looking for a Battlefield 1942/Vietnam type game set in the Star Wars Universe, get set to be dissapointed.Just not very playable or much fun at all once you've seen all the maps and the characters.Get it used!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Star Wars Battlefront a hit","review":"Although it's a shoot-em up game, it's a lot of fun for my 8 year old son.

The maps are terrible and the game is clunky. Its fun to run around as a stormtrooper but that wears off pretty darm quick. They need to fix the multiplayer interface and add new maps soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Boring.","review":"What can I say except this game is simply boring. The novelty of it being a Star Wars game was over in a few minutes. The graphics would be great, if it had been released a few years ago (like 5 year agos). Same with the game play. Compared to even Half Life 1 or some of the other first person shooters, this game is more like Red Faction. The game play very repetitious and just boring. The graphics are sub par. The vehicles are cool looking but that is it and driving them gets very old fast.Save your money and try Half Life 2, UT2004, or even Half Life 1."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rushed","review":"If this game had come out 5 years ago it would have been considered good, apart from the horrible settings editor and server browser.However battlefield 1942 came out two years ago and is still the far better game.If you are a star wars nerd buy it, otherwise don't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty decent game","review":"ok this game is very coolgraphics 9.4 Asound 8.0 B-fun 5.4 - 9.5 B-overall 8.9 B+the only prob is that the game tends to get boring very quicklyso a sugjestion would be to get this game if it a game to play when there is noting else to play"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ms. Brooks best writings","review":"This book contains some of Gwendolyn Brooks best poetry.

It depicts many of the kinds of things that really happen on a Latter-day Saint mission, both the good and the bad. One person mentioned that the movie only shows missionaries building relationships with each other and not doing much work. It would be a pretty boring movie if it showed missionaries going from door to door getting doors slammed in their face for two hours. I think one has to assume that is happening as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"great film that moved me","review":"this was a completely moving flick. om a mormon and this movie made me look forward to going on my mission. the only thing bad was how that one guy stopped believing and left his mission."},{"rating":"2","title":"enjoyed the movie","review":"I enjoyed this movie very much--it was right on the mark in terms of what it's like being an LDS missionary (in the states.) The missionaries were silly, spiritual, and pretty regular...much as I remember from my own two-year mission in Texas. It wasn't preachy and the message that faith is important rings true, in whatever your own \\"mission\\" or needs are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too much whining!","review":"This movie, in my experience does not accurately depict Mormon missionaries. I have never seen so many whiney children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing More than Mormon Propoganda","review":"After reading the reviews on this site, I thought this movie would represent an objective view of the Mormon faith. I now must say this is not true. This, to me, was nothing more than church propoganda designed to look and feel \\"cool\\". While there were moments of friction and doubt, the weak script left many gaps in the storyline:- Why did the kid end up staying after threatening to leave the first day?- What was the whole deal with Pops' relationship with his father?- Are Mormons honestly saying they have the power to perform miracles?The central message to this film was that if you truly want to be happy and one with God, you've got to believe in the Mormon theology.My advice for future Dutcher films, don't make Mormons hollier-than-thou by showing them healing afflictions. (This is bogus anyhow.) Second, don't cast yourself as a 29 year old when you don't appear a day under 40.Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A terrible movie","review":"Do not bother watching this movie. It is a waste of money, even a waste of a free library rental."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zarahemla ending.","review":"I am one that writes the \\"anti\\" literature and unfortunately they got the facts confused about Joseph Smith's initial revelation. There were 3 conflicting reports and not 4 like Dutcher proclaims in this film.Why did you not tell people the importance of following your feelings and not the facts?We just got done watching the Director's Commentary with a former 6th generation Mormon. Unfortunately, this movie is just another attempt to expand on the lies that the LDS church has proclaimed over the past 170 years.The only way for a Mormon to achieve a heavenly reward, is to risk walking into what Mormons call \\"outer darkness\\" by trusting the facts of Christ Jesus and not your feelings.If you are a Mormon wanting to know the truth about the real Christ Jesus, please look up Saints Alive on the web."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best LDS film of the decade!","review":"Inspirational and heartfelt, I highly recommend this video to both Mormons and non-Mormons alike, it will touch your heart like none other. Great film for a family home evening gathering!"},{"rating":"1","title":"LDS Missionaries Ogling Over Women?","review":"Because of the marvelous movie, \\"Brigham City\\" I was, for a time, a Richard Dutcher fan. But as a Latter-day Saint, I am on guard about what influences I invite into my home. I have noticed that some LDS film makers will try to sell us on compromises of God-given values. And with God's Army, the director uses a bit of spice from Babylon. In the real world, LDS missionaries do not ogle over women in restaurants--or anywhere for that matter. So what's the point of including it? Why do we ever have to compromise our values? And for what--to turn a few movie-goers' heads? A good LDS director will know that you never, ever have to sacrifice divinely-given standards; his/her creativity will discover a hundred other ways to make a movie work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie! Review of a mediocre review.","review":"First of all, I served a mission in Brazil from 95 to 97. From my experiences, I have to disagree with Alan's review of God's Army.Young men and women do not become perfect just by putting on a name plate. Missionaries often play pranks on \\"Greenies\\" and will horse arround (I disapprove of the toilet scenes).Most non-members only see missionaries as they are out working. This film focuses on the less known aspects of life in the field.Missionaries may have problems at home that affect them. Despite these weaknesses, Heavenly Father uses us to convey His gospel.In answer to Alan's critism, there were several months where only one or two missionaries arrived in Campinas. We would often ride alone to our new areas. Also, in Laie (with two stake centers) most baptisms are performed on the beach."},{"rating":"2","title":"A worthy purchase - highly recommended.","review":"What a fantastic film. I bought a copy for myself and one to give away as a gift. The DVD extras are plentiful and the commentary by the director/producer/writer/co-star Dutcher are very insightful. \\"Brigham City\\" is due to premiere next month and I'm looking forward to enjoying Dutcher's next work. My wife knows very little about the Mormon faith and she watched this film for the first time last night - you guessed it, she loved it. We laughed, we cried, we love this movie! An indy must-see for LDS and non-LDS alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"die cast","review":"I've just changed the original hoops in a good and nice ludwig snare, and the sound has a better quality.

Each chapter begins by clearly explaining a concept, and continues by offering TONS of practice exercises and tests. Using this guide and the questions from \\"GRE: Practicing to take the General Test\\" by ETS, I was able to score 780 on the GRE Math.One warning about this book: It does not address some of the more advanced concepts that may appear on the GRE CAT when you are scoring in the 700-800 range. For example, I encountered several questions about probability and statistics, two topics that I did not find in this guide.The great thing about this book in comparison to the Kaplan GRE Exam 2003 is that it's not just about Kaplan test-taking strategies. Instead, the author goes to great lengths to make sure you are prepared to handle the vast majority of the actual math concepts found on the GRE."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor thing ;(((","review":"this one is not very useful. bad structure, short list of examples, etc. save your money and don't purchase this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't cover quiet a few concepts","review":"I am pretty good at math.

This program is great for learning simple songs and does have a very good feedback system.The lessons are taught with plenty of simple songs which you can play and the feedback system will track how well you play. The feedback system tracks your key presses, rythem, and note length. However, it does not track the strength of your key press.I would like to see more exercises to develop better basic skills, instead of just playing simple songs. Also, the feedback program can be very discouraging for children as it is very sensitive and report very minor error.Overall, this is still a great program to have for self learner, but in no way will it beat a real piano teacher."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as it gets","review":"I thought that I could never learn piano on my own. All the material that I ever looked into either didn't have enough information in it or was too complicated for its own good.

It's done wonders for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not meet my expectations!","review":"From all the reviews and the product descriptions posted, I was disappointed with the product. I bought this to motivate my 7yr old and to suppliment his formal lessons.

UnlikeMusic Ace Deluxethe keyboard input is delayed by 1/2 a second - support recommends buying a new sound card with low latency.Don't recommend this for youngsters, adults can get still get use out of this program by ignoring the lagging keyboard input and not touching the multimedia/video button. I have the guitar version and was very happy with it; the same can't be said for this Emedia product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing - Returned It","review":"The program crashed everytime I tried to play the videos. I upgraded QuickTime per their web site's suggestion and that didn't help either. The program is made for low resolution monitors and while you can switch to full screen mode, it just changes your Windows resolution to a very low setting so it fills up the screen.I didn't even get to the second screen in the introduction. Maybe you'll have more luck on a Mac, but I wouldn't suggest this program for anyone running on a new Windows based PC."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong CD in the Box TWICE","review":"I ordered this software, but when it arrived, the box contained the CD for eMedia's Guitar Method. I went through the replacement process, but the second box also contained the same wrong CD.

There are none, essentially.I was really hoping to find something along the lines of Mavis Beacon Typing, with games and such to help me work on chord progression and key scales. There's nothing like this.And the woman who is featured in the video clips is truly frightening.Its like this product was explicitly designed to invoke all the ugly memories we have of being forced to take all those boring piano lessons with that grouchy old person when we were kids.If you want to start making music, don't buy this.

They are obviously less technical than that band. Their songs are good, and they have a great vocalist, unlike that of the band Nevermore. I don't really have a favorite song, although the title track \\"Of Human Bondage\\" is excellent. This is my first Angel Dust CD. Enlighten the Darkness is also very good. Buy both. If you are into powermetal, get this CD. Most of the CD is great, although the end gets a bit repetitive. Also, get the limited edition version double CD set with the powermetal sampler disc.

Though certainly not a literary masterpiece, and though i was a bit dissappointed at the ended (ended to abruptly for my liking), Clavell has written a truely enjoyable novel. On par with Tai-Pan (one of his other novels), the adventure and intrigue grabs you from the first few chapters and never lets go.Though i was alittle nervous about the length of the book, i'm glad i didn't shy away from it and was amazed at how quickly the pages seemed to fly by. The vast locations seem to come alive and draw you in as if you were living in them. By the end of the book i felt as if i intimately knew most of the characters.

'Wild Love Affair', which is more photo-poetry than field guide, gives colorful insight into the intoxicating world of 'Orchid Fever', an epidemic which regularly captures the minds and hearts of sunshine state naturalists. A combination of essays from leading orchid experts gives the book an authoratative feel, without lulling a reader to sleep with page after page of textbook style writing. The photographs, which are the highlight of this hard cover edition, get you intimately close to these elegant flowers without having to trudge through thick swamp land to enjoy them. Visitors to my home have a hard time putting it back down on the coffee table once they have picked it up! If you have even the slightest interest in Florida flora, scenery, or entrancing color photography...this book is a must!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor presentation","review":"Graphics are poor.

The fuschia pair goes really well with a pink tank top and black skirt I have from Old Navy, and they also look cute with jeans. Only 1 small thing, and I hope it goes away after I've worn them a couple more times, is that the thong tends to pinch between my toes just a little bit every now and then. It doesn't really hurt, and it doesn't rub, it's just a little bit aggravating when it happens.

My Supersampler is going on 10 rolls without a hitch.However, if you yank the thing, it will definitely come out.

In order to stop this from happening, I would have to turn off the camera and turn it back on and the pictures would be ok. Fully charged or now, this would happen after a few pictures were taken.Most recently, at year 2, I took pictures on vacation all week. Came home and the camera said card read error.

For me, it was not so much whether I agreed with Prof Flusser as it was that it made me reconsider many long held views of the Gospels. I was grateful for the objectivity he brought to subject (although I thought he was overly defensive on the subject of the Jewish / Pharisee responsibility for the crucifiction).

The controls (like any game) take some time to get used to, but if you are a compitent learner, by mid-game (at the latest) the controls will feel as natural as walking.

Your man never stands straight, he's always at an angle and you are guessing which cursor key to hit...oops pick the wrong one and you're off the cliff. It is this insanity throughout. It is absolutley impossible to control your man and the camera angle. Decent 3rd-person role-playing games are like Star Wars Jedi Outcast or Tomb Raider The Angel of Darkness. The camera should station behind your character so that you can move your mouse and cursor keys accordingly....hello? Game Developers!

The story is relatively good, but I think it could be better. The graphics are great, I really liked them; but the controls are complicated. The Prince is very agile and there are plenty of movements and actions he can perform. The camera, however, is sometimes complicated to handle and that will make you suffer a couple of times. I have four-button wireless mouse and I transfered much of the functions to them, but I had to switch a couple buttons depending on the situation every time. When I was fighting an enemy I switched a few functions in order to make them easier to handle. The only thing I resent is that I felt the game was a bit short. I passed it in 16 game hours.

I was looking forward to this game as soon as I heard it was being released on the PC. The original is a classic because it took player control to a new level. Although this game \\"looks\\" great, the control is non existent. Any first person shooter has a much better control interface. The mouse control doesn't add anything to player control.I am 25% through the game and it has only taken me about 40 minutes. The game hints tell you exactly what to do...there's only one way to get from one room to the next. The fighting scenes are boring. I just keep hitting \\"attack\\" and I haven't died once.It feels like you are constantly playing in a training mode. The cut scenes are OK, but the music in general is repetative.I don't know if I am going to continue playing it.If you want to watch a quasi interesting movie, you might like this game.

Beyond it's significance around the world that year because of 9/11, the 2001 World Series was a classic series for the ages. It also represented the end of a remarkable era in Yankee history, a 5 year run that may not be duplicated by any team ever again.

You will need a lot of effort to do so: 1) finalize the disc; 2) copy the .VOB files to your Mac desktop; 3) search geek's web forum until you find tips on how to convert .VOB files to iMovie-editable formats like .MOV and .MPG. And of course you will lose movie quality doing so.Terrible user experience.I've e-mailed Sony Customer Service and the first reply I got was from an automated machine completely ignoring the fact that I use a Mac (I had indeed selected 'Mac OS' in the web site e-mail form, and also made it very explicit while writing).I seriously do not recommend this camera if you plan to edit your movies using a Mac."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Video AND Still Camera","review":"Not only is this camera the best video camera I've ever used or owned, it is also better than any still camera I own! The photos are virtually perfect, bright and sharp! This camera replaces several generations of SONY and HP and Kodak Digitals I've had, and is the best by far.The videos are fantastic; this camera replaces my SONY Handycam High 8. The mini discs I've used are Maxell and TDK and are fine. (The only annoyance is that the camera gives you a constant reminder to use SONY discs). Maxell and TDK are better buys, right through Amazon. The transfer from the mini's to the full sized DVD is very easy to do on your PC. This is a great camera, but buy it from Amazon is my recommendation; it is a better buy than anywhere else I looked and shopped. I highly recommend this camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice cam","review":"I bought this for myself. But my son has four kids and I ended up giving the camera to him.

The pervasive animal imagery is also not my thing. In \\"Unbearable Bassington,\\" I didn't get past the first couple of pages as the title character was already living up to his adjective too thoroughly. A pity, as I'd expected much, having recently come across a wonderfully glib Saki quote somewhere: \\"A little inaccuracy sometimes saves a ton of explanation.\\" (A quick Googling finds that seems to be his best line; a couple of other good ones are \\"He is one of those people who would be enormously improved by death\\" and \\"\\"Think how many blameless lives are brightened by the blazing indiscretions of other people.\\")"},{"rating":"2","title":"Colors galore","review":"I have a large collection of India photographic books.

I cannot believe that Fox could not find better source material to bring the final season on DVD in a manner in which it deserves. The point of DVD technology is to view programs in more improved resolution over video tape.Avoid purchasing this season if you can ... wait for a reissue from Fox on Season 3 if that ever happes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Memory better than watching it","review":"I remembered this series from when I was a kid (I guess everyone still does \\"warning, warning--danger Will Robinson\\").

It sickens me to think how many males have stooped themselves down to the level of the first one I said. So heres my message to all guys like this. Believe it or not theres more to a girl than a pair of breasts and a private part and believe it or not she does have a beating heart and a soul under the skin.

The drawings may look a bit outdated but are self-explanatory and useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Attractive, clear, wonderfully instructive! A must-have.","review":"The Book of Massage is clearly and attractively illustrated, with numerous photographs. (Sensitive readers should be aware that there is mild nudity in the book.) The instructions are well-written, easy-to-understand, and presented in a friendly manner.Each of the three main sections of the book -- traditional massage, acupressure, and reflexology -- demonstrate the same richness and clarity of instruction.I'm personally more inclined towards traditional massage rather than the Eastern/holistic techniques. But to my surprise, I found the chapters on reflexology and acupressure to be full of useful information, and I have incorporated several of these routines into my massages.Regardless of which school of massage therapy you favor, you'll find the techniques presented in the book to be a valuable addition to your repertoire.This is a superior book on massage, and I regularly recommend it to friends. Give it a try!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nicely Illustrated Massage Guide","review":"I bought this book as an additional guide to the Kindle version of -Massage : Basic Massage Techniques for Health and Relaxation (Natural Health Remedies), which covers the full Aromatherapy Massage Sequence as taught at my aromatherapy diploma course. The Kindle book is easy to carry around and concentrates a little bit more on the customer's care and dignity and the precautions to be observed when treating clients. However, this book is a more in-depth guide to Basic Massage and explains about Swedish Massage, Shiatsu, Reflexology and other massage related topics, which I found very helpful. I would also recommend it as an addition to other books on the use of essential oils, like -Aromatherapy Recipes - The Benefits of Aromatherapy at Home (Natural Health Remedies). Thank you for a wonderful in-depth guide to Massage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent resource for the beginner","review":"I wanted a basic book of massage techniques, this is it. I also bought another book with photos that I don't find nearly as good. This one has drawings with helpful diagrams as to direction etc. This book also covers the basics of shiatsu and reflexology but by far the most extensive section is on massage. I learned a lot just from scanning the text and studying the diagrams/drawings. This is a great book and worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"an introductory book for home use","review":"I own the 1984 printing. For those who say this book is dated, it has been around for quite some time. The target audience is the casual home practitioner. While it does seem dismissive of anatomy, there are very basic anatomical diagrams and brief explanations of various bodily systems (muscular, skeletal, etc.) The book basically tells you the \\"how\\" without telling you the \\"why.\\" For someone wanting to practice massage more seriously, there are better books out there which cover anatomy and contraindications in much more detail. Even a brief discussion on biomechanics of the massage therapist would be welcome."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent knowledge of both western and eastern techniques","review":"It is great knowledge of massage techniques for learner and trained MTs.Pictures are very good and the matter has been dealt with expertly.I enjoyed reading and learning new techniques of massage therapy.The only thing I found different is nude client on table,which differs from draping rules defined by AMTA/National Board USA (That is draping of client as per applicable laws of MD/DC/VA) ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly dated material, pretentious, hard to follow","review":"This book appears to have been created many years ago and now looks its age. The techniques are disorganized and the book includes many pages of questionable and hard to figure out \\"options.\\" The author was showing off and we readers must wade through page after page of needlessly difficult massage instructions. The art seems dated too and is poorly done. Much of the book is devoted to \\"Shiatsu\\" a Japanese therapy that can be very painful and doesn't belong in a massage book. To summarize: a little useful material here and there but many techniques employing \\"pressure points\\" and similar quackery. Really not worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bizarre \\"eastern\\" massage mixed with some useful stuff","review":"A little good massage and many, many pages of \\"filler\\" taken from hard-to-understand so called \\"eastern\\" massage.

Oh yeah, Saturn touches Jupiter on every orbit, noticeably slowing the whole thing down. Meh."},{"rating":"1","title":"hard to see","review":"Pros:Easy installation. We have beams in the house so instead of screwing to the drywall ceiling we just hung the toy with strings to the beam. Worked very well.Cons:Very small.Very dimly lit sun.

Not that great of a product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great lighted solar system mobile!","review":"My son loves it! Won't go to sleep at night without the remote to this and their counterpart Moon. As others stated it doesn't fit over an existing light fixture, which is obvious, and wasnt a problem for me (he didn't have a ceiling fixture). I suppose if he had and i wanted to put it there you could simply remove the existing fixture and put a plate over the outlet. Like all mobiles it's kind of flimsy, so be careful when installing. My only real issue with it is the noisy motor (i'm funny about noises though). I'll probably either end up replacing it or building a mobile from scratch with my son in the next couple years, but this was a great stepping stone (he's only 2). Batteries don't last a long time depending on how much it's used, but I use rechargeable batteries and a solar charger so I don't mind replacing."},{"rating":"1","title":"so bummed","review":"My husband was so excited to get this for our daughters room.

Plus it is much smaller than I thought it would be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy!","review":"I love everything about this product, it's educational, looks very cool, works as a night light since it turns off after 10 minutes.

I was so excited to receive it (I want him to be an astronaut when he grows up) I was pleased with putting it together and hanging it, would have been better if it fit over an existing light ceiling fixture. The worst part is that the electric motor in it is LOUD!!! You can't even hear the audio disc that came with it unless you turn it up VERY loud. Needless to say I was really bummed, but way too lazy to return it and get my money back. Probably why its only 30 bucks. You also can't turn on the light without the planets orbit motor on."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS TOY","review":"This toy is a piece of junk. There is a requirement that it be toggle-bolted into the ceiling with two toggle-bolts (provided) and the ceiling must be one of drywall. So if you give your child or grandchild this toy and you have a wood ceiling, forget about it! And who wants to toggle-bolt something to their ceiling and WHY DON'T THEY MAKE THAT CLEAR BEFORE YOU GIVE IT TO THE CHILD??? Our solar system is sitting on our coffee table, the remote control that makes it revolve is already broken. I emailed the company about alternative ways to hang the item and never heard back.I suppose if you have the right kind of ceiling and are an owner (not a renter) and you know up front that you are going to drill holes, it might work out. Otherwise, buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such a shame...","review":"The Uncle Milton Light-up Solar System is awesome in design but horrible in function.

When reading online one might think that it simply fits over or is the yellow globe of the ceiling light already in place, but this is not the case. The old light must come down.

The problem with this toy is, the motor is cheap and breaks very quickly. Ours just stopped working out of the blue. Light turns on but nothing moves, and its still brand new. Cheap toy.

When I came across this item, I knew it would add the perfect touch for his room. Foolish me for not further researching the product, but I was under the impression that this product takes the place of main light. It does not. Instead you would have to drill new holes in ceiling with a 22 inch clearing all around (for rotating planets) this concept in my son's square room would just look awkward (two lights practically side by side). Now I can't imagine anyone wanting to use this product as a main light source for any room given that it is a:battery-operated, and b: is way too dim to be useful. I think the idea of the product is great, but they should definitely design one that just easily becomes the cover plate for an existing electrical ceiling light."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working on Day 1!","review":"I bought this for my 4 yr old son for Christmas. It was so cool when we first hung it up and turned it on. THEN, after only turning it on 4 times the motor stopped working all together. We bought new batteries and even tried our rechargeable batteries several times...nothing. My son then turns to me and says..\\"Mommy, why did Santa bring me a broken toy\\"? He was so sad and I felt very bad for him. Had I known this thing would have been junk I would never have bought it. I bought it from Fleet Farm who only carries toys once a year so they didn't even have any left to replace it with. Now I'm afraid to buy him the same one somewhere else. I told him I had to mail it back to the North Pole to be fixed, but thinking of buying something without a motor now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Buy","review":"I bought this for my kid's room about a month ago.

THis light was a major disappointment and wasn't worth the time we spent looking for it and definitely not worth the cost. It's a battery operated system and is virtually useless as a light source.

After making giant holes in my son's ceiling to hang it up, we discovered that it makes a loud noise as it spins around. It's not the regular motor noise, but an even louder \\"growling\\" sound. My guess is that either something is rubbing together inside the motor, or the moving circles are vibrating as they spin. I'm having to return it because the noise is keeping him awake at night."},{"rating":"1","title":"Motorized solar system let-down","review":"Pros:- fairly easy to put together- cool and realistic colors on planetsCons:- sun does not light up well enough to illuminate planets which means at night, when the mobile is on, you cannot see the planets!!- loud annoying grinding sound as planets rotate- it turns off after just 10 minutes (which is sort of a blessing considering the irritating motor you hear when mobile is on)Wish list:- sun was a bit brighter (for the size of the sun, it illuminates about the same as a tiny nightlight)- planets were illuminated so you could see them in the dark, especially since the colors are so cool- system lasted at least 20 minutes before turning off- unit was quieter when on- planets hung down in various lengths- larger planets (good luck watching the smallest planets rotate in the dark! You'll find yourself focusing on Saturn!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Disappointment","review":"This toy is of very poor quality and barely works. The motor that turns the planets isn't very powerful, and often I had to physically give the planets a push to get them started on their orbits. When it does run it is very loud and distracting. And while the sun does light up, it's a very dim light barely brighter than a nightlight -- you have to turn the overhead light off to even tell that it's on.The planets are on flimsy wires and can fall off easily. It takes a steady and gentle hand to hold the mobile when changing the batteries to keep from knocking all of the planets off.My 4 year-old loves the planets and was dying to get this, but after only 6 months we've taken it down and he doesn't even miss it. Instead, he's taken the individual planets off of the mobile and plays with those on their own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy and loud","review":"My daughter is 4 and really into the solar system, she knows all the planets and this was a gift that we were excited about at first. I have to say that after much anticipation, we were very disappointed. First of all when you put it together is seems really flimsy, like the planets will break the wires they are hung on. Then you put it up and turn it on, the sun is dim and the motor that turns the planets is really loud. And when the planets turn, sometimes they get hung up on one another. The audio CD that comes with it is kind of cool, but overall, this get a thumbs down from this family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncle Milton = cheap toys & no customer service","review":"We bought this for our son and less than a year later, the remote stopped working (yes, even with new batteries:) I emailed Uncle Milton to see how I could buy another remote - their customer service dept said they were currently out of stock, but I should email next week to inquire. I did so, but received no response. I continued emailing week after week for a couple months and received no responses from Uncle Milton. I couldn't find any phone number for this company so it's apparent they want to sell their cheap toys (which are good concepts while they work) and then make you re-buy it again. If you're comfortable spending the money for a year's worth of use, I'd recommend. However, try explaining to your 6 year old that you can't get a new remote because the company that made the cool solar system won't call you back - not cool!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not exactly what I wanted...","review":"I needed this book for a class I'm taking.

Also, for a book that costs $80, I expected it to fall apart within the first week of getting it. We started in chapter 12 in my class, and literally every page of that chapter fell out within two weeks. Also, The paragraphs and examples are poorly delineated, it's entirely black text, so it doesn't include the different coloring that would be used to signify important concepts are not present, making this book incredibly hard to read.

I'm a big fan of Steve Winwood and of Traffic, but this album is the worst thing he's ever put out, and the only one by him that I've disposed of. There are no standout tracks. It's all mind-numbingly bland, white-bread pop An artist finds love or finds religion, and is so blissfully happy that he loses touch with the other emotions needed to make real, well-rounded art. I'm happy for him, but his gain is our loss. Avoid this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Winwood Disappoints","review":"Upon listening to Winwood's latest, I am astounded about how the talented muscician squanders his skills. Smooth jazz stations in NYC to this point, and philly probably later, have played his \\"Plenty Loving\\" which is arguably the smoothest and best song by anyone of 1997. It is this stand-out duet with Gabrielle, which features a sexy guitar hook, which drraws attention to the fact that the rest of the songs are inept. It's too bad that Winwood didn't see or industry insiders would not allow for Gabrielle and he to make an entire album together as both do better here than on individual outings. I only hope that a single is released, so that fans of \\"Plenty Loving\\" don't have to sit through plenty garbage.

It has no rain fly to speak of so I always had a tarp with me. Once it rained on us for 24 hours straight and with a tarp I stayed dry. I've also used it in temps close to freezing and was fairly warm.

At that time Taucher's debut album was considered awesome. There were no Ferry Corsten s' or DJ Tiesto s' or other currently popular superstar DJs like today that could match up with Taucher's class.

There are several slight discrepancies, such as the name of the queen dragon before Nemorth (in Dragonflight it's listed as something totally different then how it appeared here), and several others, none of them detracting from the content of the story, however. There is one slight thing I'd like to know, and that is Robinton's exact age. My friends and I have contemplated this possibility, and come up with ages anywhere from 55 to 200. Somebody help us! At any rate, this book does a brilliant job of filling in the Masterharper's past. (I never knew he was married!) I loved this book and would recommend it highly to other McCaffrey fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now we know what motivated Robinton.","review":"Another kudo to Anne's cap. It explained alot of things that I had wondered about in her earlier novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 Thumbs up","review":"I started read Anne's Dragonriders of Pern series over 25 years ago and immediately fell in love with F'lar, F'nor, Lessa and Robinton. I have re read them throughout the years. The Masterharper was a treat as fans learned about Robinton's early years before he became the Master. I am a huge fantasy book fan, but sadly, I haven't found too many really good authors like Anne."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anne does another fantastic job of storytelling","review":"I love that she goes back and fills in the stories for most the major players of the dragon of Pern. His story was every bit as good as the other books. If you loved his character, you must read this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but lacking","review":"I was really pleased to read more of the dragons and the Masterharper (since I have enjoyed all the books including this one), but the booked lacked plot and was a lot of fluff and filler. I also downrated it because I think it would not be a very good read for someone not already a dragon fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Masterharper of Pern","review":"this is a Book on CD it arrived on time and in good condition.I had no trouble with the CD's they played fine on my player with no skips or background noise.The case they were in is the original and was not damaged. Over all I am very happy with my purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"uh, no","review":"This is definately not one of McCaffrey's better books, or even one of here mediocre books. This is one of her BAD books. There is no interesting action, no real conflicts between Robinton and his father, or any one else for that matter. Some of the explanations for certain elements of Pern and its various aspects were just a little too pat. She totally messed up Sebell's timeline by forcing him into this book, making him at least ten years older than he is in any other book. Fax's rise to domination is not given good enough attention, and the treatment of both dragonriders and Harpers was not what I'd been lead to believe in my reading of DragonFlight. The ending was too contrived, and Robinton over all was too perfect to be believable. In short, Please, whatever you do, Ms. McCaffrey, don't answer the demands of your fans by forrcing your work any more, please! The results, if this book is any indication, are not worth the effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this parag. by a 14 year old girl who loves dragons.","review":"A fantastic story that tells some of the tricks and trades of being a Harper. It starts with the birth of Robinton and goes through half his life. This book explains so much about life before thread, Robinton's childhood, Petiron, Camo, Sebbel, Lessa, Silvina, Fax, and even F'lar's father F'lon. The book ends a mere three turns before threadfall and fifteen books full of problems only Robinton can solve."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT, EXCELLENT, how else would you describe it?","review":"The book explained everything, well, almost everything you would want to know about the Master Harper of pern. The book brought a whole new dimension to the pern series. Well, Anne McCaffrey has written another great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book!","review":"Masterharper of Pern is a great book, as are all of Diana Wynne Jones' books! it is filled of adventure and comedy and romance, as well as being a good first book to read in her wonderful but complicated Pern series. I love it, and reread it over and over again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The masterharper of Pern","review":"I'm sorry, but I have to say that I was truly disapointed with this book. It was slow reading and had little action. Their was also very few scenes with dragons. The only good thing about this book is how it gave reference to charecters in the other books, like Sebell, Lessa, F'lar, F'nor, and Domick. It tells you about Sebell when he was young, and I thought that was cool. But over all, I wouldn't recomend this book unless you like Robinton, because I don't, and thats all this book is about."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent work..............yet again","review":"as i have always wondered about the mysterious character of Robinton, this book was a must read for me. i was pleasantly surprised that while i expected it to be a \\"fluff and filler\\" book because it was done so quickly, it surprised me. it brought every emotion felt by the characters to the surface and i felt them, perhaps stronger that in some of the others. the story was crafted to give a birds eye view into the life of the largest character that has ever been in one of her novels a story behind his life and she accomplished that extremly well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time compressed........","review":"Why in the world would you want to buy this collection of edited/time compressed episodes. They totally violate my memories of the character. Rhino has normally had a reputation for issuing some of the finest TV programs. This is really below their standards. Don't waste your time or money on this one.

I am trying to \\"stretch\\" it"},{"rating":"2","title":"She loves it to pieces--LITERALLY","review":"This book should say \\"3 years old and up\\" because an enthusiastic 1-2 year old can't help but rip the pages. Lovely poems, pictures and wording. My 20 month old loves the book but has inadvertently torn a page in each sitting (I avoid showing her the book and am thinking of putting it away for a year or so). She actually feels bad about it but she can't help it.This book should be recalled and remade as a board version or with regular stapled-in pages for the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"The emperor has no clothes!","review":"Another in the series of unimaginative, low-production-value products designed solely to prey upon parents who are insecure about their infant or toddler's intelligence. Julie Aigner-Clark continues to produce the same mindless drivel, but shifts mediums to allow hopeful parents to pay for it over and over again. But the sad truth is that nothing Ms. Aigner-Clark does will make your child smarter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money!","review":"The long and short of this book is turn off the TV, get on the floor and play with your baby. Talk and interact with them. Show them new things. This book will provide you with nothing that you do not have in your own home already."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome awesome awesome","review":"I received this from Amazon and it IS bound now. The spiral is on the inside of the binding, but I anticipate it will hold up better now with the outside bindings (per viewing other reviews). I am here to tell you, this is the best thing Baby Einstein has put together. My 23 month old daughter loves this and is able to 'stay with it' for longer than other books. There is SO much educational and fun information in this book and I can easily see where a 2 year old - 5 year old would enjoy this. Even if it does tear up I will most certainly purchase another (though I do intend to keep out of daughters reach). I LOVE reading this to her and talking about the images, etc. Hats off to the Baby Einstein Company - job WELL done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Fun Activities and it Falls Apart!","review":"I bought this for my daughter thinking there would be actual activities. I was way wrong. There are 365 different things to look at and point out, but not any kind of games or learning activites (other then pointing to blue and red). Also, the pages are thin and it is spiral bound so my 19 month old has now destroyed about half the book. I would go for something else!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Value for Baby Einstein DVD fans","review":"I got this book for my son when he was 18 month old. He is a big fan for Baby Einstein DVDs. He loved this book right away, since he recognized so many familiar characters in the book. This book has been a great educational tool for me to reinforce things he learned from the DVD. Actually, it helped me to learn a few foreign language words! The entire book is full of cartoons and pictures with vivid colors, and it is very pleasing to the eye. The only down side is the spiral-bound of the book. Several pages have been ripped out. I managed to cut out some cute pictures from the torn pages and made some flush cards. Overall, I would recommend this book, especially if your child enjoy the Baby Einstein DVDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun pictures...but spiral bound?","review":"I haven't bought this book and I'm still trying to decide if it's worth all the effort. This is a spiral bound book that can hardly keep the pages in place. I borrowed this book from the library, and granted it was in pretty bad shape when I got it, but by the time my 16 mos. old and I were ready to return it, the front cover had fallen/ripped off. I'm a book lover, so to me this was horrifying. But, I could never let my son read/look at it by himself just because it wouldn't stay in one piece. He loved looking at the pictures, but it's certainly a book that needs lots of supervision. Sadly, this book nothing you could hand to a child and let them play with without being concerned for the condition that the book is going to end up in. I can't figure out why the publishers thought a sprial bound book was the way to go. Hmph...I thought Baby Einstein was supposed to be \\"kid friendly\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"great split cd!","review":"Rancid had excellently cover every NoFx classics songs with their great pickle sound! maybe NoFx are more quiet than before on their Rancid cover but they have done a good job too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"11 songs are cool and thats not bad","review":"When I found out this CD was being released in March, I got a job for a day just to buy it. I wasn't dissapointed, more like puzzled- I listened to Rancid doing Dont Call Me White, and I cant tell if he just couldnt reach the vocals he wanted or it was a joke. He sounds like Ernie from Sesame Street. Other than that, this CD is totally worth the time and money. The songs they picked are, for the most part, not mainstream and that was refreshing. I was expecting Punk in Drublic and And Out Come The Wolves, although I would have loved to hear what Rancid would do with Lori Meyers.

I am a big Rancid and a big Nofx fan and to me this is one of the best cds ever slapped together. I liked hearing Rancid doing Nofx songs.. replacing Fat Mike with Tim or Lars or Matt like on Don't Call Me White, I love when he says the line \\"I wasn't brought here I was born.\\" and that's the same for the Rancid songs done by Nofx, though I do have a lot of songs by each band I would still like to hear them do..."},{"rating":"2","title":"rancid split","review":"First off I've always been more into Rancid than NoFX. This cd is cool though. Each band covers six of the other's songs. It's almost as if they're battling to see who could do it better.Rancid's renditions of \\"Stickin in my Eye\\" and \\"Brews\\" definitely did the songs justice. Tim's trademark slur is perfect on \\"Bob\\". Matt's vocals on \\"Don't Call Me White\\" crack me up. He sounds like he's going to eat someone!NoFX nailed \\"I Am The One\\". Jokingly slurring \\"Olympia, WA\\" keeps it entertaining. The reggae version of \\"Radio\\" admittedly took awhile to grow on me, but I love it now.All around good split; it's fun to hear two bands that really are friends impersonating each other. Worth adding to your collection if you're a fan of either, but not the most essential album in the history of either band.[ http://www.alt-echo.cjb.net ]"},{"rating":"1","title":"I love Rancid, but...","review":"Rancid is my favorite band, but nofx ruined their songs. their covers of antenas and olympia werent too bad, but rancids are way better.

Nofx changed the style way too much, it didnt seem right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never judge a book by its cover...","review":"This is a book that promises much and delivers very little. The \\"steps\\" that it offers to help IBS sufferers help themselves are few, vague and too general in many cases to be applicable. The medical terminology given in the first 2/3 of the book is interesting, but not especially helpful. The eye-catching charts scattered throughout the book are the only truly comprehensible features, and most of them are available on the book's web site. I returned the book, deeply disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good information, but bad book.","review":"This book contained some very useful and helpful information regarding IBS. However, the organization of the information was horrible. He mentions things without explaining them. Then later in the book he explains them, but there is no way to connect the two chapters until you have read them. He reiterates himself to no end and on trivial matters.

This one, however, is pretty much the advice I've gotten from doctors for years (keep a diary, different drugs that help, blah, blah, blah). Don't get this book. Get the newer one.

I've been researching camcorders since I bought this one and have found that the MiniDV camcorders are the better choice right now - in this price range.The video quality on the Sony DCR-DVD305 is fair, at best, even on the best video setting. I have only used the camcorder indoors - maybe the video quality would be more acceptable outdoors.If you do decide to buy the camcorder, I would suggest buying a wide angle lens for a better area coverage during filming.

I finish all the big FPS games on normal difficulty without any problems, but this one was sending me to the load screen CONSTANTLY on its easy setting. Your character spends most the game in a constant hail of bullets from enemies that are mere specks on the horizon. Anonymous, unpredictable death is very common as the hitpoints for the player are extremely low (relative to other games) even though he's supposed to be wearing body armor. If you're not a gaming ninja with unlimited time to spend honing your FPS skills, you may be in for a frustrating experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best games ever!","review":"I'm 44 and played lots of FPS computer games, and this is one of the best ever. Awesome graphics, thought-provoking gameplay, good AI and exciting, too. The \\"no F6 save\\" option took some getting used to, but you learn to adapt to it and thus play the game carefully, actually mastering each level. Completing a few of the levels feels like a real accomplishment when you finally beat it. I'm playing Half-Life 2 now, but so far I'm missing Far Cry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good game...give it a try!","review":"I got the demo for this game, and it looks like the other \\"long awaited games\\" might have a competition.Goodies:-This game has awesome graphics (as you can tell from the single player demo)-The enemy AI is good, they respond differently. For example if you rush in with a rocket launcher, a whole group of guards will try and take you down with machine guns etc. But you can just sneak up and stay undetected.-The cars, jeeps are easy to controll-You can play the sneaky one, or the 'run and just kill' kind of person. The grass, jungle is really good. And you can hide in it...the enemy won't notice!Bad:?-This computer game needs a real good computer upgrading. But just like halflife2 and doomIII.I can't think of anything else. Give this game a try, it looks very good, and I recommend it for people who are waiting for HL2 or games like that.

For detailed graphics, HL 2 is better. But, for a single player experience with open ended routes to your objectives, good graphics, engaging AI, HUGE open environments, different types of opponents, guns, maps, and so on, this is a great game! I have replayed the whole thing once and many levels many many times. I would recommend this over any other first-person shooter I've played. For multiplayer, BF2, CS, or Desert Combat (which I think I liked best maybe of those)...but for stand-alone: Far Cry.

I read a couple reviews and every one said the game could easily compare to what Half-Life 2 and Doom 3 will be like. Long story short, I bought the game and wow.

I have now played the game for more then ten days and I give up! Its a great game but if I can't save yesterdays play and always have to begin the game anew each day then I don't want to play.

I looked for a solution but the only two ways to fix it I found were to install the game with the 32 bit setup which did not work either, I also found that some people were able to copy the game files over to a pc running vista from another pc running xp but i don't know anyone that still runs xp.

Maps and scenery and ambiance. Wonderful well done.3. The AI was total crap. Predictable, non-responsive, and generally reminded us of much older games. It's easy to find spots the AI is blind to. They also snap back to patterns. You can have a firefight just a little bit away from the island, and they ignore it (less then 150m or so). You can drop a badguy in some ways so the others ignore his death, even walking over the body. We found some other AI predictabilities, which got worse as the game progressed.

The balance is great, the freedom of movement is great, the graphics are great, the replayability is great.Bottomline: Use the preset save points to replay outside modules, but skip the inside modules since once you've done them there is nothing different (not even any hidden features).Summary: Outside modules are totally new and awesome, inside play is a cheap Doom I clone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game!!!","review":"Greta first person shooter!

My jaw became unhinged because it was always hanging from the AMAZING graphics. Everywhere I went in the game I just kept looking around so I could see all the detail. I don't do that with games. The only complaint I could have is that it all takes place on an island, or more than one. So, there are not many environments but tropical. With the power of this engine, and the detail of the maps as it is, I'm sure it would have taken way too long to program new environments. Maybe they'll have some if they release an expansion pack. I would certainly stand in line to get it.This game was full of surprises. I was a little freaked out on some of the levels. There is just no end to the fun on this game.

Incredible graphics. Great gameplay. Plenty of weapons. Few software or compatibility problems for me. Sufficient game length and decent replay value (just because it's so fun).

Far Cry's beauty is not skin deep, alng with its bleeding edge graphics there is also an astounding Single Player experience to be had. In an age when 10 or less hours of gameplay is becoming a trend in video games, it's nice to see a single player campaign that is easily over 20 hours -- not just that, none of it is filler!With Far Cry, you are getting the most advanced graphics technology available in a game, as well as a superb single player. It's multiplayer could be seen as weakness, as it is not fully fleshed out.

It's possible to wander around in the world of the game for a LONG time without it saving. And when you die, you go right back to where you started. To me, that's not fun, that's torture!Obviously, as the other reviews make clear, this is a well crafted game. In fact, it's probably a great game and deserving of four or five stars. But I'll never know because I'll never play this game again.I'm not your typical gamer. I'm not very good at it and I don't want to work that hard. So you probably shouldn't listen to me.

I wanted the bright read and yellow colors to really pop. First off it taste awful not at all what I expected. Secondly it is hard to roll and drys out very quickly. Third when trying to use a paint brush with a little water to smooth the edges on my lego blocks the color in the dye ran all over. Last but not least This kit is designed to make shapes and such to put on a cake not nearly enough of any one color to cover and entire cake. This week I am off to my my older son an xbox cake and I will certainly just be using the marshmallow fondant recipe I found on the internet it's what I ended up using on the Lego cake and it easy to make, taste amazing and the color doesn't run."},{"rating":"1","title":"Description and picture is Polycog but I got Polyrib.","review":"I wanted the Dayco Ploycog belt.

For an electronic release, it is so muti faceted it takes a few lessons for it to sink all in. There are overwhelming beats, overlapping strange atmospheres, intersperesed with ambience. Fans of Future Sound of London should enjoy this disc. It utilizes that same unpredictabilty. But Lance and John Bergin(from C17H19NO3 fame) perhaps go a bit further. This disc needs to be heard to be believed, it is one of the most challenging electronic albums I have heard, fully invocing rhythm and chaos.

At the time it was written by Tennesee Williams while attending University of Iowa, the work was shunned due to its sexual content. His professor EC Mabie commented \\"I guess we all have to paint our nudes!\\" Amazingly, this was a pioneering work that deserves contemporary recognition, and in my opinion will endure as a classic for future generations.

The writing is annoying. Moreover, consequently, at the same time, nonetheless, although, however, then again, also, furthermore -- every other sentence seems to begin with a transitional phrase of some sort, as if the author's thinking process and perspective actually rely on juxtapositions and introductory clauses. Aside from being annoying, it forces multi-dimensional subjects into a 2-dimensional on-the-one-hand-and-then-on-the-other-hand way of thinking.

In my case, I picked up Gorgon thinking that it would be a paleontological discussion focused on the mass extinction at the end of the Permian period - this is not the case. While the brief comments that Ward offers in this regard are not uninteresting they could be covered in a short article.Unfortunately, from my perspective, the bulk of the text consists of personal recollections and reminisces. These types of books are not my cup of coffee - like family photo albums their appeal is normally limited to those involved. I do not doubt that these memories are important for Ward. I do not think, however, many readers will find Gorgon to be worth the money or effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can reading about extinction be enjoyable? Yes it can!","review":"Peter Ward writes with such enthusiasm that it is easy to be carried away on his adventures. While I wish he would have spend more time explaining life before the Permian extinction and the theories of that catastrophe, most of the book was dedicated to his quest for the answers. He focuses on the laborious excavations in South Africa, tensions between various scientists, professional jealousy and the political climate and changes in South Africa. After reading this, you will have a good idea about the extensive research that field scientists do and the various dangers they face, including bandits, weather, difficult terrain and inadequate rental cars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull","review":"Very light on paleontology.

The author does not have to say a word about the prospect of someone pursuing quick fame wanting to rework your hard-fought samples from academic offices. Finding GORGON itself was led to by a related venture running into on the spot obstacles. Later GORGON is found to be not quite GORGON.

Before the madcap bed-and-breakfast owner is through with her investigation, she uncovers many closely-guarded secrets in the tightly-knit Mennonite community, some of which concern those nearest and dearest to Magdalena herself.

Seems Magdalena spends more time talking to yourself than others, if she is SO UGLY how does she have the \\"babester\\" the earlier books in this series were much better, my favorite I think was the SPAM one. They were enjoyable, things were centered around the Inn. It is also like she owns the town only because she is a millionaire and she flaunts it. Magdalena has become VERY annoying!!!Annette"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain awful","review":"I had never previously read any of Tamar Myers Pennsylvania Dutch books, and after this one I guarantee you I never will again. I read a few books a week, of greatly varying styles and quality (I enjoy light and/or trashy books as much as the next person), but this is the worst book I have ever read, hands down. I despised the main character, there were loose ends left dangling, but what I objected to the most was the repetition (and repetition, and repitition)of certain words and catch phrases. I gritted my teeth each time Magdalena \\"wailed\\". (At least twenty times.) Really? Who on earth wails, other than banshees and the occasional character at a fictional funeral? If I heard \\"Big as life, and twice as ugly\\" again I might have tried to poke my eyes out with the corners of the book. An utterly distasteful novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Japanese songs, but don't be misled","review":"Despite what the title of this album may say, this is not a \\"soundtrack\\" to the StarBlazers (English title) animation series which remains so popular. Instead, this is a \\"song collection\\" of Japanese songs inspired by the series. Perhaps only the initial song -- the theme to StarBlazers in its true Japanese format -- is readily recognizable. I took a chance buying this album, hoping for a real soundtrack, and was a little dissapointed. The songs themselves are nice, but not, I think, worth the import price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and spellbinding","review":"This is my favorite CD- it has all the great songs from the first four Space Battleship Yamato movies. Some of the songs weren't on the movies and I assume they came from the Japanese TV series. If you're a fan of the tunes in the Yamato series, buy this CD! It's a bit pricey, but you get what you pay for-I would gladly have paid twice the import value for this CD!You just can't get bored with these songs-the lyrics are poetic and the instrumental part is mesmerizing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game","review":"I have played every Warlords.This latest game is the best of the turn-based releases.It seems to have a little of all the previous Warlords games in it,from the first one to the Battlecry games.I loaded the game and right away down-loaded the patch before i played the game and have had no problems at all.The game is smooth and stable.Combat is all new from previous Warlords games.It is much more hands on,although you can default all combat to the computer if you want to speed it up or don't want to spend the time playing it out.It is much harder to capture cities.The units also seemed to be more balanced with no single unit really dominating in combat.If you like the Warlords series you won't be disappointed with this game.I have been playing the remade Illuria scenario(original Warlords scenario)for about 30 hours now and I am not half way through yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"1/2 the game of Warlords 3","review":"I've been playing Warlords since the original game came out. I actually still play the original every once in awhile. Every new version of the game improved on the concept with the exception of Warlords 4.This is about 1/2 the game it should be. There are so many things missing, most notably diplomacy, that simply ruin this game. I honestly believe they ran out of money to make the game.Warlords and Heroes of Might and Magic are my favorite series of all time. I love these types of games. This game is so bad however, that I actually deleted this game, threw it away and went back to playing Warlords 3 which is a significantly better game.The only good thing about this game is that when I went to the website to see when they would release the unfinished half of the game many of the posters were talking about a game called Dominions 2. I ordered it and have been playing it almost non stop for 3 months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Radio - Fast Delivery","review":"Wow. What a radio !!

I fell for the hype and I want to warn you that it is full of flaws. 1) reception was no better than my small Sony radios. 2) The sound is supposedly balanced for talk radio. To me, it sounds muffled (as if everyone is talking out of a cave) with few highs. Yuck. 3) There is no handle, just a grab indentation. A radio this big is sure to drop with nothing to hold onto. Yes, they do sell a carry case - one that makes the whole thing as ugly as can be. 4) The buttons have to be pushed down hard to change. An individual defect on the one I got? Who knows? 5) This is very expensive for a whole lot of nothing. Don't be taken in. Get a Grundig field radio or a Sony instead. I regret my purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy with the CC radio Plus","review":"I have to agree with the fellow from Atlanta!

This is one of the few funniest TV comedies ever created that did not succeed in TV ratings because it was not aired on a major network. This show is about a 30 year old paperboy who never grows up in every sense of the word. He lives with his retired parents and run into all kinds of zany, sometime off-beat antics that provides entertainment to young and old. It was quite disappointing to many of us that it did not reappear in reruns, but this DVD offers a rare opportunity to view four episodes.

Rhino Video should be ashamed for putting together such a shoddy piece of work. The images are cloudy and pixelated to such an extent that it's hard to make out any detail on some things. I've seen better digital video on the internet. Of course this doesn't cause the show to be any less funny than it is but it does make you wish that Rhino had taken a little bit of time and care to clean these shows up.

Unfortunately, these second-year installments are not two of them. The humor of \\"Spewy and Me\\" starts and ends with its premise--E.T., but with a hideous, malevolent alien--and may be Chris Elliott's creative low-point. \\"Girlfriend 2000\\" is better, but still below average when compared to the show's first-season offerings. Get a Life lost some key characters, and a lot of steam, in its sophomore campaign. Rhino video should recognize this fact and issue the classics, like when Chris and his dad get trapped inside a toy submarine (\\"Neptune 2000\\") or when Chris gets married and divorced in the same day (\\"Married\\").

It was great to read with my boys as they could relate to so much of the story. It was also helpful that my son realised he wasn't alone and that if they could write a book about the way things happened, then others went the same way.

For $20, it is a great wallet to get. The best thing about this wallet is the small form factor: if you dont hold alot of cards and cash, this is a great wallet to have. It also limits the amount of cards you can hold. I would say that you could hold 8 cards in the back and maybe 3 in the clear sleeve if you wanted to. Occasionally, I end up with that many cards, but this is achieved after considerable stretching of the leather.The only negative thing about this wallet is the clear leather front: it started chipping away/breaking over time. This was because I kept removing and returning my ID into that pouch area. If you simply keep the ID in that pouch, I do not believe that it will break.Anyway, I'm buying another one of these wallets to replace my breaking one.

You won't be able to carry a big wad of money in it, but that kind of defies the purpose. However, don't let the pictures fool you! Your money will be safe inside the little pouch.

It has a minimal amount of material and stays incredibly thin. Everything I carry is easily accessible. My only minor criticism is that sometimes if I pay with cash and get change, a larger wad of bills fits slightly awkwardly into the cash pocket (and sometimes I just wad the cash up and stick it in my pants pocket.But for someone like me who generally pays for everything with a credit card but likes to stick a 20 in there just in case, it's pretty much perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Already a huge fan","review":"Only ben using this wallet for a short time but already love it.

I never really realized how little I needed to carry around until I tried it out on a whim! Build quality is very good, although there is a *very* small amount of fraying of the stitching. The only major concern I have with this wallet is that the clear ID window is kind of loose, which is consistent with some other reviews on Amazon. I've found that putting my drivers license and my student ID in the window pocket keeps them both sufficiently snug, so nothing has fallen out in nearly 3 months of use.

You know what though, its such a good wallet, holds just what you need, and nothing more. I always hated fat wallets, and stuffing them with crap.

Quality Product!","review":"I just received my Dopp Regatta 88 and I must say I'm quite impressed. The product seems to be made of quality materials, (don't know about reviewer who stated bill liner was vinyl, mine is not) stitching is very uniform through out. As I was transferring contents from old wallet to this one I didn't realize how much junk I was carrying around on a daily basis that I really didn't need.

Before getting this wallet I would stuff everything into my old wallet and it would just get full of old reciepts and trash. I hated sitting on my old wallet because of that. This wallet helps you stay organized by preventing you from putting too much in it. It keeps all your essentials, and stays slim. I got the black one which looks both casual and high class at the same time. The outward facing ID window is great for showing it quickly. The best part is that you barely notice it's there."},{"rating":"2","title":"My husband really liked it","review":"My husband is a salesman and is required to carry an ID badge when out in the field.

The activities were pitched just right for our 1-4 graders, and we are planning to do the entire series again after finishing Book 4. However, unlike the first three volumes, the activity book for Vol. 4 was pitched for students somewhere in 8th to 10th grade. It was not an incremental step up from the other three levels, but a huge leap forward, maybe 6 grade levels or so. It was not at all accessible, fun, or even adaptable for lower grades, and we were so frustrated we quit the book in Chapter 14.

The company was very efficiant in sending out the replacement promptly at no extra cost (just had to pay too ship to them not to have ship back out to me) But this smaller stretcher worked great. It does take a while to strech a pair as you can only do one shoe at a time but as long as do it in advance for when you need the shoes there is no problem. My shoes fit more comfortabley now.

These shoes are notorious for being all over the board with sizing. I bought a 5.5 because the 6 was a little too big and flipped off my feet when I walked. The 5.5 were great length-wise but didn't give much in the width. This product worked well at stretching the shoes just enough to fit me much better. The only thing is, it wouldn't fit very far into the shoe. So the tip of the toe (which is just slightly pointed) didn't get any stretch at all.I only stretched each shoe for about 2hrs. and that was all it needed. It's still a little tight towards the front of the shoe, but at least now I can stand and walk in them for hours without wanting to cry. Also, the shoes are 4.5 inches high and there was no problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest tool ever!","review":"I bought this with the hope of saving time and money from going to the shoe repair to stretch my various high heels.

I knew what I was buying - the single stretcher in the box wasn't a surprise. I've thought about buying a second one but a) my second shoe will be the right size by the time I get the 2nd stretcher and 2) that would be giving in to the MAN. We can't have that, can we.That being said, my right shoe fits quite well now. I'm looking forward to that beautiful day when the left can join the right in harmony and lack of blisters, and we can dance down the aisles at work to the stares and concern of various coworkers.Or something like that.BTW - though this is a \\"high heel\\" stretcher, I'm using it on flat sandals.

This is a game based on cars every day ppl can buy and race. Thats why its STREET racing, and not RICHMAN racing. The tuning of the cars is by the far the best Ive seen yet w/ body kits and even head/tail light modifications. The decal and vinyl option is very entertaining as well. 5 stars from me and i recommend it to anyone thats a fan of the import scene or Fast and the Furious.Just my 2 cents:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best racing game ever it is better than grantrismo 4","review":"this game is going to be the best game ever who ever said grantrismo 4 is better they got a nother thing comeing need for speed underground is going to better than any racing games every made and they are going to continue making the best racing games just like need for speed underground. They have illegal street racing and they are going to have drag racing. If you liked the rest of the need for speeds then you will like this one i played the demo and now i am just waiting for the game to come out and i am going to get it the first day it comes out i already reserved it and i have 4 more days to wait.

You have the option of customizing your ride as you continue completing objectives in one player mode. The graphics are very shiny and crisp. The gameplay is usually very intense. In some cases you are speeding down a two-way back alley at 220 MPH and there is an oncoming jump! Those were the pros, now for the cons. It is very annoying sometimes when you are in a race and all of a sudden a van just pops out of nowhere. Also the replay can get extremely frustating aswell because it takes sooooo long for replay to actually end, and by the time it has ended your opponents have already passed you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disfunctional","review":"This game freezes constantly and was extreamly scratched up apon arrival.

(only level three NOS.) It is also awesome to customize your car to make it look sweet. For example: you can put a sweet looking spoiler on your car or you can put neon on the bottom of your car. (Visual displays on your car increase your reputation and how ever many reputation stars you have; for example level five reputation multiplies your style points five times.) Style points are earned by doing power slides or taking shortcuts; style points are earned to get sweet looking vinyls and decals on your car.

It is challenging, for those who are looking for a challenging game,and at the same time it is not so hard when the difficulty is set down. There is drag racing, drifting, just crousing around a city, circuit and more. You can customize your cars the the muffler tip. The audio and video in this game is great! The graphics are splendid, and the music is awesome, with singers like Rob Zombie, Petey Pablo, and Lil' Jon and the Eastside Boyz, and many, many more (literaly).

The nice thing about Hot Pursuit is that the cops tend to even things out a bit, so even if you get just worked over by a helicopter dropping incendiaries, chances are your rivals will be getting it soon. In this one -- I mean really -- how easy is it to hit a car when you're traveling 150 mph through a tight city street with trafffic? Answer : VERY EASY. Well too bad none of the AI cars hardly ever hit a thing (and when they do they recover in two seconds), but when you inevitably do, it looks like you drove off the Grand Canyon.

Very nice graphics and a decent soundtrack (lil jon and the eastside boys excluded) Well 1st thing i would like to say is my 1st impression was pretty good, but getting further into the game it just got really frustrating, as the computer is almost impossible to beat, and some of the race tracks are ridiculous. Another thing is why is an RSX faster then a supra~ ridiculous!It has got to the point where i would be yelling profanities at the tv screen.

And practtically the whole city is dead. There isant one person strolling on a sidewalk, Creepy. Also the most dissapointing part of the game is that all the buildings you see in the backround are fake, your racing in some kind of tunnel to keep you inside the race so you cant even explore. Oh and when you try to go a part road that has an arrow \\"gaurding it\\" you are thrown back onto the race track again. Spare me. The game desiners just want to keep you in the right track so you dont see whats really behind those pretty buildings... Nothing! I mean come on you could of took the time to make the buildings 3-d. Anyway thats my review for a game called Need For Speed that isant made well. But if you look on the bright side you can create a car and race it."},{"rating":"1","title":"SUCKS EGGS!!!","review":"This game sucks. PLain an simple. It's a good thing I rented it first. There's no variety in the courses. I felt like I was stuck riding the same course over and over again. The cars are cheesy too, and so are the mods you can do to them. The drag racing is ok but gets boring after a while. Some music tracks were ok. It's a good thing that you can turn some of the tracks off though because i'd say a good half of them suck bad. The only good thing about the game is the graphics and speed you get while driving. Those are top notch. For that i'll give it 2 stars. I no doubt had a better time playing Need For Speed 2: Hot Pursuit. If you want the best game in the series, that's the one to buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"ThA BEST RACING gAmE EvA","review":"this game is off tha hook it is tha best need for speed eva made!

NFS games have always been at least somewhat arcadelike driving. It would be a better comparison to put this game up against the first gotham racing. If any of you writing reviews have ever played xbox live, I think you would call ps2 an inferior system too. Even though AI has improved greatly in the last year, there still is no better oponent than another human. I can't think of many new games xbox has come out with recently that doesn't have online capabilities, yet ps2 still hasn't made any real move in response. They need to just come out with a third one that can handle better graphics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why buy this if you can buy Burnout 3?","review":"The whole focus of this game is that you drive incredibly fast and customise cars. If anyone who is reading this doesn't know what Burnout 3 is, then let me give you the gist of it. The whole focus is that you drive about 10 -- no 100 -- times faster than this game, and you drive agressively. It doesn't have must customisation, but it's a hell of alot of fun. Raming apponents into walls and having them explode is much more fun than this game. This game decent at first, but then loses its charm. This game is slow compared to Burnout 3, has hideous music than will pierce through your eardrums like a butcher's knife, bad collisions, and is just not fun at all. Buy Burnout 3 if you want an excellent racing experience that you don't even need to like racing to enjoy and experience Burnout 3's goodness. Did I mention its only 20 bucks and there is a sequel coming out in a month called Burnout: Revenge?"},{"rating":"2","title":"yo charlie V1 IS COMINGGGGGG SOOOONNN","review":"MY NET IS COMING BACK EGT READY THOMAS AND MY FANS OUT THERE THAT WANNA SE ME AGAIN IM COMINGGGGGG NFS U IS SWEET ON GAMECUBE SORRY I CNAT WRITE A REVIEW RITE NOW CAUSE AT SCHOOL G2G PEACE OUT DONT VOTE FOR THOMAS CHARIE V1 NAAA"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME GAME!!

GOOD:Need For Speed is known for there amazing cars goes customizable in this game. The cars are ok original but as you progress you get awesome upgrades you can choose and switch. Also like in Fast and the Furious this game also has Nitro but should last longer in the game-you get about 4 seconds on the pro stage upgrade (1st). Also it has people at the sideline at the start to cheer. Great graphics and environment is awesome. BAD:Cars are always in your way and your car crashes way too much and has NO DAMAGE AT ALL. This game is another great Need For Speed game and is fun. P.S. All races are at night and ALL RACES HAVE TRAFFIC. You cannot quit tournaments in the middle or you'll lose all your progress in the tournament and races ca be long. In regular races you have to finish 1st in the races to advance. Good game but needs work, but still good enough to buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game","review":"Suite up in a VW Golf and prepare to take over \\"da streetz\\" Ludacris style.This game offers essentially 3 different styles of racing; Sprints, Drags and Drift Racing. All equally fun. In Sprints it's just like any other racing game. Drag is just a strait shot on a road requiring perfect gear shifts and dodging oncoming cars and drift is just sliding around holding down the e-brake. Doesn't sound fun but it is.What I liked about this game was that it got you started real quick. Which is a breathe of fresh air from games like Gran Turismo which require many hours of play to get your car REALLY ready to race.You can upgrade the engine of your car and even the looks of it, with many different features to make your car stand out from the rest.Overall, this was a great game. I think EA is heading somewhere with this concept and I wouldn't be suprised if we a more in-depth street racing game to come out soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Need for Speed series just hit NOS","review":"I just bought Need for Speed Underground and it is very addicting.

Easy to assemble with your veteran drive. Fan is noticeable but not disturbing.I bought two cases:One to keep my DVD-RAM Cartridge drive Panasonic SW-9574 in use. No issues here.And one for my old Plextor Premium CD-Burner, which I like for the PlexTools C2 Error readout for quality checking of written CD-Rs. I had been skeptical, but this now still works with a USB connection between drive and computer!However I had to limit the ripping speed to 40x (CD) as otherwise the drive sputters, spins up and stops a few times, and finally reduces speed to minimum 4x. Looks like a data transfer speed limitation of the IDE to USB adapter, which is why I don't assign the highest rating.With Windows XP both my Vantec NexStar DX NST-530U2 cases worked on first USB plug-in without third party driver installation, and ever since."},{"rating":"2","title":"As of Day 1, It does what it should...mostly","review":"Pros: It Works, No issues with drivers, Vista recognized it. Enclosure feels very rugged, doesn't seem like it would break easily. USB and power cables have good length.Cons: The IDE cable was rather temperamental. Computer didn't recognize the drive until the cable was bent the right way.Point for being generous on the IDE cable length, but too much cable makes it hard to fit in the enclosure. I believe trying to fit the cable in had something to do with it being rather sensitive.

The collaboration works very well, taking the best parts of BMSR and adding some elements not usually mixed in with their music- namely electric guitars and some catchy drum loops thanks to OP. I think this was a good introduction to OP, and I look forward to exploring their solo work.

You can use all sorts of videos, pictures, etc. And put them by timelines! 2. You can add special effects to them (as in pictures going smaller, not movie special effects). And you can add credits to them which makes it like a real movie. 4. When you are done with your movie, you can save it as in a movie file (Realplayer).

You have to run flawless races in order to advance. The customization is excellent but if you can not get past a race then how do you get the next upgrades? Regardless of difficulty level the computer never seems to get easier, every race gets worse and worse. Every time you think you may have it won a car comes out of nowhere and causes a crash which takes much to long to recover from. I believe that computer AI has to make it extremely difficult to win with out tons of repition simply to keep you playing, after you have unlocked all the upgrades and cars what is left?

You can only modify the standard parts of the car, which is far less than Gran Turismo's options.

Indeed, of all the books on the history of the Civil War, this is my favorite. The research is exhaustive and the detail incredible.

Brilliant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Denouement in the Peach State","review":"Decision in the West is well researched, and the narrative is well constructed from the various primary sources. In his own analysis, Castel drops the bombshell that Sherman was not a very good general. If only old Slow Trot, George Thomas, could have had his way, then things would have ended much sooner. Fortunately for the Union, the principles of industrial war were already kicking in, and good generals were no longer needed to win wars.Castel avoids the annoying habit of Civil War historians who name their chapters after a quote from primary sources. Unfortunately, though, he names them after the month during which the chapter's events occur. Is it asking too much to be able to look at the table of contents in one of these campaign books and actually have chapter names describe what the chapter is about?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read!","review":"Albert Castel does a great job keeping up with a long campaign.

A superb resource for collectors and an indispensable addition to academic American Art History reference collections, Audubon Art Prints is a superbly organized and very strongly recommended presentation enhanced with twenty-two color illustrations and fifty-five halftones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Attention Audubon Art Collectors","review":"Bill Steiner's new book is a must for collectors of Audubon's bird and animal prints. It contains lots of new information on Audubon's art, and any collector would benefit from having this knowledge either as a current collector or one considering this art field as a terrific collecting area. Steiner's book is filled with his opinions on how and what to collect. While some of his opinions do not coincide with my own, the reader never the less gets a frankness not available in most print shops.He not only lays it all out on how to buy he gives seldom heard advise on print conservation, a subject rarely discussed in the written word. This is the first book written strictly from the Audubon print collectors viewpoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid book for a solid workout","review":"I found this book full of useful information not only for the beginner but for someone who has been working out for a while.

It smells so good you WILL be tempted to eat it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This is by far my favorite lotion for one because of the way it makes my skin feel and two because of the fresh scent. If you use it as a full body lotion, others close to you are likely to smell it so if you work closely with people who are extremely sensitive to scents, use caution. If you use it for face and hands like I do, it shouldn't be an issue. The scent is natural and is similar to fresh baked cookies, or a bakery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Texture","review":"I like the smell of it, which is not overpowering. I like that it is not watered down and runny like other so called butters or creams. It's not greasy at all. You can't go wrong with shea butter, and I also like that it doesn't contain petroleum."},{"rating":"2","title":"good, but smelly","review":"I bought this cream for my son who is very sensitive to all types of skin creams. He has excema which flares up now and then and refuses to put any type of moisterizer on it. He tried this and will actually ask to use it. It seems to do the job well, though it does take a while to be absorbed completely. For me, the only issue is the smell. I personally don't care for it. It is very strong, and lingers. If you don't mind a strong shea butter smell, then go for it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A menopausal savior","review":"I have tried every cream in the world, then my twin told me about Shea Butter by Tree Hut.

It is wonderful, you should all try it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Far, far better than I expected","review":"OK - I'm sitting here kind of floored. I bought this concert DVD out of curiosity just to see if these old guys could even do half justice to their classic Christian rock songs. After about the 5th song I'm realizing this is maybe the best rock concert DVD I've ever watched (maybe only Rush Time Machine is better). If you've never heard of Petra, then you should check them out even if you know nothing about Christian music. It's just great, great rock, performed with precision, outstanding vocals and superb melodic structure. Good gosh these old guys can play.

All in all it is a collection of his more commercial success that should satisfy most peoples curiosity for those who did not grow listening to Adam Ant. And for long time fans it should satisfy those nostagic of his early MTV days. And hopefully we will hear new material in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"An awesome trip back to high school...","review":"I have been an avid Adam Ant lover since 1981.

Anyhow, now I am a 30-something, \\"dignified\\", mother of 2, who still hashes out secret fantasies of running away to London. It gives me a break from reality to be able to don my black leather jacket, hop into my convertible and blast Dog Eat Dog as I am screaming down the highway. His music is timeless, and this disk has all the best of the best. Adam takes you on a wild ride from raw sexuality (Whip in my Valaise) to the plight of the american indians (Killer in the Home) to a highway man who could rob me anyday! (Stand and Deliver). This disk is not to be missed. If you are not familiar with Adam's work, this is the perfect sampler of music from many albums and many stages in his musical career."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good 80's Anthology","review":"This is a good collection of videos from the 80's.

If your part of the insect nation, pick up this collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"HUZZAH!!!","review":"This, along with B-side Babies, is really the only Ant you need. I think everyone needs a bit of spunkypunky, kitschy, relatively mentally ill camp pop in their collection. \\"Beat My Guest\\" is probably my favorite on the disk; it's really catchy and funny and messed up...I warn you, though, once you hear it, it will never leave your head no matter how hard you try. \\"Stand And Deliver\\" is brilliant. Actually, they're all great...the only songs on it that are kinda on the cheesy side are the ones from \\"Strip\\". Phil Collins produced them (shudder). But hey, it's cool, the other 19 tracks are excellent and you do need fun, weird, tongue-in-cheek music in your collection along with the Joy Division and the Nirvana, it's good for you. Trust me on this. Have I ever steered you wrong before? Didn't think so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This is a fantastic CD! I knew two songs (Goody Two Shoes and Antmusic) before I purchased this CD and I have already declared it the best surprise purchase of the year (for me). I was in high school when most of these songs were being released, but I wasn't listening to this kind of music back then. There is no particular style to the album, each song seems to have a different sound. Take it from a guy who purchased this CD on a whim.

He must have at least 40.","review":"Like fellow Washington D.C. guitarist Danny Gatton, lightning fast Roy Buchanan defies description. His talented (to say the least) musicmanship covers many styles. On this albumn he touches all the bases with originals and covers of James Gang era Joe Walsh, Neil Young, Booker T. and the M. G.'s (with a scorching \\"Green Onions\\" cover that includes original members of that band) and even Hendrix. Buchanan's play is sometimes reminisent of Jeff Beck on this albumn as well. It might seem presumptuous for Buchanan to take on such heavyweights but the truth is he has few equals. He plays is always controlled although often seems off the scale. This is due of course to his limitless talent as a guitarist. Sadly like the afore mention Gatton, another guitarist of epic proportion, he too took his own life cutting short a more than brilliant career."},{"rating":"2","title":"First in the Series...","review":"The House of the Dead (sometimes called Curien Mansion) series is amazingly awesome. Although this game is simple and graphic, every Saturn owner should have it, and if you own the Stunner or Light Gun for the Saturn, it just makes the experience more awesome! Warning: It's hard to find for a decent price, and they didn't make any remake like they did for the second one and the third one. This is the only version you can find of House of the Dead. Although it's a great game, it's not worth $50, so don't fall for the pricey claims."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real eye-opener!","review":"First off I need to apologize to Kiria Gypsy.

Beware The Ides Of March","review":"This album isn't just about a remake of the hit song \\"Vehicle\\", this 2 CD set is for any person who has ever enjoyed The Ides of March.

From the opening drum riff of \\"Friendly Stranger\\" to the last chord of \\"Rebel Girl\\", this album is pure magic. What band can you name that has all of it's original members after 35 plus years? As an added bonus, The Ides perform some of Peterik's hit music from his days as co-leader of the group Survivor. Don't miss the version of Tobacco Road. It smokes!!!! Recorded April 20, 2002, this live set is phenomenal.

The brass section (known as the babushka brass) illustrates perfection, while the keyboards and drums keeping you wanting more!While the Ides have been around for 40 years, they have the energy of new artists and when you speak of perfection, Jim Peterik's guitar playing is the best there is. I'll put him up against any guitar player around. In addition, his songrwriting talents from Vehicle to Hold On Loosely to the heart-wrenching the Search is Over, just reaffirms the talent Jim possesses.This CD has it all - it and the Ides of March are timeless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!!!","review":"Good storyline and soundToo much repetition going back and forth to the same areasProbably not buy another product from this software company!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I read this book, when I was a child.","review":"I read this excellent book, when I was a child, here in Brazil.This book is short, concise, easy to read and an excellent introduction about Luftwaffe's history.If you want details, this book hasn't details.If you want to know the basic about Luftwaffe's story, this short book is among the best ever writen, about this subject.There's many photos on this book.All of them are black and white photos.This book is also unbiased; this isn't a pro-nazist or anti-nazist propaganda's book.This really is a military history book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Question Mark?","review":"I bought this so i could connect my M-Audio Torq Xponent to my amp and I thought it was a Red and white as in Right and left but apparently it was Ring and Tip?

One must grudgingly admit that Altman manages to plod through the external events of his subject's lilfe, and as far as these are interesting (some are) the book is interesting. But Altman fails to analyse Benchley's work -- fails to connect his humor to events in his life or the work of other humorists and writers of the time. The book's early chapters are hopelessly bogged down in detail from Benchley's journals, only a few of which are either illuminating or interesting. The style throughout is pedestrian (except, of course, in the quotations.)

Always funny and sometimes controversial, Mr. Grant got divorced, Mary was a liberated women etc. The cast was perfect for their roles. This show is very tame by todays standards, but still original and hillarious. No need to go into details of the show because we all know about the show.

I am puzzeled by the release on DVD of these pathetic shows while MTM remained in lock up. Thank you, thank you THANK YOU! Now get the rest of the seasons out."},{"rating":"2","title":"MTM 2nd season","review":"Like the first season DVD, I never get tired of seeing it. It's better than any sitcom currently running on TV."},{"rating":"1","title":"just so-so","review":"it had been a long time since the first season was released, so i guess i forgot how much of the show was based on her home life. while that was good to get you aquainted with Mary herself, i has hoped the second season would be more in the office, but it wasn't. it's still pretty much her home life. i wanted to see more behind the scenes in the newsroom. i hope future released seasons will be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Show","review":"What a great show! The actors and characters are not only believable they're likable. Not only that... the storylines are funny and interesting. That is opposed to being insulting and stupid. To understand how this is possible a viewer would have to realize that this sitcom is thirty five years old and that in it's day The Mary Tyler Moore Show was the best. What that means is that it was better than a lot of other well written situation comedies. Unnecessary to specify 'of the time'.This is a good show for anyone suffering the advanced cynicism and bitterness commonly associated with exposure to THE FRESH PRINCE OF BEL-AIR, MARRIED WITH CHILDREN or FAMILY GUY... If you're so miserable this show can't make you crack a smile have your cable disconnected and go on Luvox."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous!","review":"Another sensational season of Mary Tyler Moore and perhaps even better than season one. Season two continues with Mary in the news room and the usual cast of characters. However, season two begins to pick up on more social issues such as explaining sex to children, antisemitism, race, as well as some feminism-lite but despite the appearance of more serious issues Mary and Rhoda continue plugging away with plenty of laughs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap earrings","review":"I definitely liked these earrings when I first purchased them as they are dangly but light. After a while, the sterling silver began to turn to an orange color since they are cheap earrings. I'm not too disappointed because they were relatively cheap when I purchased them, but now I can't use them anymore. Perhaps spending a few dollars more for better quality earrings would have been worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a plastic cup.","review":"It's blue, it's stackable, and it's pretty sturdy. I have yet to have one break, warp, or crack so far and I've had some of them for years. They don't seem to pick up smells and they microwave fine (as far as I can tell). Not much else you can say about them, it's a plastic cup. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"came fast; works great","review":"I've only had these for about a month now but they work great. I use them in a guitar effect chain running a Korg kaoss pad between stomp boxes. Kaoss pads only have rca in/out so this cable is perfect for what I needed and keeps the loop in stereo."},{"rating":"1","title":"weak dictionary with mistakes","review":"I am an American who has been living in Poland for over 5 years. Using this dictionary caused a few funny situations since people told me \\"you don't really say it that way.\\" As a simple example, the dictionary gives the word \\"bleknitny\\" for the English word blue. Every Polish child knows that \\"niebieski\\" is the common word for blue (not listed in the dictionary) and that \\"bleknitny\\" is only for those with a literary bent. There are many more such examples.There are many other fine dictionaries (e.g., Collins) that come in pocket form that give further information about the word and how verbs decline. I would save your money and buy something different. Save yourself a few embarrassing situations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is anyone else sick of this company?","review":"My Shih Tzu has enjoyed these treats for years. I used to give them 5 starts. But then the company started having inventory problems. Sometimes it would take 2-3 months unless you were willing to pat $250 a box. Now they've fixed the inventory issues but have totally screwed up the packaging. Where they used to just place a cardboard strip in the middle of the treat, now they shrink-wrap it in very tough plastic. You have to fight with it for 5 minutes just to get the darned thing unwrapped. And they've gone backwards environmentally speaking. All of the packaging used to be recyclable but now it goes in a landfill. I've just had it. My puppy prefers your chews, but I think it's going to be Best Bully Sticks from now on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Puppy Miracle Product","review":"I've given both of my puppies look-alike and similar products and these are by far the best. I have never met a dog that does not LOVE these! I've given them to friends and they can't believe how much more their dogs love these compared to what they had previously thought were their dogs' \\"favorite\\" chews. I call these my puppy baby sitters because they are miraculous at occupying my puppy and satisfying his chewing needs. I have a small breed puppy and they are the perfect size and shape for him to hold and chew (not too bulky/big). These can be difficult to come by (I've only found them at specialty pet stores) and are relatively expensive, so it is definitely worth it to order them in bulk from Amazon - you'll save time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't say enough","review":"about these dog chews/treats. they keep my dog busy for hours and get her need to chew out on something meant for a dog and not one of our shoes, furniture, etc. I wish they were a bit cheaper because My dog goes through 1 a day!!!Fantastic, quality product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Messy, but my pug's favorite","review":"These were too big for my pug when he was a puppy, but now he loves them and finishes one per night. We've nicknamed them the \\"stinky beefs\\" since the smell isn't great. I like that it's not a corn- or grain-based treat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moldy on arrival","review":"I received these flossies and they were full of mold and definitely not suitable for consumption. There was a recall by the manufacturer some time ago and flossies are hard to get a hold of. Either these were recalled and the seller is still selling them or the seller is storing these in bad conditions. It took more then a month to deal with the seller to finally get a shipping label and full refund. Buy with caution."},{"rating":"2","title":"great chew!!!","review":"My long haired Chihuahua of 4 1/2 pounds, loves most of the flossies.

I have spent at least an hour loading, unloading, and searching the WWW for a driver that will work. It doesn't work on my Dell laptop with Win 98SE. I tried contacting the \\"Tech Support\\" 3 times and never received a response. If you are buying to work on a Win 98 system, be careful. I can say that it does work on my WinXP system, but it appears to be very slow taking 29 minutes+ to copy 450 MB. Equal time to delete."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intensity and Succes Superior to Golf Ball","review":"A week prior to purchasing this I had began to feel early PF symptoms. Where my arch near the join with my heel would get very tight if I was stationary for my more than twenty minutes. I would then have to walk it off. Immediately I began attempting to massage it out by rolling on a golf ball several times a day. This seemed to help, but still my symptoms continued to worsen. On a fluke I got the footweel as a gift and after the first time using it was amazed at how much more intensity and precision it has than a golf ball. My symptoms altogether disappeared in three days. Everyone is different but I would recommend trying the footweel to relieve PF, especially if you are not having success with less powerful massage aids.Also, the footweel doubles as the most powerful pressure IT-band massage I have been able to find. Makes foam rolling look like a cakewalk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that impressed","review":"I was really hoping this would help with my plantar fasciitis, but I'm very disappointed with it. I'm a huge fan of The Stick, but this is not great. It actually hurt my feet even if I rolled them gently on it. I'm not sure if it's because I have small feet (women's size 6.5), but it doesn't feel good on my feet. I'm sticking to the golf ball for now."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must have","review":"Provides great relief/release of tension in the bottom of the foot. Definitely needs to be on a towel or rug to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"too wide for a \\"normal\\" size foot","review":"This product arrived on time and hurt my foot when I used it. I have a normal size foot (width wide) and my foot was in between the outside rollers. Only the middle roller actually hit my foot. Not worth the money. I sent it back for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"the stick footwheel","review":"this thing does not work that well... take a 3 inch candle and roll it under your foot... or a golf ball... much better then this... SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This product is a triumph of marketing over usefulness.","review":"I am a professional manual therapist with over 20 years of experience with injury rehabilitation.Because of the design of this product, I find it nearly useless. It has three protruding rings that are spaced too far apart. So when you roll it under your foot, you get a line of pain in your sole, because the pressure is too focused. If the product was narrower, the pressure would be dispersed more effectively. Maybe if your feet are size 20 or larger, this product may work.You would be far better off buying a plastic spiky ball or yellow practice golf ball to roll out your soles. For working out specific areas of tension, go with the golf ball."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the Footwheel!","review":"Great for foot cramps! I think it would benefit from having rubber wheels though, or at least some kind of covering that helps make it not roll away from you while you're using it. I use mine on a mat though, but I've heard some people say that using it on a wood floor isn't the greatest. But all that aside, it really works out the kinks, and it's a cinch to use, and you can regulate how hard or soft you want the pressure. It's a simple device, but better than the tennis ball I was using by far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cured my plantar faciitis","review":"Plantar faciitis struck suddenly and intensely 2 years ago and stayed with me for about 16 months. The pain was strange and I didn't really know what the problem was because the pain would migrate. After a couple of months I went to an orthopedic surgeon who had no answer other than I could kill some nerve that might have gotten inflamed. He prescribed an orthotic which provided marginal comfort. Then I tried ice, rolling with golf ball, etc with no success. At the 14 month mark I saw a podiatrist who built 2 orthotics for both feet. Again they did virtually nothing. Finally I tried this foot wheel that my wife had purchased months before from a running store and used it as directed, holding the pressure for 30 seconds in each location. Within a day or two I had huge relief and after a week the problem went away completely. It's strange that podiatrists don't prescribe rolling more often. I guess they make more building orthotics that don't work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Royal Society","review":"Royal Society comes as a logical step in this band's progression. After blistering debut Horse of the Dog it was always going to be interesting to see how the group would follow up such a convincingly solid debut, never an easy task. The answer is a natural exploration of how the band could expand on their \\"psychosis rock\\" sound which is often with what seems a natural maturity and to great effect on songs like \\"Rise of the Eagles\\" and \\"Mister Mental\\" and at times a little forced and seemingly less focused on numbers like \\"Puppy Dog Snails\\" which clumsily trails through an awkward nursery rhyme style song almost parodying themselves in the process. For the few weaker moments though, and there is only a few, the album is a brilliant expansion of the ideas the Eighties' laid down on their debut. Top notch in fact."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST ONE YET!!","review":"Another amazing volume of arc the lad. All the action you've been waiting for is realeased in this incredible volume. Action, action and more action. And it's a lot better then the action in the other volumes. He finally uses his spear instead of saying \\"come to me fire... AND BURN EVERYTHING IN MY WAY!!!!\\"In all the other volumes I questioned the rating. It says 15+ on the back but on the other volumes it could have been rated PG. But in this one it goes into dark territory. It started out as a sort of cutesy film but now its filled with blood nudity and things that just look plain wrong.Well my point is that this volume is great and you should buy it. That's right, Cough up the dough and hit that add to shopping cart button."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow paced, but must pe patient.","review":"Again just like the first DVD volume, this contain only three episodes. Most likely because the entire series is mere 14 episoeds. In this volume, Elk meets Arc and more of Elk's past is uncover. There was not much figting scenes as hoped, but the story is progressing slowly. Not to spoil,but one could probably tell who the real villain is in the serie from this volume. I'm still looking for something that'll hype up this Anime, but none here. Hopefully, in the next volume the story will be more intense and more fighting action scenes. Just like the first volume, the extra consist of some previews and a ADV compilation. Overall, this volume is satisfactory. This serie needs to start a moving to the point."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS","review":"1st the piece was made wrong, in the picture it shows a wine rack and shelf and ours did not have the holes drilled properly to set it up that way, so now we have the wine rack on the bottom and can't put anything on top. The furniture came totally damaged from deliver, there were dents in the \\"fake\\" wood all over the place. I called amazon and they gave me 3 options, take it apart, repack it and return it, exchange it which still meant taking it completely apart and repacking and 3rd was discount the item. It was just easier to have it discounted...but I doubt this item will last more than a few years.

I think he is a fanstastic songwriter and truly is an inspiration to me and my own musical endeavours (I have been a musician for over 20 years.)But this \\"album\\" just really isn't up to par with Rob's talent and abilities. \\"Something to Be\\" was a great album, but in many regards it was a departure from Rob's usual styles as experienced from his many years with Matchbox Twenty. \\"Something More\\" is even more of a departure. The songs seem very uninspired, especially the supporting \\"band,\\" which really feels like nothing more than computerized drum-box throw-ins.I gave the CD one solid play-through with my wife - a Rob Thomas convert thanks to myself - and both of us felt rather dissapointed. You'll probably see my copy up for sale in the near future.But again - please know that I'm not disrespectful to Rob (I'm a member of his fan club and wow do those people ever get touchy!) but hey, even Tiger Woods has his bad games."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something more is less!","review":"Rob Thomas is a talented artist whom I hope to see more of.

I'd like to see something more than this CD from him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Cheesy","review":"I can't speak for the rest of Smith's series but these worn anecdotes about authors are riddled with factual, spelling, and grammatical errors. She needs an editor.On the first page forty-five is spelled \`fourty-five'.Aaron Sorkin was never an actor on The West WingHoratio Alger may have been a minister but was never a priestNo writer can be excused for using 'laid' for 'lay'.There are others, but the above proves the point. Moreover, if this is the way Smith handles the copy, then of course the facts themselves are suspect.The pages are also filled with whiz bang typography and exclamation marks, all of which make this a book one can readily leave off reading if one is truly looking for information, trivial or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"it's the only box set from the Big O!","review":"Sure, Sony Music Products could have done it better. More, and better chosen songs from the Monument golden era (1960-64). Better annotation. More running time per disc. A representatio of his last works, Wilbury's and solo. But it's still the only cross-section of his career that we have and, as such, it is essential for the Orbison fan. The sound is decent, and only a few secections are totally unnecessary. And it's priced reasonably. The only reason it doesn't merit 5 stars is it could have been so much better. The music is certainly 5 star quality"},{"rating":"1","title":"Roy deserved better","review":"I've bought many box sets over the years, but this one takes the cake for being the most disappointing. At the time of it's release I had managed to track down most everything on it through the compilations that were released to capitalize on Roy's death. I bought the box set sight unseen and couldn't believe how scanty it was when I got it home and opened it. It showed no advance thought or planning with a poorly done book and four discs with 50 minutes of music on each. Sony strikes again, or I should say, Sony strikes out. Like I said, Roy deserved better. Maybe if Sony had leased the rights to the music to Rhino justice would have been done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elvis's favorite singer","review":"This man was E's favorite singer and when \\"Crying\\" was released, Elvis went out and bought 10 albums and gave to his closest friends!!!!

A martyr is killed for being a Christian, not for planning to kill someone else. There are a few other people in this book who were not martyrs when they died. \\"Martyr\\" means \\"witness,\\" and to call someone who dies because he is caught plotting against another's life--despite how evil that other may be--is comparable to the ignorance behind calling animals of prey cannibals when they eat a human being. There's just no truth in a statement like that.Too, the \\"let's make this book cool for the youth\\" layout and title lessen the strength of an already insipid collection of stories.

The writing is clear and concise and discusses a variety of issues in KM and Intellectual Capital. This is an ideal book on several levels. It will provide those unfamilar with this subject a good basis for understanding this emerging management discipline. For those who are up-to-date on the latest innovations within this field, the book provides a great example of the difficulty faced when trying to institute a Knowledge Management culture within an organization.

As such, it's not really a road movie or a gangster movie or a romance, just an opportunity for a few stylish French actors and actresses to stand around murmuring cod philosophy in tres chic clothing. Plus there's an appearance from the late Joe Strummer, who plays \\"Vince Taylor\\" (an obscure-yet-hip reference to the '60's rocker who wrote \\"Brand New Cadillac\\", which Strummer's band The Clash recorded a cover version of on \\"London Calling\\") and is onscreen for maybe 10 minutes max despite having fourth billing in the credits.In short, \\"Doctor Chance\\" is a film that thinks it's a lot cooler than it really is and isn't really worth 96 minutes of anyone's time. 2 stars for being stylish, 0 stars for the rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dependable Chuck","review":"I've been using this chuck for about 6 months now and it has worked great.

His descriptive narative and flow of words is unparalled. I am 80 and have 72 years of avid reading behind me!

This made reading at bedtime or the gym easy since I could read a tale or 2, arrive at a good stopping place and then put the book down. I found it interesting the way the authors used well-known fairytales to illustrate modern self-help concepts (self-love, taking responsibility, manipulation etc.). i.e. it was intersting to see how each fairytale was customized and used to deliver which messages. While the book delivered good advice through each story, I found many of the focal messages and advice kind of cliched and simplistic. I also found most of the attempts at humor by the authors to be kind of corny, albeit original. All in all, the concept of the book was interesting and provided me entertainment, but not so much of enlightenment or self-awareness.

Customer support is bad. Way to many bugs. More like an eternal beta. I imagine corporate just wants to spend as little as possible to produce this game. Not the quality I would expect from a LucasArts title. I played it early on before the CU. Love all the professions. Quit afterwards. then started playing again since just this past month since they let any and everyone come back for free for 30 days. The community is completely gone. Most venders throughout the galaxy are empty. I rarely see as many people as I did years ago. No more groups. Don't waste your time on this. Wait till the Old Republic comes out.

It's dumbed down for very young kids. There is no challenge whatsoever. I recently decided to test the game since they added talents to the game but it's still the same old watered down boring bugged game.Do yourself a favor and pass on buying this game. If anything just get the demo and see for yourself. One thing will stand out more than anything when you log in You will ask yourselfWhere are the other players?Is this a MMORPG or a single player game?Trust me the servers are empty and this game will be shutting down soon.The force is very weak with this one.

Where before the NGE, every cantina was always full of people, the only cantina that has anyone in it now is Mos Eisley. The cities are empty. Player cities are sitting there with empty houses.

I just started playing a couple months ago and I am disgusted with what the previews show you. Its fun at the begging you do a few missions make some money get rewards. But then buy the time the tutorial is over you come to realize that a galaxy far far away is really a boring galaxy far far away. First of all good luck trying to get a response from customer service. The missions in the game become repetitive. The quests you go one seem more like a chore than a mission. It just is the same thing except with different NCP\`s. You will discover that after the legacy missions are over finally :) that there is now work that pays decent credits and XP. Small basic items cost about a months worth of missions. Piloting is pathetic. You waste more money getting your ship mission ready than you make in about all the space missions.

In the course of these years, SOE has managed to ruin a wonderful game and drive off around half of their paying subscribers. But people who have no experience probably don't want to hear about this. They want to know if the game is fun...Once you get past the bugs, the level grind, the lack of content, the lack of players and the condescending attitude of the developers who KNOW what YOU want (even though the evidence shows they only know how to drive away their subscribers)...yea, you might have some fun. Is it worth 30 dollars? I guess that's all in what you consider a \\"waste of money\\".Take it from an ex-player...leave this sad excuse of a Star Wars game and a MMORPG alone.

The combat has been dummied-down to the point of feeling like a cheep third person shooter.I played this since release up till about 3 months ago and the game has deteriorated to the point that most servers are relative ghost towns. This isn't the game it once was. I'd suggest steering far clear until a sequel to this game is made or an entirely new Star Wars online experience is introduced."},{"rating":"1","title":"The dark times are not over.","review":"This game is far from being complete. SWG has been dumbed down incredibley. Is SOE adding stuff back in?

I would not recommend this game to anyone, unless you like being bullied by a large company that does not care about its customers.

There are still some bugs in the game, but patches are commonly coming out. There are a lot of veterans of the old game that really don't like the NGE, so they give it a 1 star.

I surf the forums alot. I can tell you that most the people who have left the game are the power players who had their power taken from them and they couldn't handle it. Also the crafters that dominated the market.Now not all the changes were good. If you played from launch, you miss the complexity the game had. And there were a few let downs like spending 6 months to a year developing your Jedi, only to have them change it so anyone can start as a Jedi, instead of earning it. There are bugs, but then look at how massive this game is. You are going to have some problems.But let me tell you I have played this game since beta and will play until they shut the game down."},{"rating":"1","title":"You deserve every bit of misery if you pay that price for this game.","review":"Save your money, time and sanity by NOT buying this game.

I can't argue either point as I quit playing last year after the NGE.

They revamped the complete game twice and this is actually the third itteration in hopes to emulate the success of WOW. Not only is this version a failure but it is by far the worst version of the game produced so far.Also don't be fooled, all this is an attempt to grab some quick cash. This IS NOT a NEW GAME in any shape or fashion. This same exact version of the game has been out for a year. This company just decides that every few months or so they will repackage the game and put one little digital keepsake in the package so gamers will feel compelled to spend $40-50 again.Stay as far away from this game and company as possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"New box, same broken game","review":"This product is just another attempt to grab a few more dollars from a dying and terribly broken game.

This book is made from PVC (vinyl), and according to the Parents magazine article, \\"vinyl contains chemicals that can put kids at risk of developing asthma, cancer, and organ damage.\\" \\"The European Union, as well as Canada, Mexico, and Argentina have banned the use of PVC in children's teething and sucking products\\" -- and if your child is like mine, this book will become a sucking product. Although \\"[m]ost major baby companies in the U.S. have dicontinued using vinyl in their infant-oriented toys,\\" Baby Einstein has not. I recommend emailing Baby Einstein (customerservice@babyeinstein.com) and encouraging them to stop using PVC in baby products."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perhaps the best of the Samaria series?","review":"I enjoyed Archangel, but could not ignore several weaknesses in the plot. I found this tale far more convincing, and all its pieces fit well together. Additionally, I found the protagonist, Allelujah, a far more sympathetic character than any others so far. She is quiet and scholarly, thrust into the limelight against her will, and doing her very best to do what needs to be done. She is an admirable character.I am enjoying the Samaria series, though nearly against my will. The \\"science fiction\\" lacks science, and I usually don't read romance... However, wings make some difference, and Shinn is truly a very good writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"slow, not much happening","review":"I read and enjoyed the first book. While reading this one I kept wondering when something exciting was going to happen. It was rather predictable. I think the character development was much better in the first one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The sequel that is not really a sequel","review":"Personally, I was a bit disappointed by the book when I realized that it is not \\"really\\" a sequel to \\"Archangel\\" but picks up the thread 150 years later. There is no question that the book is excellently written and that it is a worthy addition to the \\"universe\\" created by Ms. Shinn in her first book, but somehow I found the characters not as engaging and the plot not as suspenseful as that of \\"Archangel.\\" The fact that Jovah is a computer was a bit too obvious right from the beginning. Nevertheless, I would definitely recommend the book for reading - and I am waiting for the next installment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, more sci-fi than I expected","review":"When I first started reading and realized this book took place 150 years after Archangel, I thought I would not find it interesting. I was quite mistaken. This book has an edgier sci-fi theme, where I found Archangel more of a love story. This was spottier at times, but the end was great. I am looking forward on reading the third in this trilogy."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!! She does a great job!! Definately *5* stars!!","review":"She is the best!

She has obviously planned the history and the future of the world extensively, and I would love to see more stories set there. Each novel has characters that could spawn interesting future novels, whether dealing with the past or the future (I'm in the middle of The Alleluia Files right now) -- for instance, I would love to read a novel about the original settlers, or one about the Edori's journey to Ysral.

What a song, man!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe their worst album","review":"I love Motorhead, but classic Motorhead not albums like this that sounds so childish. THe melodies are awful and there is not passion , you have a sense that they are just playing for playing had that in their previous albums where playing because they had something to express. Terrible album - If you are new start with Ace of spades."},{"rating":"2","title":"Motorhead's 1916 a classic album","review":"\\"1916\\" is one of Motorhead's better albums, and was recorded with the former 4-man lineup of Lemmy, Phil Campbell, Wurzel, and Phil \\"Philthy Animal\\" Taylor.All compositions are well-written and well-performed. The quicker tunes have a real sense of urgency about them, and a couple of ballads also grace the album with surprising sensitivity.This is a strong Motorhead album, and is undoubtedly a great introduction to the band, if one has not heard them before. Definitely worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Motorhead Classic!","review":"1916 is one of the best metal and Motorheadalbums of all time! From the opening track\\"one to sing the blues\\" and \\"I'm so bad babyI don't care\\" this is just great rock. Thenit gets better with \\"no voices in the sky\\"and the love ballad \\"love me forever\\" butmy favorite track is the title track withjust Lemmy and keyboards \\"1916\\" with thegreat lyrics Lemmy is known for and herehe shines. Awesome track. The whole albumis great and of course the tribute song\\"RAMONES\\"! I saw them on this tour andthey blew me away and even met Lemmy andhe bought me a drink! Cheers and long liveMotorhead! highly recommended!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"True Motorhead, worth the money!","review":"He's so bad baby, He dont care. And I dont either! This is a true ass kickin' Motorhead album. The highlights are: I'm So Bad (Baby I Don't Care), No Voices In The Sky & 1916. It is worth if just for those 3 songs. If 1916 don't get to ya, then your screwed up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get me wrong...","review":"I love Motorhead, but this album just isn't...that...great. This is actually the second of Motorhead's \\"mediocre trilogy\\" that started with \\"Rock N' Roll,\\" and ended with \\"March Or Die.\\" Anyone new to Motorhead is advised to avoid these three albums before they have all the other ones, which are all more or less straight up classics. This is not to say that \\"1916\\" is all bad, but it suffers from many of the trappings of slick, pre-\\"Nevermind\\" early 90's hard rock. Still, there are some hidden gems in mud. \\"The One To Sing The Blues,\\" \\"I'm So Bad, Baby I Don't Care,\\" and the final four tracks are all really, really good. It's a shame that the middle songs are all over-produced mainstream hard rock, and not up to Motorhead's usually-high standards. The one exception is \\"Going To Brazil,\\" which isn't all that great here, but is later souped-up to become one of the highlights of \\"Everything Louder Than Everyone Else.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"One standout, and the rest is pretty good","review":"In my limited experience, I prefer Motörhead's 1996 \\"Overnight Sensation\\" to this earlier recording. Though there are fans around of the dual guitar work of Phil Campbell and Wurzel, I think having two guitarists narrows the sound and squeezes Lemmy's bass out of the already rather constrictive mix.The songs are uniformly good, though: humorous, scary, hard-edged, and always intelligent. And the closing song (\\"1916\\") is so good that it hurts. The melody is lovely and direct, the lyrics as powerful as any Wilfred Owen poem, and Lemmy's vocal is heartbreaking. Characteristic or not, this is one of the best songs I've ever heard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good","review":"I remember when this came out. It was a real \\"turning of the page\\" for Motorhead. The production was crisper. The songs were better. The guitars fuller. Of course, Lemmy's voice has never been great, but it wasn't as rough this outing.Many metal-heads hate this album because it's not just in your face, screaming guitar-fare. This has more depth than that. Oh, there's are plenty of rockers here (I'll Sing the Blues and Going to Brazil are real standouts), but there's more. The Ramones tribute song (R.A.M.O.N.E.S) is fun and the best non-Ramones Romones song. And the title track is quite moving. Lemmy's normally offensive voice manages to lend more to the ballad here than detract from it, as if it helps to paint the brutal story of the song.So, do yourself a favor and buy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"New to this band?","review":"A must for the Motörhead library. Solid studio work including some classics from the boys and if you're new to the band this provides a window to an earlier era. And if the title track doesn't bring a tear to your eye you're already dead."},{"rating":"2","title":"motorhead with a budget.........","review":"this album was made when then finnally had a decent record company to back them up so they could take their time .to bad its phil taylors last full album with em ....but hey this cd rocks and it brings back a good time in my life ,,,i remeber buy this in the early 90s and playing it over and over til the tape wore out ,,,,so thank god i got it on cd now ,,,,,,cause one good thing about cds the sound the same even after 300 plays unlike tapes which would warp or break sometimes get eaten in the player,,,,good i dont miss cassettes at all those things had the worst audio quailty you ever heard....well next to a 8 track tape that is..............but anyway get 1916 cause it rocks and its pretty cheap priced too....."},{"rating":"2","title":"As a 15 year fan","review":"I have to say this is one of their best recordings. 1991's 1916 combines many facets of this incredable band.

It was so irritating to watch (I don't like unimaginative rock videos) that I ended up fast forwarding through the DVD - slow enough to wade through all the \\"foggy\\" guitar and piano playing. There is one track that was promising because they had flashes of all sorts of historical images but it wasn't followed through and what could have been the one track that kept my attention turned out to be another disappointment.If you like the budding 1980s MTV style rock video (lots of watching musicians play in fog) then you will like this.

Families will want to view this DVD together every Christmas eve. It's ideal for young and old alike. In addition to being absolutely entertaining, it makes clear the real meaning of Christmas. I would recommend it as the perfect antedote to the worldly distractions that take away from the true spirit of the season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Splendid","review":"I'm not sure what I was expecting here, but I certainly wasn't disappointed. The story from \\"Christmas Eve and Other Stories\\" has been modified a bit to allow for different tracks to be used, a fact that makes this something new and different rather than just videos of the group performing their songs. The highlight for me is the incredible version of \\"O Holy Night\\" that simply takes your breath away. This DVD is full of the passion and originality that make their three cd's such extraordinary experiences, and seeing them perform reminds me of the energy of their concert that I was fortunate enough to see (highly recommended also, by the way). While I would have loved to see more music contained here, the length seems to be perfect, as it can hold you spellbound and not drag out a bit. No one here will win awards for their acting, but it isn't about the acting--it's about the music and the season. This is a great DVD to own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Presentation, but give us some Live Performances","review":"I agree totally with Just Bill back in Dec. 2001 that this is a great music video, but avid TSO fans would die for videos of their favorite orchestra in live performances on DVD.

While the music is excellent, I could have just popped in my cd and experienced the same thing minus the visuals. I was really hoping that this DVD would feature live performances, but instead we have \\"TSO - The 43 minute Music Video\\". It would be one thing if we were talking about Brittany Spears or some other no-talent act, but here we have a band that can pull it off live, so why not do it!?!?!?!?! MY only other neg. criticism is the inclusion of Michael Crawford who ruins the great song \\"O Holy Night.\\" He sounds like a cross between the Cowardly Lion and Mighty Mouse. Not a good combo.Anyway, on a positive note, the DVD menus are cool and there are some great Chris Caffrey moments for \\"true\\" fans. (You know who i'm talking to!)

Not a big religous person but I get the humane message - loud and clear - from TSO. These guys fill me with the spirit that dreamers dream of. So, to keep me centered I use the DVD as sensory input to remember who I want to be and how I should act. Weird? Yea I thought so too, until I intellectualized it and found a ringing that felt good.Being the most dangerous creatures on earth we all need lessons on how to be less dangerous. Many of the great teachers point the way and attempt to lecture or show us.

No one could have been a beter narrator than Ossie Davis. The story wasn't as important as the music, but my husband came in and sat down to watch it. He never does this. What was truly great was since it was in our hom theatre I was able to increase the sound during the songs and really got enveloped and wrapped up in it. Though it's not an everyday thing, it's a great way to kick off the Christmas season and to play just like TSO's other CDs when cooking or working around the house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet Christmas story","review":"Trans Siberian Orchestra (TSO) is definitely to be more appreciated in person, but this is a very sweet Christmas story (though only 46 minutes long.) It's become an enjoyable holiday tradition in our house. We go see them in concert every year, then come home and watch the DVD several times to extend the experience. The variety of performers in the DVD is really special, Jewel, Michael Crawford, Ossie Davis, etc., and Tommy Farese, a member of the TSO, is awesome, and our favorite.

On my old alarm clock, I could set both alarms to wake up to the radio. On this new one, only one alarm can be set for the radio, one for buzzer, and one for cd.

You can set the CD, radio, or buzzer for the alarm...one, all, or any combination of the three each with it's own seperate wake up time. I start with a soothing CD, then NPR comes on, and then the buzzer is the final backup in case I'm really lazy that day.

So if you are new to the Unix environment, and want to get started with it, check this book out. This book doesn't get the 5 stars I would have given it when I first got it, because it's rather dated.

I love that the fabric is wipeable and durable. The strap is adjustable so depending on your height, you can adjust to wear on shoulder/across body, or just throw it over the stroller handles.

Anyone who has a problem dealing with racism or child molestation should probably think twice before watching this. Since the movie takes place in the early 40's, it's full of the attitudes of those days-- the idea that sex is a bad thing and women should be ashamed of their bodies, menstruation is a curse, blah, blah, blah.

The top slaying highlights of this ripping album include the one and only Nightcrawler, the mood setting Touch Of Evil, the excellent title track, All Guns Blazing and just about any other song... K.K and Glen's solos are at their best, and Halford voice just couldn't be any better. All in all an amazingly good and heavy album, not the usual JP, but certainly not worse.

It has nothing to do with the glory days with Dave Holland on drums. Scott Travis is a great drummer, but he sounds too \\"californian\\" and does not fit into Judas.

It is well written with descriptive delight. Southern culture is vividly intertwined with the experiences of Ms. Bush as a child of southern farm life. The characters bring reality into the plot. The reader gets to really know them, as the story progresses into an experience well worth sharing. I look forward to more books by this writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"About Time","review":"Betty Bush listened to the old people. She wrote it down and in doing that, she let the sun shine in on some of the deepest darkest secrets of the Old South. Betty's book tells the stories we've heard told around the kitchen tables, in the barbershops and beauty parlors since we were old enough to listen. They are the stories our parents prefered we did not hear when they gathered, and shooed us away.Betty's book is the American story about our connections to our land, and our sad losses of the connections. She finds hope and strength in the human spirit and she warns us that if we don't wake up, we will all be sharecroppers for generations. This is a \\"must read\\" for anyone who wants to know the truth about why we are the way we are. Her book is filled with compassion, forgivness and love of life; it is a relection of her soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"I expected and got sunshine!!!","review":"I love reading a book or seeing a movie and finding out why a writer gave a certain work a title. Well \\"Expect Sunshine\\" is a wonderful title and one that I even find myself saying to start my day. It is like I hit bingo, when I finally discover where the title comes from. Of course I can't give that information to anyone without spoiling the book so ......Here's my review .....I thoroughly got my sunshine reading this wonderful book by Betty Bush. The characters were well developed and interesting. I could relate to the characters and got completely involved in their lives. There are so many interesting stories in this one book without being overly complex. The book is a great read and I highly recommend it. Bookclubs would love this one. It is just the book for great discussions!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very acceptable product","review":"A good compilation (may be short) from Suzanne music. At least all the tracks are clean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Provides Lots Of Comfort","review":"This is one of the best back supports I own. It holds air fine and is totally adjustable to fit your needs. This is my go to back support even though I own quit a few of the more expensive one's. Unlike some of my other ones's this works everywhere, chairs, cars, on the floor and I've used it at the beach all summer. So far it's been worth every penny and if it ever did leak I would replace it with the same one. This also work very well when my neck gives me problems.Remember the real cure is exercise and good posture. I highly recommend \\"8 Steps to a Pain-Free Back\\" by Esther Gokhale. Don't laugh off a book on good posture like I almost did. There is so much good information in it and it worked for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"serves the purpose","review":"you don't need much air in this at all.

I choose to buy this product for the convenience of placement and the fact it can easily be adjusted to support on different furniture and in different vehicles.I usually have it very floppy. I use it most frequently at my desk or whenever I have to drive somewhere further than 15 minutes away. It has worked wonders for my back.The only downside is that occasionally the little thing pops open and it deflates."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful","review":"I'm a nurse, and I'm on my feet all the time.

Like other reviewers have said, keep the pillow barely inflated."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!!","review":"This product rocks. It comes with a strap to attach it to a chair, but that misses the best use of this product. It is best when blown up just slightly and then placed between your lumbar area and chair. Best use for me is on an airplane--the slightly blown up cushion fills the space between my lower back and the airplane seat tremendously well. I also use it on long road trips--especially when traveling with someone whose car has bucket seats. And, it deflates, folds up and fits easily into a handbag or backpack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back pillow","review":"I have a herniated disc and was in a lot of pain, especially sitting for long periods of time. Before I was to go on a long road trip, I asked my physical therapist if she knew of anything I could do to be more comfortable on the trip.She suggested this pillow. I tried to find it locally because my trip was coming up soon! But all the shops nearby seemed to be out of stock. I had enough time that I would probably receive it from Amazon, so I ordered online. And I was pleasantly surprised by how quickly this came.My therapist emphasized that the pillow shouldn't be used (in my case) fully blown up, but very floppy. So I blew it up and smooshed it down. It helped a great deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trans Atlantic Flight a Breeze!","review":"Usually when I travel for long distances, I arrive at my destination with back pain. This pain usually lasts a day or two before wearing off. But I recently took a trans- Atlantic flight that lasted over 7 hours and I arrived with no pain, feeling great. That's because I was using my newly purchased Corflex Medic Air Back Pillow. I inflated it with just 3 breaths - in order for it to be comfortable it must NOT be inflated fully and for me, three breaths was perfect. When it is used like this, it doesn't even look inflated, but it is just perfect to support the back in the right spots. This product turned out to be a blessing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked great.","review":"The only gripe is the strapping option to the executive leather chair. It could have been done better... I have to keep adjusting everytime I sit down on my chair. Other than that it worked well.

Speaking of Spock, he turns into a remote control TV and manages to guide Dr McCoy through Brain Surgery--and Spock has no brain!!!!!! This episode insults Spock's character. As Trekkies say, \\"Bad Star Trek is still pretty good.\\" Maybe--it is, at least, slightly campy. Luckily, you have another episode on the DVD, \\"Beauty\\" is a good examination of prejudice based on looks-- a subject that is still taboo in our society. If you are one of the few Dr. Pulaski (Next Gen, season 2) fans, she does a good acting job in this episode. The Medusa is an interesting character. My other gripe is that Star Trek Originals do NOT give any extras-commentary from an actor would help these DVDs sell. You get 2 episodes and that is all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One Episode Not Worth Mentioning and Another Average One!","review":"If you are deciding which volumes to keep, you can safely consign this one to the dustbin and not miss a thing. Granted the second episode is a lot better than the first but still relative to the other episodes in TOS-dom, it is still forgettable. The other reviewers have done a good job of explaining why the first episode is brainless but the scriptwriting of the second episode is also subpar and while the plot is a little more interesting and believable, the overall episode still falls short of what we are used to from prior episodes. Definitely not recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One good One Bad","review":"While I agree that Spock's Brain is not the best effort of the third season, I would rather sit through this episode than \\"Plato's Stepchildren\\" or \\"The Way to Eden\\" or \\"The Mark of Gideon\\".

I took the pretest and got a 92%. I seriously doubt I am that good at math. A lot of the hardest questions from the big book aren't in this book. Also, in the big book I got around 40% at the Pretest for my first attempt, and then a 60% after some studying.

It is like learning to write all over again, but better. The shapes are more aesthetically pleasing because they relate directly to sounds, rather than a given word's linguistic history. It makes you stop and really listen. It's amazing how many extra unnecessary letters we have in the English language. I feel bad for those who must learn to write English as a second or third language . . .Pitman's system is the synthesis of about 200 years of shorthand experimentation, mainly in England. Shorthand has almost died out, but perhaps it will find some other role in the 21st century.

Disc Three is \\"Gene Autry & Roy Rogers\\". These are songs by the two most popular singing cowboys. Gene and Roy also appear on all the other discs. Disc Four is \\"Movie & Television Themes\\".

The severity minimal means achieving maximum effects are the essence of what director/critic/screenwriter called \\"the transcendental style\\". The story of a woman's' love that was never requited by those who loved sounds simple enough but then, Dreyer would not be the master he is if he had not turned it into something beautiful that is intrinsically tied to the means of the film as medium itself. I thin that this film has only 57 shots. Yes 57! Long camera takes and static camera setups are what make this particular film and unforgettable experience. Definitely not for all tastes but once you see it you will probably be hooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ignore the documentary","review":"Watch out, cinema lovers! Carl Theodor Dreyer is a unique director, and his films require a special kind of patience.

There has been no new edition since before the Roth IRA was introduced. The boom in online investing invites a chapter of its own, warts and all.

Yes, it's not the solution to all your financial problems, but it's a great overview with very enlightening information.The only thing I didn't find details about was 457 retirement plans (even though it talks about others).

In the hands of the very adept writer/director Tamara Jenkins, \\"The Savages\\" lets out all the stops. These characters are all damaged, in one way or another, and the screenplay allows great latitude to show the humor in everyday human foibles. Indeed, there's loads of unrequited familial love that has never been given the chance to flow naturally. Laura Linney and P.S. Hoffman are excellent, perfectly cast, and the wonderful Philip Bosco is on hand to add considerable angst to the proceedings. DVD extras are few but there's a nice making-of segment that explains a lot, and allows Ms. Jenkins to cite her connection to the story. It's not really a pleasant story, but the ending has a certain degree of redemption, and not the cop-out that might've been.

When we opened the gift it looked so neat, I could see the attraction, but I agree with all of those who have talked about the small black-and-white display with very poor resolution. The games are not nearly as good as those on the Leapster and the laptop is pretty large to take places. After a few minutes playing on his laptop, he always asks to play on my laptop. If anything, it has increased his desire to use my computer, and this is not good.We have a VTECH digital camera that is great - I'm surprised by how poor the graphics are on the Nitro Laptop.

I have a copy of this album on vinyl and am glad to see it finally reissued on CD. I gave it five stars because I truly believe that fans of the Three Stooges, even Curly Howard purists, will enjoy these recordings that Moe Howard and Larry Fine made with 1960's-era third stooge, Joe DeRita. My favorite songs in the collection are \\"Mairzy Doats,\\" and the reworking of \\"The Alphabet Song,\\" originally performed with Curly in the Columbia Pictures two-reel comedy, \\"Violent is the Word For Curly.\\" \\"The Madcap Musical Nonsense\\" CD speaks to the inner-stooge in all of us. It is innocent, child-like fun that will bring smiles to all the young-at-heart. I hope more of the Stooges LPs make the transition to compact disc.

They toured during 1990 and 1991 at a relentles pace, selling out everywhere to promote their Step By Step album's songs. Perhaps the funkiest of the remixes is Games, which is catchy, funky hard hitting enough to confront their toughest critics and naysayers! Sounds very close to the siren/tornado sounds of rap group Public Enemy! Another standout is the C+C Remix of Call It What You Want, which also ended up on their Greatest Hits album in 1999. It's just as danceable and funky today! The other numbers like Hangin Tough, Step By Step and other rare remixes are just as good.

It is only 13 pages long with only two pages dedicated to any 5-6 chapters. The 5-10 questions, which were dedicated to the 5-6 chapters were silly, and had no depth to them. There were no other usable parts to the book. There are only 2-3 reproducibles, but they are not worth the cost of the paper to print them.

I don't know if it was unusual, but he saw us in his home office in San Juan Capistrano, Southern California. He was a wood carver and made beautiful little bears, one of which he gave me and I treasure it still. Bieler Broth is quite popular now as a liver cleanse, and it really works.

The soup is simple to get (vegetables and parsley only) and easy to make. It is fantastic even when I eat all the wrong things one day, it gets me right back in balance and settles any problems I may have.

Except Dr. Bieler didn't have a website, a special program or supplements to sell. He was just telling it like it is, as he observed in his 50 years as a general practitioner.

Diesel has had some background with other movies to give him his chops on this type role. He is certainly capable of doing drama and not just action. I was impressed with his performance and the movie itself as a whole. The movie is mainly serious although there are a few lighter moments. This is not \\"My Cousin Vinny\\". This is not nearly as comedic. So don't go into it thinking it will be funny and you should enjoy it.The movie shows the trial of several organized crime families in New Jersey in a serious manner. They are portrayed neither guilty or innocent. It is even handedly presented to us as to the jury. This is one of the better courtroom dramas I have seen in several years. I recommend this if you enjoy drama or especially courtroom and law movies. I plan to buy a copy myself. It definitely has replayability."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth watching","review":"I don't normally watch docu-dramas about mobsters, but this one had flair. Vin Diesel shows us the sympathetic and humorous side to a character that has done some 'bad things'. Inspired by the true story of Mafia man 'Fat Jack DiNorscio', this film tightens up the plot to what was probably a long, drawn out experience for the jurers and others involved. A jurer would have to be entertained by courtroom antics to stay awake during the real trial. This is a good adaptation of the true story.Chrissy K.

It wasn't a BAD movie, definitely, but it was definitely not a GOOD movie by any stretch of the imagination. Vin Diesel was good and so was Peter Dinklage.

The movie draws out (much like the trial) and you can't really see a connection with anything. They might as well have just made this an A & E special if they just wanted to highlight some funny things that Jackie DeNorsio said in his trial... but this definitely isn't worthy of a 2 hour movie.The directing is pretty boring which doesn't help the movie progress. Also, the cinematography is bland. Don't check this movie out. It's kind of a waste of 2 hours of your life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Find me a better story","review":"Other reviewers have described the plot, so I will skip that part. First - I am a big Vin Diesel fan. The story starts out with some action but quickly mires in a courtroom setting. I had nothing invested in these characters. You like Vin's character because he is funny and has some angst going on. But how they got to this landmark case and why - all back story.I think this story would have been better told in a mini-series format. (But then the A- list people wouldn't have done it). The first 2 hours would be showing us their dirty dealings and then subsequent arrest. The 2nd two hours could have been the trial.As much as I like \\"talking\\" films - those with dialogue and not a lot of action - this one just didn't deliver. It was - as another reviewer stated - a vehicle for Vin to show his more serious dramatic side.The hair piece rivaled the one that Sean Connery in \\"Hunt for Red October\\". It was good to see Peter Dinglage - loved him in \\"The Station Agent\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vin should WIn Oscar WOW!","review":"I didn't even like Vin before this film. I thought another one of those new action guys from generation X. Boy was I wrong his performance was amazing in this film. I sat back amazed and thought this boy actually deserves an award for this one. He just grabbeded his character and just ran with it and it was so natural and so different then anything I have ever seen him do. The story was very well put together and it even made you want compassion on these bad guys. He showed a loyalty that is so missing today in films and in people in general. It is amazing how people will sell eachother out for convienence instead of principle of loyalty friendship and Family. The film has nothing to do with Italians but it has everything to do with humanity and just plain commitment. I think we can all learn from this movie a little bit."},{"rating":"1","title":"It arrived broken","review":"This product arrived broken and when I requested a replacement, they would only send me a refund and lead me to believe (via email only) that the product didn't always survive the shipping process.

Buy it!","review":"I first started teaching myself about Malcolm X when I was only in 6th grade, but I was only really concerned with his life story and not his ideas. The books I had read up through high school never gave any extra insight either (and I owned 10 at the time). I first read this book in the fall of '95, finding it by accident when I was going through the books by Malcolm my freshman year at Montana State U. This book is terrific! I had always been an admirer of Malcolm, but without the insight and this book gave it. My favorite speech is \\"The Black Man's History\\", truly a masterpiece. There are some ideas that don't quite pan out, but these speeches came during the time he was still with the Nation of Islam and a follower of Elijah Muhammed. This book gives terrific insight into his ideas early on. It is well worth the money to buy this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good only for historical purposes","review":"This book has it's moments, such as \\"God's Judgement for White America\\" which speaks of divine revenge for the crimes against Black Americans, but too much of this reflects the period when Malcolm was parroting (his own admission) the cuckoo-patch teachings of Elijah Muhammad for the benefit of the ignorant. \\"The Black Man's History\\" is filled with utter madness about Blakc mad scientists creating White people, ad nauseum.

It is the story of a dysfunctional branch of the Courteney family living in South Africa around 1900. Somehow the blood and guts of civil war isn't as interesting as other Smith narratives. Other books have lots of fascinating and well-researched context material that make them interesting and separate them from other \\"pot boilers.\\" But \\"The Sound of Thunder\\" is mainly just about people hating and harming each other in irrational ways. The characters are all improbable, the coincidences that bring them together stretch credibility beyond the breaking point, and the action is often senseless and leads nowhere. One interesting dimension of Smith -- exploring the essence of Africa -- is trivialized in this book.

Horrible acting and even worse direction. I had hoped that even if it was bad, it could be that bad movie that I didn't mind liking. You know what I mean? No go. The only cool part of this movie is seeing Willem Dafoe in the ending sequence. I wish this title didn't have to die. It was set up for a continuation but, unless the rights are sold to a better film maker, another cannot happen. I know everyone is entitled to his/her opinion but, for the people who actually liked this movie, I'd ask you to reevaluate every thought you've ever had.

In any case, if you dive in, prepare to be deeply insulted."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Should Have Been Better","review":"Just watched the movie; was a big fan of Saints I. It pains me to say that while it's watchable, it's ultimately cartoonish and overdone. The brothers' relationship is taken for granted, and they are moved through obligatory gunplay like pieces on a board. The humor between them and their Mexican sidekick is phony and overdone, and his character is never clear. And Peter Fonda's accent sucks. He obviously didn't take much time preparing for his role, as limited as it was. Don't get me wrong -- the movie wasn't terrible, but it could -- and should -- have been so much better. I watch the original every so often. I don't think I'll watch this one again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrific!","review":"Seriously. This film is nothing like the original. NOTHING!

For all the fan boys who will cry foul because the creator of such an amazing first movie could do no wrong in you eyes, think again. For further clarification go watch \\"Overnight\\" it is a documentary following Troy Duffy and his cronies while producing the first film. It becomes apparent immediately that he purely got lucky with the script and directing in the first movie. This is abundantly clear in the second film as typical cliche direction and piss poor comedy fills the screen. Duffy tried to be \\"creative\\" in some scenes, and it is obvious that he tried to hard.

I guess it's the natural progression....or de-evolution of things. The movie is good in it's own right. The sterotypical mexican was a bit of a twist but not much off from Rocco from the first flick. The replacement for Agent Smecker was....sexier, but nonetheless from the same vein as Willem Dafoe. The history of Il Duce was interesting.....anyways.

The same quirky almost idiot savant of detective work who listens to classical music & sees things that NO ONE else even noticed. But wait! They made her a smoking hot female.

I was sorely disappointed. No longer is it good vs. evil. It's about the Saints' reputation, the father's resignation to his fate, and retribution all the way around. Really.I did love Julie Benz as Agent Eunice Bloom. Her portrayal is priceless. There are some great scenes that are classic. For instance, the \\"f-ing rope\\" comes in handy again and more falling into the scene is involved.If you watch this movie knowing that it is not up to par with the first, perhaps you'll enjoy it more. By the way, what did Sean Patrick Flanery do to his face?!?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Developmentally disabled cinema","review":"I'm glad to see that Hollywood is reaching out to the developmentally disabled community, by employing mentally challenged directors, script writers and actors to produce movies of a caliber that is easily comprehensible to people of a genetically predetermined low IQ and limited understanding. Obviously, the movie would be intolerable to an audience of normal intelligence, but its constant shooting, non-existent plot, dopey posturing and incoherent, meaningless dialogue are enough to keep an audience of low-functioning mental incompetents occupied for two hours. So again, kudos to Hollywood for recognizing a previously underserved audience. And to Troy Duffy: You're a winner! Sean Patrick Flanery: Yay for you! Norman Reedus: You win the prize!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN","review":"Loved the 1st Boondock Saints but this was the worst movie I have ever seen! Atrocious writing and acting that was (I am hoping) trying to be camp but came across as high school amateurish. My previous worse movie ever was Hang Up or Hanging Up - a piece of dreck starring Meg Ryan and that blonde chick from Friends - Boondock Saints 2 is actually much much worse than that.Save yourself the money and time and just stare at a wall for an hour and a half - your life would be more enriched than sitting through this POS."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Horrible Sequel","review":"I went into this film with an open mind, but oh my God was it awful. Within the first 10 mins my friend walked out of the room and said he was not watching it. The acting was so terrible, I felt like I was watching a cheap play where the actors were reading the script as they went. They tried way to hard to make the move cool like the first one, but they lost all of it. They overused similar film techniques used in the first one and replaced william dafoe with some woman who was not even near the caliber of actor. The guy that replaced there friend from the first one was also a terrible actor. Sure the movie had lots of killing and unecessary swearing to try and make it appear as cool as the first one, but it really made it lame. I don't reccomend this movie to anyone, it only reminds me of why the first one is so good."},{"rating":"1","title":"SKIP THIS CRAP!","review":"There's a reason why no one wanted this movie made - IT SUCKS!!

So buy and enjoy!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNK","review":"I don't normally write reviews but the one is so bad I can't help it! You people who gave it 4-5 stars are on dope. Don't waste your time unless you think vulgar for the sake of being vulgar and using the \\"F\\" word unnecessarily every other line is cool. The action sequences are dull: the 1st angle shows the boondock boys shoot, the subsequent angle shows the bad guys fall, ... rinse, wash, repeat. Every shootout??? (did the bad guys even shot back?) scene was done the same way. Agree with all the negative reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money","review":"Loved the original...hated this one. There is not one redeeming quality about it.

It was nothing like the first which was and is a classic. The director either didn't know how to recreate his masterpiece or didn't care. Don't waste your money. There are a few attempts to capture the interface between the brothers but the movie just doesn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hahaha, What a Joke, Seriously","review":"Do not be fooled, this film is most assuredly not the original indie sleeper hit we all know and love but almost a cheap imitation. After a 10-year hiatus from filmmaking, and with the mortgage on his house due, Troy Duffy turned to art to exploit his only cinematic achievement for money. Way too long of a runtime for a flick like this, the borderline ridiculous film sucks up tons of time doing flashbacks and random scenes with a character from the first film Rocco. Not to mention the use of a quirky confusing character to replace him. The film is really so much of a mess you might possibly even know less about the Saints after watching it. Duffy was quite obviously trying to fill a futile void to recreate his success. Once again another disaster of unseasoned filmmaking."},{"rating":"1","title":"First movie is a masterpiece; this is utter garbage","review":"I'm embarrassed for all involved in this amateurish and corny excuse for a sequel.

How the actors could even stand to go to the premiere I will never know..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just terrible","review":"We turned it off after 15 minutes. It was so bad from the casting to the absolutely ridiculous dialog and acting. I don't mind cursing, not at all - but lets say the first 15 minutes every other word was F this or F that - for no reason.Plus the boys find out about the travesty...go to the barn to dig up their guns, clean them, cut their beards and hair and take sexy showers (yes it's true) and you would think this would take hours, yet the priest who delivered the news was sitting in the kitchen like he'd just gotten there....then they go to the Boston cops. A litter of worse actors there has never been...Wow, I will watch terrible movies. I mean any action or sci fi junk - I love. But this was so bad it had to be turned off. I'm thinking to slapping the guy at the rental store just for good measure."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hoped for more...","review":"Maybe it's just me but this movie felt like a cheap, recycled version of the first. I'm astounded by how many people feel this is just as good if not better than the first movie. It makes me wonder if a lot of today's fans of the movie actually got why the first was so great. This sequel had a couple interesting things going for it like the ending and our new fbi liason is pretty entertaining and easy on the eyes. Aside from that, you aren't getting anything new, original, etc that wasn't already done in the first and done well. To say the least, I was pretty disappointed which sucks because I had high hopes."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you loved the first movie do yourself a favor and don't watch this !!!","review":"I consider Boondock Saints (the first movie) one of my top five flicks.

Well, I stand corrected. If you are looking for legendarily brainless action with the most ridiculous plot ever, just watch the first one and don't ever, under any circumstance, waste your time with this. This deserves 0 stars while the first one could warrant 1. This director is trash, watch the documentary about him and the original film to see how much of a complete doucher he is."},{"rating":"1","title":"absolute garbage","review":"Boondock Saints 2 is an absolute travesty. It was like the director forgot what made the first one so enjoyable and try to emulate it anyway. Characters don't act a thing like they did in the first one. The action scenes are just boring. The brothers just stand like five feet away from the goons and not get shot once while they blow away like 7 or 8 people. They don't move at all! they just stand perfectly still and the frackin henchmen aren't able to hit them at all. The person who they replaced Dafoe's character with is a terrible actress and over all the acting is worse than the first one. Please don't waste your time with this piece of garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Wow! I think this just cracked my top 5 worst movies of all time. Right up there with Last Action Hero. Terrible!!! I couldn't even finish watching. I loved the first one though. Wow just wow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Watch This Movie","review":"I was highly disappointed with this movie. The first one was good, but this second one really ruined it for me. It's very juvenile and the story was bad beyond belief. The acting is hambone (some worse than others) and isn't true to the characters from the first one. I watched the movie because I liked the actors, but after watching this movie I like them less. Too bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie, decent price","review":"As always, Amazon offers movies, even new movies, at good prices. As for the movie, it's not as good as the first one, but what sequel is? It's still vastly entertaining, with most of the original cast in addition to \\"the boys\\" as they return to Boston to avenge the killing of a priest after a long time in hiding. The story progression was very similar to the original film, with enough new material to keep it from feeling like déjà vu. I was concerned about Rocko's \\"replacement\\" initially, I feared that his ethnicity would be \\"overdone\\", but it never occurred to me again, Clifton Collins Jr. put in a solid performance as the comic relief, being given a slew of fabulous lines. Julie Benz is amazing as the sultry-yet-tough southern belle FBI agent sent in to investigate the first murder, and supposedly track down the Saints. It's a pity we had to wait 10 years for this, but it was worth the wait. Great action, great story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Job Well Done","review":"I ordered this movie and left to go out of town, it was supposed to arrive a few days after I returned from my trip.

I remember leaving the movie theater in total confusion, just wondering how Troy Duffy could have made such a wretched movie. It's like he didn't even try. Every aspect of the film was either a thoughtless rehash of something from the first movie, or he just stole it from the generic action conventions box. This was a HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE movie with lame dialogue, predictable plot devices, and absolutely none of the quirky originality of the first film. I hope Duffy dies and goes to hell for this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie!","review":"Cool movie, a must watch if you are a fan of the first!

Having said that I loved the episode An American Empress because the enigmatic France Nuyen was fantastic in it as she was brilliant and engaging in every episode that she starred in. As someone who has yet to see San Francisco these episodes are like a Tourist Brochure of where to go and what to see. Tag your it is a particular favourite of mine because of Scotty and Kelly's hippy disguise and the interaction with each other and the shop owner.

She eventually landed a deal with Sony Records and became an instant sucess with the classic hit \\"Where Does My Heart Beat Now.\\" Her other hit \\"If There Was Any Other Way\\" also made the top 40 proving that the American public could possibly love her as much as they did in Quebec. Even though this album was releaed in 1990 there is most definately an 80's pop sound to it which some newer fans may not like. Her voice sounds flawless throughout. Some critics have referred to Celine's voice as a \\"technical marvel\\" and I agree. She can put emotion and power into a song unlike any other artist pop singer out there.

The interesting thing about this album is that it seems to be a false-start pop artist launch, in the sense the the sound of it, the synth-pop backing, doesn't seem to have carried off in her later english language recordings. \\"Where Does My Heart Beat Now\\" seems to be kept off most of her hits comp albums, though it was getting extensive mall overhead play at one of my former jobs. Well, played often enough again and again and again... to be something like a jackhammer A/C song on the overhead muzak.

This live collection from Glastonbury is simply a masterpiece. It is well known that their performances at Glastonbury have been epic and this really shows that. The playing and the sound is great. We get most of the hits of course. It may be somewhat expensive since it contains the now obligatory live DVD...but what a live DVD: it contains all 16 tracks from the two CD's. It is really a sprawling work from a great band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the best","review":"Beautiful footage of the concert.

What was the engineer thinking? The original AWB hits worked so well partly because of the feeling of immediacy; the sound was _right there._ This CD sounds as if the singers are at the other end of a tunnel, and to make things worse, the tempo is sluggish and the performances sound tired.The frustrating part is that there's some good material here.

Somehow, the plot just lacks that certain McCall magic.Set in the hills of Kentucky, we read about, Catherine, who returns to her city of birth. Trials & tribulations over mean-spirited people almost overwhelm her. There is not much intrigue or fully developed characters. I do commend the authors message of how hurtful gossip & such can be.When romance writing is at it's best.... we expect rich, full, textural images and characters that make our hearts soar. Hopefully Ms. McCall will \\"return\\" with one soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"One for the Romance Lovers","review":"I have been a fan of Ms. Sala's for some time and this was one of her older books.

The Return is a very touching drama that reminded me of the fued between the Hatfields and McCoys in Kentucky. The tragic beginning had me hooked and I could not put it down. The characters, the details, the plot and the interesting twists were all excellent. Wouldn't change a thing =)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Correction","review":"In my review of yesterday I made a mistake that I wish to correct at this time. I still stand by my general comments concerning the lack of proper research. However, in fairness to the author,I wish to make one correction: the aggravating errors were not about a snake; but there were several mistakes concerning the flora and fauna found in Kentucky. I also think Ms McCall needs to learn alot more about the behavior of hunting dogs and mountain people. I apologize for my error; at the time I had just read 2 books set in Kentucky, both of which had glaring errors about the area and I had them mixed up as to which error went with which book.

As a resident of Kentucky (the book's setting) I was turned off in the first few pages by two very obvious errors concerning one snake. Authors who make money off our book purchases owe it to their readers to do research on the setting;historical period;etc to avoid this type of mistake. It's just part of the writer's job. Despite public opinion, not all romance readers are uneducated and/or stupid. If the genre wishes to be taken seriously, writers must do the proper research and/or editors need to be better informed. From now on I'm afraid that I will always wonder if Ms. McCall's other books are as inaccurate as this one was."},{"rating":"2","title":"A complement of the 2005 World Series DVD","review":"There are two highlight DVD's for the White Sox in 2005. One is the World Series 2005 released by the MLB official and the other is this. The major difference between these two is that this one is more focused on the regular season while the other one is focused on the postseason. So they are complements for each other.The special feature in this DVD is also worth mentioning. It has an introduction to the players. This is what you can see on the big screen before the game starts in the home ballpark. Another special feature is the '59 Go Go Sox song with the footage. It is not easy to grab this song on the website and I am glad they put it here. Some of Sox advertisements on TV are also collected here. The parade for the Sox and another compact highlight film are in the fourth and last.I am glad I have both of the DVD's. It is always delightful to watch the 2005 White Sox film.

You can't hear Erics singing, and when you can't do that, you miss the whole point of the gig.3. It's very short!

Unfortunately, this video has (little or) no footage of Hurley's moving pictures, but does contain the most famous still photos. Perhaps the weakest part of the video is the periodic dramatization, in a studio, of the life threatening circumstances. The snow and setting are obviously fake and don't convey the sense of suffering and harsh conditions under which the expedition labored. On the positive side, the video does a good overall bio on Shackleton, presenting him in a positive light, and showing something of the extraordinary nature of his character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ringo Lam's The Adventurers","review":"The Adventurers is a fairly average actioner from the once prolific Ringo Lam, more remembered for Andy Lau's then-record-breaking salary for a Hong Kong film (US$1.5m) than its qualities as a film. It has a couple of good moments, but its burdened by a ridiculous plot even by HK standards - after botching an assassination attempt on the uncle who killed his parents for the Khmer Rouge, fighter pilot Lau goes to America, joins the CIA, where they make him the head of the biggest triad in San Francisco so he can kidnap and marry said uncle's daughter to find out about arms shipments to Cambodia... as you do. It's not uncommon for HK films to make the plot up as they go along, but this one plays like they had a different writer for each reel, none of whom were told what the others were doing. An okay time-filler, but no more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Character","review":"Great Character and Great Stories.

I thought he was better than that."},{"rating":"1","title":"sad","review":"Loved the first series but this is mostly WAY too violent, way too depressing. The acting of course still superb, the setting as well, so if you can stomach the black outlook..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disappointing episode","review":"BEFORE THE FROST was an excellent book featuring Linda Wallander as a police cadet who is pulled into searching for her missing friend Anna. The tale is grim and horrific. The Masterpiece Theater version of this book does not even come close to following the book. Instead, we find Linda married and pregnant, with a very minor role, vastly different from the book, which revolved around her character. While I love Branagh's Wallander, the beautiful scenery, etc. this particular episode left me wanting more. Read the book. It was so much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the show; hated this episode.","review":"What a letdown! After such an exciting adventure in Riga, we are left with this bummer. I'm offended as a Christian to be presumed the equivalent as the likes of the UFO-freaks (Heavens Gate) or any blaspheming cult. Its a shame, because Wallander's character could really use some good old fashioned Jesus religion to give him some faith to hold onto."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blu Ray Doesn't Play","review":"The Blu Ray version of this work will not play in either of my blu-ray players.

Buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's what happens when a big star is full of himself","review":"Artists, even very good artists, make the mistake of believing they don't need independent criticism.This is the worst thing I have ever seen Kenneth Branaugh in. His acting is fine, but the plot is on the level of a Saturday morning cartoon. So unbelievable, I couldn't finish watching the first episode. To add insult to injury, the action moves very slowly, with lots of closeups (of Branaugh, the big star, of course). So you have something that makes no sense, but takes a long time to do it. Someone must have been doing Freudian thinking when the word \\"dog\\" was included in the episode title."},{"rating":"2","title":"Series Quality Remains High","review":"Branaugh's version of the spiritually-drained, emotionally unavailable, malnourished Wallander is easy to care about and, for me, easy to resonate with his passion. His girly ringtone, and his unshaven face return this season for another round of murders. True the high number of exotically gruesome slayings seems rather implausible, but it's worth the suspension of disbelief to enjoy the quality writing, acting, and visual style. I like it that this set of stories takes place away from the boring set of the police station and the Riga story is the best Wallander episode so far. Best if you have seen Series 1 and 2 already, but mostly understandable on their own without the context of Series 1 and 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored To Tears","review":"By the time I got to this episode, after watching all seasons, I was so sick of all the abject misery that can befall one human being.....jeeeze.....Its all about him and all his MISERY, what an absolutely depressing show.

But then we run into the same old problem: the book is almost always better than the film or television version. I can understand time constraints leading to some compression of storyline, but why change entire parts of the plot? The stories are great, why mess with them unnecessarily?

The comments on racism could have been thought provoking, but seem to imply all Caucasians have to apologize for being \\"white.\\" One chapter discusses how \\"whites can't tell blacks apart,\\" but Mr. Rock lumps all \\"whites\\" into one category, ignorant of the racism and persecution many \\"whites\\" have endured, and not all come from the same place and status. By the time he got to talking about doctors and how they shouldn't be paid, I was finished. I can hear racist rants anywhere; just because this is couched in the guise of comedy, it makes it no less of a prejudiced, racist view. Mr. Rock openly admits it is racist, but assumes people will find it amusing and enlightening. I found it to be neither. The sociology of race has been written about in more interesting, engrossing texts; I'll stick to those."},{"rating":"2","title":"Craziest Comedian","review":"There is nothing to say about this book but that it makes you laugh at every joke that is printed inside this book on the pages.

The so-called humor in this book is racist and degrading to all people. Fortunately, someone lent me this book so I didn't spend money on it. I only made it to page 44 when I realized that negative black/white comparisons sprinkled with liberal doses of the n-word were as \\"funny\\" as this book was going to get.

When I plug my Grado's in, there is wiggle in the female connection on these cables. If there is even slight movement while listening, sound gets cut out altogether, or one of the channels cuts out. It is very annoying to watch a movie and have to hold on to the connector to avoid that wiggle. I feel I can't even move when watching a movie.To rule out that it isn't a problem with the Grado jack, I plug them directly into my 1/4 cable input on my computer. When I do so, I get a healthy \\"snap\\" with no wiggle or sound cutting. I tried multiple 1/4 jacks and all have the loose wiggle once plugged into these cables.

If only some one else had wrote the book, and if it had not been so overdramatized, Missy's Murder would have recieved a lot more attention and stars. Missy sounds like an absolute angel, and Karen sounds like a complete monster. I tend to believe that even the worst monster shows some good before their monstrocity. In this book NOTHING was good or even slightly likable about Karen, The fat homely witch she was (Kingsbury's view).

Also when you try to start the disk on your WII sometimes it restarts and you have to start it again.

The adapter was also not the name brand adapter it should have been, but rather a cheap, very lightweight knockoff with unfinished edges. Add all that to the fact that when I tested out the adapter, there was very noticeable static & interference, just in the couple minutes I had used it, and we end up with a product that is not worth the money or time waiting for it to arrive.(I can't speak to the quality of the adapters that 4 & 5 star reviewers have received, it seems to be a crap shoot when ordering through this seller.

When you plug the adapter into a hole, yes it is very snug, but the problem comes when you plug something into the adapter.The hole in the adapter is very loose.

It was tight enough to hold my headphone plug, I could play away on my piano without bothering anyone and life was beautiful. But after about a week of LIGHT use.. My headphone plug doesn't stay in this adapter. Even if I try and hold in the adapter, sound will only come in though one side of the headphone. Not even the wonders of tape could fix it. I think it's hit or miss with buying this adapter. You could gamble your $1.03 and you may or may not get an adapter that works longer than one week.. or you could save that dollar three cents and put it toward an adapter that lasts.

Perhaps the only value is the author teaches you about tuning the piano using the slower beating 4ths and 5ths method (once the main method, aural tuners now predominantly use the faster beating 3rds and 6ths method). However, even this method is explained cumbersomely by the author. The section of repairing piano parts and regulation is anemic and terribly short considering the complexities of a piano.

I bought this one because of two reasons: the 900 Mhz technology and for the detachable monitor. Unfortunately, this product did not meet my expectations. First, the charging base on the monitor never kept the battery charged and after only 2 weeks of use, failed to work at all! It constanlty flashed red and then stopped flashing permanently. As for the reception, it was just so so. I got a lot of static and was not able to hear my daughter breathing or moving (she co-sleeps on my bed). For me, I need a monitor that is noise sensitive and reliable. We live in a rural area and have a one story house. A 900 Mhz monitor should have no problem in this type of setting.

Unlike the child unit, the parent unit does NOT have a charging mechanism. It runs on 4 AAA batteries. I figured \\"OK, just buy rechargeable batteries.\\" But the unit drains the batteries really fast AND it takes a SCREW DRIVER to change the batteries. If it was once a month or so, no big deal, but the batteries will die in a day or two, especailly if you forget and leave the unit on after nap time.

Every so often the base unit doesn't line up correctly and shows that its not charged when it is. The receiver part has to be plugged in all the time. If not, then you will go through batteries every couple days. Very expensive. I will say that its clear for the most part, that's why I gave it two stars, but after having this for less than 7 months it is starting to make strange static noises and I must buy a new monitor. Save your money and look for another one. This one is poorly designed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problems with Charging Unit","review":"I'm hesitant to recommend any First Years monitor, because there is a recurring problem with the charging bases.I charged our receiver for a good week or more before our baby was born, so the receiver should have had a good charge. Instead, it would flash low battery whenever I took it off the base.When I would try to re-charge the unit on the charging base, I noticed the problem. Even with the receiver properly placed on the charging base, it would only charge intermittently. I could see the battery charging light come on now and then, but by and large it would not charge at all, and there would be no light.I thought I had a defective model, until I talked to another mommy at my local Babies'R'Us store (while we both scoped out other monitors). Turns out she had also just returned a First Years monitor for the same problems with the charging base. (Also note another reviewer out here had the same problems.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"This a bitter lemon","review":"As a electrical engineer and pround new father of a baby girl, I am more than disappointed with this product. It did not work out of the box. With a 10 hour fully charged battery in the baby unit and brand new 4 AAAs in the parent unit the range was 1 foot (with or without the AC adapter plugged into it), on both A and B channels. If you buy this brand & model and have good luck that is great but why take the chance? For me it is back to the store to exchange this for something better, but first I will read the opinions, something I should have done in the first place. Best fo luck to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Charging Base Problems also!","review":"The clarity of this monitor is great, but after only 3 months of use I had to return it to the store because of a problem with the charging base. The transmitter would not charge nor would it work just sitting on the base.I loved the idea of the attachable base and again the clarity that I experienced with this monitor was great. Unforunately, I cannot recommend this product because it sounds like from my experience and other peoples experience First Years has a problem with this monitor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Speaker quits working all the time !","review":"I should've read the reviews berore asking my mother in law for this monitor.The speaker on the monitor keeps quiting everytime I pick it up. I even opened it to see whether it was due to lousy welding, but it seems as the speaker is the main problem.Since I live in Brazil there is no way I can return this but is seems to me that this is a continuing problem for all other users.Do they have 'recalls' for baby moinitors ?Other than that the reception is ok..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major design error!","review":"We can't figure out why the baby unit is rechargeable but NOT the parent's unit....It seems like it would make more sense the other way around because the parent may want to walk around with the unit. This has been frustrating when we use it at the grandparent's house, and we have to keep plugging/unplugging the parent unit whenever we move around the house. Recharging the baby unit seems not as necessary as that unit usually is stationary. The parent unit can take batteries but you have to use a screwdriver to open the case up. Otherwise, reception seems to be ok (though we don't use it over long distances), and the LED indicators for sounds are useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Monitor","review":"This monitor was terrible. Even with the volume turned all the way up we couldn't hear our baby- Sometimes he would cry and we would hear him from the other room but the monitor wasn't registering it. We exchanged it for a Fisher Price Aquarium Monitor- also terrible, a real waste of money. We now have the Fisher Price 900 mhz and it is THE BEST monitor! We have a 14 mo. old daughter and a 3 mo. old son- we love this monitor so much that we bought it for both kids. It is so sensitive we can even hear the babies breathing- the reception is crystal clear. Don't waste your money on this one- buy the Fisher Price 900 mhz."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Reliability, Take a Pass","review":"We got one of these when our son was a newborn in part to avoid interference with some 2.4 GHz devices around the house. It worked reasonably well until just out of warranty, when the parent unit broke (the switch, apparently). We couldn't return it, and couldn't repair it. Stuck with a child unit, and figuring it was just one of those things, we decided to buy a replacement pair, and just have an extra child unit we could swap in and out as a replacement. Gosh, what do you know, the new child unit broke down, and we had only one parent and child unit, and then the second child unit broke down.We didn't drop, wet, or otherwise abuse any of these units, and followed the recharge and usage instructions to a T.Whatever the reason for the breakages, and however much the features may appeal, I don't think 12 months of combined use for two units is what you would call reliable. In fact, I call it awful. Avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Monitor quit working after about a two weeks!!!","review":"We got this monitor as a baby shower gift. It worked for about a week and then it stopped. The only thing that works is the lights, but there is no sound. I wouldn't recommend this product to any parent. This kind of failure in a product of this type is inexcusable."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD CHOICE...VERY BAD !!!!","review":"When I bought this monitor, I thought it would be really neat that it could go anywhere, but the parent unit uses batteries like crazy. If this was the main problem I would be happy, but there is more...Another thing, after only having the unit for 3 months, It stopped working all together over night for no reason. The lights worked but no sound came out. It would work only if you banged it on the table or blow through the speaker...I even thought about buying one of those pumps to keep pumping air into the speaker!!! I cannot replace it since I am now working for a couple of years abroad, so I decided to buy one from SONY, which is a brand I can trust. This time I looked at the reviews FIRST. I would not recommend this model at all, only if you like a lot of stactic and interference, together with headache that does not work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst monitor I've ever had","review":"I received this monitor as a shower gift and I cannot get it to work. I've called customer service 4 times with no resolution. They sent me a replacement base and replacement rechargable batter pack, but it did not fix the problem. I believe there is a short in the on/off switch in the parent unit. This is far to much hassle for me at 9 mos pregnant preparing for baby's arrival. Be prepared, customer service consists of ONE person. I've waited on hold for over 20 mins at least twice. I'm returning this poor product for something different."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE this MONITOR!!!! Used it for almost 2 years so far!","review":"I absolutely LOVE this monitor!I really have never experienced any of the problems that anyone has complained about. Instead, over the past 22 months, this monitor has brought me complete peace-of-mind. It is so portable and easy to use. And I find it to be extremely reliable.The only issue at first was that the parent unit drains AAA batteries very quickly when not using the AC Adapter, so we bought two sets of rechargeable batteries and a small charger. That way we always have a fresh set of batteries. Problem solved!I have recommended this monitor to everyone I know with children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of static noise","review":"This monitor picks up all wireless noises because it is not digital - anything: cell phones, appliances, etc will render it virtually unusable. Why would not they make digital monitors? A digital wireless phone with monitor function would be a better solution."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like this monitor, very convenient....","review":"I am able to use this monitor whether my son is in his crib or in our living room in his swing. The child unit charges on a charger and then can be moved from room to room as needed. The parent unit can be used by battery or plugged in. We have had no issues with it and really like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"SGE2000 - great l3 switch - easy to use","review":"I have bought several of these switches and use them both as standalone and stacked switches. Great price, great product, best feature set for price/speed, easy to maintain. The only annoyance is that some of the ones I have bought have to be converted to standalone mode via a modem cable (included)."},{"rating":"2","title":"RCA to iPod!!","review":"Great, cheap item for convenience. I use several of these around my house - one in the house, one in the patio, one in the garage, one in the workshop. Every place I use my iPod and have a receiver available I have this cable connected. Whenever I'm in each area and I want music I just plug in the iPod and go. For the price it is well worth having several around. Just make sure your receiver has RCA inputs (such as for a CD player, etc.) Some of the \\"All-In-one\\" component music systems do not have RCA inputs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Splitter","review":"It's a good product and works just as advertised. The quality of the cables seems very good so it should be durable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stroller","review":"I have had this stroller for about a year now, and it's really great. I am not a runner, but I use it for daily walks in the neighborhood where sidewalks are uneven and sometimes broken. It handles very well. I have also used it at the beach, where it was also great. The stroller is light-weight and maneuvers like most jogging strollers with fixed front wheels. I also have a double jogger whose front tire swivels, and that one is much easier to turn.The basket under the seat is very roomy, plus it has another large pocket on the back of the seat and little zippered pockets in the shade. The shade adjusts all the way to the front and back making it very easy to keep little ones out of the sun.I use this stroller a lot, and it has really held up well. Aside from some rusting, which I attribute to the beach use, I have had no problems at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turning Difficult","review":"We bought this stroller so I could jog with my baby, but the fixed wheel did not allow for easy turning. The stroller pulled to the left, so, while I appreciate the arm workout, made it nearly impossible to run. We since got a different stroller. I can say this stroller is designed fairly well in terms of safety. The baby fits nicely with the secure straps. The parent bar does not adjust, however, so tall parents beware. If you are a serious runner, I don't think this stroller would be for you. I could not fit the stroller in my trunk, and while taking the wheels on and off is not hard, it's an extra hassle. The stroller I now have (In Step with swivel wheel) actually fits in my trunk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frame bent on first try","review":"I was so excited when I bought this stroller. I put it together and took it for a test run with my 2-year-old daughter in it. I had gotten as far as my neighbor's house, when the frame holding up the front wheel became twisted causing the front wheel to fall off. I didn't go over any major bumps. I have never seen anything like this in my life. Thank goodness my daughter was not injured."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great!","review":"I run this from an acoutic guitar amp and into my laptop and it records flawlessly with very little static or noise.The quality seems pretty good and so far, after two months or so it's still going strong.Two thumbs up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job well","review":"I waned to connect my amp to the computer to play some guitar effects from Garageband through the amp.I found this cable is not hard to find but it isn't easy either.

Both arrived both are sold by same company. But the batterey holder is made in the USA and the card holder is made in China. The quality control in China is sadly lacking. The straps where the velcro are adheared too are too short thus keeping you from getting a secure fit and in addition the quality of the velcro must be less as well because they dont stick well. Returning as junk. In fact the batterey holder is only slightly larger then a card holder so why have both it will easily work as a card holder too. Make them all in the USA if you can. If you can do one you can do both here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"It came with two. Does its job.

Both already have storage for CF cards. And while this will fit a CF card it also stretches enough to accommodate a battery for a Canon 40D or 7D.Because of the design issue with the Velcro like strap it can take a bit to maneuver however not really a big issue for me.Great item for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked, but didn't last long.","review":"I bought this from Target under a different name. It came in a set with a crank flashlight. The radio actually worked for me in the beginning. I used it for about 4 months. Then the crank broke. To be precise, the gears inside broke. When it worked, this was really a decent radio with good reception (well, for $10) but I threw it away after it broke since it really had no use anymore. If they would have only spent a few more cents on it, and put in metal gears, this could have been a useful, sturdy little radio."},{"rating":"1","title":"DID NOT WORK; NOBODY CONTACTED ME","review":"BAD PRODUCT.

Following the instructions, the \\"CHARGING\\" light comes on but the \\"FULL\\" light never does despite cranking it for several minutes. The instructions say you should only need to crank it for a short time. Even after several minutes of cranking, you don't hear a thing. Don't waste your money on this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"List of better products on the market now","review":"This was an OK product when I bought it a few years ago. The hand crank only gives power for about 1 - 2 x the time you crank the handle. For example, crank for 5 minutes, and you get about 5 - 10 minutes of power. Also, the reception for AM is a little below average, bad for FM, and non-existent for Weather. Not bad when it was first introduced years ago, but very substandard nowadays.I've been doing a lot of research on the topic. Here are the three top rated radios with dynamo that I could find. Make sure you get one that can take batteries if the crank fails.CC Observer wind-up emergency radio (Black)Etón American Red Cross ARCFR160R Microlink Self-Powered AM/FM/NOAA Weather Radio with Flashlight, Solar Power and Cell Phone Charger (Red)Sangean MMR-77 Emergency AM / FM Portable Radio"},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid.","review":"I bought the Innovage crank radio last summer, and recently disposed of it, generally unhappy with its performance. Was never able to pull in a single NOAA station--and I live in a state capital. FM reception was poor. Cranking for 90 seconds gave me about 5+ minutes of charge. But the final straw was the tuning dial, which became frozen; I was unable to tune it. There are better emergency crank radios out there, usually costing a bit more. I was in a cheap mood when I bought this; I will not be again when shopping for a replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor","review":"Do not buy this radio. The hand crank option failed to work on the one I purchased, which would seem to defeat the purpose of owning it. In addition, it is impossible to contact the manufacturer regarding a replacement.

Avoid Innovage Outdoor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deserves Just One Star","review":"The purpose for buying this radio is the hand crank feature. For the one I bought, after the factory charge died, the hand crankdid not recharge. In addition I tried a charger, but it also failed to do the job. All that worked was batteries.This item is marketed under a number of names including Jensen, Innovage, and Lifelong. They're all the same radio except for the name. From other reviews I would gather that you can get a good one but that's an iffy situation.Oh well, I bought it just to play around with it anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Innovage Battery Free Crank Radio","review":"The battery free portion of this radio failed to work for more than two minutes at a time after cranking for nearly one half hour. When placing batteries in the radio, it works fine, but it defeats the main purpose of an emergency radio when no batteries are available. I had to remove the Ni-MH storage batteries and replace them by re-soldering them in place. This is my second one of these radios, the first one works just fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little anemic","review":"To be honest with you, I was expecting better than this, but then, what do you expect for fourteen bucks. It's a handy little radio, and I do like the crank system. Nothing is more irritating than listening to a ball game while you are fishing and have the batteries give out. But with this little radio, crank it and presto! You got power.Now for the downside. The tuner is unbelievably poor. Even strong stations are hard to tune in. Trying to tune in weak station? Forget it. Also, the tone is very tinny. It does, however, serve it's purpose however- a general purpose portable radio which you will never lose power. But if I had to do it again, I would spend more money and buy a better radio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad design and poor quality","review":"Italian design used to mean quality. It also used to mean that the product is made in Italy. None of this apparently true.The strainer handle is made as the single shaft, it was poorly welded on to the rim and already loose and rotating, right out of the box.Mesh bowl was flattened and disfigured on one side. It was not the result of bad packaging, as I first thought, just bad quality.Italy (as wel as France, Belgium, and many other European countries) have no law that mandates to show country of manufacture on the product. If item is made in Italy, it would proudly say so. Otherwise, it says nothing. This strainer is obviously a very cheap export at a very high design price!Although I returned it the day I received it and did not use it, I think that decorative plastic handle makes it unsafely unbalanced.The only reason I gave it one star, because I had not been give \\"no star\\" option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing in person","review":"I was set to buy this purse at Target, but I didn't.

I figured that since I like relaxing, kind of New Age-y music, this would be a good one for me to buy. I turned out to be wrong. The sound effects either sound really fake or like something from a cartoon science-fiction movie. The instruments are obviously from a synthesizer. There is a sound error in Track 3. The melodies themselves are repetitive, unoriginal, and are almost identical to other tracks on the disc. I only listen to this CD for laughs now.

In fact, my daughter likes to just play the music and dance sometimes. I omitted a star due to issues we had with the \\"pen\\" that comes with it and the function of using the pen and seeing what you've done on the little screen. It is very inconsistent -- my daughter soon lost interest in using it with the activity sheets. Rather, she uses regular blank copy paper and crayons to do activities.

I chucked them in the back of my amp, as I don't have a pedalboard, and they would always get stuck to the speaker, which I suppose is magnetic. I'm not sure if the magnetism messed something up inside of them or what, but one doesn't work anymore, and the other one is extremely fuzzy, and if moved at all, it creates a horrible buzzing sound (like when you plug your guitar in with your amp on). It's absolutely unusable now. The actual jack is loose too, and it spins and can be shaken within the head clamp.I'm not sure if it was the magnet that caused this to happen, or if they were just cheaply made and unreliable, but they were very cheap, so I wasn't too bothered.
