Of course it is just an opportunity to get into print everything he has ever thought and every letter he has ever written. Therefore satisfying his quite frightening ego. A man of talent would have the ability to convert the everyday into a book, a journalist can merely report, and unfortunately does not know when to stop.However, it was enjoyable in its pointlessness and no doubt gave Queenan the autodidactic comfort in knowing a tree has been destroyed to immortalise his senseless ego further."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough already !","review":"At first I liked this book, but he just kept throwing the same jokes out over and over again. I do not think Queenan is very good at writing about himself. I kept thinking how self absorbed he was. I've enjoyed Joe's articles in magazines, but not this book.

I imagine that writing directly about yourself is much harder than doing a hatchet job on another author's work. (So few writers, so many Amazon reviewers...) Joe swings the axe like the tough kid from Philly, but his search for Sainthood by embracing shade grown coffee and cruelty free products just isn't genuine enough to be funny. I am sure any of his other articles that he excerpts indirectly in a long list of apologies for former misdeeds are much better.

In fact I found myself associating each mentoring challenge with a situation in my own environment. When skills are outlined and discussed, often it is the 'nitty gritty' of how would you really go about saying that to someone, that is not addressed. Not true here. You experience not only the dialogue, but also the toss and turn nights and the talks that don't end with the desired outcomes. I found this book entertaining as well as a keeper for referring back to for various mentoring issues. Peddy's work and family parallel story lines added to the picture of what mentoring is and isn't.The title itself is very telling and helpful as a masterplan. I would recommend this book to anyone who's goal is to make a positive difference in the lives of others.Susie =>"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent book about DSP theory!","review":"I've read many books about discrete time signal processing, but none like this!

In a search to find something to share with my students, I decided to give it a try. I couldn't put it down! The story is told from the perspective of Bud, a ten-year-old orphan. The voice of Bud is true to a ten-year-old boy, and his dialect and mispronunciation of words are endearing both to adolescents and adults. Students love his rules to live by - many of them are probably similar to some of their own rules to live by. Bud, Not Buddy reads like a fairy tale. It has a sad beginning, is full of humor and sadness, but in the end, the reader is left smiling. The book also provides some historical insight into the depression era in a format that students are likely to remember. I consider this to be a great extra!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book for the Classroom!","review":"There are so many themes to explore with this story. There are many connections to social studies that can be made with geography, the depression, civil rights, etc. The idea of surviving alone and the skills needed for doing so are very interesting in the book. I think the repetition, rhythm, dialect, and diction make the story a good read aloud. I especially liked how the abstract proverb \\"when one door closes, another opens\\" is depicted so concretely in the text. This is great for children just learning to deal with abstract symbols. It also introduces concepts of injustices and reacism in American history in a subtle and easily relatable way. The humor and believable characters make the story engaging and fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Voice","review":"(This reveiw is written in the voice of Bud.)Hi! Bud Caldwell here.

This was a very confusing book so I would tell you not to read this book because it skips around to other characters so you don't now what character you are reading about so don't read this book because you will be as confused as I was.

That is why he is looking for his father.My favorite part was when Bud Put Tod's finger in the water to make him have a wet bed. It was so funny I was laughing so hard I almost cried. That was my favorite part because it was so funny. It was one of the only funny parts in the book. That was one of my favorite parts.I like this book because it has a lot of action in it.

Bud is my favorite character. He is a lot like me. I make up my own rules, and sometimes lies so people don't question me a lot. Ms. Thomas reminds me of my mom. She is really nice. Herman E.

I guess I connect to this book a lot.Bud's mom died when he was six. He was in an orphanage at first but then went to live with the Amos's. Bud got into a fight with their son and they made him sleep in a tool shed. He ran away from there and had a great adventure you will have to read to find out!I gave this book five stars.

I wanted to know what happened next and couldn't be discouraged from doing so. Who needs recess when you have a brilliant short novel about an African American child trying to find his father during the Great Depression. He has many adventures along the way, obviously, and the book has stuck with me ever since then, even though I haven't read it in ten years or so. The one scene in particular that sticks with me (even though it isn't one of the beautiful scenes of the novel) is the one involving Bud locked in the shed and disturbing a nest of hornets. That one scared me as a kid and must have appealed to my as yet unrealized love for horror. All in all, this is a great book and I am glad that I was forced to read it in school. Most of the books the school forced us to read I enjoyed, but I think that this was my favorite of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bud, not Buddy","review":"This book was recommanded to me by a friend.

I think that the author must have spent a lot of time on the book and put a lot of thought into it. There isn't much action so it would have to have a pretty good hidden meaning to make up for boringness.I think that one of the many abstract meanings is pushing on and on and on even if everything is against you, if it's the school bully, luck, or your grandfather hiself, you keep on going. What is really cool is that the book is based losely on a true story. I really think that Curtis is a great author and I hope he keeps on writing.

The pieces by Moeran are late works appearing the latter half of the 1940s. In contrast, the Finzi pieces are early works from the 1920s and are inspired by the seasons. Moeran's Serenade is somewhat reminiscent of the Capriol Suite by his friend Peter Warlock. The Sinfonietta is essentially a theme and variations piece with a substantial prologue and epilogue. Finzi's The Fall of the Leaf is a glorious piece of autumnal scene painting. Both he and Moeran died in the mid-50s, and this piece was left incomplete at his death to be fully orchestrated by Howard Ferguson. Finzi's Nocturne has the subtitle \`New Year's Music' and is intended to be an evocation of the feelings we experience at that special time in the turn of the year. All pieces are played by the Northern Sinfonia of England conducted by Richard Hickox."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, awful, awful","review":"If I could give less than a 1 star I would.

Immature, it was more like reading a teenagers school story than a professional author.(2) No character development at all. Like the writing, the characters acted and sounded more like badly written teens than mature adults who had the capability to run million dollar companies.(3) I skimmed the parts with his friends. It was just cliched and clearly thrown in so the author could write more badly written books about them later.I really don't know how this could have been published by a professional firm.

While it covered a little new ground for those who are familiar with the Archbishop's life, the main point the author made was that Sheen had faults.Indeed, it seemed the author was proud of the fact that he exposed Sheen as a sinner, just a man. Well, even those of us who love the Archbishop already know he wasn't perfect. The author came across as a little man trying to pull down a great man.Overall, the book was a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"biography of priest and peacock","review":"This is a well written book.

That's why I was so surprised when I made my very best recipe home made chocolate chip cookies with this brand (instead of what I normally use, Nestlé) and they tasted so bad I had to throw out the entire batch. It could not be my recipe because it's the same recipe I've been using for over 40 years, loved my many. I was hugely disappointed.For full disclosure I did not buy these at Amazon so to prove I did buy and try them I include a photo above. You'll see I also tried Hershey semi-sweet chocolate chips.

The book in my opinion deserves a 5 out of 5 rating. The primarily reason is because it encouraged couples to explore both deeper levels of emotional intimacy and to explore the freakier side of freaky, without crossing the line of decency.

The author falls into gender stereotypes on the same page, implying that rosaries were used solely by nuns. And while I can't absolutely prove it, it seems unlikely that monks' robes were \\"dyed black, brown, gray, or white.\\" How would you dye something white?

It would have been a better book, perhaps, had Koppel chosen to write about the leather jacket and the stick.Readers who are able to overlook Koppel's arrogance will find little insight into international events. First, these events are quite dated. Kosovo, Monica and Viagra are not fresh, riveting subjects. Secondly, Koppel doesn't have the time to give us thoughtful insight. He appears to be jotting down a few bedtime thoughts about his day. And so often his predictions and views of current events prove wrong.What I came away with is the realization that much of our daily news stories are fleeting, insignificant events. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bushel full of Benefits","review":"My grandson loves this game and is always very enthusiastic about playing.

However, I had to comment on this book for my sheer enjoyment of reading the words! One often reads a fiction book to enjoy a good story, but this book also was a pleasure to read for readings' sake. The story goes back and forth in time and does deal with the subject of one's faith in God and one often needs pause to think about statements made. But for beauty of the written word I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who has time for this?","review":"This is a book for someone with a long life ahead. As I grow older - and I just had a birthday yesterday - I have less time for puzzles like City of God. No doubt Doctorow is brilliant, but I no longer have time to spend on diversions that turn out to be mostly demonstrations of how clever the author can be in juggling multiple plot ideas and literary gimmicks. Fiction writers should remember that their work doesn't mean a thing if the reader doesn't read it.

I skimmed through large sections of it because they were so annoying. The musings on the universe etc. were not new at all--anyone with a basic undergraduate background has been exposed to this information. The thoughts on religion, too, were very mundane. The \\"romance\\" was boring and almost non-existent. And just calling a story a \\"mystery\\" doesn't make it so. The best passages were the story of a young boy during the Holocaust, yet who but a total incompetent couldn't make such a story moving? This book seemed like a collection of journal entries that the author strung together. Very little effort seemed to go into turning it into a novel. Entire passages are repeated. It was painful to complete this book, but because I'd paid $... at the airport for it, I felt I had to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Philosophically lacking","review":"This book is not a great theological manifesto. The theology of this book is the same addled-brained, pseudo-Christian sophistry that liberal denominations like the Unitarians, Congregationalists and Episcopalians have been shoveling at us for 75 years. Great literature challenges the major spiritual and moral assumptions of the day. This book simply adopts them."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of paper and time!","review":"After reading this book, I wish someone would explain why it got the rave reviews. The only interesting parts were the memoirs of the child in the Holocaust. It was totally confusing otherwise, with no explanation as to who the continually changing first person was in each section. As to the mystery of the cross that was moved, it was never explained. What a waste of paper and time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"more convoluted than the brain","review":"This book, which I anticipated so much, having read a lot of other Doctorow, disappointed. Much of it felt to me like an introduction and I kept waiting for it to take off. I confess to not finishing it, so maybe it does do that later in the book, but it seemed to be starting and starting and starting...I wanted to be interested but couldn't find the story, at least not before I gave up. Give me the Book of Daniel or Ragtime or Billy Bathgate any time...City of God was under-edited and excessively self-conscious, like Doctorow was saying, \\"aren't I clever?\\" No, not this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomprehensible Disappointment","review":"I had really liked some of Doctorow's previous works especially Ragtime, so was anxious to check out his newest work which sounded intriguing. I got the audio book edition, as I usually enjoy listening to these in the car to occupy/save time. Unfortunately I for one was very disappointed in this one. Too much stream of consciousness and random thoughts. Little plot and no involving characters. Couldn't even finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disjointed - Unworthy","review":"Perhaps my expectations were too high after reading the Waterworks, but this book stunk. I can best describe it as a series of disjointed philosophical musings. The silly \\"mystery\\" was never explained and the author's voice kept changing. A narrative by Einstein came out of nowhere. There was no real story other than a tale of love involving a man who is extremely hard to like.A complete and utter waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"I can't remember the last time I failed to finish a book. Even with the worst of plotlines and/or writing styles I usually stick it out until the end. I closed this book after 50 pages and am not going to try again. The narration suffers from too many speakers and no way to identify them. Is the rebelious priest having an affair with the wife of a wealthy art patron? Or was that the journalist speaking? Who was looking for stolen church artifacts in the restaurant district? The book had some wonderfully written passages - but these don't count for much if the author refuses to let you know WHO IS SPEAKING!!!! I love a book that challenges your intellect, but this book was ridiculously difficult - if you make your readers work that hard, you're going to lose a lot of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"demanding but rewarding","review":"E.L. Doctorow's latest novel is indeed very cerebral. It poses a great mental challenge to any reader. However, this is eased by the fluidity of his writing. His ruminations on faith, theology, Wittgensteinian philosophy, movies, pop standards, the Holocaust, all contribute to what the author is attempting to do in this novel -- not linear storytelling, but storytelling in all its possible dimensions, which, come to think of it, is the \\"stuff\\" of life. The novel, if at all it can be called that, is a powerful demonstration of the irreducibility of life to facts, even to stories! There's not a neatness here!, which may annoy most people."},{"rating":"1","title":"impossible","review":"This is an impossible book to read. It is free flow consciousness reporting of a number of points of view which have no connection, or little. The Critical incident employed to hold the reader's attention is hardly ever addressed in the climax. There is no connecting plot line, but a series of bio's and other stuff. I read a lot, and this is one of the worst stories or works of fiction I have ever read. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A deep, tricky read","review":"This novel is presented as a writer's notebook, and it is most effectively read as all coming from the same writer's pen, albeit in different voices. It is not easy to make plain sense of the narrative structure, but things do come together at the end, when the writer makes his most cogent summary of the backstory of his proposed novel (or maybe screenplay.) In any case, it's a challenging maddening effort, best read once carefully and then quickly and smoothly skimmed a second time. Only the reader can decide if it's worth it. I definitely thought it was."},{"rating":"1","title":"City of Confusion","review":"Perhaps I was reading about the election in Flordia, as I am just as confused with both the City of God and the State of Florida. On reading the reviews of Doctrow's book I continued to feel somewhat stupid, as I have little understanding of what the author was trying to convey in this stream of consiousness. I sense the author was putting us to some kind of test and no one has indicated that the Emporer has no clothes. Harry Potter is looking better everyday and, in his favor, he is too young to vote!."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish it","review":"I forced myself to read the first 1/3 of this book, but I just couldn't finish it. I just couldn't follow it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. While it had it's moments and there was some eloquent language, I did not appreciate the resolution."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"GOD\\" Awful!","review":"This is not one of the worst books I have ever read---it is definately THE worst book I have ever read. Let me rephrase that---this is the worst book I have ever not read. I read at least one book a week. And I read a wide variety of books. While I certainly do not love every book I read, I can read the entire book and, if not totally satisfied, at least feel that the book has some redeeming quality and basis for the author having written the book. However, NEVER have I read barely 30 pages when I knew this book was just awful. Every page is like pulling teeth to get through. It is totally disjointed and so difficult to follow. And don't ask me what it's about---I HAVEN'T THE FAINTEST IDEA..... What a waste of time. I'm only glad that I had the sense to stop reading after 30 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"god is in the details","review":"i was unable to finish the book because of the plethora of scientific mistaments in the first few pages: 1.the universe is not expanding at an exponential rate as stated on the first page. it may have expanded at this rate for a small fraction of a second of it's existence, but for the most part it expanded at a much lower rate. 2. the speed of light is not 183 million miles a second as stated somewhere in the first thirty pages of the book. 3. einstein would have been able to see himself in the mirror while traveling near the speed of light. that's the major point of the theory of relativity. 3. the force of gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between two objects, not to the distance between two objects as stated somewhere near the start of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"City of God It Is Not","review":"I bought this book on the basis of the excerpt reviews on the book's cover. And the beginning of the book itself -- the Big Bang, etc. But I agree with the reviewers who have given it one star. In spite of my strong interest in philosophy, cosmology, fiction & literature & religion, the book did not sustain my interest. It does seem to be a notebook. I, too, have paid money for it; so, I will finish reading the last quarter of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"utterly unreadable","review":"To say I'm disappointed would be an understatement. This pretentious and overblown work aspires to be philosophical and grand-scale (a modern day Ulysses perhaps, but I shudder to compare this work to Ulysses which is one of my all time favorites) but is almost totally unreadable. Sure there are great snippets and some great writing, but unless you're planning on taking weeks out of your schedule, you simply will not be able to follow the threads. I'm happy to admit any shortcomings on my part as a reader for those inclined to criticize my lack of apprehension, but this work of genius really eluded me. I'll even say it went over my head. Having just finished Stendhal's The Red and the Black which was an enjoyable experience, I found reading this one a chore that I barely made it through.As I said, I did enjoy specific passages and some of the sub plots, but the pretentions to greatness and the obtuseness of the narrative wore me down. Good luck trying to get through it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Much of a Read","review":"I have absolutely doted on Doctorow for years and was disappointed beyond measure with this latest self-indulgent effort. There is here, a sense of arrogant disregard for the reader - \\"follow me if you can\\" - that is far removed from the wonderful, and so readable stuff I was expecting. Rule 1 is, was, and always will be \\"People shouldn't want to put it down\\". Not this one I'm sorry to say. Yes I admit it, I couldn't be bothered to finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious","review":"Although I have enjoyed some of Doctorow's previous works, such as \\"Ragtime\\" and \\"Billy Bathgate\\", I struggled to even finish this disappointing work. Doctorow changes points of view so often and unpredictably in the book that it was sometimes baffling to read. In the end I felt that the author was simply trying to show us how much smarter he is than the rest of us and was suffering from a serious case of pretentiousness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Say it ain't so, E.L.","review":"How did the author of \\"Ragtime\\" and \\"Book of Daniel\\" come up with this mess? He must have been cleaning out his literary refrigerator: \\"Let's see--here's a plot line that never went anywhere; here are some musings on Big Things that don't fit anywhere else; maybe I can finally get rid of these experimental ideas I never got around to using 25 years ago . . .\\" I hope this book was an aberration. I'd hate to see Doctorow go the way of Updike, continuing to write when he no longer has much of interest to say."},{"rating":"2","title":"Metaphysics for Postmoderns","review":"This is a brilliant book, only partly a novel, important to read and often thrilling, but not consistently compelling. Several motifs appear. Most resolve into the body of the piece, but a few remain frustratingly obscure. Doctorow's theme is our craving for transcendental and romantic meaning despite the failure of religion. While many postmoderns give a pass to \\"organized\\" religions in favor of a vague spirituality, Doctorow knows that if the metaphysical holds any meaning for mankind it must be vetted--tracked and challenged in all its sobersided and pop manifestations--by a community of seekers. City of God invites us in. It is Doctorow's gift that he can connect difficult theological and cosmological ideas and render them simply and vividly for his readers. We get a close-up view of the bleeding edge of contemporary philosophy. While we cannot expect closure to his tale, we can appreciate his wise guidance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this book","review":"Do not pay attnetion to the nay-sayers who describe this book as too difficult. This book will flow for you, if you experience it with an open mind. This is a deeply rewarding book by a mature writer. In the future, people will wonder that this book was not better received than it has been; in the future, people will still read this book. It is a novel about the wonder of it all, a leap from Mr. Doctorow's previous works."},{"rating":"1","title":"The artist succumbs . . .","review":"City of God shows Doctorow at his worst, succumbing to the self-love that is always tragic. Doctorow is more interested in what he knows, what he thinks he knows, and how good he thinks he can write that he failed to see that what he was writing was not very good. If you're a Doctorow scholar, obviously you need this book. Otherwise, go buy something else. Like Twain's cynical and mediocre Mysterious Stranger, no one will be reading City of God in 30 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rave reviews???","review":"Someone asked, \\"Why all the rave reviews?\\" Because no critic had the courage to offer less than rave. Critics are cult members and they must remain loyal to the cult.About the book: unnecessarily disjointed and confusing, self-indulgent, but an interesting commentary on the state of post-modern religion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Doctorow is one of my favorite authors, thus my disappointment with this book was keener than it would have been had not the writer been of such great stature. I did not finish this book. I was completely bored by all the philosophyzing and was confused by the random organization. I REALLY hated the pages dedicated to the lyrics of popular songs. What was the point? I certainly hope that Doctorow's next effort will measure up to his past works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Guess it depends who you are...","review":"I can't help but think that if this hadn't been written by an established author, it never would have seen the light of day. (For example, if I had submitted it to a publisher, I feel sure it would have been rejected as rambling, disjointed, not making sense, what's really happening & what's taking place in the writer's head, etc.) It was still interesting & thought-provoking for all that, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO WE HAVE ENOUGH WOOD TO SPEND FOR PAPERS?","review":"Doctorow is one of my favorite authors. But this time I'm really sad! Literature, philosophy, religions is my area. And I'm not a reader-of-easy-readings. And I know that there are many books hard to read but you can read. City of God, a book, may be Mr Doctorow began to write down this \\"novel\\" with a big idea, he wanted to put some new-or-old \\"things\\"in it. But there must be very simple \\"thing\\"in every book. Write a book to read! And if you want to wite a book for just a few friends, a few professor who don't like to read a novel, and a few experts who write \\"good..perfect...revolution in literature!...\\" before read the book, you have no need to publish it. You can use a fotocopy machine, putthem in files and send by mail. To many papers means to many wood even if you use re-cyclings. (Sorry Mr Doctorow. My first star just for you and second star just for the name of book)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring! Boring! Boring!","review":"The premise of the book has great potential, especially as we enter the Millennium. The writing style, however, is difficult, and the action crawls along. While I read most books within a week, I found this one to be lugubrious, confusing, and not at all interesting.Most of the characters never truly develop and the author gives each one an attitude of indifference toward what is going on. Needless to say, I was greatly disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've Read Better!","review":"The book, while written fairly well, doesn't have enough to keep the reader interested. I was more entertained by Flags of Our Fathers and Indestructible, Jack Lucas, Medal of Honor.

The clip is nearly useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good smaller version of the 45780","review":"This knife is of good quality and is a smaller version of the full size. It is easier to carry but is not a general purpose knife."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing Parts, Disappointing Quality","review":"After waiting ten days to receive this product, I was very disappointed with the quality and workmanship.First of all, the pocket clip was missing a screw and only held loosely in place by the remaining screw.The handle appeared to be fairly thin flexible plastic, and the blade locking mechanism was similar to that used on $10 hardware store models. Fortunately, there was a small thumb clip to prevent the locking mechanism from failing as it can on cheaper knives.The blade was also quite dull by comparison to Buck or SOG knives. Overall, I would rate the knife as far inferior to the $38 Buck knife sold on Amazon in materials, workmanship and quality. Very surprising for an $80 knife, and very different from the product description. Returned to Amazon for refund within an hour of receipt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Southern Christian Rock","review":"This disc was pulled from many Christian retailers be cause of a short cover of ac/dc's Back In Black by a band called Metropolitan. The nice gem on this compilation disc is of early Third Day. They do a medley of Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus-Can't Help Falling In Love-With Or With Out You. Not bad for so early in their career. There are many different styles of music on this disc all recorded live at the old Strand Theatre in downtown Marietta, GA. Another good song on here Flavor Of The Month by a band called My Friend Stephanie (they had 4 national releases since then). It's good Southern Rock and a nice little piece of history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best book I have read!","review":"I am very disappointed in this book. I have never read anything by this author before but I did read part of it before I purchased it and thought it would be good but... What I have read was a little interesting but I have not even finished it. I have gone back to it several times trying to \\"get into it\\" but am not having much luck. I am really not sure what it is, about the book that I don't like. My suggestion is to not waste your time on it. If you choose to read it I hope you enjoy much more than I have. Who knows, maybe if I finish it, I will change my mind about it. As it stands, I will not be adding to the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this series!","review":"I have read this whole series several times over. Barbara Hambly started me reading fantasy and I am thankful for it. I was lucky enough that I discovered the series after the first three had been published so I was able to read them one right after the other. I had a hard time finding something to read after them - how do you follow perfection? I would highly recommend this author and this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre read.","review":"I could not bring myself to finish this book. Poorly written and dull.

It has some creative issues, but I am definitely enjoying the story and am already done with the trilogy and on to the first stand alone book in Hambly's Darwath universe!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Time of The Dark","review":"Read this book years ago and still love it. Characters are well developed along with an in-depth plot line. Makes you think about what history of ours has been lost due to not enough accurate records or lost records due to some event. This book leaves you thirsting for more of the events and wondering what happens to everyone. Highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cross-worlds fantasy","review":"I read these when they first came out and loved them. Loved them enough that I bought them for my Kindle despite having the paperbacks on my shelf. I've probably reread them 4 or 5 times.

I will read the next in the series as the characters grow and will continue to grow in strength and abilities that add to the plot of a medieval world on another planet facing inventive Evil forces. I enjoyed the female characters who stand on their own and do not bow down before the inevitable challenges they face.

This paparazzi type of film shooting works well occasionally, and gives it a documentary type of feeling. However, when it is as often as it is in this movie you become very aware of the camera and its movements, which detracts from the story and the movie itself. All you become aware of is the CAMERA and the cameraman, and why the hell isn't he using a tripod or something?!?!? Don't most people want to get into a movie and empathize with the characters? I couldn't see how this was possible when we are constantly reminded that they are only actors being filmed by a shakey cameraman.The story was fine.

'Bobbled' individuals and spaces are placed in extra-dimensional stasis for the life of the bobble. From normal dimensional point of view, a bobble is an impenetrable and perfectly reflecting sphere. In the background of Vinge's novel, bobbling is discovered by a shadowy contract research organization in the USA which uses the technology to overthrow all governments in the world and impose themselves as a world government - The Peace Authority. The Peace authority retains power by use of bobble technology and active suppression of technological/scientific progress.The Peace War is the story of the overthrow of the Peace Authority. Decently written and plotted, The Peace War incorporates aspects of time travel, clever articulation of the bobble idea, and an entertaining future history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best scifi i have read in years","review":"I bought this book along with the seguel and i read both in a matter of three days it was just totally mind blowing the whole concept of going forward in time simply by \\"bobbling\\" yourself off, of exploring space in what would same to you a matter of minutes or weeks but in actuality a millenia ,of awakening in a distant future and the human race had vanished, like i said mind blowing an excellent read two thumbs way up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SO Hard To Read","review":"Such a lack of character development, amazingly dry and fragmented writing. I end up getting the gist after a paragraph and having to go back and reread. The author has no concept of fleshing out the 1 dimensional characters. Wili goes from dangerous thief to wunderkind under Paul's tutelage after just a few days and never looks back. Sure, people act like that in half hour sitcoms, but not in real life and it's just not a believable premise for the rest of the plot. I'm ok with boring cardboard characters if the plot is good. Alas, it's not. Bobbles. Ok. I think the author wrote himself into a corner and had to resort to magic to solve the problems in the end. In this case, the magic is the unlimited super-intelligence of the computer that interfaces directly with Wili (with no computer uprising either) and they save the day by being so amazingly super-intelligent.

And, no doubt, it would be a disaster if this were to occur in real life...The only quip I have with the book is that none of the characters were very compelling, due to a lack of development. Superior character development is one of the biggest reasons why I would recommend reading \\"Fire\\" and \\"Deepness\\" before this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was pleasantly surprised!","review":"This started off a little dry as there were quite a few characters to establish and a lot of bouncing around between them.

Thank goodness! Thought provoking ideas abound, excellent characters that behave realistically in a 'realistic' story - suspended disbelief is not merely hanging by a thread here.

He entombed himself during Cleopatras time, and does not awaken again until the year 1914 when an English Egyptologist uncovers his resting place and brings him to London. Coming to his senses in England, Ramses immediately begins to cause trouble and consume everything in his path. Handsome and charming, he is refused nothing.

It seems that Rice has found a writing formula, and uses it over and over again, plus the novel perhaps can give chills to preteenage girls from the ninth century, but all attempts to schock the reader stays just as attempts. It's amazing just how predictable the novel is, and of course, from the first chapter you can realize there will be a sequel. Please don't!"},{"rating":"2","title":"captivating, profound, incredible!!","review":"from the moment i started the book, i couldn't put it down. I love how anne rice is able to talk about history, and not bore you with it at the sametime! I cant wait for the sequel and i hope it comes out...(it there is one). The book is full of feeling and you feel as if your one of the characters within the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Mummy","review":"I have sat many an evening pouring over Anne Rice books and have never had a dull moment. This book, however, is one of my all time favorites. The charactors were a work of art. From the smells of the embalming rooms to the blue of Rameses eyes... I felt as if I were there myself. The Witches of Mayfair, Lasher..Taltos, Pandoro,all are marvelous. But being a true Eqyptian Mummy fan from Karloff until the Brandon Frasier version, this is the best by far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mistery, history and sensuality","review":"Overall, a nice book. Mystery and suspense, mixed with a bit of history and a bit of sensuality. At first, the \\"elixir of life\\" seemed too much a digression from reality, kind of hard to take the story seriously; but once you accept it and let the story take you, it gets more interesting. It would get even better if more historic facts were added, from Egypt's history, Roman Empire's history, and life in England and America by the beginning of the century. The end leaves too many hooks for a sequel, and too obviously. Still, I enjoyed reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Mummy: A reveiw by a 13-year-old.","review":"The Mummy is the first book I ever read by Anne Rice. This is a wonderful book! It's filled with adventure,exsitment, romance, and terror. I'd recamend it to anyone. (Even my best friend who never reads and she loved it almost as much as I did!) I hope you read the book and enjoy it as much as I did!"},{"rating":"1","title":"rather very mediocre","review":"Having enjoyed her neurotic and interesting immortals in the Vampire chronicles and her bits about Egypt, I was (mistakenly) enthusiastic to read this one. Well, it is a simple potboiler, with two-dimensional characters and a rather flimsy plot. Even the evocations of history are flaccid and lack subtlety. I suspect that she is writing this junk as fast as she can and thinking that this is her moment to make some money so she will make as much as she can while she can.If you are seeking high-quality gothic horror, pass this one up. Howoever, it you don't particularly care and want a story that moves along, this is OK. It is strictly throw away.Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointment","review":"Having read The Vampire Lestat I was keen to learn more about the enigmatic immortals Rice mentions in that excelent book. But Ramses the Damned turned out to be a total disappointment. You have to wait for 200 pages for some action and even then it is predictable. Most of the time the book reminded me of some B-movie script. And there is no trace of the mysteries from Vampire Chronicles. It is supplanted by a sluggish blandness. I barely brought myself to finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge disappointment","review":"I'd foundServant of the Bones (Mass Market Paperback)in my university library and had enjoyed it greatly, so I thought I'd let Anne Rice entertain me again with a book about one of my greatest interests, Egypt. She didn't.Because of the settings and locations--early 1900s London and Egypt--and the characters--a murdered British archeologist and the main character, his Edwardian daughter--I kept thinking (or hoping) I was reading an Elizabeth Peters novel. But I every time I thought it, I was reminded that it sadly wasn't by the utter badness that was everywhere in this book. There was the badness of the writing, the characterization, the story, and probably other things that I can't even remember anymore. It was basically a romance novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gold spun bandages","review":"Egypt and Anne Rice. Great combo. She has done it again with Ramses and company. The characters breath life like people from another time period and caught up in extrodinary circumstances. There are truly some great suspenseful moments, especially the opening. I enjoyed the romanticism between Ramses and Julie (will they, or won't they?). I have to admit enjoying THE MUMMY as much as INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE. It is a must for Rice fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"So captivating you lose all sense of reality!!!","review":"This is truly one of Rice's best books I have read by far. I didn't think anything could turn my interest from her vampire's but this book did it. The story of Ramses is so captivating you are their with him and really feel for him. I was completely taken away to Egypt in this book and couldn't put it down. I wish it would have never ended. If anyone knows of any book as intriguing or on somewhat of the same subject (egypt orientated) please email me. Everyone who truly loves Anne Rice's writing must read this!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't start if you wanna stop","review":"I think this is one of Anne Rice's best novels. She gave me the chills about mummies, but also showed me the human side of them. I think this is a very passionate novel which at the same time shows the beauty and glory of Egypt, something different to the description in Ramses, by Christian Jaque."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't stop reading!!!","review":"I got this book last night and I cannot stop reading it. She writes so smooth. I was instantly transported the Ramses tomb! I am only in the first 50 pages and I love it. Will keep you posted!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I finally threw it away before finishing","review":"This was the most plodding, cookie cut, predictable book I have ever read. In fact,it is the first time I have ever thrown a book away before finishing. I made a valiant effort - read about 75% of it, but then just pitched it. I feel as if this book were written just to cash in on her name. There was little effort and research. The plot was dull and purposeless. I wish I had not wasted my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable and cliched","review":"Anne Rice may have created an ingeniously imaginative world with her Vampire chronicles revolutionary with their colorfully adrogynous characters of dark sensuality and bloodlust, but she disappointingly seems to fall short of practically everything else that I have happened to read of hers. \\"The Mummy or Ramses the Damned\\" is a perfect example; it reads disconcertingly like a fatal collision of the Hollywood cinematic productions The Mummy and Encino Man, leaving intelligence scattered brokenly in it's ruined wake.This kitsched piece of literature is predictable and sad,and heart breakenly tragic when coming from an author easily capable of so much more than this cheesy Egyptian adventure that could easily be Brendan Frasier's next film. Also I have no clue as to why this book is constantly being refered to as packed full of egyptian history. As an avid reader of history books I felt there was frighteningly little actual history within Ramses the Damned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anne Rice at her Best","review":"I can't think of a more perfect book. the only flaw is that it might be nice to get a sequel, but I think it's too late now. The Mummy is a fantastic adventure story, with some romance thrown in for good measure. Ramses is found and he's not actually dead. He finds himself in early 1900's Cario, and what happens next is awesome. Even if you've never read any Anne Rice, you will not be lost, this is a stand alone novel. My husband read this book and also thought it was great, so don't be put off if you are male. Read it - you'll like it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't buy it!","review":"Although I found parts of the book held my attention there were contradictions and inconsistences. A great part of it reads like a Harlequin Romance novel. I didn't buy for a second that a powerful, charismatic character as Ramses could possible be interested in a simpering, clinging, crying, snivelling Julie. Same holds true for Cleopatra's interest in Alex. Come on! Give us some strong characters for the hero and heroine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Mummy or Ramses the Damned","review":"Don't get me wrong, I loved this book. I give it a 1 star because Rice wrote it in the late 80's and has never followed up with a sequel. There is nothing more annoying than that. Hook your readers and then never follow up. It's 2011, so I think a sequel is not in the works. Shame, Shame on you Anne Rice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it if you're not a diehard Rice fan","review":"What a stinker. An attempt to write something from the pulp horror genre (think \\"Thrilling Tales\\") that adds nothing to the category but instead wallows in obvious plot lines and poorly crafted romance....ugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the bandages it's wrapped in","review":"This was completely ridiculous drivel. I usually like sexy thrillers, but this wasn't particularly sexy, nor very thrilling. Flat writing, repetition and bad research prevented me from being able to suspend my disbelief."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anything about Egyptology can't be all bad","review":"A simply mesmerising book. Forget the Egyptology for a moment and it is the traditional bodice ripper, it sweeps you along on its romantic ride and you will love every second. The scenes on board the ocean liner make you wish that you were there to witness this romance of the century.Ramses bewilderment at all the technological advances made by man makes you see the world through a childs eyes once again and you really appreciate all we have now.Free of some of Rice's more flowery prose it is an entirely beliveable book and reminds us of how in vogue Egyptology and its archaeologists really were at the turn of the 20th century.Not so much of a horror book but a jolly good romp that grips you from page one.Even if the horror genre normally leaves you cold or romances leave you wanting to kick the dog this book will really deliver the goods."},{"rating":"2","title":"Required Reading for the Rice Reader","review":"The Mummy was rather simple, and not as complex and detailed as Rice's other books, but it is still enjoyable. The characters are hard to remember at the start of the book becuase of their lack of disiquishing characteristics, but by the second half of the book, the reader in very much involed with them. Kinda sappy, but a pleasure to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"RICE TOPPLES KING","review":"Anne Rice has done it again. This book has convinced me that she truely is the \\"master of horror\\".

She goes to great lengths to bring Ramses to life on many levels, and makes him a little more understandable, or reachable than Lestat, and Rowan. The book is full of rich imagery of Egypt, and Edwardian London, but as Anne Rice tends to, there are many climaxes and some are very long winded, and repetitive.

This is such a poor quality clamp I threw mine away. First off as preasure is applied to the work piece the clamping preasure causes the handle to walk right off the shaft causing loss of any hold. I drilled a pin into the handle and through the very soft metal rod its pushed onto to prevent this. Then found as preasure was applied to the work piece the wedge clamp section completely distorted on its mount (Plastic), so no longer were the pieces held paralell.

Their advice is based on their experience as parents of 3 children and as parents, we all know that we all do things differently.

The instructions are sufficient and if you have a TV that is smaller than 60\\", you *will* have some pieces of wood left over, so don't worry.The lacquer finish on this wood is absolutely stunning. In the picture that is posted on Amazon, this almost looks grey instead of the glossy black that it is. I would say it took me about an hour to assemble and the stand feels very sturdy. The stand also does a good job in minimizing the amount of space it takes up. The glass is a smoke color and adds a nice touch to the overall look and feel.

I was short one lock washer. One of the nuts inside the metal bar was stripped and thus non-functioning. The stand is very good looking, but whoever makes this (certainly not Samsung themselves) needs a new Quality Manager (hmmm...maybe it is time for my promotion).

The stories she told were woven together beautifully and had you laughing and crying, sometimes simultaneously. I was delighted to find \\"Cherry\\". My delight was stopped short on about page ten and never returned.Karr rambles on and on, relating boring, insipid, drug infused, meanlingess anecdotes, with no beginning, middle or end.It was so awful, I left my copy on a plane."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning: This book is nothing like the Liar's Club","review":"I couldn't wait to read this book after tearing through Liar's Club in less than a day. What a disappointment this book was! This book almost seemed a little too far-fetched. I often found it too unbelievable, especially the drug use and her almost too vivid memories while high. Could she really remember what everyone was wearing and which way the floor was was swaying when she was high 30 some years ago? I doubt it. The glib writing style is the same as the first book, but the touching memories aren't!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cherry with a big fat Pit","review":"I loved her first book and bought this one without browsing it. I trusted this writer. The first paragraph rotted on the page. Overwritten prose. So many visual images, I thought I was in Disneyland. This was written by a poet run amok. Uncentered. Goes on and on about nothing. I'll stop now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why, oh why, didn't someone stop her from writing this whole book in second person?","review":"Mary Karr is a fine writer and a compelling story teller. I don't know why she thought writing practically the whole book in second person was a good idea, but what amazes me is that no one else stopped her and the book went to publication this way.Maybe she was trying to portray something about the alienation of adolescence, I don't know. But in effect, it was just distracting and annoying to read.Disappointing after the brilliance of The Liar's Club."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is soooooooooo bad","review":"I will 100% agree with the person who says in their review is this the same author of The Liar's Club?

I'm very happy with it. Like with other kits, the instructions are nothing more than a printed wire diagram on the box. Its a pretty straight forward install. It was pretty easy. The only issue I had was figuring out how to tie the keyless system into the two leads off the actuator control box. It uses a \\"type B\\" locking system. Once I figured out what lock system it uses, it was a piece of cake. A quick Google search showed exactly how to wire it up to the keyless system. It only comes with one five wire actuator so the locks are only controlled with the drivers side lock plunger. Other kits come with two so you can control the locks from either front door. Wiring it to the vehicle couldn't have been easier. A power wire and a ground wire is all there is that connects to the vehicle wiring itself. All the other wires just connect to the actuators with pre-installed bullet connectors. Pretty easy."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WHAT I EXPECTED","review":"The playlist for this DVD was great but the recording was extremely poor. The dubbing did not go with the performance.

What good is learning without questioning? While the editing does make it a hard read, the writer does explain in the beginning why he published the book earlier than he expected. I encourage you to digest the contents and use as many historical and religious references for corroboration. It is said that history is written by the victor and undoubtedly the author has tweaked the nerves of a few people. This is history like most people taking an African history class has never seen it.

Without discussing the merits of Afrocentrism, this book is not an asset to that ideology. The book is not written well, being dry, dense and poorly laid out, rarely concise, and not especially compelling. The book contains virtually no footnotes, no citations, or any kind of proof that an academic historical work should possess. Most of the assertions are \\"because we know\\" without any real back up.The book is poorly organized and occasionally simplistic.Again, without discussing the merits of the ideology, this book is not very good. The subject matter seems wrong, ill-conceived and even made up because of the author's inability to conform to even the most basic standards of proof. If you wish for a convincing discussion of Afrocentrist though, you are better off elsewhere. This one can only hurt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Destruction of Black Civilization","review":"This is a book that gives specific details about the causation of the demise of one of the greatest civilazations on earth. The book begins in ancient times and gives names, times and places of what happened. It puts classism and racism in a broader perspective than what is usually shown."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Afrocentric \\"Feel-Good\\" Work of Fiction","review":"A classic politically correct fable to bolster the self-esteem of a people that never mastered the use of the wheel until it was introduced to them a few hundred years ago. It tells how the black man had his civilization stolen from him by the white man. Anti-Semitic, Anti-White, it tells how the ancient civilizations of the Mid-East were the product of the black man. They neglect the fact that many Egyptian mummies had blonde and red hair and that only Asians, Semites, and Indo-Europeans ever built a civilization.To the credit of Afrocentrics, when sufficient numbers of Nubian slaves were used in Egypt, racial strife boiled over. A mixed Pharoah named Taharka of possibly mixed Nubian ancestry reigned. This marked the collapse of the New Kingdom and decline of Egyptian civilization. Afterwards, Egypt remained an insignificant colonial nation of various powers from 1100 B.C. to 1952 A.D."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reply to John Q","review":"John Q made the observation that many Egyptian mummies have blonde or red hair. What he did not state is that THOSE ARE NOT THE MUMMIFIED BODIES OF ORIGINAL EGYPTIANS. THEY ARE MUMMIFIED BODIES OF WHITE ROMANS WHO INVADED EGYPT AND IMPOSED THEIR RULE ON BLACK EGYPT. The Roman pharaohs engaged in Egyptian religious practices to validate themselves to the Egyptians. The Roman Pharaohs continued the Egyptian tradition of claiming divinity of rulers, so there would not be any revolts. John Q is one of those people who are terrified of the idea that Blacks contributed to civilization in any way.I doubt that John Q even read this book at all. This book is one of the most insightful books I have ever read. However, it does not fully address the fact that African traitors originally sold slaves to Arabians and Europeans. The problem of BLACKS AGAINST BLACKS must be addressed and solved."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great launch pad","review":"This book has created within me a need to search more about African and African American history. This is the real stuff, the people, places and things beyond, Martin Luther King, George Washington Carver, and Marion Anderson, Montgomery Alabama, and the \\"60\\". No, disrespect to any of these but we are too often taught that these people, and things happened in a vacuum without any reference of what happened before them or at the same time.The most important thing Dr. Williams does for all people is to answer the question of how did Africa get to the point it currently is in. He pulls back the covers to reveal that the rest of the world did not just pass Africa by, but actively saught to keep Africa back. First, Arabia then Western Europe and its satalites have been robbing and suppressing Africa for centuries.This book is a must read, if you want to understand where we are now and how we got here."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Blues IS Number One","review":"This is one of my desert island discs that I'll never grow tired off. Orange is the pinacle of JSBX.Jon Spencer may just be a skinny white boy fron NYC, but he somehow captures (or emulates) that sort of old, dirty blues sound. And yet, explodes it! With... rock and roll.From the opening instrumental, to the classic scream-along Flavor (see how many cities you can toss in as well, once Jon starts naming them off). This is a perfect hard-driving, rock record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice beat-up photo of the CD on amazon, looks like my copy","review":"The \\"blues\\" pose of JSBE doesn't always hit the spot for me (\\"Now I Got Worry,\\" anyone?). But hey, what's in a name. Could a band possibly have more stage energy and swagger?This one hits that spot, every single time. It's barely restrained sexuality (okay, it's not restrained at all) leaks out of your speakers as the band threatens to leap out of them.I also enjoy the album they put out with Dub Narcotic Sound System."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Good\\" Jimi Hendrix-ish blues rock - you might like it","review":"\\"Orange\\" is not a great album, but it's not bad either - I think you'll simply be content with it. The singer isn't all that charismatic, but he at least sounds like he belongs in the band - I can imagine some people not liking him, though. The album is essentially Jimi-Hendrix-ish blues rock (not as much as The Mooney Suzuki, though). It's relatively well produced, and it at least sounds inspired and seemingly original. I think they definitely have their own unique sound (though it obviously has a lot of influences). Thankfully every song here is good, though none stand out as \\"great\\". The lyrics tend to be pretty impossible to make out, and even when you can they aren't that interesting anyway. They do have a pretty good sense of humor in some of the songs, however (see \\"Flavor\\" for an example). Overall it's merely a \\"good\\" record. Blues-rock fans should like it, but not greatly. Recommended.Highlights include:the entire album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably thier best","review":"Followed closely by Now I Got Worry, one of my favorite JSBX albums. And they are great live!

Chock-full of odd, transparently self-serving gimmicks (like Spencer shouting \\"Blues Explosion!\\" at key moments) that somehow resist aging. Humor: \\"Take a whiff o' my pant leg, baby!\\" is sure to become a water-cooler catch phrase. Blues? More like blues-infused rock. I'm tempted to call the sound derivative, yet I've never heard anything like this.

There is not one remotely badsong on \\"Orange\\", but if I had to pick 4 favourites I would choose\\"Flavor\\", \\"Brenda\\", \\"Dissect\\" and \\"Bellbottoms\\".This is The Blues Explosion masterpiece, currently unavailable,but all of The JSBE albums will soon be re-issued in expandededitions, after the release of a best of compilation in april.Bellbottoms!Bellbottoms!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not to be Missed","review":"I have been waiting a long time for this modern reissue of Ramsay's classic work. Wilson's edition does not disappoint. The book is beautifully printed (the old editions were so dreary) and now includes over a hundred color photos of relevant sites and images. These images are carefully placed near the texts that they illustrate. Also maps, charts and colorful sidebars have been added. Ramsay's work in Turkey is, and remains, the basis of all subsequent investigations - and Wilson is well qualified to follow in his footsteps. This book is a must for those who are interested in the expansion of Christianity into Asia Minor, Greece, and to Rome.

But the \\"Essentials\\" volumes that Marvel churns out are just that: the things which grant the absolute bare essentials of the comic. The worst part is perhaps the way in which the artwork has been presented, in a muddled and stark black and white printed on what is very much like construction paper. This complete lack of color makes anything hard to see, from simple conversations to, and most importantly, the confusing and shadow-filled fight scenes. Spend the money on the omnibus version in full color. Makes the experience of reading this collection about 50 times more enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting bit of comic book history","review":"Before buying this I had no idea Dracula was such a big part of the Marvel Comics universe. Now I know better. More importantly, it's a fun read. It reminds me of those classic Hammer horror movies. Not so much violent as creepy, atmospheric, and just a touch old-fashioned.Dracula and his hunters are the stars here. Drac is an especially complex character. The stories are a little repetative. Hunters track down Drac. Drac escapes. But the stories are still fun, still interesting.Two parts are especially worth noting: The first appearance of Blade in comics (before he became a dull half-vampire cliche). And Drac vs. Werewolf by Night.Recommended especially for comic fans looking for some history.

Devoto does the best classic punk vocals I've ever heard on this album, he does the speaking/screaming/ranting/tone and accent changes with more power than Johnny Rotten ever had. When you throw in the fact that the later Shelley-run Buzzcocks basically invented the Green Day/Blink 182 etcetera style of punk/pop on their first two albums and what we know as \\"alternative\\" on their last album, you have to come to the conclusion that the short history of rock music is Holly/Berry/Lewis, Beatles, Buzzcocks, Nirvana.

An eclectic mix of sonic seduction with something for everyone the world over. I recommend buying the CD rather than a digital (MP3) download with this album because the quality difference is noticeable but then Im a perfectionist when it comes to my listening pleasure.This entertaining album will last a lifetime and looked at like that has a pretty cheap asking price (how long does a beer last?)Well done and thank you to The Cats"},{"rating":"1","title":"Check the lamp warranty before you buy","review":"The lamp in my PB6100 only lasted 600 hours in economy mode.. quite a bit less than the 3000 hours quoted for it and the PB 6110 available now. The lamp warranty is 90 days or 1000 hours. (of course the 90 days came first...I don't watch 11 hours of television per day!) When I called Benq, the tech support said the average lamp life of people calling for replacements was 500 to 1000 hours. again, quite a bit less than what is quoted in the sales literature. He said I got the warrented life out of the lamp (90 days, I guess) and should be happy with that.By the way, I first had to e-mail to get a phone number, then waited on hold for about 25 minutes for the guy to say I'm SOL.So, instead of looking at a $400.00 lamp every 3000 hours, I'm looking at a new lamp every 600 hours, or *FIVE TIMES AS MUCH*I wish these guys would be honest about lamp life.Good luck, and may your lamps last at least half as long as \\"up to 3000 hours\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A NOVEL undeserving of praise of any kind.","review":"As I began to read this book I thought that I would get a greater insight to the Bruderhof.

He has personality, a good voice and he shows a kind of respect,trying to re-capture the true spirit of Luther's music.This is a hell of karaoke played in a nursing-home.Save your money ,do not look at the charts and wait for the next tribute album....come on,there are so many excellent producers around...Jason Miles,George Duke,Marcus Miller....I will stick with the originals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tribute to Luther Vandross","review":"Get Luther's Greatest Hits.

Out of all of the songs recorded, I only liked 3 three of them. Aretha's verson of \\"A House is not a Home\\" was simply horrible. It would have been better had Dionne Warrick (the original singer) do it. And I didn't understand why some of the artists chose songs that Luther remade anyway, such as Always and Forever.

Keep in mind that it is a tribute to Luther and not a CD of artist trying to sound like Luther. There was only one Luther!My favorite Luther song is \\"Creepin\\", so I was glad it was added on the CD, however my favorite cuts off this CD are sung by Fantasia and Alicia Keys. I liked Fanstasia's version of \\"Till My Baby Comes Home\\" because I could see myself jammin' to it in a club. I didn't care for the arrangement of \\"Power of Love\\" and would have preferred to hear someone else sing \\"Dance with My Father\\", but I'm still glad both songs were added to the CD.I believe Luther would have been proud of the contributions to his music by these artist.

As a Luther fan, I have NO desire to listen to anyone but Luther Vandross sing \\"Luther\\" songs. His amazing voice is what made these songs classics.I'm all for people taking music and making it their own but, again, some of the artists picked can't even sing their own simple songs well without the assistance of hip beats, background dancers and a booty dance, so why would they even attempt a Luther song.My advice for any Luther fan is to skip this CD and put in \\"The Best of Luther Vandross: The Best of Love\\" CD instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"where are luther's background vocalists?","review":"Where are all the spectaculars singers that were on vandross cds: tawatha agee, brenda white king, cindy mizelle, cissy houston, fonzi thornton and so on..They should have been there, and would have deserved a great place here. it's a shame! and marcus miller,Roberta Flack, Bette Midler :a disapointing project."},{"rating":"1","title":"If there was an option for NO stars I would have chosen this","review":"I am so upset that I bought this, the only consolation is that I bought it on sale and plan on selling it to a local store that buys back used cds.

Luther is the greatest singer we have ever had, and this is how we honor him?? What a shame!!In my opinion John Legend is the only pure act on the album. Stevie/Beyonce, Alica, Jamie!?, Usher and Babyface offer decent covers, but what the ... are Elton John and Celine even doing here, and what did Aretha think!!! .. this stunk big time!!Luther deserves singers like Anita Baker, Regina Belle, Howard H., Freddie J., Chico Debarge, BRIAN MCKNIGHT!!, D'ANGELO!! ... where are they??

I will admit the first time I listened I thought what in the world did I just buy? After listening again, I realized all of the great talent as well as the gifts of the artists contributing to this tribute to the greatest balladeer ever. All of the artists out did themselves. John Legend singing Love Won't Let Me Wait, Fantasia 'Til My Baby Comes Home, Alicia Keys (featuring Jermaine Paul {who is Jermanie Paul?}) If This World Were Mine.....They all gave a great new look at songs by Luther!!

I was deeply saddened by his death and I am even more saddened that this album was made. This man with not only the beautiful voice and the wonderful way of arranging his songs, should not be copied. what his mom should do is get some of his never released tracks and tribute him that way. When this albums was completed didn't any of these artist think, you know none of us can compare to Luther, so let us not even attempt this. Maybe as a tribute put one of his songs on their next album, but not this way.

Considering the incredible array of talent gathered for this tribute to one of music's greats, the results are somewhat predictable, by the numbers and rather mundane. Instead of siezing the opportunity to truly make the numbers their own, most of the tracks are rather boring straight forward covers, and some such as Aretha Franklins, are downright terrible. Only legendary Donna Summer manages to rise out of this quagmire and deliver a truly inspiring, upbeat version of The Power Of Love and that alone saves this tribute."},{"rating":"1","title":"CONTECT PROTECTED!!!","review":"CONTENT PROTECTED IS A VIOLATION OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLES RIGHTS, DON'T SUPPORT ARTISTS THAT ALLOW THIS SOFTWARE ON THEIR ALBUMS--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"},{"rating":"1","title":"No one can sing like Luther","review":"I am sorry to say that no one came even close to Luthers soulful voice and vocals, the songs on this tribute sound horrible,the only thing I learned from this tribute is that Luther was a true artist and legend.

He and an incredibly tight band tore the place down. The show was so impressive, I went out to Virginia and bought this album that night.Needless to say, there weren't a lot of turntables installed into vehicles in those days. I had to wait until I got home to give that new vinyl a spin. Wow.If you don't own or buy any other Dirk Hamilton album/disc/mp3 download, you owe it to yourself to grab this one. As mp3 downloads go, how can you go wrong with \\"Grow a Rose\\"? But do your ears a favor and choke up the bucks for the whole enchilada.

I love this film!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Criminal Law: A landmark in the careers of Bacon & Oldman","review":"Criminal Law, released in 1989, gave a door-opening opportunity for Gary Oldman to enter the world of \\"real\\" Hollywood movies, and provided an opportunity for Kevin bacon to demonstrate his talent in a career slow spell. The plot is a well constructed thriller with Bacon playing the malevolent client of Gary Oldman's maverick neophyte criminal lawyer. Oldman gives an excellent portrayal of a young egotist torn between the oath of client confidentiality and the knowledge that his client is guilty. Bacon is brilliant as the cold genius client. A third very creditable performance is delivered by Joe-Don Baker who plays a tenacious wizened investigator. Overall the script provides for a tense thriller with much food for thought, laying the groundwork for similar movies one and a half decades later such as \\"Seven\\" and \\"Kiss the girls\\". I'd recommend it highly, but not on a dark rainy night if you're alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Criminally Insane","review":"I had this on VHS for years so you can imagine I'm thrilled to have it available on DVD now. I know a number of people that enjoy this movie. Any critic that thinks this movie lacks wit is criminally insane. This is a fine thriller with Gary Oldman and Kevin Bacon turning in excellent performances. When a Boston attorney, played by Oldman realizes he has got his client off a murder charge when he was guilty, he tries to figure out away to make retribution. But the killer, played by Bacon, isn't going to make that easy at all. If you enjoy this be sure to catch \\"The Juror\\" and \\"The Client\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dated Thriller with Interesting Backtory","review":"The backstory surrounding \\"Criminal Law\\" is more interesting than the film itself. Infamous Canadian Schoolgirl Killer Paul Bernardo was obsessed with this film and with Kevin Bacon's twisted character Martin Thiel. Mr Bernardo even changed his last named to \\"Teale\\" shortly before his 1993 arrest, in a bizarre nod to this mediocre film. Gary Oldman plays hot-shot Ben Chase, an Attorney who manages to get Thiel aquitted of murder charges more than once. Thiel, a preppy son-of-an-Abortionist, loves his clothes, boats, and doing creative things with flaming diapers. Tess Harper, Joe Don Baker, and Sean McCann play the cops in earnest, but this is Oldman and Bacon's show. Neither is especially successful here: Oldman, with a bad 80's haircut, is wild-eyed and soaking wet for most of the film and Bacon lacks the depth to play his role. Christian Bale did a much better job playing a near-identical role in \\"American Psycho,\\" a better film than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Performances, Dumb Plot","review":"A pompous and predictable thriller that covers all-too-familiar territory, this one is about a lawyer who helps set his client free of murder charges only to find out he was guilty of that crime and of another killing. Those who prefer smart thrillers will be disappointed, but with its occassional moments of intriguing suspense and credible performances by Oldman and Bacon, it's hard to look away."},{"rating":"2","title":"inside book says","review":"Chocolate of course is the stuff of which fantasies are made. Rich, dark, velvety-smooth fantasies that envelop the senses and stir the passions. Chocolate is madness; chocolate is delight. You'll behold chocolate in all its infinite variety: chocolate chip cookies, chocolate honeycombs, double-dipped chocolate-covered cherries- shall we go on? - brandied chocolate Bavarian, chocolate raspberry trifle, fudge ice cream and how about all those chocolaty cakes and pies and those mousses and malteds, those swirling parfaits and puddings. O wondrous book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very unhappy...","review":"I purchased this book for sentimental reasons to replace my copy which had disappeared. I had once come in first place in a baking contest creating a huge chocolate \\"cabbage\\" cake like the one on the cover. Although the image is inside the book, the front cover has no image. I expected the book to be AS PICTURED. I was duped."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice ideas. Not so nice recipes","review":"I love the title of the book. I love the pictures. I love the ideas it has (esp. the chocolate cabbage). But at least a few of the recipes haven't worked for me. I've made the cabbage cake at least 3 times and I've given up on the sponge cake core. It comes out pretty dense, and I use another sponge cake recipe.Another recipe, chocolate honeycombs, says to mix the wet and dry ingredients and then cook to a simmer. With twice as much dry as wet ingredients, there is no way you can simmer this.So I would actually recommend the book, but take everything it says with a block a salt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just the first impressions.","review":"For a book costing around $75, and that even after a rebate of in excess of $22, in terms of layout, binding, print quality, and paper quality, it is an absolute disappointment. Having spent that much money, I was hoping that just the production quality would make me keep turning the pages until there was none left to be turned; I must admit that in terms of that particular aspect alone, it has proven to be quite the opposite. For the list price, I would have difficulty picking it up and going through it knowing how much had to be spent in order to get ahold of it. Overall quality, not just the quality of the content, of the item has to be in line with the price tag; in case of this particular item, that's just not the case."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"Unfortunately, this book did not live up to its fascinating premise (time travel through wormholes) and the \\"teaser\\" synopsis on the back cover. It begins well, and the first 90 pages are excellent hard sci-fi. The book quickly degenerates into a poorly disguised pulpit for radical \\"environmentalism\\", however, with the hero discovering a model to unfailingly predict catastrophic environmental degradation. The essence of this story is that climate models are always right, and the empiricists are always wrong. The novel contains profound elements of eco-conservatism and a lot of poor science. Among other things, apparently the author didn't know that algae was a plant, and produced oxygen. In sum, I strongly recommend avoiding this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depths of patience","review":"I read it a second time because I couldn't remember what happens at theend, only to realize that that had been because nothing happens at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Ski Socks","review":"Got these for our 2-year old skier - they are very soft and comfortable.

Read this book later..but read it.","review":"Research is the strength of this work, not the telling of a major battle. It is difficult for the reader to grasp the overall view of this clash as it is layered over with detail upon detail. From mass movements to small skirmishes, it is told in the driest of writing style. The usual complaint levied against military books, inadequate maps, can not be claimed here. The maps are numerous and like the work itself, detailed. As a reference tool the book is invaluable and for this it merits the rating given. An interesting read it is not but it does belongs on the shelf of those with a serious interest in the Bulge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yesteryears in Uruguay","review":"This is an interesting book which reflects the first-hand impressions of an English immigrant to Uruguay. Highly recommended for all those interested in the history or rural life in South America's southern cone. Though somewhat disjointed, the book is a detailed, often-humorous outlook on how a foreigner must have felt when confronted with local idiosincrasies and habbits. A sort of 'Hitchhiker's Guide to Uruguay' of the early 1900s, it takes the reader through a variety of situations which the author himself experienced and how he often muddled his way out of them. An entertaining read, though the value of the editor's long and rather boring prologue is highly questionable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tough And Tasteless","review":"This well packaged package of beef jerky tastes relative bland and is relatively tough and chewy, I rate it below average in all categories as it is a sub-par product even when compared to commonly marketed brands such as Jack Links.

It wears well and is very attractive. Goes well with casual or dressy clothing. The 2 tones allow me to mix and match other gold & silver toned accessories. And amazon has it for an excellent price.

A book that has to be in each fan's library."},{"rating":"1","title":"It will make you appreciate bad movies...","review":"This movie is so bad that I look forward to seeing some movies that suck now. You don't know how crappy a movie can be until you see this. Forget the James Bond spoof angle - this movie is mostly torture with a couple of funny lines in it. I think John Wardlaw went to film school and cut class... No one can act, but the script is even worse. Most of the lines you'll hear in this one are not even words, just grunts and moans. Watch this thing only if you get some sense of adventure from enduring bad films (you don't know what bad is yet)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disapointment","review":"I must say I was very disapointed with this film. I'm not sure if my expectations were too high, or my sense of humor is way different then those who made this film. Either way, I would suggest that you rent it first before buying.I thought much more could have been done with the independent film. I felt the acting could have been better as well as better props and sets. However, it's obvious that the director has a knowledge of Bond films. The names of the characters as well as the plot were very \\"Bondish\\".Being a musician, I was impressed with the theme song. I thought that was just great. But other than the cool tune and the opening credit sequencing I was disapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deserves a negative star!","review":"This is such a bad movie, do not waste your money or time!

Also not very good in the picture department."},{"rating":"2","title":"In three acts","review":"The first part of the book reveals a lying sociopath that charms his way through life and many out of loads of money. John Robinson is a brazen narcissist, given himself awards, learning computers while incarcerated, leading a double life and really ripping off people. I was actually amazed at how bold and smart this guy was.Next we get details of his brutal treatment of women he met online while posing and a wealthy Gorean Dominant. Many tawdry details are given and over the years women turn up dead. A dear friend of one of the missing women worked with police to bait John Robinson. Loads of details are given. I almost felt embarrassed reading the intimate details of their sex talk.The last bit deals with the conviction and wrap-up of the case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tingly Good!","review":"I purchased this mask on the recommendation of a friend, who loves it. I've been using the mask two or three times a week for the past month - it leaves my skin hydrated and rosy.

The benefits of oxygen have really been pushed by skin care professionals as of late... so this product would naturally be a hit. I've had the Bliss Oxygen facial and it's AMAZING. I also use their cleansing milk every day.So after my facial, I decided to give this a try. My skin often feels congested, as if it just needs to be \\"aired out.\\" The packaging is a great pump that seems like it's of a high quality. The mask comes out as a peach-ish gel that quickly starts to foam up. This part is kind of cool. The sensation of all the bubbles on your skin is almost energizing itself... but the actual results left me wondering why I spent 54 USD on this mask. I gave it a chance and tried it again a few days later... still nothing. My skin didn't feel any smoother, nor did it look any better. Masks are intended to provide visible, if not temporary, results and this one fails."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trying for the 3rd time-Will Give update- Made me break out","review":"First off, I have had the Oxygen Facial at the BLISS SALON in Boston and this mask is NOTHING like it.The Real BLISS Salon Facial left my skin almost perfect!

Also OK are FIRST MEN IN THE MOON, MOONRAKER and LOST GALAXY. THE LOST GALAXY's opening passage bears an unmistakable resemblance to Goldsmith's CAPRICORN ONE.I don't know how many packagings of this disc there've been, but... at least three.

The camera-work(Nikos Andritsakis) is a welcome initiative although it's not thoroughly innovative.The pace is good thanks to a water-tight script (Urmi Juvekar) and the running time of approximately two hours only serves as an advantage.Most of the newcomers have been pushed to give a good performance and some of the applaud goes to the director(Dibakar Banerjee) here.The dialogues are sharp but at times a tad stinging to the eardrum.There's a lot of negativity in the film, and maybe it's due to the nature of human psyche but the bickering and bashing don't fail to entertain you for even a single minute."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the Graduates","review":"'Stories for a Grad's Heart' is truly a worthwhile book for graduates.

None of the songs show any melodic promise.The change- an awful repetitive dirge of a number, with the same riff repeating over and over. No melody can be heard through the noise. I was shocked by how tuneless this number is. Almost grunge like.The orchestral version is not really better. Nicely arranged, just don't think there is much of a melody here.A table in the sun- so dull. Soft tune, without any direction and sparse poor instrumentation. The singing is off too on this tune.Bad moon- boring rock song, with predictable chord changes and no movement in the song. Shapeless.

I'd rather hear a compilation album of the straight songs dropped in it than this rather uninspired hodgepodge.For example, nobody's mixed the Chemical Brothers like Dave Clarke for the simple reason that it's practically impossible to improve on perfection and that's what this album appears to have attempted to do.If you already have Fat of the Land, The Prodigy Experience will do a better job of showing you Liam's roots and this album is hopefully not where he's headed.Save your money for the Prodigy's next inspiration.

Underground? Pop? Fat of the Land is not pop. In fact, It's heavier and harder to get into than Jilted generation.

Expect Liam Howlett spinning vinyl...and believe me, in a fun, groovy-refreshulous way... The Dirt Chamber Sessions Volume One is nothing less than a classic mix.

A good one at that, I might add.All the mixes are fairly clean, no real alterations from liam, its like he cut out sertain peices of cool songs and pasted them together and added a beat.

Liam Howlett is a dj who should stick to taking three second samples and messing them up into the big soup of the prodigy's next original album. for all of you who thought this was the prodigy it isn't. it's liam in his basement fiddling about with his turntables and making a record that is his favorite music. it would be an interesting record if he could actually mix, though. if you want a great mix cd but the chemical brothers 'brothers gonna work it out.' if you don't think so...email me and we'll have a nice little chat."},{"rating":"1","title":"just what I think","review":"Instead of doing a good cristian thing (and if he wants to PROTECT children) and write how to be a good parent, raise your child to become a good person, he invest his time on debunking Harry Potter ..

Tim is a 5 year old visiting a kindergarten class before he starts school. In self-narration, he tells the reader that he is nervous, but he soon learns of all the fun things he will do, including crafts. Tim also discovers that he will learn how to count, write, and how to measure and make cookies. At the end of the day, Tim concludes that kindergarten will be an exciting place.Rockwell's use of color is the main highlight of this work. The primary colors burst forth in vibrancy, accentuated and augmented by the use of watercolors. The art looks as if it could have been drawn by a child, which surely will create a sense of realism for the young reader. The absence of lines and pencils presents depth and texture to the art, but children will be drawn into the book by the actions of their peers in the story. A good book for preschool storytime to prepare children for school."},{"rating":"2","title":"Banging!","review":"Check it out! I used to play this cut at the end of all my clubs and it used to bang! Fools didn't want to leave until the joint went off!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Toothless tripe on toast!","review":"I didn't expect much from this book, but it failed to meet my lowest expectations. This is nothing more than a trashy, throwaway romance novel with fangs. The so-called plot is just poorly written filler between third-rate sex scenes. The characters are one-dimensional, the \\"world\\" they live in is convoluted without depth or definition, and the author routinely ignores the Alaskan winter and other plot points when it suits her. Laurell K. Hamilton does better scary studs with bite. For a truly excellent read, try Charlaine Harris' Southern Vampire series for witty dialog, humor and a real plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"Unbelievable. With all that the character has suffered the reader would more readily believe that Zarek will go postal with a flame thrower than fall in love and be redemed.Even fantasy romances have to visit reality sometime and having spent the previous book in the series developing Zarek as a pathological character you cannot turn around and cure him in 300 odd pages. Some stories only exist to carry you from one sex scene to another... this one barely reaches that level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Master of the pen","review":"Sherrilyn Kenyon weaves such fascinating tales and creates such lovable characters, my favorite of which is Zarek, from Dance with the Devil. This book keeps you on the edge of your seat and by the end, you will have fallen in love with the prickly, yet big-hearted Zarek. Each character leaps off the page and into your heart. Dance with the Devil is an unforgettable read that earns itself a special place in any library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meow.. Kenyon does it again","review":"Sherrilyn Kenyon has a nack at the tragic hero love stories and this one is a good example of this talent.You really start to feel for Zarek in this book. You can't help but feel for him once you start reading about all the pain that he has gone through."},{"rating":"2","title":"my favorite so far. By Jean W","review":"Dance With the Devil is my favorite DH book so far. I found the series on my kindle about a month ago and have been reading them in order. I really liked DWTD because the plot of the story was a little different. I was starting to get a little bored with the repitition of the same plot with different characters in the other books. It just seemed like the end was always the same...The couple fall in love and must find a way go get the Dark Hunters soul back and then they live happily ever after. While I love all the DH books thus far it was a refreshing change of pace. I totally agree with most of the other reviewers in saying that Zarak's charicter was fasinating. Throughout the book you become more and more in love with him and his strength to servive so much creulty. I cried multiple times while reading and laughed just as many. I hope that the rest of the DH series continues to fasinate me as much as DWTD has."},{"rating":"2","title":"Might be my favorite hero","review":"After each book, I fall in love with the hero. The first book gave us Julian, then Kyrian and then Talon. But after this book, Zarek might be my favorite. Ms. Kenyon sure knows how to create heros that are to die for. And we can't forget the heroines. Each heroine seems to compliment their hero so perfectly. Anyway, this book is like the others, a fast read. You won't be able to put it down. Zarek is the last person anyone wants to be around. He has been isolated for so long and has built up walls to protect himself. But Astrid slowly chips away at the walls. The book has humor, action, suspense and love. It's a great book and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My, oh, my Zarek","review":"This book was......amazing.It's funny, because the first Dark-Hunter book i had read was \\"Kiss of the night\\" (a very good book, but it unfortunately told me about Zarek and Talon's stories before i had read them so DO NOT start with this one)which made me read the rest. I like to read in order so i began reading \\"Night Embrace\\" (Talong's story) but i was absolutely itching to get into Zarek. He just seemed so much more interesting and deeper than Talon. And boy, did Kenyon NOT disappoint!Filled with more heartbreak than Romeo and Juliet (albeit with a happy ending) and more LOL humour than a comedy festival i was left utterly fulfilled yet wanting. Wanting to rip off Zarek's clothes that is!Truly, one of the best reading experiences i have ever had, i could not (and did not) put this book down. Read it if you love paranormal romance, hell, read it even if you don't!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best one in the series so far","review":"Out of the Dark-Hunter series, this is the best book, and best hero, so far. It's amazing that a hero like Zarek can take so much pain and can actually learn to love. A bit corny, but the humor makes up for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alaska is starting to heat up","review":"A blind judge, a scarred warrior who has a troubled past, and a sarcastic shape shifter.

Very entertaining-has all the attributes we've come to love and expect from this author. She definitely does not let you down ... interesting all the way to the end!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"To Die For","review":"Sherrilyn Kenyon's imagination blows my mind. I found myself sobbing less than half-way through this book (and I'm not a crier) when, as a reader, I was taken into Zarek's unbelievably horrid childhood. I felt so much pain reading those passages, that I ached to make this hero feel better, to make him warm, and bake him bread (if you read it, you'll understand). On top of that strong emotion, I laughed out loud at the sarcastic witty dialogue and fell in love with newly introduced characters like Simi, the demon and Sasha, the timber wolf.I absolutely loved this book!!!!!!!!!! From the hero who wants only to remember how to laugh, and the heroine who longs to feel emotions long left dead inside her, this book grabs you and sucks you in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zarek - Dance With The Devil","review":"My favorite of the Dark Hunter series to date. Sherrilyn made me feel what was happening throughout the book. A combination of laughter and tears with a welcome twist at the end. And as a bonus, for those who have a thing for Acheron, we find a more indept characterization as well. Extremely Good Reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another winner","review":"I absolutely adored this book. Zarek was a perfect hero. His life was so cruel, but Astrid knew just how to soothe him and heal his wounds. I loved reading about them. And I loved learning more about Ash.

If you have any pity or compassion in you, skip this one! I can't believe it's in the romance section since I can't remember a single part about the romance.

At its core, it is a classic romance/thriller setup: the innocent heroine, driven to help the surly handsome man with his dark past even as he pushes her away. The author's intention to spice up the conflict by developing her \\"Dark-Hunter\\" race and throwing in some mythological references is perfectly fine. The book could have been positively delicious if it were well-written at all.The fact is that this author's writing style is clunky, heavy-handed, and rife - no, DRIPPING - with cliches. Her dialogue is insultingly cliched as well.This author personifies the reasons why so many people make fun of romance novels - it's ill-concieved and badly written. The only thing the author seems to have spent time on are the sex scenes. She certainly didn't research any mythologies or her setting (Alaska) ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dance with the Devil","review":"Please don't waste your money , this is the most boring book I ever read.My classification is \\"minus 5 stars\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this book!","review":"I cannot recomend this book highly enough! I loved it! This is a very touching story about a man who has had no love in his life, but practically on the eve of being put to death he falls in love with the very woman who is to judge him. This book is fast paced and interesting, with lots of other colorful characters; including a child-like demon, a mind reading dog, and gods galore. A must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very touching","review":"Not many books make me cry, but this one just about did it. As much as I loved this book, there were a few red flags that should have had Zarek asking questions. However, since the story was so touching, I easliy overlooked the few flaws. Also, Zarek was a little distracted by Astrid. This is one of the best Dark Hunters yet. I am looking forward to Ash's story, but not if his mate turns out to be Artemis."},{"rating":"2","title":"How many Z's are out there??","review":"I like Zadist, I mean Z, I mean whatever!

Interestingly, these are the type of stories people always seem to love the most in a series. I have to admit, as much as I don't want to like them, I'm definitely a fan.I guess I just remind myself that this is a story a.nd real life is not like this. I'm always glad for a happy ending and a mended heart :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dance With The Devil-I loved it!!","review":"Dance With The Devil was a very enjoyable read. The characters of Zarek and Astrid were both extremely well written. Their relationship was interesting to follow because it took a while for Zarek to warm up to Astrid, which was understandable given his horrific experiences. The action was a page turner. I would highly recommend this book for paranormal romance lovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than just a romance novel","review":"\\"Dance with the Devil\\" is my favorite of Kenyon's \\"Dark-Hunter\\" series so far. A large part of the novel is dedicated to character development, and the characters themselves are much more complex than previous novels.

What I found was just a political piece about pro-homosexual views and running the \\"ungovernable city.\\" The main character seemed like more of a vehicle for a politically motivated piece than anything. He had a weak back-story, and seemed to be a cookie cutter character. I enjoyed Y: The Last Man, and even though it had lesbian scenes in it, it was warranted. There were no women in the world!

What started out as an interesting trip into how a hero decides to forsake his power and become an ordinary man trying to better the common good through political office has devolved into an alien/preternatural attempt at world takeover and the destruction of the human race. The original plot line had humor and personal drama, this not so much and I'm wondering if I should bother continuing on with it.So, if you start reading this because you like Brian K.

Watchmen, Squadron Supreme, Wanted, Authority and Top Ten. If you're still telling your friends why they should read these (even if they won't) then I strongly recommend you check out Ex Machina. There's a strong super-hero component to the story, but the focus is on real world concepts like freedon of expression as seen through the life of ex-superhero, now mayor of NYC.Along with Sleeper it's one of the best reviewed monthly comics from the past couple of years that no seems to be reading. Here's hoping being collected into a trade paperback keeps it being published; I like getting my fix monthly. But I'll be buying a couple of these as gifts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most annoying comic ever.","review":"More than half of this comic is characters preaching politically correct politics. Even worse its not even intelligent but the kind of self impressed rantings you'd get from an 8th grader who just finish Animal Farm. Brian K.

This first volume likely stacks up pretty well there. I rate it versus a larger universe, where really great art is ... rare. In this genre, so far, there are, for me, two standouts:Watchmen, and slightly lesser, but still great,Batman: The Dark Knight Returns. This doesn't even come close, and would get, charitably, three stars.Now, price. I paid $10-ish for the first volume of many, which barely lasted me an hour of reading. You can have the complete sets of the above masterpieces for around $10-15 per. I'm sorry, but I'm not a comic-book guy, so this just feels slightly like a rip-off to me.

Luckily enough for him, historians, and adventure lovers alike, he was on the winning side and survived to tell his tale. His tale is his aspect of the venture among the soldiers who fought the battles, rode the trains, suffred the hardships of civil war, and tasted the glow of victories won on the way to the capitol city. It's gritty, putrid, rough and tumble and the food isn't great but at the end you get a heck of a kick from surviving it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy the General Books edition!!!","review":"Do yourself a favor and do not purchase Insurgent Mexico as published by General Books. Please look further since this is a great book and should be read as intended by the author, not as published by General Books.

According to General Books, \\"we have recreated this book from the original using Optical Character Recognition software to keep the cost of the book as low as possible.

Caveat emptor!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from this book!","review":"This book completely spoils the pleasure of reading John Reed: every other word is a misprint; some phrases break into the margin of the page and end into nowhere; almost all chapters end in the middle of a sentence, which is continued (in the lucky cases) in the next chapter. Even the \\"look inside\\" pages are fakes: they are the pdf of an old edition, from which the present one was, with utter incompetence, re-typed. This is not a book, this is a distillation of desperate incompetence and blatant brazenness."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Reed's writing style is great","review":"This book was written over 80 years ago, so as military journalism it is quite dated. However, the author's portraits of people and places are so vivid that the characters and events seem to come alive. The author displays a novelist's talent for description.

Avrum Ehrlich gives his readers a detailed history of Chabad leadership and each leaders struggles and achivements. However what I disliked about this book was Ehrlich's constant disaproval of hasidic sources claiming they are basically lies. He claims to have a purely scholarly viewpoint yet uses sources that are defectors from chabad that have a very anti-chabad view. Obviously anyone who considers any of the Chabad rebbe's as a powerful influence in their life will probabbly be disapointed in this work. It does however give a good solid history of leadership in the chabad movement. I just think there are some things in the book that go to far that only serve to cut down certain famous chabad personalities, while adding nothing to the history of the movement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Personal Glorifcation","review":"Ehrlich seems to be another guy who has an aganda and is trying to make himself popular, while having no REAL TRUE insight into what go's on in the CHabad Movment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great!","review":"I had this pan for 5 years before I upgraded to a Le Creuset skillet.

If anything I think Sitchin was too nice to flick this guy off like a bug if this was the case. Martell is neither a Sumerian scholar, nor is he really that well versed in the complexity that is the ancient alien theory. He's also got the conceit of a 12 year old pageant-goer. Anyway, my money got sucked in before I knew who he was or that he was just about doing a bad attempt at taking credit for Sitchin's work, but I'd recommend picking up ANY Sitchin DVD or Book and you'd learn much, much more than you would by picking up this crap\\".I couldn't say it any better.

Orchestra and chorus are fine, as is EMI's sound. But this CD runs up against one of Britten's most brilliant recordings, a version from 1960 that surpasses even the high standards set by this genius of a conductor. Britten communicates a sense of joy, revelry, and mystery that Previn can't touch.In addition, Peter Pears does some of the most superb singing to be heard from him, and all the other soloists are nearly as inspired. Despite its seemingly simple subject, the Spring Symphony's 12 disparate songs and lack of easy melody make it a tough work to bring off. I'd recommend going for a truly great recording, even though this one is a very good effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent study of part of the world war one","review":"This book is an excellent study of the first world war as it played out in Africa. Its from a very British point of view, but the author excells in making history into an interesting series of stories rather than a recetation of events and facts.Africa was a sideshow in the war, but sideshows always provide fields for the individual and the exccentric to do interesting things. And part of the story of the book is how some germans managed to fight in Africa all way to the end of the war in 1918.If the book has faults, its that its treatment of the postwar settlement is too short and it is too much from a British perspective. But still the best book on the subject with no serious rival."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent account of this WW1 campaign","review":"Byron Farwell offers the reader a well researched and well presented account of this often forgotten campaign of WW1.

Hunting a German Cruiser on the Rufiji River by an elephant hunter (The African Queen?). Accounts of some of the terrible battels on land, one where both armies were routed by killer bees! Men fighting with spears, knobberries, machine-guns, planes and armoured cars.

They invade Malta, which clears up their supply lines, and send more forces to Africa. The British are cut off, and are forced to sue for peace. The Germans then invade Russia, from Iran as well as from Germany. The Russians fall quickly, as the germans have more manpower than historically, plus have access to British heavy bombers to bomb the Russian factories in the Urals.

Now I just learned that he is divorced from Julia. Marriage is hard work, and I don't judge him for the failure of his marriage. But it may be a cautionary tale to the rest of us that we have to take advice from others about relationships with a grain of salt. Despite all of Kenny's song lyrics and prose about finding success in relationships, in the end he couldn't make it work forever either.That doesn't mean marriage can't succeed, but we might do better to study couples who have been together for a lot more years to get a glimpse into what works and what doesn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"OH, MY, GOD!","review":"These people are so deluded and in love with the idea of their own \\"preciousness\\" that it could make the reader dry heave.

Although, some of the footage is a duplicate of part 1, much of it is unseen before.

The colors were so muted-faded, not at all like I remember from the TV program years and years ago. Or is the copy old, old, old?? I didn't think a CD would loose the true color. Was fun to see again, but decided the British accent of the characters would not work for a gift for the special needs child. I love the story.

It's a real shame because the books about the borrowers are pretty good - I loved them when I was a kid. Also, the borrowers are supposed to be kind of a cross between mice and people - they have tails and kind of mouse-like facial features and this movie left that out so they were just tiny humans in this movie, so it didn't make sense when the mother borrower saw her first human and thought they looked ugly.Maybe Disney or Pixar will remake this someday and then it'll be good to watch, but I'd pass on this movie version - I don't think even kids would like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old Poor quality transfer","review":"This is a VERY POOR quality transfer of the 1973 film with eddie albert and is not even in widescreen.

The characters here are EXTREMELY undeveloped that sometimes you start thinking this is a comedy or satire. It's with Nick Nolte being assigned a case by a prostitute and he goes from one oddball scene to another. All the stars, primarily Winger and Nolte, lack the kind of edge and downbeat charm that makes them so likeable in the first place. A real talkathon (only film ever that made me go to sleep).

However, ten years later I don't think they'd advanced all that far. The only thing that made their later relationship believable was the fact that they'd corresponded regularly over the course of ten years, and that correspondence meant a lot to each of them. However, when they were reunited after ten years, they didn't seem to know that much more about each other than when they'd parted. I thought the characters were entirely too modern in their attitudes and behavior, and I found it somewhat annoying. I couldn't really lose myself in this book, and to me that's the whole point of reading fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"freckles-books","review":"This was a great story.

She explains how she came to the decision to start a mail-order catalog. Her descriptions and stories tell the truth about starting a business. She also shares her techniques for getting in touch with ideas that are already within.I was so inspired by this book. I kept a notebook nearby and jotted down all of the thoughts that resonated with me. Lisa Hammond is honest about her experiences. She doesn't sugar-coat financing or making money. At the same time, she gives hope to other women's dreams. Mostly, I appreciated that she wrote about the specific details of the steps she took to begin her business. Many writers just share general how-to thoughts for others, but won't divulge their own \\"trade secrets\\". Lisa Hammond lays it out.

Now it's $500+ Wow! Anyway, if they ever drop back down in price, I recommend this series to anyone. The only issue is the discs are all packed on top of each other on 1 spindle instead of separate slots. This is an easy fix by buying blank DVD cases. Although beware! The cases are NOT the standard 27mm and will not fit in the cardboard slipcase. You have to get the 22mm cases.

But with a narrative structure that is centered on the naval officers of Kronstadt, who played a vital role in the overthrow of the Romanov monarchy. But who also tried, unsucessfully, to prevent the revolution's democratic principles from disintegrating into Bolshevik tyranny.Reviewer Alfred Johnson, apparently a die hard Communist, claims this doc is told from an anarchist perspective. But this is clearly not the case. Rather the failures and brutality of Lenin and the Bolsheviks are discussed by various mainstream historians, both Russian and Western.Recommended for those who want to learn more about one of the most important events of the 20th century."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"a review of the Russian revolution, which was a long process and really several revolutions. well-done, riveting. one of those documentaries that you don't have to be a history buff to enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute and addicting!","review":"This is one of those games you start playing for five minutes and the next thing you realize, it's hours later. Magic Match is easy to learn, but hard to master. It's one of those match games where you have to find three items in a row on a grid, but all sorts of things get thrown in the mix, like boarded up spots, or frozen pieces, wild card \\"coins\\" you can earn for long matches and magic orbs to gather all of one item on the board. As you go things get harder and you can get more powerful versions of your spells, which makes things interesting. Also it is fun trying to figure out how to earn trophies and going up in wizard rank. There is definitely replay value too, I am on my second way through the single player mode (this time on \\"hard\\") trying to beat my scores and get the rest of those darn trophies.This game is good for grown ups and kids will love it too.

These are poems full of humanity and an obvious love of language."},{"rating":"2","title":"Come live the journey!","review":"The Journal of Lewis and Clark, by DeVoto, is a wonderful reading adventure from cover to cover. The language used is from the men who spoke it. The emotions conveyed are from the men who felt them. You will feel your heart race as a grizzly bear chases the men into a river, or a buffalo runs through the camp. If your are a hiker, you can sense the frustrations they felt as Lewis thought the Colombia was just over the next ridge. Feel the culture of the Native Americans as the first White men did. See the country as only the Journals of the men who did can present it. Read it first hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I would use one word to characterize this work: Timeless. To relive the great expedition through the words of Lewis and Clark themselves is a fantastic experience. I think that most people who enjoy American history will love this book. People who are not inclined to read or enjoy historical non-fiction might find it tedious (such as students forced to do so for class assignments), as it is long and detailed.I previously read Ambrose's \\"Undaunted Courage\\" (which itself is excellent), which contains many passages from these journals, but the journals themselves are unsurpassed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon review issue.","review":"Amazon has combined the reviews for two different edits of the journals of Lewis and Clark. One edited by Bernard DeVoto and one edited by John Bakeless. I read DeVoto's edit and think it is fantastic. There are numerous different versions of the Journals ranging in cost and size. It would be nice if Amazon split up the reviews for the two different edits so that people good could decide between the two. It's like having two different versions of the bible with one set of comments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book - in the words of Lewis and Clark","review":"While reading the preface of this book, I learned so much that I had not learned before regarding our nation's early history and expansion, including how the early explorers were picked for this journey. What they went through on the journey was almost herculean. The trials and tribulations of these men (and one woman with a child) were unimaginable. They were amazing people and I cannot recommend too highly this book. This is probably the best book I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sargent Floyd","review":"I am disappointed DeVoto's edition appears to omit details of Charles Floyd's death and burial. As shown on the Ken Burns video there were some poignant passages such as Floyd asking Clark to write him a letter and Floyd dying with a \\"great deal of composure\\" as well as the campsite at the mouth of \\"Floyd's River,\\" all of which DeVoto chooses to omit. To be fair, I haven't finished the book yet, but am already past the Sioux City portion with mention only of Clark's \\"Biliose Chorlick\\" diagnosis and alarm at Floyd's rapid decline, so it doesn't look good for additional mention of Floyd. So now I'm wondering what other good parts have been omitted. Devoto's lengthy intro is very insightful and gives good perspective on why the journey was so important."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mariners Cap","review":"I really like wearing the cap I purchased.

I wish I could see it on Broadway before it ends the run."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shock and awe lightened up with good ol' boy humor","review":"I'm in 80% agreement with Mr. Frey. I, too, saw it several times. Like the movies \\"M*A*S*H\\" and \\"Airplane!\\" Ferrell and Company's nuanced performances had to be re-seen to be fully appreciated. I felt the Condi Rice scene was nothing short of astounding. The limber lookalike who limned her should win a Tony for Most Athletic Supporting Actress! Ferrell maintained perfect character consistency and nearly perfect improv toward the play's end. There were several segments that definitely needed tighter editing, but they did not detract substantively from the quality of the performance as a whole. To sum up, this play was credible, clever, and for the most part, terrifically funny!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Let It Be Over","review":"Tedious, base yawnfest from the used to be funny, now we wish he'd just retire Will Ferrell.

At a bit over 13 inches I was concerned it would look too small on our mantle but I was wrong. This clock is quite well made and the tone of the chimes is extremely impressive. I love the adjustable volume which allows you to hear the clock without it being annoying!! Seiko has mad a winner here! As I am writing this I hear it chiming downstairs!! Love it. Great product and great service Amazon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pleasing","review":"This clock has been a very nice addition to our mantel. Looks lovely with an old world appearance. The Westminster chimes are very enjoyable to hear while the Wittington ones are ok but just not quite as pleasing to the ear. The ability to turn off the chimes at 11:00pm rounds off the features. We have received many positive comments from guests."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clock disapointed.","review":"It looks lovely and the chime sounds like the real thing. However, the clock can only be programmed to turn off the chime between 11 pm and 6 am. To manually turn the chime off requires removing the back of the clock and fiddling with small controls. So a warning to those considering purchasing a Seiko chiming clock - if you don't like being kept awake until late at night or woken early in the morning then think twice about purchasing this clock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seiko Manelt Chime Clock","review":"Our 80 year old 7-day Russian Mantel Clock stopped, and I couldn't find anyone to repair it.....looked about for a key winding clock, and the prices were out of sight. I found this one, and decided to give it a try. The tone and clarity of the chiime is excellent, and the volume is loud if left on the highest volume...actually it is too loud , especially for the size of the clock. I turned the volume down, two marks and it's perfect. The case is nice looking and not fussy. We're quite happy with it...the price is the best that I had found in my searches."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good service","review":"I bought the used book POWER IN PRAISE that I had been wanting.

The plot is a simple damsel in distress who falls in love with her protector. A San Francisco attorney suddenly becomes the target of an international hit man for reasons she doesn't understand. While she and an ex-cop (check) are on the run in the Pacific Northwest, they eventually fall in love. There's nothing elegant or interesting about the way the romance is portrayed. The bad guy is a dull cipher. The cop is a Vietnam vet, which is awkwardly dealt with instead of artfully. It starts obviously and lumbers and lurches soddenly to its inevitable and unsatisfying end. It's still better than the movie version starring Stephen Baldwin and Cindy Crawford. Actually, much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Directions....","review":"I went on Hike# 49 (Boone County Cliffs State Nature Preserve) and if I hadn't been a local resident I would have NEVER found the place. The book's directions were to look for the turn off 6 miles east of Burlington; it should have said WEST of Burlington. Also, the sign at the small road you are supposed to look for that says \\"Kentucky Nature Conservancy 1.9 miles\\" actually is an \\"adopt-a-highway\\" sign that indicates that the KY Nature Conservancy has adopted the next 1.9 miles of road, meaning they are responsible for picking up trash along the road. I drove past this sign several times before I realized it was the sign I was supposed to be looking for. Ok, other than that, it was a great hike in a beautiful forest. I'm glad the authors wrote this book, they just need to update it with better directions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seafood - Surviving the Quiet","review":"This has to be my album of the year so far, trash rock with gentle uplifting melodies that carry you away then suddenly dump you back into distorted noise-ville.

I love Placido Domingo but I've never heard an Otello that matches James McCracken and this recording. I heard Vickers live and wasn't deeply moved, though live performance in opera is a dicey business.I listened to this album for forty days in a row. It's that affecting. Fischer Dietrich D. is equal to McCracken. This is a sensuous, overpowering Otello. It was the iconic Otello in the Sixties; it remains unsurpassed.Update: I bought the Vickers version and I'm floored. On CD, Vickers is better. Vickers is scary.Personal note: as much as Verdi claimed to hate Wagner, I think he learned the value of continuous aria from him in Otello. To Verdi's benefit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the motorola","review":"This charger worries me because it appears to charge differently than the motorola home charger.

Justinian did not marry Theodora the very next day after Euphemia died. First he had to convince his uncle to change the law forbidding people of high estate to marry ex-actresses. (Justin did change it.) Then Justinian became ill. Only after he recovered, did he marry Theodora. It is not certain that Theodora died of breast cancer. It may have been throat cancer.

Plato can seem so distant and archaic so much of the time, but here there is an actual sense of human urgency: Socrates is about to die. A lot of times the dialogues feel completely neutered from any real world concern, you just see these people walking around, having their abstract little discussions as Socrates schools them all. But here you see those discussions finally grounded by a frank acknowledgement and confrontation with mortality. This is the last chance he will ever have to say anything, and everyone knows it. Plenty of subsequent works of philosophy offer more compelling, accessible arguments, but few can match the pathos and immediacy of a condemned man having a few last words with his friends before he carries out the death sentence against himself.

Well if you already own the three seasons then dont bother. The cardboard footlocker contains the same three boxsets as were released individually. If you dont own them, then this is perfect. The footlocker looks great on a shelf. I took a star away for nothing new but the footlocker. No new features, pictures or anything. I did NOT remove a star for the music, because I first saw the syndicated version when I was younger so this is the version I remember.

The music they replaced the origional sound track with doesn't really do it for me.HOWEVER, the last time I watched the series was back in the 80's when I was in High School. I forgot how great this series was. The missing music shouldn't stop you from enjoying this series. I find myself watching show after show, and realizing that I need to get up to head to work in a few hours. The only difference between when i watched this in high school and now, is that now I'm a Sergeant First Class in the Regular Army, and a combat arms soldier.

I guess living with the frontman of one of the best rock bands in history is terrible.I'm sure there were in fact some hard times for Cyrinda, but all in all, us regular folk can't quite equate our lives with hers.The book doesn't show the Boys in a good light, if you're a fan you really don't want to hear that stuff.

Cyrinda's memoirs are tainted with bitterness & revenge towards her ex-husband Steven Tyler. While some of her stories are interesting, she goes off track in the middle of most of them to trash Steven which leaves the reader to think \\"what was that all about?\\" She goes on in grave detail to talk about Tyler's behaviors during his well-known past addiction, but barely mentions her own and I'm quite sure she was no angel either! Throughout the book she also mentions how unjust she feels and that Steven has never apologized to her either verbally or (mainly) financially. I agree with the reader from New York that Cyrinda should get a job, but I'd also advise her to get off the pity-pot as well, unless she plans to live the rest of her life as a perpetual victim.

I was dumbfounded by the kind of lifestyle this runaway girl lived.She was brave but careless with her life. It's a sad sad story and I cried. I imagined living her life and it made my heart grow heavy. Maybe people don't agree with her book but its how she seen it. It's her personal life and she aired it and now shes gone. Get the book!

I think Mia is a very beautiful girl and should consider herself lucky to now be old enough to make life changing decisions and be smart enough to have a relationship with her father and have her own opinion of him. Obviously Cyrinda is bitter and is still dwelling on this failed marriage. I also agree with 'reader', get a JOB Cyrinda and leave Steven alone!

I have been a faithful patron to HBO and Amazon in buying SATC DVD's. I would just like to know WHY you are offering Season Six as two - disc series and WHY the UK gets one disk for the season and WHY it is out a full two months before the Part II disk in the states. WHAT KIND OF GAME IS THIS?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this what they call entertainment?","review":"I can't think of anything more boring than having to sit and watch four barely dressed women in expensive shoes running all over New York to have sex with anything that moves.

Why would you want to purchase a dvd like this when all you have to do is look out of your window and see the same thing, especially if you live in NY? Walk through Central Park or ride the subways. It's all there for free!!! Wake up folks! There's real entertainment out there, I promise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just okay.","review":"I think the sex and the city shows are funny, but with part 2, and 1 of season 6 it's just not as funny as they used to be when the show first started out. Everything in season six was so obvious as far as what was going to happen. All the girls in season 6 I thought were just over dramatic about things, and it was just the same problems they were having in every episode. It was just boring. Don't buy it unless, you're a real big fan of sex and the city, it's not worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"This season seals it, this is one of the best shows ever.","review":"I am typically dissapointed with the ways shows end. Remember Friends, X-Files, and slews of others. This is the one show I have fully watched that stayed true to its comedy and it's story for the run of the series. This is the one series that has nary a bad episode.Season 6 part 2 is great. While it is only 8 episodes (which is little for the high price) it has tremendous replay value.

All the essential ingredients that made Part 1 good watching (great lines, decent character development and pacing) was sadly absent in Part 2. The supporting cast's roles were even more diminished and their storylines more farcical or hastily skimmed through. The serious chapter and verses that led to Sarah Jessica Parker's grand finale in Paris turned out to be nothing but a drag. The \\"happy\\" ending for Carrie and big was so formulaic and uninspiring. The haute couture was probably the only saving grace to Part 2. If you have access to the Zone 3, two parts-in-one edition, get it instead (priced US$40, sans Special Features, but who cares for the over-rated alternative endings from the over-priced (US$57.48) Zone 1, Part 1 & 2 edition)?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sex in the city- season six part 2","review":"My dvd arrived in a reasonable amount of time, however it was missing disk # 2 and they did not have a replacement to send so that sucked!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"HATE TO SEE IT END....","review":"I have been an avid fan of \\"Sex and the City\\" since it began. After purchasing this last season, I was able to complete my entire collection.

I am however perplexed as to why HBO did this in two parts and why in the world they would release it AFTER the holidays.

Whoever picked this date should have their job handed to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"The series just keeps getting better","review":"This is the fifth (and so far last) book in the series. All the books have been good, but this one has a little something extra. The mystery is good, but there's also a wonderful addition of touching family drama. It could have run the risk of being too soft, but Alison's witty writing keeps things balanced. Some of her dialogue had me laughing out loud. The relationship between Kate and Andy is so much fun to follow. This book really does have something for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book!","review":"This was a very interesting mystery and I really enjoyed it. I'm looking forward to reading the previous four books. It isn't often that I find a book set in my home province. I grew up near the main character's childhood home of Indian Head, Saskatchewan. Gordon does an excellent job of describing Saskatchewan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasant, gentle, oh,so Canadian!","review":"Gordon's mysteries like those of other Canadian writers of this genre (Bowen, Wright(LR,Eric)} are really excuses for depicting fascinating characters. The prairies come alive in this book, the little old ladies waiting to be inducted into the local Baseball Hall of fame are real characters! The plot takes a few surprising twists. There really is no \\"detection\\" to speak of since Kate Henry is handed the solution on a platter. But then that hardly matters. What one really recalls at the end are the characters and the setting!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Get Any Other Wagner DVD Instead","review":"Reading Amazon reviews should have warned me but, I was taken with the incredibly low price for a Blu-ray disc. You usually get what you pay for. The visuals are so awful, so ugly, that I just turned my head and listened to the music.One star only because it's Wagner and there are no \\"negative stars.\\"I still can't believe it was so awful. Could it be a put-on?"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'll Probably Wait for the 3-D Version","review":"Let me first say that since you can get this item delivered for less than $10, it is worth every penny. The lossless sound track certainly sounds great on a surround sound system. What I heard of the singing was beautiful and the details of the orchestration came out better than on other Ring recordings I have heard. According to a reviewer of the full Ring set, left and right channels are sometimes interchanged but I had no idea of that from the excerpts. The visual element was abstract art of geometrical, kaleidoscopic shapes, with little connection with traditional Ring imagery. There is no scenery but several projection screens at various places on the stage, giving the video creator, Franc Aleu, the opportunity to exercise his imagination in cooking up 3D action. Unfortunately I was watching in 2D and the effects were pretty much lost. I will wait to see if they are releasing a 3D version before deciding whether to buy the complete set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Technohype meets Eurotrash","review":"This is a truly hideous production, a marriage of gargantuan stage technology with conceptual drivel. Unlike others, for me the singing is undistinguished, the conducting pedestrian. I wonder if the staging is not just a huge send-up of the whole Wagnerian mythos and ethos. I'm sorry I wasted $10 on the highlights, but glad I didn't throw away over a $100 on the complete cycle."},{"rating":"2","title":"CBS 60 Greatest Old-Time Radio Shows","review":"Received product in great condition.

The lid ball-handle and the handle itself are plastic. Not impressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"POWERFUL!","review":"How could anyone not like this? This is the ultimate revenge movie. Women are raped everyday in this country and most of these rapes go unpunished. Rosario Dawson actually gets justice in this movie. I've never seen anything like it. It's extremely graphic to say the least. She actually rapes the guy who raped her. An eye for an eye, thats what i live by. This movie shows how damaged a rape can leave someone. Even after Rosario gets revenge, you see how truly hurt and broken she is. I actually saw this about 2 years ago and it has stayed with me every since. It's a powerful film. The only reason i did not give it 5 stars was because it's a little to long. And there's this period after she was raped that seems to drag on way to long. However, This is still a wonderful film that i hope many people will take the time to watch. I didn't no Rosario had this in her. She's now one of my favorites. -This movie is definately A MUST SEE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ascent in Descent?","review":"This emotionally challenging portrait is brave on every level - a furious essay, written with depth and compassion in oil-black splatters of ink."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not make much sense","review":"I'm not as articulate as some other reviews, but this is long and slow to watch. I can hardly watch the ear cutting scene in \\"Reservoir Dogs\\" because it is too graphic, or I'm getting too old. But I was expecting something like that in this movie. So when it never came I thought so what, whats all the 5 stars about. All I can say again is very long and arduous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor!","review":"Dark and poorly made. I understand the rational of revenge, but was tasteless and not worth watching again. Would not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Senseless","review":"As a revenge movie, if that was the plot intent, it failed miserably. Having date sex forced upon her resulted in an almost mindless turn of attitude and personality resulting in the victim, Rosario Dawson, getting someone (another male) to rape the one who raped her. I believe the NC-17 rating was because of the extended view of male genitals and the Mano e Mano rape scene, but perhaps that was a good thing - it kept many from going to see it and wasting their money as I foolishly did. I like Ms. Dawson as an actress, but movies like this could ruin careers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Descent","review":"I don't know what movie the other reviewers were watching but this is not a good movie. The movie is about rape but you never see it on screen. It all takes place in a dark setting and it doesn't have a plot of any kind or any character build up. I hate when people have a chance to make a good movie and ruin it with stuff like this. If you buy this movie don't expect to much."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for everyone","review":"could not watch i guess my internet connection is too slow.i tried several times over many days, movie would start and then stop, did'nt make it through the opening credits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brillant Evocative Film. HORRIBLE!!! Dvd Transfer.","review":"i am in agreement with what has been said of the film by the reviews alreadyon this page. my comment therefore is about the dvd itself. a most dis-appointing transfer. especially in the final scene when Mia gets her revengeon Jarrod. when i saw the film in theaters everything was crisp clear andsharp but on the dvd leads Rosario Dawson, Chad Faust and Marcus Patricklook like orange people from Mars. not only that but the rest of the screenis so dark you can hardly differentiate anything as you could cleary do so in theaters. again one of the most disappointing dvd transfers ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Subtle and brutal","review":"This is both subtle and brutal. It is about what happens through subtle conversations to an evening dinner, his apartment and the brutality that follows. Her response is to implode, as if to organize her reconstruction. The nightclub scenes seem to be a visual metaphor for her own re-awakening; dark thoughts in a dark environment. Her recovery is self-imposingly slow. Her thoughts are not apparent as she befriends the club's darkly handsome owner. He exudes sensual strength. It is something she harnesses later in the film but not in the way you might suppose. Ultimately, it is a film about the reopening of her mind. It is a psychological study with a sharp edge. The question is really, whether her final ascent is the actual descent; well worth watching!Ian Hunter.Author of \`e-Love'."},{"rating":"1","title":"A crushing bore","review":"I got sucked in by the good reviews again. This film is a cure for insomnia. There is nothing shocking or interesting about monotone performances and a story that moves at a snail's pace. Forget it and move on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for the Northern Front Range hiker.","review":"I have hiked several of the trails described in the book and I agree with the author on ratings of the trails. The trail descriptions are well done and give you a very visual idea as to what you will experience on the trail. The directions to trails are pretty straight forward, and the maps are pretty good but a bit simple for my taste. The only real fault I have with the book is that there are no UTM or Latitude, Longitude info for the trailheads. Having this information would have made it easy to pull up my own research for the area. That one annoyance is the only reason I did not give it five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"An execellent outline of Irish History","review":"This book makes you long to see the places it descibes. The historical references are not totally accurate, but this only makes the story seem more alive. Beautifully written."},{"rating":"1","title":"A chore to finish","review":"I love historical fiction, but this book falls very short for me. There are some nice stories between the lame one of the boy Rowan which is uninteresting and down right boring to me. I do realize whether or not a book is \\"good\\" is very subjective. But for me this book is shallow and leaves me wanting to read one that has more substance. If you like short summaries of various Irish events and very few details or \\"Meat\\" then this is the book for you. But if you feast on more in depth accounting of events that transport you back in time, keep looking. I am almost finished with the book and it is a chore to even pick it up. I am so ready for something by Sharon K. Penman. I was looking for a book that does for Ireland what she does for England. I will have to keep looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book Club","review":"This bood was VERY hard to read. Didn't keep my interest. I would not recommend it unless you like historical reading about Ireland."},{"rating":"1","title":"Finished it grudgingly","review":"I wanted to quit this book about halfway through, but kept going hoping it would get better. I ended up skipping over the stories within the story. I found the main character hopelessly obsessed and pathetic with trying to track down the elusive storyteller. It was not the historical fiction I was hoping for, especially since, not being from Ireland, I began to feel like every story was a myth, and didn't know if there was any truth to the book at all. I suppose the surprise ending should have helped me feel better about the main character's obsession, but I had guessed the ending about midway through, and felt more depressed for the characters than happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!!!!","review":"I checked out this audio book from the Library to listen to on my way too and from work. I found it hard to get out of my car. The author did a wonderful job telling the stories, history, and folklore of Ireland. He also did a wonderful job brining it to life in his vocally acting out the book. I ended up buying the audio book. It is one I look forward to listening to again soon. Buy this book or the CD. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Marvelous Book - Highly Recommended","review":"Delaney is a magnificent storyteller, as can be seen from his fabulous tale of -- a magnificent storyteller. In this book, he captures both the whole grand sweep of Ireland's magical history and, at the same time, the nuanced details of a young boy's growth and search for family and ultimately for himself. Its a marvelous job and a great great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unhurried love letter to Ireland","review":"Despite my love of this book, I will start this review with a caution: this book is an unhurried homage to Ireland, her stories, mythology, history, people and her spirit.I personally found it charming, informative and re-readable. It captured my imagination, and showed me how things I knew about Ireland fit into the greater whole.But someone who doesn't relate to the Irish, or who expects a \\"fast\\" work, may not like it.One nice thing is that the book really gets right into it, from the first page...the Storyteller shows up, sits everybody down and begins to tell a story. After that first story has completed, you will know if you're going to like the book or not.I know that I am looking forward to Delaney's other works, and to the short story works he's created since writing this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"In my top 5 books ever read","review":"I read 20-30 books a year.

I was hoping to gain some historical perspective on the country and its people through reading a novel, as opposed to a nonfiction account. I was not disappointed. Delaney's writing is a pleasure. He's a masterful storyteller and I believe I learned a great deal about the place through his colorful telling of its history. Reading the book while traveling in Ireland brought many of the sights alive for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart-warming Stories","review":"Great stories of Ireland!

The narrative centers on an old Irish story-teller who wanders the roads of Ireland telling stories. A young boy becomes fascinated with him, and the framework is his continuing fascination with this man and his craft over the years.But the treasure of the book is the series of stories told by the wanderer. The use of language is some of the best of the Irish gift, and the stories are elegantly crafted. I had a strange moisture around my eyes at the end of the one about how poetry was created, just from the sheer beauty of it.I have recommended this to several friends, and I am thrilled to have it added to my collection of books worth keeping and reading again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"It touched me to my marrow\\"","review":"Every now and then a book comes along that takes you on an unexpected splendid journey; this is such a book. I cried wonderful tears while reattaching to my roots (County Mayo & Sligo}. Had I been reading at Starbuck I'd surely have drawn questionable looks! The twists, suprises, the rich history of a people that just wouldn't be defeated is awe inspiring indeed. The wonderful mysterious bond between a young boy and an old wandering storyteller will steal your heart. Be you of whatever nationality or ethnic background, read this, it'll touch your soul. This is a Gem! Sincerely, Lliam Burke"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The book alternate chapters between a boy tracking down a storyteller and the storyteller telling stories or recounting myths of Ireland. Neither story line held any interest for me. I kept expecting substance in each new story, but each myth or legend seem bland. The story of the boy seemed nonsensical. The best part of the book is the language. The writer does write very fluently with a deft use of figures of speech. However, this seems a little off as well. One story the author really brings ancient Ireland alive, but then uses an extended simile of the Titanic. It broke the magic for me.Perhaps I missed the hidden symbolism and meaning, but I gave up after about 1/2 through. I would give the book only one star for the plot, but the writing was very good so I gave it another star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ireland","review":"This is a wonderful book.

Take my advice and pass on this snoozer."},{"rating":"1","title":"good read if you are Irish and in middle school","review":"Not much flow to this book,with only very limited highlights of Irish history. The motivations of the kid and other adults are rather one dimensional, often acting without logic. It is painfully slow to read, though it does pick up somewhat in the last 100 pages. This was a read for our book and this feeling was universal. Several could not even get through to the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"The book is nicely written and it's easy to read, but has a major fault: it lacks of any kind of plot. You may read it as an interesting collection of stories, but then, they are not so great either, and the central plot devised around Ronan O'Mara is the weakest I ever saw. Nothing keeps you coming to the book, wich makes really hard to deal with the almost 600 pages of the novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Master Storyteller","review":"Through the tales of a wandering Storyteller, Frank Delaney's IRELAND weaves stories of Ireland's history with the saga of a convoluted 1950's Irish family.

Once they get restored, the DVDs will be much higher in price, so if you want a lot of good, clean family fun without the expense, pick up this set for the holidays or all year round."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you paid for","review":"My parents had just bought this set of 8 dvds. Now granted, there is a LOT on here.... but it's not good quality.I've got the cartoon disc on right now, and it's all off colored, skipping, with really bad quality. It looks like someone taped them off tv and then transferred them to dvd.Or maybe the production value was just really that bad.It's all public domain, so you're getting exactly what you paid for. The only good thing on this disc is the original Rudolph cartoon, and even that seems like it could have gotten a better treatment.If you want good cartoons, stick with the ones you know. The stop motion Rudolph, Charlie Brown, and The Grinch will be the ones your kids want. Not this."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAVE your money","review":"Sure this isn't overly expensive, but it isn't worth even a few dollars. The re-recoding of this DVD was done poorly. Not only is the sound bad with frequent echoes and distortion, but the voices are also off. Some of the B&W episodes are green and gray rather than black and white. Additionally, the DVD often skips and freezes up. This could have been a fun collection, but is instead frustrating to watch and nearly impossible to listen to many of the movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Gourds..","review":"Great Gourds.

And, based on a recent NPR interview, I'm sure he's a nice enough guy. But if this CD (my first exposure to him) is indicative of his entire body of work, then Dougie needs to switch FROM decaf. I don't mind getting cerebral and spiritual once in a while, but my bloodpressure dropped so precipitously while listening to this CD that I could feel myself beginning to flatline.

I can imagine talking to my best girlfiends about that (which the women in this support group were) but I didn't think it made very interesting copy.

Hikes range from 1 to 9 miles in length, covering all of the major hiking areas (and some not so major areas) in the state. Longer hikes are referenced in an appendix.

I respectly but strongly disagree. I think this album was terrible. I gave it two stars because I did like a couple songs from it. I'm so happy they did not continue in this monotone, bland and non-distorted direction. I think this is most definitely their worst album they've done. The lyrics were not bad but the melody was an ear sore. Not sure why they chose this direction but Ten Thousand Fits redeemed this travesty. If you love a power hitter, don't bother with this album. But if you like something toned down and much more radio friendly, then this is your pick. If you get only one Disturbed album, get either Asylum, The Lost Children or The Sickness."},{"rating":"2","title":"For those down with the sickness...........","review":"For those who were down with the sickness before; prepare to Believe.

While \\"The Sickness\\" was raw, original, and full of variation, \\"Believe\\" is merely two or three songs, each one changed slightly and given a different title. The result is a repetitive collection of annoying songs, none of which seem to tap the same ferocity of the debut. I enjoy the majority of Nu Metal albums, and was really let down when \\"Believe\\" caused me (the irony here is astounding) to lose faith in disturbed. If you have to, buy it, otherwise just get a Korn album and be happy you made the right choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!- 5/5 by far one of the best metal CD's this decade!","review":"In moderns times, many rock groups make one good CD and then their sophmore CD sucks. Disturbed is here to stay people!The whole CD is hard-rocking solid. Pretty much every song has a memorable guitar riff and Draiman's singing has sky-rocketed past other metal bands. Not to mention the drums & bass will blow out your eyes. Simply said- if you don't have this CD, you need to.If you soft-rock fans didn't like the Sickness, then check Believe out. They are much improved.For the rest of us hard-rock fans- Disturbed is on my top 5 new bands- yes - they're that good.

Prayer is a classic styled song of Disturbed calibur. Beyond that, the rest of the music is watered down, emotionless ramblings with no particular point or direction. All in all, the music isn't horrid, but Definatly not for a fan who enjoyed the drive/emotion/hard hitting lyrics/musical styles of \\"The Sickness\\". Sorry, but its true."},{"rating":"1","title":"If your looking for their raw sound of before PASS!","review":"I fell in love with the bands sound on \\"The Sickness\\" And while you can still tell it's Disturbed, their edge is gone.

But if I wanted ballads and inspiration from beginning to end almost, I would have bought John Tesh's new album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Disappointment","review":"The great thing about the album Sickness was that it was a true metal album.

Nobody loves to sing about death anymore and it was a drastic change from the Sickness. They suck. Osbourne was wrong in saying that they are the future of metal.What happened to the old days where guitar solos ruled the scene and that when everyone was so talented, you couldn't get enough of them? Today, bands like this are just making so-called metal that are not true to the real metal roots just to appear on TV.Disturbed sucks and thats a fact. The way he screams is just horrible...like a girl. Watsup with the WAAAAA? They don't mix well with all this religious crap on this disc. No wonder the Ozzfest sucked year after year unlike the early years like in 1995.

Each song gets pretty heavy and stays that way until the end. David did tone down his lyrics a little...but it just shows what a great voice he has. He still has the same screaming vocals that was in the first album. I just think he decided to tone it down and not do a rehash of the first album...I respect them for that. All the songs are great...I really can't say a bad thing about it...therefore I recomend every song. The first album was a stand-out and it got them noticed...the second one they decided to be more melodic and I think it worked well...BETTER THAN THE SICKNESS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Focused, and amazing..","review":"Disturbed's second album, is by far, greater then their last album \\"The Sickness\\". They lost some of their \\"teen angst\\" feeling, and replaced it was far more well thought out lyrics. The title is the main theme; to strengthen your belief in whatever it is that you hold dear to your heart. Disturbed are extremely focused, and follow this theme from start to finish. Themes of alienation, and lifes messages also play a major part. The last track, \\"Darkness\\", shows a far more mellow side to Disturbed, never before heard. Overall, the album is not quite as hard as \\"The Sickness\\", but its still the nu metal, many have come to love from their first album. Overall, to me, everything about Disturbed has been improved on this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"{0/10} More old scrap for the rusting Nu-metal heap.","review":"A lazy, over-wrought shell of an album. Sounds like a hundred other talentless bands. 12 tracks that all sound the same, boring and dull. How do these people get a recording contract? A real mystery. The most droaning lead vocalist you can imagine. Awful. Not even worth a purchase from the dump bin. Not even saved by decent packaging or production."},{"rating":"1","title":"i wish there was a way to put zero stars","review":"I'm a man of few words. Disturbed is not metal anybody who says they are has no idea what metal is and probably thinks shleps like linkin park are too. Bands like these couldn't be any less metal. Now on to the album- its bad. Dave Draiman is an interesting singer but i can't stand him after a while. There are no guitar solo's and if there are its guitar noise that bands liek these try to pass off like \\"oh yeah i'm being innovative i don't want to play the same stagnant stuff.\\" Who honestly wants to hear about Dave's mom abusing him? The same morons that thought \\"daddy' by Korn was a great song. If you like this good for you i'm not trying to insult you or your tastes i'm just saying it makes oldschool metal guys like myself very angry when bands like this are put in the metal category."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks harder than the gravitational forces of a black hole!","review":"This album reminds me of a story. A friend of mine had gone ice fishing (hang on, it get's better) and after several hours fishing and drinking, he went to a little ice shack serving as an outhouse. Inside was a half-cut barrel full of frozen, ahem, faecal matter dug in the ice. With nary a thought, he began wizzing on the pile. Up rose a huge cloud of stink into the cold air, giving him what he described as a \\"stream bath\\". His clothes, his skin, everything stunk horribly after that. His friends stayed clear of him for the rest of the night.That's this album in a nutshell. It stinks so bad, one mere listen to this cd will leave a stench on you and drive away your friends. Don't even wiz on it. Run away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Changed for the worse","review":"I'm a big Disturbed fan and I have a lot of respect for David. The point is that this cd sucks.

I have to say that this CD is the MOST generic, boring, sell out of an album I have ever heard. I think that every good review on this website must be from a record label exec who is trying to sell this excuse for an album.

It wasn't a bad CD, but aside from the singles and \\"Shout 2000\\", there wasn't anything particularly interesting about the album. It's the same with \\"Believe\\", only the hardcore Nu-Metal has been replaced with a more melodic version. For me, this album is easily more accessible and listenable than \\"The Sickness\\", but there seems to be little difference in structure between the majority of the songs here. The verses are either guitar driven or low key, leading to a melodicaly screaming chorus. It is one of the few albums I would tag with the 'cookie-cutter' label. Only \\"Breathe\\" (on which you can hear some SOAD and Tool influence) and the ballad \\"Darkness\\" seem break from the norm. Not a terrible effort, but definately not classic material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do You Believe?","review":"Back in the memorable year of '99 I heard a song called \\"Stupify\\" that was on one of the best CD's I currently own. Songs like \\"Voices\\", \\"Down With the Sickness\\", and \\"Fear\\" completely amazed me. Now Disturbed is back with Believe, a record of some similarity to their debut, but for the most part, a lot has changed. If you already have their debut, then you probably know why I gave this disc such a low rating. Instead of the great, brutal music I've grown to love, they come up with more \\"melodic\\" songs. The result is tracks that are softer, less anger, and sound alike. The first single and song on the album \\"Prayer\\" is probably the best of the whole record. While there may be a few other songs that I could consider decent, the majority of this CD is worth passing. Buy the first before even thinking of buying this. It's a lot better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Right.","review":"Or wrong? Disturbed, is well, pretty wrong. I don't know who they hire to review these albums, but uh, news flash: there is NOTHING intelligent about Disturbed. It's jock nu-metal with childish lyrics. Progression of a nu-metal band? Haha, that almost sounds like an oxymoron. This album tries to be melodic, haaaa...the singer needs to be able to actually sing and the musicians must be able to write melodically to make it melodic, and hey, these guys just don't have the skill or talent to pull that off. The last album was horrible, and so is this one. So, if you're new to Disturbed, or are a fan of their older stuff.

This album is horrible. A lot of the songs sound a like and the fact that they all have one word titles to the song names is annoying too. They're sound is different than other bands, but it doesn't amount to good music. Their only good song period is \\"Down With The Sickness\\" and what they need to do is change their beats and fill their next album (unless they don't want to record anymore albums which is fine by me) with songs that sound nothing alike whatsoever and diversify the album, if they even know how."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hehehehehe...","review":"The guitar sounds pretty good, but this band/album can get annoying. Especially the Vocals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbed....sounds like they got sum mental help","review":"Ok so heres how it is. I LOVED DISTURBEDS first album. I couldnt put it down. I loved all the tracks. Concert was great. Everything I loved about them...then this cd came out. What in the world?? Dave did you get all your crazieness out in the first album and decide to turn soft? We really didn't need another Staind. I don't want to be mean...I luv Disturbed best band around. This cd is tottaly diffrent from the first...they took a chance and it didn't work. Should of sticked with the same stuff because thats what us...your fans liked. Keep tryin!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Believe it's bad!","review":"From the faux goth/\\"satanic\\" bling-bling on the Limited Edition packaging to the sheer inanity of their lyrics, Disturbed is indeed that if they feel they are metal. One has the impression that Disturbed is trying to prove something to the unwashed hordes who clamor for their \\"music\\". What are they trying to prove? That because they have a Limited Edition they have achieved fame? Gimme a break! If one wants real metal, stick to Acid Bath, Apocalyptica or better yet,Pre \\"Load\\" Metallica."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't surprise me one bit","review":"When \\"The Sickness\\" was released a few years back, I thought it was a refreshing breath of fresh air with all the rap-metal/nu-metal stuff that overbloating the metal genre. I was there cheering for these guys at OzzFest when they were one of the opening bands while most other people were booing them. Well, Disturbed had some success, and \\"Believe\\" is a testament that that little bit of success has gone to they're heads. Every song on here doesn't have one shred of the originality or raw emotion that \\"The Sickness\\" had, and Disturbed now sounds like a band of pretenders, a band that just sounds like every other nu-metal band thats plaguing the airwaves right now. This isn't metal, and anyone who thinks this is should have they're head examined and not listen to they're Linkin Park CD so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow....","review":"Reading the previous review, its sad and disappointing to see that this group of hacks are actually getting people interested in rock music. Hey Kathy, since you're new to rock music it might be counterproductive to love a band who represent nearly all things wrong with rock. Bad musicianship, stupid vocals(god are they horrible) and some of the worst songwriting ever characterize this, one of the last still standing nu metal bands. The only good thing Disturbed ever did was beat the living $%&* out of that horrible emo band Finch, because as awful as nu metal is it still comes second to emo in terms of crappiness.If you want to hear good hard rock, listen to Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, old Helmet, Soundgarden and Queens of the Stone Age"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as good as The Sickness","review":"Damn good and melodic heavy metal music. But still staying true to their roots. If you like Prayer you'll fall in love with the CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't *Believe* the Hype","review":"I heard good things about this album, about how much they've progressed and how they were changing metal. It's still very mediocre to me. The vocals, while hardly disturbing, are the only interesting thing going on with disturbed, and even they can get annoying at times. The guitar playing is just your typical poor numetal style. It does the same thing in every song. Fast 'chugga chugga' riffs in simple chord progressions. Sometimes there are no chord progressions at all. The so called 'great melodies' are very thin. You could repeatedly strum any random chords and call it a melody. If you're not into this kind of music, disturbed will not change your mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"BELIEVe","review":"This Cd wasnt as fun and catchy as the Sickness. Believe is an alrite CD, but its not as spectacular as it could be. The best way i can describe disturb's music is by an analogy.....What Weezer's \\"Blue album\\" was to \\"Pinkerton,\\" Disturb's \\"Sickness\\" is to \\"Believe.\\"I suppose believe is more meaningful, and if you're a more lyrical, soulful person, you might enjoy Believe more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing....","review":"If you loved \\"The Sickness\\" because of the great metal sound and the amazing vocal talent that David Draiman showed in songs like Down With The Sickness, The Game, and Stupify, do not buy this CD. The songs are certainly decent, and the band has talent, but compared to \\"The Sickness\\", this CD is just plain boring. This is not like the first album... this isn't stuff you're going to have cranked up in the car, or stuff that you'll be moshing to at a concert. If you loved the hard, crazy, heavy music from Disturbed's first album, and were expecting more of the same, \\"Believe\\" will leave you very disappointed. I expected more from the band that gave us the insanely disturbing final verse of Down With The Sickness..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat heavy, but gets lazy as it goes on...","review":"Disturbed still haven't released an album to live up to my expectations yet, they've still stuck to their alternative metal/radio friendly rock they seem so accustomed to. However what makes this album dissapointing is it's refusal to reivent itself and take itself to different levels. Okay sure, 'Prayer', 'Awaken', & 'Remember' might be catchy and may stick in your head for a while, but it takes more than a few good songs to make a truly memorable record."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not The Sickness","review":"This cd really let me down. I bought \\"The Sickness\\" and thought that it was awesome. The music was hard, fast, and quite a bit angry. Also all of the songs sounded different. The only downside was that the lyrics were a bit, um...retarded (bring the violence, it's significant...)but then I got \\"Believe\\" and was just sad. No anger, no vocal violence- If i wanted to hear a bunch of losers doing slow songs and call it rock I'd have gotten a Creed cd. Hell, \\"Prayer\\" could just as easily been performed by Creed. This cd reminded me why nu-metal sucks so much. Save your $18 for a Slayer cd!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ok cd","review":"the cover is too satanic. It could have been less. the music is alright. Staind is a better group anyways."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beatifully Disturbed","review":"Disturbed has definitely created a Metal masterpiece with their new cd, Believe. Every song is filled with intensity, fire, passion, and soul. With lyrics that are much more meaningful than most other Metal bands touring today, Believe is definitely making a lasting impression. The songs were beautifully written and they keep the hard hitting, loud sound, and lead singer, David Draiman bringing out a lot more than just screaming and yelling into a microphone, showing he can boast lyrics just as good, if not better than the rest. Buy this cd today if you haven't already, and see for yourself, this cd will make you Believe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbed shows more of their 80's roots on Believe","review":"I do believe that Disturbed has put out an album that will re-define the \\"nu-metal\\" genre and how it will be judged. I have only heard samples of the album on Vh1.com and I like what I hear, citing influences from Metallica's Kill 'Em All through ...And Justice for All era (before the dreaded \\"Black\\" cough*sellout*cough album) to Queensryche to 90's based Pantera. The songs (from the samples) that I keep coming back to are the heavy and brutal but melodic \\"Liberate\\" to the \\"Down With The Sickness\\" bastard child \\"Intoxication\\" to their first single \\"Prayer\\" (I've heard the full version of this) and another heavy cut \\"Devour\\" amongst others. I do believe that with the next album, hopefully they won't do what KoRn does and don't reinvent themselves, keeping the \\"If it ain't broke, don't fix it\\" routine."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the best","review":"i was really disappoited by this cd i heard some band on hard drive ( a radio show} saying this cd was 10 x 's better then the first on i only like 3 songs on the cd but im still a huge disturbed fan if your going to buy this cd buy it on sale its not worth 20 dollers"},{"rating":"2","title":"For all those stupid people put there...","review":"Ok, first off, I'm not 13, I'm 18 and I was just looking around on Amazon for some cds, and I noticed some of the reviews on the Disturbed cds...the people who support this, I salute you, and for the people who don't...grrr...the people who say that its the same thing over and over, it's not! You don't hear the same guitar or the beat, and the people who say they have no talent, you go ahead and try to do that scream David does on, \\"Down with the Sickness.\\", I hope your throat bleeds when you try, because his does every concert...why on earth would someone do that every time, and might risk their speech?

Theyre all pretty good except for Darkness.Overall if you liked \\"The Sickness\\" go out and try this album.MAKE SURE TO GET 10,000 FISTS SEPT.20TH"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"First of all, I am not into alternative sounding vocals much but Disturbed gives me a nice retreat to softer \\"metal\\" when i have a headache or something and I simply love this cd. Whenever I'm not in the mood for heavy bands such as Lamb of God, Cradle of Filth, or Dimmu Borgir I just simply stick in this CD and enjoy the near perfection that Disturbed has managed to grasp. The only complaint I would have about the album that there is not much change to it other than the last song. The majority of the songs sound very similar but they are still beautifully harmonious enough to help me relax. Great CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"diffrent but good","review":"You know I dont listing to rock music just because of how hard it is.It's about how good the music is.Therefore someone that just like's the style of there first album \\"The sickness\\" would probably not like this one.But if your open minded about bands changing there sound or style you probably would like this.I love most of the tracks.When I first listined to to this album my favorite song was liberate.But I recamend listing to it first if your interested in buying this."},{"rating":"2","title":"proud chicago band","review":"Disturbed isn't all that disturbing, but it does a great job of pure stomping music. Disturbed is not all that unique or inventive. It just does the stereotype of this type of music very well. I've seen them live-they sound even better live-although all the mindless and EXPECTED -by the band- praise from the audience is laughable. The mass zeig heilings of the band is stupid. Disturbed takes itself too seriously, as if the rise to the top of hardcore pop was something messianic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbed - Believe","review":"It has been done-- somebody has single handedly made an album worth buying: David Draiman. Without him, the band would be nothing. He has an unmistakably intense voice that you know, after two notes that it couldn't possibly be anyone else-- he's just that good. This album has an attitude that's frustrated, yet epic. It gives me chills every time I hear Remember(no. 5)-- the guitar rythm pulsates, and the vocals soar... it's really somethin to hear. Why I give this album 5 stars is because that the message is real, and the sound is increadible. BUY THIS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Now a Sissy?","review":"The sickness was a great album. With hard lyrics and pain wretching sounds made that album successful. They were all hard and mean in the sickness. The first single off this album, prayer was really good. I then liked remember, but the rest of this cd is down right, one word gay. I mean what the hell happend to these guys? I thought they were mean and hard, this cd is all about being nice and being wimps, god i thought i would puke this cd up after i watched opera or something. I guess i just have to listen to the RIP disturbed's sickness cd and buy some old slipknot cds. What the hell happend boys?"},{"rating":"2","title":"4 Stars for this one.","review":"This is the first album I have heard from Disturbed, but I figure that I'll go and get my hands on their first one sometime in the future, as this album had good enough elements in it to make me a fan. It did not have enough good elements in it to justify a top grade.The biggest downside is that the songs are too alike, and the album therefore gets a bit too repetitive.Some songs are original and interesting, though, such as Prayer, Liberate and Bound, but songs like Remember and Mistress just sounds too much like other songs. Not to take anything away from them, though. I really like Remember, even though the intro scared the hell out of me...Davids voice is great, and they really know how to make some catchy tunes, even though I disagree when you say that the rest of the band is that much above average. I find them acceptable, nothing more."},{"rating":"2","title":"INSPIRATIONAL (and a big step up in brains)","review":"Exhaltation is the best word to describe the feeling while singing along to \\"Remember\\". Besides the fact that they simply have an extrmely clean, hard, and crushing sound; the lyrics suddenly convey an attitude and meaning that I have rarely heard in a band. At first glance or listen you would think that they are just another angry band, but if you can't follow his lyrics, just read along once or twice and i guarantee you will find a message of hope in humanity, and a disdain for apathetic christianity which is truly inspirational. Thats not to say there isn't anger in the music, but only anger at the conformist, lazy, frightened, and hateful society we live in. A theory about the cover symbol: is it a conglomeration of all of the religious symbols?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Diturbed!","review":"This cd is awesome!! I love it! I can listen to the album the whole way through and not get bored with a single song on there. Its a little different from their first cd,....but I actually think its better. Its something you can listen to out in public and not have everyone think you are some weirdo. \\"Devour\\" would have to be my favorite song followed by \\"Mistress.\\" Lead singer doesnt do all the crazy stuff with his voice,....which i missed,....but its still a great album! I definitely recommend buying it,....even if you didnt like their first one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Amazing!","review":"This CD rocked me away with all of the great mindblowing tracks. Every track is better than the next(exeption of Darkness). Every track was great. There was great lyrical CD, but I think the real thing that blew me away was the guitar riffs. This was definitly the guitarist's CD. There were great guitar specialities in Mistress, Intoxication, Remember, and many different other songs. This is a big reccomend for anyone who liked Sickness. Definitely buy this classic CD for your rock collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than before","review":"Let's get one thing out in the open. This cd is softer more positive AS INTENDED. David wanted to put out a softer more positive cd after 9/11.Another thing, this is not \\"Nu-Metal\\" David doesn't call distubed nu mteal because that would indicate a rap kind of influence. Disturbed has none.It is also a treat to hear David sing yes I do miss the grunts and various sounds, but his singing to me is more enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album","review":"Great album. Full of intense, hard hitting songs. A very mature, hard, intense album. Drainman increases his vocal length dramatically and the heavy guitar riffs and lightning quick music landscapes progress. A cd that shows this group knows the world [isn't bad]. A very much more optomistic album than their 1st, with positive messages about believing in yourslef and never backing down. All great songs on this album, a truly great album. ... This cd ranks tied for #1 of the year, right next to the other saviors of rock music, Audioslave."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Music","review":"This is much more mature than their previous release.

This CD really gets you in the mood with great vocals, guitars, and lyrics.

It seems that David Draiman is conflicting with his spirituality. The vocals are still as rich as they were in \\"The Sickness.\\" However the music is kind of redundant. But, there are some catchy lyrics that make each song entertaining to listen to. The first track \\"Prayer\\" is a great opener! This is also the first single off of the album. The music is more melodic, but yet heavy as ever! I do reccomend this album, it has alot of potential, and it was well worth the wait!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the price of admission!","review":"Those of you that haven't heard of Disturbed don't know what you're missing. For those of you that know who Disturbed is, then you're in for a treat with their sophmore effort. The entire album is awesome from the opening song, \\"Prayer\\" to the closing track, \\"Darkness.\\" This album is a step forward for the band, and the emotions that Drainman puts into his lyrics just jump out at you from the speakers, that is if you have a good sound system. Not for the religious, Believe is an awesome album that belongs in the hands of any lover of metal. Also, the limmited edition comes with a DVD with the \\"Prayer\\" video on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated and Forgettable","review":"This and Taproot's brainless \\"Welcome\\" deserve special mention in 2002's most disappointing and overrated albums.What's the connection between Disturbed and Taproot?

Sure, the music is OK, but It's not aggressive, rageful, or even explicit. It's David Draiman telling his audience not to hate anyone. What ever happened to the raw emotions of the previous album? The whole album is lighter, with few ventures into the world of screaming vocals. David sings the whole time, automatically losing points in my book.

Unfortunately even rinsing the corn-starch off did not make these palatable and I would have to recommend that folks avoid these, or at the very least select the chili flavored version as they are far more fresh and actually taste like the product I remember having as a child."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should Always Be In Print","review":"I was given this book in 1968 and it remains one of my favorites. Why? Because until very recently it was the only book of poetry written by children that I could find. As a child I loved reading poems written by other children. The language and metaphors sounded real to me, as in \\"I hear the drummers strike the sky\\" to describe \\"Thunder\\". I continue to be touched and inspired by the poignant clarity found in the poems of \\"Miracles\\".\\"Miracles\\" is a wonderful book for anyone who enjoys the poet voice. It should ALWAYS be in print. Children need to know and have such examples of their own muse.

The second board arrived defective as well - the hook that is supposed to hold the board together so it doesn't open, doesn't work, so the board is always half open and impossible to store. I'm sending it back (after suffering through repackaging again). In addition to the fact that I've received a defective product twice, I have to say that the board is huge and is NOT easy to open.

I could put up with the bad story if the action was good, but unfortunately the action is really bad. Everyone who Liu fights has a gun, but they never pull out their guns until it's too late. It becomes repetitious to say the least.There is one scene worth watching. When Phillip Ko and John Liu have their fight, it is intense. It is about twice as good as the fight they have at the end ofMars Villa.2/5Picture quality is decent.I would have liked to have seen the movie Fighting Fist of Shanghai Joe, but this is a double-sided disc and for some reason Shanghai Joe wouldn't play on any of my DVD players or my computer.

This is nothing like that. The first thing you have to do with this DVD, is to go into the set up menu and turn on the English, and now you have a dialogue spoken in Norwegian with English dubbed in. Hard to watch. Add to that the vocal music and text shown in newspaper articles is all in Norwegian, this leaves an English viewer out of the loop. That behind us, this storyline is standard fare, the actors do a great job, the leading lady is a take charge likable character. In the horror genera, I think the bar has been raised quite a bit above this production. Yes it has it's moments, of suspense, but it doesn't quite make the grade of a modern slasher film. I don't want gore for the sake of gore, such as Saw, but this one seems to go out of the way not to offend anyone.

I'm sorry folks, but I've seen these type of films all before. Story be damned, I'd have to say that the acting is pretty solid, especially by the female lead.

While King usually delivers a subtle creepiness, and Barker a wildly imaginative story, I found this Koontz work to be careening, over-the-top pulp. Roy Miro, the out-of-control government agent, is interesting, but the broader storyline is amateurish, the kind of superficial plot you might have tried to write yourself in a high school creative writing class. The characters in the book are as one-dimensional as any I've encountered, and the dialogue is stilted and cloying throughout. I listened to this book unabridged on audio, narrated by Anthony Heald - the Vice-Principal from Boston Public. To my ear, the spoken dialogue was so unnatural as to be almost unlistenable. I read Koontz's \\"Sole Survivor\\" after this, to compare at least two of his books.

This is entirely a product of the 90ies, with conspiracy theories, the X-Files and JFK intrigues going on... I am not sure if I should think this book is good. It literally incites every reader to literally hate and mistrust anyone related somehow to the government...While I do agree that nothing and nobody is perfect and that abuse of power are a fact, generally denigrating the American government and people working for it doesnt really seem to me the appropriate way to deal with the problem. I wouldnt wonder if some far right milita are using this as their favorite bed time story.The story itself is well writen, the action is good and it's good entertainment.

I liked the main villian, but Spencer Grant and his canine sidekick were too cheezy for my taste. The pacing was off- if this were a quick 300 page paperback, it could have been swell, but drawing out a corny story with cornball charcters is not my idea of time well spent.Sorry, Dean...maybe I'll give you one more strike till you're out (talk about cheez)but I think you are going the way of the dodo bird as far as my world is concerned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great author","review":"I enjoy several of this author's works.

Find a comfy chair....sit back....and enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Action that goes nowhere","review":"This being my first Koontz book, I approached with the caution necessary whenever I read a mega-selling author such as Koontz, Grisham, or King. The suspicion turned out to be justified. The movement of the novel is sluggish, while the plot turns are ridiculously predictable. I was waiting for some huge realization at the end, some monumental literary zenith that would make the 20 hours spent slogging through this worthwhile, but in the end it was ultimately more of the same: predictable, mainstream, low-brow.Try some Douglas Coupland on for size and give yourself a challenge. I recommend Girlfriend in a Coma."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best part of the book is...","review":"Eve Jammer's acts of inexhaustible autoeroticism. I bet the author had a good time imagining and writing this!Quite seriously, the author was pretty good in his writing. Problem is, he gets too much with descriptions and metaphors. And regarding Spencer Grant's vague reminiscences of his half-forgotten traumatic past, Dean Koontz is no Dostoevsky. He should have trimmed down on those annoying and recurring inner thoughts and memories of Grant, i.e., those interminable texts in italics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"Koontz has a number of books that are worth reading - but this isn't one of them. His recent tendancy toward sick / erotic side-tales doesn't appeal to me at all, However, it does provide the major source of \\"mood\\" for the book - so it was probably needed.

This was the first of three novels in one hard cover book. I threw the book away without reading the other two stories after reading Dark Rivers of the Heart because I could not in good conscience give the book to anyone else. I could not believe the theme could be so wacky, the text so poorly written, the character development so infantile, that, to give the author the benefit of the doubt, I finished the book only to reaffirm my initial reaction of \\"why am I wasting my time on this?\\"Mr. Koontz, you will not waste my time again."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"first problem: im a computer guy, and he has it all wrong. why, oh why, dont writers consult computer people and ask, \\"Am I saying this right?\\"second problem: the dialogue sucks. hard. tell me, when was the last time you heard a furious lawyer, upon finding out about a framed family member, yell out, \\"Those..Those morons!

It provided for multiple twists, and deep thoughtfulness. I can see why Koontz had to take some time off after writing this just to clear his head. The only issue I had with this audio book (and I listen to a ton of them being on the road alot)was I felt that the audio was read a little too fast. I did get used to it by the second disc and thouroughly enjoyed it. From a fiscal perspective, buying these audio books used makes a ton od sense. This one was in great shape with no skips."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absurdly pretentious, but I couldn't put it down!","review":"From the very first page, I laughed out loud at the incredibly pretentious use of language by the author. The thesaurus on his desk must be huge! But I did find the book very engaging.If there's one thing that can be said for Koontz, it's that he has a sense of pace. The book reads like a screenplay, but I'd have to say I wouldn't see the movie. I enjoyed his paranoid, tortured, conspiracy-theorizing protagonists, transparent though they were, and the truly evil antagonists were oddly appealing as well.Great literature it ain't, but a fun read nonetheless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Conspiracy-based thriller with sicko erotic fantasies","review":"No doubt about it--this one grabs your attention and whirls you along for quite a ride. The over-long explorations of sick-sick-sick fantasies and the increasingly insistent depiction of conspiracy at the heart of government will doubtless turn on some readers and turn off others. In this context, \\"a real page-turner\\" meant that I skipped over page after page trying to find actual plot-related narrative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not one of his best","review":"I'm normally a fan of Dean Koontz, but I was reallydisappointed with this one.

But come on Dean! Hitchcock also did PSYCHO and THE BIRDS. A little variety couldn't hurt you either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Conspiracy theory","review":"Koontz was in full-fledged paranoid rant when he wrote this book back in the mid-90s. Everything from Waco to Ruby Ridge to black helicopters make cameos in this \\"innocent man on the run from nameless government agency\\"-themed book. It's a lot like Sole Survivor but without the metaphysical edge.I would actually have given Dark Rivers only one star (a first for my review of Koontz books) but Dean comes up with a really creative serial killer that bumps the book up in my estimation. Like I mention in one of my other reviews, Koontz is awfully hard on artists in the plastic arts, and he continues that tradition in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of koontz's best","review":"Dark Rivers of the Heart is one of Koontz's better works and if you like his writing style, you will like this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Without at doubt, my favorite Koontz book.","review":"Some people make it a point to read the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy once a year. I read this.Simply put, this is the best book I have ever read. It quickly drops you into the action, but leaves enough hidden to make you guess all the way through the book.I loved the character development between the main character and his dog, as well of course the supporting cast.I did think that one of the most interesting aspects of this book was in that the hero and his nemesis never did meet once through the entire book until the end. This is the type of thing that Koontz (and everyone else) traditionally prefers to stay away from, feeling that there needs to be interaction in order to build suspense.I can't recommend this book enough, and would highly recommend giving it a look."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Brother!!","review":"This was my first Koontz book and I loved it. It was almost too real. It was supenseful and creative. I had a hard time putting it down. I'm primarily a non-fictional reader. This had to have been good to hold my interest as well as it did. I recommend it to anyone who wonders about big brother or who just wants a suspenseful novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad, but not one of his best","review":"Anyone just getting started with reading Mr. Koontz's books may not want to start with this one. Maybe it's just me, but this one didn't seem to be as interesting as most of his others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Koontz's Best!","review":"If you really love Koontz, you can't miss this one. It's long, but if you love to read, it'll be over too quick!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it!","review":"This is my second favorite Koontz book, and I've read most of them. This novel was more like a spy thriller with lots of technology thrown in. This was one of my favorites because it had all the suspense elements of his other novels, without quite the sci-fi element. I felt that I had learned a lot when I finished it. This book is one for those who love thrillers, but don't really like the sci-fi angle of Koontz's other books. Oh, my very favorite is Lightning."},{"rating":"1","title":"A stinker","review":"Ultimately forgettable. Lame characters. Same storyline we've seen in all those shallow government conspiracy tales. Koontz's anti-govt. message was not convincing. One of his worst."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great novel","review":"it was just awesome read, thats all I have to say. I would like to comment that Koontz is obscessed with Fords and Dogs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Help in a Small Book","review":"My best friend gave me this book. I was the maid of honor in her wedding and she in mine. When I told her of my engagement, the first thing she did was send this book to me. At first I was overwhelmed by all of the lists, but later I realized that it helped you to see options you may have not thought of on your own. It has pockets for notes and receipts, lists for guests names and even recommended items for when you register! All in all it was very helpful and I would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Was Looking For . . .","review":"My mom bought me this organizer when my fiance and I first announced our engagement. I think I'll be buying a different one very soon. First of all, this one's very small, with very little space in which to write. It doesn't pay much attention to detail like you'd expect the \\"EVERYTHING\\" organizer to do. And it devotes a lot of space to buying the engagement ring, which, frankly, we had already taken care of! Big disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use!","review":"With a wedding, there are a thousand and one details that are easily forgotten. This book is very helpful and compact; I keep it in my purse. It helps you manage every little detail that in bridal excitement you might easily let slip through the cracks. It also helps with making decisions about wedding size, formality, and reception music. Now, if it could just make the mothers-in-law get along, it would be the perfect wedding accessory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"When I read the good reviews and saw the impressive price, I thought this was the planner for me. However I have found that it lacks spaces to record pertinent information, such as the details of getting a marriage license in your city/state, (or how about a modern/creative idea such as a space to work through one's name change options), yet it has plenty of room for things your average \\"down-to-earth\\" person doesn't need, such as announcing your wedding in the newspaper. Also, I find the cover to be flimsy - if they'd accept that it's spiral inctead of trying to fake that it's not it would work better and the pockets are really small and flimsy. I haven't yet decided what to do, but sadly I am considering tossing this one and going down to the bookstore to find one I'll be happy with so it may not turn out to be a great buy in the end. Don't get me wrong, tt does have some decent info in it, but so far it doesn't seem to be anything you can't get elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"This planner was never out of reach while planning my wedding. Today, I'm sending it as an engagement gift. It's an excellent resource and really breaks the wedding process into manageable pieces. Thanks to this planner, I never felt overwhelmed and had no last minute \\"surprises\\". The only drawback was the inability to store forms in this book. However, the book is small enough to put in a purse, so the benefits and liabilities cancel each other out. There is also an \\"Everything Baby Organizer\\" by the same publisher...But that's a separate review!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Everything wed organizer is just ok","review":"It has good information, but if you are looking for an in-depth more complete book, this may not be the way to go."},{"rating":"1","title":"This planner is not so great","review":"This planner is not that good. Basically it only has places for your final vendor choices. I want one that I write information in and deceide later. For example the catering section should have spots to list more than one caterer. What fool would go to one caterer and sign? This is a shop around kind of event. A calendar for appointments would also be nice. The size is good and you could take it places with you but what use would it be?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of Questions!","review":"I had lots of questions while planning our wedding! This book was a BIG help. It is divided into chapters which made it easy to read. It is a great book for newly engaged couples, without a lot of time on their hands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful AND Funny","review":"I thought that this organizer was very helpful and added a little humor to the whole \\"Wedding\\" process. Not everything about a wedding has to be uptight and this helped to keep the stress level down while planning everything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like it a lot-wish it was larger","review":"I like this organizer a lot, but I do wish it was larger, like 8.5 X 11. I like to save things and regular size pockets would be nice. I am helping my sister with her wedding so I am sure I would have even more stuff to save if I was the actual bride. I do really like the lay out and it is super helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everything and the kitchen sink","review":"Most brides know what they want for a wedding even before the soon to be groom asks them to marry them. This book contains a lot of information and you need to sift through questionnaires and worksheets to get to the good stuff. If you have chosen reputable vendors they will do a good part of the work for you. They will ask you the necessary questions in order to give you want you want because they know what a psycho bride can be like. The best part of the book is the end where they give you a timeline and space to write down the names, addresses, and phone numbers of your contacts."},{"rating":"1","title":"shallow","review":"This book has alot of \\"feel good\\" inserted in it.I was disappointed in it. I bought it to give to my daughters and daughter-in-law, but changed my mind when I read it.It strayed from the Biblical view."},{"rating":"2","title":"The standard for the entertainment industry","review":"This is a must have book if you work in the entertainment industry and are planing to hang things! This book help standardized much of the industry. It is well written and laid out. The math at times can be heavy but is mandatory to know if your are doing any planing and layouts for pre rigging. be cautious about some of the OSHA regulations as things do change be the basis of it is still very valid none the less."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Children and Hardcore Fans","review":"Like the film it is based on, this ani-manga will not convert anyone who is not already a fan. And it frustrates many fans with its careless exploitation of a previously rather well-designed series. Buy it for your kids, or if you simply MUST have every YGO item out there. Otherwise leave it alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD set, bad Packaging","review":"I always enjoyed the early years of the WWF and was excited to be able to own the first 5 years of Summerslam. After I got this as a birthday present, WWE picked the worst possible way to package these dvds! You cannot take these out without them getting scratched. They work fine, but still I would like to own it without being scratched before I watch it. So take this in mind when getting this set. But hey it's the glory days of the WWF!!

So when i saw this for sale I jumped on it immediately. Out of the 5 events my favorite is 91. It is the best summerslam on this set. The others are good too but, this has got great matches from start to finish. Don't get me wrong the others have classic matches too but, they do have some sleepers.All in all this is a great set to own if you are a classis WWE fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great action from a different era","review":"This package contains the first 5 summerslams.

I recommend this for all WWE fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pros and Cons of Yu-Gi-Oh GX Academy Duel Disk","review":"I haven't bought this duel disk, but I have the first one. The original is very similar to this one.First, if you view it in its \\"compact\\" form, you can see that it looks just like the left side of the original duel disk, where the last 3 Monster Card Zones are, making it easier to carry.Also, the Graveyard stays hidden inside the Life Point counter until it goes into Duel Mode. But I think that would make it less sturdy and it would break if handled too roughly.And Finally!!! A Duel Disk that has the Spell & Trap slots at the BACK of the duel disk. So, for all those people who worried about their cards falling out or their opponents seeing them, problem solved.Although, for a piece of plastic that transforms and has light-up numbers, it is kind of expensive. It costs $30.00!!! And right now I only have $2.00 earned up to buy it.So I hope my review helped you decide whether or not to buy this Duel Disk, and if not, go read some other boring review!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yu-Gi-Oh Academy Duel Disk","review":"I dont have right this duel disk but the chaos duel disk and i can only say that it works fine. I also think is good than the graveyard is bigger than in the two other duel disks so you not was needed to open the graveyard. i give it only 4 and not 5 stars becuase i dont have it myself so i can bee totaly sure than its so good like mine. I think its a fair price and its a very great gift for all Yu-Gi-Oh collectors.

I accepted this colored format change when I purchased the film. What I didn't bargain on was the atrocious damage inflicted on the lovely B&W analogue images.

Don't waste your money on this failed conversion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantastic Movie - Sub-Par Disk","review":"While this is a classic and beautiful movie in its own right, the disc I received could not run with the subtitles on at about the halfway mark.

The worst packaging we've ever seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"Very well written and easy to understand.

Paine nearly lost his head in France, and there were many who would have gladly done the same after he returned to the United States in the early 19th Century.

This album is short and simple, which isn't always the best thing. And did I mention pretty shallow? Nothing heavy about them. Each song is about 2 minutes or less and if the low quality doesn't make you mad that you wasted your hard earned cash, then the timelength of this album will (it's about 1/3 as long as a normal cd is).

After I finished reading the book, I at first did not know what to feel, but later I became simply angry and did not know why. Now I do. Many of his claims about what the command was like and what a supposedly wonderful boat we were under his command are simply false. Much of the success we enjoyed under CDR Waddle was due to the well-trained senior enlisted and officers from CDR Guy's tour as CO. True, the climate was enjoyable, and I did enjoy coming to work every day, but the same standards of behavior and performance were not applied to nuclear and non-nuclear personnel. This is what led to 9 Feb, not an isolated 8 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a joke","review":"I served on the USS Salvor (First Navy ship on the scene) when this incident occured. I remember that Friday night looking out into the dark sea knowing those men had already drowned. This tragedy should not have occured.

This man caused 9 men to lose their lives. He should not be allowed to make a profit from this."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Right Thing","review":"I was extremely happy with this book read it in one seating as I found it very compelling and could not put it down. I had followed Cmdr. Waddles case through the media and of course television reviews. I was favorably impressed with Scott Waddle at the time and his wife and attorney in interviews. But I was especially glad to read the Cdr.s explanation of the accident without some of the distoration of the meia. After reading this book you realize how badly at times his case was handled by the Navy and that they lost a very brillant young officer when Scott retired. Our loss and the Navy's. This is a well written acount of what actually took place an honest account, and certainly well worth reading!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Wrong Thing","review":"I have scanned the other reviews and the best one is by Jack Shriver. He hits the nail on the head in describing how Waddle presents himself in this book. I am a retired enlisted submariner and I was shocked at how thin-skinned and devious this CDR was during his career and how he portrays himself as the victim! He compares his plight to Job and even makes reference to a letter in support of him from a Pearl Harbor survivor who wondered why he only killed 9 Japanese (students) and not all onboard the Japanese trawler! How incredulous to even mention this! Scott Waddle circumvents the chain of command repeatedly (big Navy no-no) and indirectly lays the blame on his Fire Ctrl Tech and OOD for the accident. While they certainly were a huge factor, the Captain has ultimate responsibility. If CDR Waddle wants to know about a Navy skipper who truly was victimized, he should read about the Captain of the USS Indianapolis (WWII)."},{"rating":"1","title":"the negative reviews are telling....","review":"I was interested in reading this book, so I looked at all the reviews first. Most reviews are totally enthusiastic about the book and author. But there are many negative reviews too.

I found the interesting content to be in regards to the history and information pertaining to the submarine. Waddle made a grave mistake and ended up on the chopping block. While everyone makes mistakes, I couldn't help but feel that he was a little whiney and used his religious beliefs to hide the fact that he showed little or no remorse. Personally, I'm not buying any of it. How does a man like this end up in charge of a nuclear submarine?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sloping shoulders","review":"I read this book thinking that I may have been handed an insight into what went through the mind of this submarine CO when disaster struck. What I found after \\"As the CO I am solely responsible\\" was a slopy shouldered attempt to blame everyone but himself ie the Fire Control sailor didn't do his job otherwise nothing would have happened etc etc etc. Then there was the \\"This is God's will, God is great\\" stuff that high profile people involved in incidents tend to lament. Don't waste your money.

From start to finish, I was deeply impressed-often to the point of visibly shaking my head and/or making vocal noises loud enough to attract my wife's attention-by Jakiela's skills at understated humor, and tenderness without sappiness, and her ability to blend those two qualities with exquisite and devastating effectiveness. Moreover, Jakiela offers a unique perspective on commercial air travel: I will never again board an airplane without remembering Jakiela and endeavoring to behave in a manner that will not leave me skewered on the end of her pen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Difficult but very rewarding","review":"Surely this is a demanding book, Theissen assumes good knowledge of the NT itself, with its social and political situation and pagan thought at the time, and also of religious studies generally. I see it as an attempt to treat New Testament Theology from a new perspective, that of the psychology, sociology and philosophy of religion, rather than just writing another conventional \\"theology\\". It is a pioneering work and repays thorough study. One of the very best books on the Early Church!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a tour de force of writing.....","review":"I read books on the Holocaust to try to understand the times, the mileu, the horror, and the suffering.

I have a set of silicone \\"Egrips\\" pads applied and it was extremely difficult to slide the phone into the case. Once in, it's fine, but yeesh! I do have to assume that without the Egrips on there, it'd be easier to push in, but really, it could use a tiny bit more space. or some elastic somewhere on the case or something. Forget using the larger battery with this one. The leather is nice and thick, but again, it won't stretch enough to use it with the egrips or larger battery affixed.I would give this case a B or B- overall.

They were expected to die, but over generations they were able to survive and thrive. This story was known as both \\"The Survivors\\" and \\"Space Prison.\\"\\"The Space Barbarians\\" is a weak sequel. The story continues with the survivors having to deal with a new threat. The humans do a number of stupid things, which adds to the \\"tension.\\" For example the humans allow some aliens, claiming to be allies, to put a special detector on each of the survivors' space ships. It turns out each special detector has a nuclear bomb in it.If you have never read the first story, go track it down now. It is a classic.If you really enjoyed the first story, only read \\"The Space Barbarians\\" if you are willing to be disappointed, otherwise skip it and retain your found memories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad Sequel","review":"Godwin tried too hard.\\"Prison Planet\\" is great, I enjoy re-reading it every so often. I was looking forward to the sequel.However, I dropped this book into the discard pile about halfway through; I'd rather straightforward plots rather than contrived complexity. Instead of overcoming obstacles through ingenuity and perseverance, Godwin has the Ranarokians facing despicable Earth/ Athena characters and aliens with no apparent redeeming qualities. A constant parade of difficulties appear out of nowhere (\\"third level spaceship? Eh?) with little foundation or rationale.Maybe it gets better in the second half, but ....Anyone wants it- price of shipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"very dissapointed","review":"Too big for what I wanted.

I felt sorry for both principals in this tale. Lucien, a talented composer and musician, had a disastrous youth which damages his ability to bring his music to fruition as an adult. Madeline has a very manipulative step-mother with her own dark secret, who is determined to arrange a loveless, albeit advantageous marriage for Madeline very much against the girl's will. When Lucien meets Madeline with the intent of a seduction, buried sparks are ignited in Madeline. However, all's well that ends well (this is a romance, after all) but not before intrigue, lies, separation, and subterfuge almost destroy any hope of future happiness that Lucien and Madeline may have. Woven into the plot is an intrigueing sub-plot which involves Madeline's step-mother and her young lover, Jonathon Child; all in all very tastefully done by a very talented author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Historical romance with the realities of life....","review":"So many times historical romance books have problems come up that don't speak to our time. The complexities of the relationships are often times very base and minimal. This book has the fierce complexities of human relationships reminiscent of Wuthering Heights but with a better ending. This books centers around a classic tale of the musician and his muse but told in a more colorful way. I very much appreciated the authors characters, the diversity of the characters lives and the vivid imagery. The only reason I gave this four stars instead of five was that from about 75% through to about 85% thought there was a huge lag in the story with a bunch of filler."},{"rating":"1","title":"what is the author's intent?","review":"Seriously what did the female character see in the male character? his overdrinking? his uncaring and disrespect of women? his 10 yr old temper tantrum after his music was taken from him? For someone supposed to be sensible, her attraction to him made no sense to me. It seems the author was going for the good girl\\\\bad boy dynamic where the man needs saving and the supposed intelligent and sensible girl is reduced to a shivering mess just because he smiles at her, nevermind that she was aware of his less than noble intentions. This message is false to me and I did not enjoy this book because of it. The man was infantile and needed to grow up. A 2 star rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written and mesmerizing","review":"What is love? In H.R.'S it is usually a cat and mouse game played by aristocrats. Here it is not different except it feels very different. The characters feel like real people not like the fairytale characters we have come to be familiar with in HR's. That Ms Samuels can evoke from the reader such a strong sense of timelessness and place shows she is an author of unique talent and ability. Her descriptions of violent rain does make us shudder with chills. We can see the glowing colors of the flower gardens in the early morning mist. This book immerses us in the story.This novel is a romantic tour de force, complete with tortured hero in desperate need of redemption and the just-right heroine risking her all to redeem him.I highly recommend this book, it is exceptional."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's up with all the 5 star reviews?","review":"This book dragged.

Bob will appeal to new and old alike;however, let me warn you...this is hardcore old school at its best.

If you are a member of the new era, take a step back in time and see how it has been done since turkeys first walked this earth. Regardless of your genre, this book is a must have for ALL turkey hunters. The style, prose, wit and delivery is unmatched and will not let you put the book down once started. The only difference between the Godfather of turkey literature Tom Kelly and Bob Henderson is a closet full of years and experiences. You will enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Book","review":"This book is great. The album's artwork was used for the cover so there's no mistaking it. The first section of it take you through a Piano/Vocals/Chords take on all the songs. Then there's a second section devoted to TABs and chords for all the guitar parts.

The author, Samuel Woodworth Cozzens, clearly never visited Arizona or New Mexico. The history is wrong. The geography is wrong. The people are wrong. Many of the places are imaginary, and the real places aren't as they are described in this book. The pictures are imaginative, but not really from this planet, much less the Southwest. Anyone who has ever visited Chaco Canyon will be amused at the fanciful drawing of a place labeled Canyon De Chaco. As just one of many factual errors, the author goes into great detail about how amazed the Apaches were to see that he would actually bathe in a stream since he claimed the idea was foreign to them. In reality the Apaches bathed often and were shocked at how rarely the Anglos of the day did. The book will be amusing to anyone who lives in the Southwest and has even a minimal knowledge of its history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid Westinghouse!

We originally thought it was the cable hook-up, and the cable service came out twice to replace the box. The sync was STILL off! So finally we came to the conclusion that it was our beautiful new TV. The picture is fantastic, but sadly the non-synced audio and video can drive one insane.

I also had to re-do the calibrations since the firmware update is a MUST to clear off the SD audio/video lag. Not sure what audio issues some users are experiencing because I hear no buzzing with mine. No dead pixels either but usually that's a function of the (un)luck of the draw.TV could've used more silver highlights around the casing or make the bezel shinier to make it look more appealing. The picture does speak for itself however. Pretty great value for the price that's for sure.

Unbelievable!!These markers are horrible.

While the facetious title was probably a marketing mistake in its connotations of lite \\"chick lit,\\" the stories themselves are profound meditations. The point to the essential loneliness of the self, whether in or out of love. Some of the stories show men and women in strife, trying to make contact through thick walls inadequate words. Others like \\"The Secret of his Sleep\\" show the wounded self retreating into private dreamworlds, abandoning the project of love altogether.

Thirdly, one of the main arguments presented, after stating some arbitrary \\"nice-to-know\\" item on biological facts, that \\"this cannot have come into existence by accident\\".

Topics covered include General Tuning, Specific Tuning, Join Plans, Join Strategies, B-Tree Structure, Indexes, Keys, Foreign Keys, Query Prepping, Locks, and this is but to name a few. One nice feature about this book is it's not vendor specific. It covers the \\"Big Eight\\" RDBMS so this book has dual value to me as I use both SYBASE and MSSQL 2000. Buy this book. It will reveal the secrets of the SQL universe to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"He has some problems","review":"My friend has this guy and after time this figure's legs just collapsed and his arm that holds the sword fell apart as well.Now this figure is metal bolted together and back on his featOne more thing this figure looks much older than the character."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent.","review":"Rather you're a Final Fantasy or Auron fan this is a great figure. Nice attention to detail. Only complaint is upper leg joints not as mobile as you might like. Excellent figure over all. I'd reccomend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep it in the box","review":"I bought two of this toy by accident, and with both of them, they werent out of the box 5 minutes without the sword breaking. It is top-heavy and any little bumb will break it at the base of the blade. All Play arts figures are pretty flimsy but this one is just poorly designed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Auron FFX Action Figure","review":"Before I even opened the box, I was grinning like a fool. This action figure is so badass and it looks great on my desk.Pros:-It's freaking Auron.-Can be posed almost any way you want.-The detail is spectactular. Right down to the little free swinging tassel that hangs from his shoulder, and his sake jug. You can even move his glasses around, but I'm not sure if you can take them off, it doesn't feel like you can.-He is able to stand on his own. (without help from the doll stand it comes with)Cons:-The arm is a little difficult to switch.-Some joints look potentially weak, so be careful when posing.-Getting his legs to look right can be tricky because of some stiff joints.Overall, Auron is an awesome action figure and any FFX fan would be ecstatic to get one for a present."},{"rating":"1","title":"Helen Bryant didn't write this book","review":"I'll be honest; I haven't read this book. But I, Helen Bryant (also known as Helen Anders) didn't write it. Sherrie McElroy did. I've told the publisher to fix this on Amazon.com and a lot of other sites, and it hasn't been fixed.

I just wanted the public to know that not only is she true to her music, but true to herself and friends. I admire anyone who can make a living doing the things they love. Jill is a great example of this kind of person. She takes her passion very serious and goes to extremes to put her music out to the public. I cannot tell you how many times people who listen to her ask her why she is performing at the SF Pier and not signed. With a voice as beautiful as hers, I cannot help but wonder this myself. This has not discouraged her, as it drives her to be better and write deeper songs. Once you give Jill the chance to sing to you, you will forever love her, and appreciate the trials and tribulations a performer goes to, to make it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reflective Planning, Teaching and Evaluation By Judy Eby","review":"The author describes how reflective teachers think and provides specific strategies for meeting the needs of students with cultural, linguistic and learning differences. Among the areas covered are: diagnosis of student needs, motivational techniques, cooperative learning, daily and long-range planning strategies, making the environment safe for children, the integration of computer technology into the classroom, how to \\"bridge the gap\\" for diverse students who may have different backgrounds or schema; developing self-esteem, and evaluation of student progress. The author knows what the problems are-and addresses them succinctly. This book is a must for all teachers- not just for beginners!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite as clever as it thinks it is","review":"I bought this book after enjoying other books by Peter David (in the Babylon 5 series), and seeing the high rating in Amazon.After reading the first third of the book, my reaction is that the humor is rather adolescent, and predictable. The story is intriguing, but rather flat and not fleshed out.I read fewer books than I used to, so those that I read need to be really good. This book is falling below my threshold of an enjoyable read.... I hope it improves before the end; otherwise I might not make it...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slogging, desperate, and self-important","review":"I tried, I really did. I wanted to like Sir Apropos but simply could not wallow through one more page of misery and despair set in a world where ABSOLUTELY everyone is happy to indulge in rape (I kid you not, there are 3 rapes in the first 150 pages), pillage, and murder. This is by no means a fast, fun satire -- as one reviewer claimed. Satire involves wit and an appreciation for the object being satirized. This is a book filled with loathing, self-obsession, and violence. It is drowning in its own crapulence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Apropos of originality.... this book is not.","review":"The cliches were exhaustive and exhausting. I suspect other readers will, like myself run from this book \\"like priest in a .... factory\\" (David's phrase). This was a real disappointment for a longtime reader of Mr. David's work."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like Terry Pratchett... read one of his books instead","review":"Awful, awful, awful. A must to avoid. If I could give this book a negative rating, I would. \\"Sir Apropos of Nothing\\" is full of cheap puns, weak characters, and contrived plotlines, all written in a cloying, self-amused (VERY self-amused) style that gets more and more irritating with every page. Peter David obviously read a Terry Pratchett book one day and said to himself, \\"Hey, I can do that.\\" I'm sorry, Mr. David, but you can't. There is a crucial difference, sir, between you and Mr. Pratchett. He is funny, and you are not. Stick to writing comic books. You are at least good at that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Peter David!","review":"Peter David is one of those strange writers that can mix comedy with elements of tragedy and do it *right.* It's hard for me to find a book that will really make me laugh, really laugh until tears fall down my face, then make me cry out of actual sadness only a few pages later. I was hooked on this book the whole way through and wandered around in a daze after it was over (this was before the sequels came out).Excellent all around. I highly recommend it for anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be Careful, I Drive Like You","review":"Perhaps you've seen the bumper sticker that both warns and accuses: Be Careful, I Drive Like You.I think Apropos is an attempt to say, \\"Be careful, this protagonist acts like you.\\" Apropos, the real you, is not a high-minded, noble hero, but someone looking out for number one. You might accept his sort of world-weary character in a hard-boiled detective novel: a loser that \\"ain't taking no chances for nobody else,\\" but saves the girl against his better judgment. Well, here he is in a fantasy setting. But his utter lack of virtue might put you off. \\"Of course I'd save the maiden,\\" you say. But would you? Would you really? Or, \\"I'd never do anything like that to a friend!\\" Never? Not for anything?Makes you wonder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This was a great book, but unlike most novels of this sort the hero was not one I could love whole-heartedly. There were times I hated him, but it was actually refreshing to read a book where the hero wasn't all golden looks, honor bound, and duty bound. This was an easy reading book and I enjoyed it all the way through. The characters were unique and unforgettable."},{"rating":"2","title":"HAHAHAHA","review":"This is a laugh out loud book. Even if I wasn't laughing out loud, I at least maintained a smile throughout this book. So, if you want a witty, hilarious read, this is the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I won't buy the sequels","review":"Sir Apropros of Nothing seems to start like a fantasy parody. That's what the cover indicated, at least. In the mood for a silly jaunt, I picked it up.But there are actually two books here. One is a hilarious satire of most epic fantasy novels. The other is a serious depiction of a clubfooted young man, conceived when his mother was raped, physically abused, mistreated, and maligned.I feel like someone mixed Victor Hugo with Dave Barry. If the book had just been serious, or just been silly, it would be excellent. As it is, we have discussions of Sir Umbrage of the Flaming Nether Regions amidst tales of a childhood upbringing that makes you want to weep. The combination doesn't work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely Good, but...","review":"I loved the wit and pacing of this novel; it definitely kept mereading, and some turns were brilliant. Overall, definitely a good read and highly recommended for anyone who has any interest in both fantasy and Monty Python/Princess Bride style tales. However, it has flaws. Sometimes the humorous tones conflicts with the serious ones, and they cancel each other out rather than adding to one another, making it impossible to commit to any one strong feeling..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A jewel","review":"This is a beautiful book written by a man extremely well educated in religion, psychology, ethics, and philosophy. The wonder of the book is how the author manages to both contrast and integrate the different schools of thought. The main premise is that secularism has not provided adequate replacements for the ethical (and other) religious teachings, and that it should do so. His suggestions is that modern psychology should incorporate the wisdom of the saints and philosophers, which is has not so far done. His discussions go to the heart of the matter, even dealing with issues of free will versus determinism. The discussion is often very concrete with stories of specific persons and their problems. A fascinating integration of ancient and modern thought. Schimmel was propetically named by his parents, as was the biblical Solomon, he is very wise man. This is a great book to read and re-read for anyone seeking to heal themselves and those around them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seven Sins: Jewish and Christian, and Classical Reflections on Human Psychology","review":"I purchased the book upon a strong recommendation by my philosophy book club members. The book was an easy read, but I was very disappointed in the dry and mundane writing. It was apparent that the author was not fully familiar with classical philosophers other than Seneca, Augustine, and Aristotle. His \\"reflections\\" were primarily a comparison of what he considered to be significant differences between Jewish and Christian beliefs on sin and vice. While the author may be a very effective counselor in his arena, he is not very well informed of recent studies on the neurophysiology of moral behavior. While reading, I often felt that I was sitting through yet another boring religious sermon. I did not learn anything new that I had not learned in Catholic school almost 60 years ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Disappointing","review":"The EverQuest: Ruins of Kunark has become almost indispensible while playing the game. I expected this book to be an update or revision, instead it is a supplement. Only new spells are addressed here, and the only maps are of new areas. I had hoped to retire my old book and just use the new one. Instead, this one will not get much use at all, and the old manual will continue to be well used."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whats the point?","review":"By the time you reack lv 5 you will know all this book offers.It give incorrect information at times, poor stratagies at best, maps that come with the game it self. The only real use for this book is the list of spells and since this is a web base game all that play will be able to go online and look thoose up."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Necessary Evil?","review":"If you're going to play the Luclin expansion, you probably want this book. Like the original handbook, it has the new classes' spell lists, new area maps, etc.Yes, all that information is available in various places on the web. And yes, there are updates to the game over time. But the convenience of having it all in one place - especially if you're going to play a new class, new zone, etc. - is well worth it.I agree with a previous review that the biggest problem for me is that this is a just supplement (so I still need my original/Kunark guide), but it seems priced like a complete guide. Pima's having their cake and eating it, too. ;>I bought it. I'm glad I have it. And I'm sure I'll buy the new one when Planes of Power is released, too..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Non-Christians shouldn't bother","review":"This is a pleasant book but the protagonist doesn't do a whole lot except hang out and proseletyze. His faith is strong and when attacked and nearly dead, waits to hear God's words before dying. He is judgmental which I don't find endearing regardless of faith or lack thereof. The only women that are treated kindly are those that are already devout, the rest are confused, jealous, fickle, fornicators or worse.Things move at a slow pace without the unpredictability of everyday life. But since there aren't a whole lot of Christian mysteries and I can imagine devout Christians not being happy with some of the debasement of other humans found in so many mysteries these days, this should be just up their alley."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating...I'd Love to Have Been There!","review":"This lovely book is a companion to the IMAX film Coral Reef Adventure.

I cant remember what its called but it broke off relatively easy. The rest of the figure is just fine except he isn't very movable so all I can dp is hang is sword down. I am not that much on his blue sword but its still great nonetheless. The detail is very nice and I loved FFX so I found this action figure fantastic just not all I hoped. If you love FFX and like action figures than pick this up and you will be happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even more Disappointing that CCNA 3","review":"I have to say that although the first two books in the CCNA Companion Guide series were good (CCNA 1 Networking Basics and CCNA 2 Routers and Routing Basics), each being 400-500+ pages long with detailed information, the last two companion books (CCNA 3 Switching Basics and Intermediate Routing and CCNA 4 WAN Technologies) have been stripped down to 200+ pages each but still at the same price as the first two!This is in stark contrast to the actual course material which can be seen in the CCNA ICND self study book is much more rigorous and detailed than the CCNA Intro self study book. This tells me that the 3,4 companion guides should also be much more detailed in order to prepare the candidate adequately.I'm not certain if the above review used the first two books but they were much better.Not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorest of the CCNA 4 companion guides","review":"This Review is being written 8-18-2007 for WAN Technologies CCNA4 Companion Guide, by Allan Reid.This textbook was the worst one of the four companion guides provided in the Cisco Academy courses for CCNA. The text does not adequately cover the topics that are in the CCNA ICND exam. There is not enough detail on the topics introduced. Neither does it cover the topics in the Cisco online Academy course. If you use this book, you can't answer the question in Cisco's own online chapter tests. For some reason, this book diverges from the online curriculum. My classmates, and the instructor, universally agreed that this book is poor.Note: CCNA Academy courses Version 3.1 use this book. The entire curriculum is rewritten, making this book obsolete, EXCEPT for Academy use, as they may still take the old CCNA exams after the announced expiration date in November of this year.

It is actually only 180-count, not 250.In addition, the formula has changed. It used to be made with high quality calcium citrate but now it it is made with low quality calcium carbonate derived from oyster shells. In case you did not know, you are not supposed to take calcium carbonate because it does not absorb properly and it prevents the absorption of other important nutrients.I broke the seal before reading the label, so I cannot return it.

Exactly, one would imagine that this is a great game. However, this isn't so. First off, the graphics are terrible. You can hardly make out the tan blobs to be soldiers. Second, the game is VERY short -- there are only fifteen short levels. Lastly, the player hardly ever get to use a tank or a jeep.

Fire flamethrowers, bazookas, rifles or throw grenades or launch mortars. When the going gets tough you can always blow up a bridge with explosives! The only downside to the game is the graphics are not spectacular. Some time you only see a screen filled with green.

I also had a very hard time tightening the belts in the carseat because the openings for the belts did not line up well. Instead, I returned it and purchased a Kiddopotamus, which is shearling-lined and zips but fits OVER the carseat. The Bundle-Me item is perfect for strollers, but NOT for use with a carseat.

Also, since it is tall and the base of this mug is very narrow, it is a little top heavy so I have had the issue of this coffee mug falling out of my car cup holder. Even though the lid is on securely and completely closed, I have still had coffee spill all over my car (floor, seats, console) when it falls out of my car cup holder just by taking a regular turn. Other issues with the base be narrow and the top being wider is that it is easy to knock over when sitting on a desk and again, even if completely closed, it spills and makes a mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Title should be \\"Collecting Postmortem Photographs\\"","review":"I have been collecting postmortem objects for several years and was very excited to find this book in print. However, I was greatly disappointed to discover that, far from being a comprehensive identification and price guide, this book focuses almost exclusively on photographs - not the items in them. Picture after picture is generically described. Most of the photos are ascribed values in a generic range. None of the items pictured in the photos are identified or priced. Only five or six pages are devoted to collectible objects in the field. This book was misadvertised and, for me at least, a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"FASCINATING","review":"This is the first comprehensive book on collecting funeral and death related items, and is not morbid at all. It covers most of the major types of collectible items and has beautiful post mortem portraits,which I collect and must admit are my favorite items in this book.The author has an extensive collection of these and I wish he would publish more of them.There is a growing interest in this aspect of collecting, touching on a hidden and forbidden part of history and culture, history of photography, the art of stone carving and preservation of cemeteries.The author presents all of this material respectfully and with a touching sentimentality. If you collect anything related to death, you need to have this book. It has many excellent and clear photos of the items described."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money-Really Misleading Title","review":"I was so excited to see that there existed a book on post mortem collectibles. As a collector of vintage photos-dags, ambrotypes, tintypes, CVD's, and Cabinet cards, with an emphasis on post mortem photos, I was hoping that this book would showcase at least some photos from the cased photo era. However, the book does not delve into this area at all. Not one cased post mortem photo is shown. Most of the post mortem photos are people lying in coffins from the 1940's to 1960's. Plus, there are lots of pics of death related stuff that isn't really \\"collectible\\"-like pictures of tombstones. Are we to think that tombstones are collected? I certainly hope not! I would recommending passing on this and waiting for another publisher to publish something better on the subject-something like Sleeping Beauty One, but that is in print, and not cost $500+."},{"rating":"2","title":"Held up well","review":"This was a well made and long lasting toy.

This truely is nothing more than a plastic lump of blinking noise. There is nothing my child can learn from this toy and he gets frustrated when he tries to play with it, as he (and I) expect it to do something more than spit out the same, single ear-splitting song over and over again.Only one of the 3 cards actually do anything and that still isn't much. The most I hear of this toy is from the bottom of the toy box, when the other toys accidently end up pushing the buttons, as they get piled ON TOP of it.You can spend your $20 on something more effective.

Seeing the work that this man produced without the help of table saws, routers and the other tools of the 21st century is humbling.The book is definitely worth every penny for those who love the furniture of the period, who enjoy knowing the history behind a particular piece, or who just enjoy seeing objects that are beautifully built with matchless craftsmanship and care."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMERICAN BEAUTY","review":"Thanks to DuPont, American Federal Furniture is now much appreciated, and is some of the most expensive period furniture in the world. It's hard to fathom, that not long ago this type of furniture was not coveted at all, it was thought too austere and understated, the wealthy in the ninetenth century and early twentieth century wanted all things French, thankfully they finally came to their sences and now this style is considered one of the most beautiful. John Townsend was a master of the style, along with John and Thomas Seymour and Duncan Phyfe. This book does a wonderful job of highlighting his best work and the text is highly informative and the writing scholarly. If you have any appreciation for great craftsmanship or just love American Federal Furniture, then I have no doubt you will love this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not science if it cannot be replicated","review":"Several recent studies have tried to replicate the results of Dr. Price's research. None of them have done so. Replication is what makes something science, if it cannot be replicated, it is not science. Dr. Price's research may or may not have been valid when it was done in the early part of the 20th century when dental equipment was crude and techniques were primitive, but here in the 21st century, Dr. Price's research does not appear to apply to modern endodontics.

Only a coward or a sadist would use animals to try to replicate any effect in humans. The practice of vivisection is so archaic, barbaric and misleading that any imagined scientific results should be completely discarded.I'm sure there's better books out there on the topic of the hazards of root canals than this one.

An Endodontist would gladly explain to you proper treatment rationales and which will give you a predictable outcome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Root Canal cover-up","review":"OK, so we have many readers praising these findings and a couple of Dentists attacking them. How about some proof??? Are there any later studies, using newer research methods,that tries to replicate Dr Prices results? Any studies tracing the long term health history of of a population of root canal recipients vs the health history of a second population that never had a root canal? If not, then the initial round has to go to the sympathisers with Dr Price.

Following this description is the prompt assurance that he is not effete! Despite assurances, however, Nigel fails to excite one's imagination. He is a wimpy character, totally lacking in the usual masculine epithets such as strong, muscular, tall, etc. I found myself hoping that he would not claim the attentions of the fair Casandra. But alas, that is the whole point of this book! Further, though Balogh attempts to remain true to the time-period by using Regency-type vernacular, she over-uses certain expressions. Each page has either a Cor-Blimey, Zounds, La or I'faith.

Her parents have made plenty of dimes off this video and the book, only \\"a PERCENTAGE of the proceeds go to charity\\", a charity which they control and tap for their travel expenses and who knows what else. The story of this girl is tragic. More tragic is the story of how her own mother is cashing in. She KNEW Cassie never said yes but she released with this title anyway. It is dispicable. It was a very un-Christian thing to do. Cassie's story is sad and should be told but there is absolutely no way to justify the way her mother has pushed this onto teenagers.

If you want to see a movie that shows how a young woman was emotionally abused by her parents \\"tough love\\" philosophy before she was tragically and senselessly slain, get it. If you want inspirational stories of faith, you're better off reading C.S. Lewis, than seeing this sad attempt to capitalize on this poor young woman's death.

But because of violence in his home country, flights to return there have been suspended. He is stuck in the airport for god only knows how long. Tucci is determined to somehow drive him out; he does not want him living in his airport, and he would rather that Hanks make a run for it, so he could become the responsibility of the immigration authorities, but in the end, Hanks's character stays put, adapting, learning English, finding ways to eat and stay alive, even finding a job.

The movie is about a man that comes from Krakosia and goes to the U.S. But, while in the JFK airport, no one will let him leave it because his country is in a war and is actually not considered a country. And since he can't go back, he lives in the airport. It takes him a while to understand what has happened to his country, but he is very sad when he realizes it. Hanks's accent is great and his character is funny as he learns english and gets a job as a contractor. It's a unique comedy and I recommend it for anyone that wants to watch an\\"intellectual\\" comedy. (a comedy but not one like Old School, etc..)"},{"rating":"1","title":"eh.....","review":"Such potential. Such huge potential. But somewhere along the line something goes pretty serisouly wrong with this movie.

There were parts that you could tell were supposed to be funny and there were parts that were supposed to be dramatic but fell flat. Every joke revolved around Hanks' character not being able to speak English very well. All the dramatic moments revolved around pretty much the same thing.What really makes the movie horrible was the completely nonsensical plot. Almost every plot point is ridiculous and can be greeted with a big WTF?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Easily, Spielberg's Worst Movie","review":"This movie proves that even a brilliant director like Steven Spielberg and two Hollywood mega-stars like Hanks and Zeta-Jones cannot save a (very) lousy screenplay. Although the movie is not meant to be realistic - the sheer implausibility of the story, the shallowness of the characters and the cliched sub-stories - makes you squirm in your seat, waiting for the roughly 2 hour movie to end.One interesting fact - an entrire terminal has been constructed for the purpose of the film - that's quite impressive as a movie set but that's about the only thing impressive in this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty silly, bordering on stupid","review":"I usually like Tom Hanks and Catherine Zeta-Jones but this movie was just plain silly; although Stanley Tucci did a great job playing a sad sleaze.

But worst of all, there was product placement after product placement. Unashamedly so. It was pretty obvious that the only reason that the storyline involving Zeta-Jones and the Napolean book was added to the movie was to allow another 5 or so shots of Borders Bookstore.Hanks was BRILLIANT in the role - very immersive character. Spielberg on the other hand should be ashamed - only \\"Spielberg Moment\\" was when Hanks was \\"trying on\\" suits using his reflection.

He's traveling to the USA on a simple task, which we learn about through his love interest, when his country goes through a revolution. Technically no longer being a citizen of any country he's left at the airport where he proceeds to try and make the best of things.Most interesting in that he starts as an outcast with all the merchants and workers and by the time of his triumphant departure from the airport he has become a hero.Catherine Zeta Jones plays a small role as the love interest and probably did the project to work with Spielberg.Unfortunately, there's no audio commentary from Spielberg but then he doesn't seem to do it for any of his movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hanks Is Entitled To A Mistake Now And Again","review":"Hanks does his best to make this obtuse flick watchable, but little can be done as the screenplay is such dreck it would give Aaron Spelling a sugar high. Nothing about this ridiculous mess is believable except for the government slackers (excuse the redundancy) doing nothing for the main character. I wish Steven Spielberg would stop making films.

Tom Hanks has the worst acting in this movie and his character was really annoying even his accent. The character he played everyone hated him and they were all rejecting him a bunch of him not to leave the terminal and at the end he finally left but he had to stay in a Terminal for years which is wrong but still I did not like this movie. My friend and I were ready to walk out of theater and we also got our money back too. I even almost fell asleep during the film. The only scene that I thought was funny was when Tom Hanks was in the bathroom with the guy and there shaving and the guy was saying something about living in a terminal or something that is so funny the rest of the movie sucked.

What we have here is a film that could have been written using a template, something like a \\"Movie-Matic\\", which would include romantic subplots with a woman dating a man who's no good for her, and a few lovable but bumbling sidekick characters with amusing accents. An otherwise forgettable \\"feel good\\" movie is marred by the inclusion of lefty propaganda (watch for the \\"Canadian pharmacy\\" scene), and the entire basis for the plot plays into the childish notion that large institutions (like airports) are actually controlled by lone, capricious tyrants, rather than by a confusing array of local, state, and federal authorities.

Did Hanks lose a bet or something?! I couldn't stand his stupid accent and this is some of the worst acting I've seen by anyone. He couldn't have wanted to do this movie. I wonder if someone blackmailed him to put his name on the cover. What I can't believe is all the losers that try to tell you what a great movie this is. I guess they feel bad about wasting a few hours on the crap. And if your wondering why I spent the time on it? I was hoping to get a gander at Zetta-Jones' cans.

Stanley Tucci's character was unfortunately rather one-dimensional (no fault of Stanley Tucci). It also appeared that some sections were cut because there were some lines that just didn't make sense, not to mention a wedding of two people who apparently never dated.All in all, a waste of theater bucks. Wait for it on video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh so long, boring and unsatisfying","review":"This movie definitely feels longer than it is, as it continually drags through scene to scene to develop some straggly story line.It's not a love story, it's not a drama, it's not a comedy (for sure), and it's no inspiration, so what the heck is it?! Disappointing. Hanks' accent is over the top, Zeta-Jones is incidental as a stewardess and mild romantic interest (big zippo there)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Great","review":"I wasn't expecting anything spectacular when I rented this film, but I was surprised by how much I really enjoyed it. It had me laughing out loud, and cheering on Hank's character.

The huge Kennedy airport terminal itself -- a magnificent set populated with hundreds of constantly busy extras -- is the star.But wait, this airport terminal is not even a microcosm of America, Steven Spielberg is not Frank Capra and Tom Hanks is not Jimmy Stewart. Also sadly missing is an authentic spiritual quest or even a basic humanism. And worse, the final revelation of the purpose Hank's stranded, stateless immigrant's quest to honor his deceased father is absurdly empty.This movie is not just ordinary junk. It's boring, superficial, smarmy junk.Spielberg needs to have some real experiences and not process life in a dark screening room watching old movies.Remember, time wasted on bad movies is gone forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Nonsense","review":"Ugh.

Dumb. There is comedy, which is worthy of a groan or two, and little else. There is romance, but it's torpedoed by Catherine Zeta-Jones' lackluster attempt to play a romantically mixed up flight attendant with a heart of gold and deep knowledge of Napoleon (yes, you read that correctly). Not even Tom Hanks' performance--oh yes, he tries--can resurrect the superficial characterization of a man between countries and cultures, and who is meant to embody the essential goodness of mankind (apparently).This is junk food; actually, it's just junk. It's hard to watch it without concluding that you've wasted valuable time. Is it mild? Yes. Is it pleasant? I suppose in the way that music in an elevator is pleasant (I don't happen to think so). Does it accomplish anything? Resoundingly, no."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant, entertaining, funny, feel good movie!","review":"I had completely forgotten about this movie until I saw it again recently on tv. Hanks is, of course, brilliant, and although long, the movie uses that time for the story to develop and for you to get attached to the characters as you get to know them. Victor's ingenuity surviving at the airport is fun. It's a good rainy Saturday afternoon movie that will make you smile!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is just a film-length commercial.......","review":"In this day and age of Hollywood films, we have to accept the role of product placement that inhabits all major productions. Having said that, this film blows the idea so out of proportion that it is pretty much unbearable. Practically every scene that takes place in the terminal itself forces a brand name in your face and it's just a constant reminder of what remains most important in Hollywood nowadays. An argument could be made that all those stores exist in real terminals, but the way they are placed in the center of every scene just becomes too much. They include burger king, starbucks, borders books, yoshinoya, discovery channel store, and there's a few more. The best scene is one in which tom hanks is asked to do some translating for airport officials, but the story falls kind of flat and catherine zeta jones' character is pretty worthless. See it if you want, just not enough substance for me to support all that product placmement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to believe anything about this movie","review":"We just watched this on DVD [and btw, the widescreen DVD has NO extra features, none] and my gosh, I didn't believe 5 minutes of it in a row.

Apollo 13, Saving Private Ryan, Castaway and Forrest Gump are some of my all time favorite movies. Tom Hanks is in my humble opinion our generations Jimmy Stewart. He is the consumate professional who makes you care about the character he plays with great emotive ability and a keen sense of comedic timing.Unfortunately, lately his movies have been a bit disappointing. I was really looking forward to this one, but it failed to move me in any way. The romance in the story never really cooked. His mission in the U.S. was almost an afterthought and his conflict with the terminal director seems forced and unecessary.

It feel more like a story that the author was mulling in his head, put it to paper without much thought to preparation, editing or coherence.The story is a sorry mix of espionage, terrorism and revenge.I read the book out of respect for all the great books Forsythe has written in the past. But perhaps now it is time to bid adieu to his newer ramblings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Innovative Side","review":"This is by far the best book I have read.

Everyone should have atleast one copy of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"After The Phantom of Manhattan Forsyth returned to his first kind of books with the Veteran and Avenger... but results are not at the same level of books from his 'first life'. The theme of this book is not so distant from \\"The Dogs of war\\", but the book lacks the details that made Forsyth one of my favourite authors...Simply disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome back to a great thriller writer","review":"Frederick Forsyth's sabbatical from thriller writing has been too long - and now, thankfully, he is back writing again and giving us first class thriller fiction. What is interesting about him is that he is unaffected, unlike lots of his rivals, by the fall of the Iron Curtain in 1989. He has continued to be up to date and relevant in his thrillers. OK so they are not world class literature but we can't be reading Dickens all the time and for what they are Forsyth's novels are great. He is a massive improvement on the rather formulaic Tom Clancy and since Forsyth's politics are way way to the right of most people it is great that he has concentrated now instead of getting back to giving us all excellent holiday reading. Welcome back Forsyth - it is good to see you in print at what you do best again!

Against your better judgment, becausethe author is an unknown and the font is too large, to make thebook thicker. But the cover suggests an intriguing, save-the-world premise, and sports a good picture of a submarine or a swastika, so you buy the book. Before you reach cruising altitude, you have given up on the book and are reading Skymall. Imagine that book. That is Avenger. Now you know what it will be like to try to read Avenger. Even worse, because you were expecting Mr. Forsythe. It is difficult to write this, because I am his best fan. If you have not read any of the following Forsythe books, buy these instead. You will savor the book, and honor Mr. Forsythe: Jackal, Deceiver, Odessa File,Devil's Alternative, Dogs of War, No Comebacks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative and entertaining","review":"Excellent book. The author did a great job in developing the charaters and presenting a very entertaining and very informative story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly disappointing","review":"A weak, half-hearted novel from a writer capable of much more. Character has never been Forsyth's strong suit, but in Avenger he has hardly bothered with it. Synopsis: An ex-tunnel rat from Vietnam is now a \\"lawyer by day and a bounty-hunter by night\\", motivated apparently by the death of his daughter and wife. He hires out to very well-heeled people who have been wronged and cannot get justice the usual way, to bring back whoever has wronged them and hand the low-life over to the authorities. This protag is completely unbelievable, as is the villain, a 100% evil Serb who has fled his homeland after the end of the war there, taking a billion dollars with him and setting up a Dr. No-style fortress off the coast of South America. Ian Fleming did it better than this. Forsyth's usual familiarity with technology and with the various intelligence and security organizations of the world is pretty weak here, if not absent. A pathetic example of resting on one's laurels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice change of pace","review":"Rather than the \\"normal\\" thriller plot, Forsyth reveals an event early, and then the rest of the book leads up to that event.While I agree with other reviewers that this is not \\"Jackal\\", the protaganist is a very methodical hero who is quite interesting.If you like \\"cat and Mouse\\" suspense novels, this is a book for you. All the events are credible, and the contemporary setting of the Bosnian war is very interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"The master is back!","review":"I was asked if this book was good. No, it is spectacular. At first, AVENGER seems like a simple tale of revenge, but it is so much more.The story begins with the murder of an idealistic college kid in Bosnia in 1995, and a bereaved grandfather who decides to do \\"one more good thing.\\" The Avenger is Cal Dexter, a kid who made his bones in Vietnam crawling down tunnels and wasting Viet Cong. The rest is waiting for you between the covers of this extraordinary book.Mr. Forsyth reminds us of what he did when he wrote THE DAY OF THE JACKAL. The same intensity, twists and turns keep you guessing right up to the end.This book deserves 10 or 15 stars.Run don't walk to your nearest book store get a copy right now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Avenger","review":"I bought and read almost all of FF's novels and enjoyed most. This publication is a bummer! My feeling is someone is re-writing history in a very distorted fashion for pure political reasons. Not so much Vietnam or Bosnia etc. but our own relations with OBL and his organization.It is historical knowledge that OBL is a true friend of the Bush family, that he was on the CIA payroll and still may be. The reasons that the arabic world hates us is not religious as this book makes you believe, but mainly found in a never-ending middle eastern conflict.To write a third grade book and semi-hiding just on the side some political statements, unproven and untrue, is scandalous. To see a review by someone under the signature of Gingrich only adds to the propagandistic \\"value\\" of this book.As much as I have tried, I can't find FF's original talent as a foremost writer of fiction anyplace in this \\"novel\\" I will save your readers time by rehashing the storyline, but it is amateurish and not believable"},{"rating":"1","title":"Forsyth once wrote one of my favorite suspense thrillers","review":"The Odessa File. Judging from \\"Avenger,\\" those days are long gone. Forsyth needs to a) get an editor; b) begin to care about his readers again; c) rediscover a sense of pride in his craft.The narrative never attains any flow, which sharply reduces the level of suspense of this action-packed, yet dull novel. One problem is that Forsyth seems to think that every character must be introduced with a full-length birth-to-current biography. That's OK, if you're 15 years old and are just starting out writing, but points to the degeneration of Forsyth's skills.\\"Avenger\\" is a wildly-implausible, sloppy piece of garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"This cannot be Forsyth","review":"Very disappointing novel that has nothing to do with Forsyth's previous work. The intricate plots of Dogs of War and Day of the Jackal give me the impression that this story was not written by the man himself. A messy story from Bosnia via the Middle-East to South America? Come on, next to Bin Laden Forsyth introduces South African bullies, private armies, CIA black ops, Vietnam vets and every other cliche in modern suspense. Please pick up any other Forsyth."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG DISAPPOINTMENT","review":"I have always been a big fan of Frederick Forsyth but this book is a disappointment! There are so many threads to the narrative that before he could weave them together into whole cloth I had to go back and re-read sections because I had forgotten \\"who did what to whom\\" (and no, I am NOT a slow reader). There was entirely too much pre-Sept.11 historical background that contributed little or nothing to the book and served as a distraction. Some was necessary but he should have saved all that for a non-fiction historical novel. By the time Mr. Forsyth got to the point, the book was almost finished."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Forsyth really write this trash?","review":"I've been a huge fan of Forsyth since reading The Dogs of War. I've always loved his work.But now this.This book is filled with a amateurish writing style, barely-plausible plot points, and various inaccuracies which make me wonder if the author actually researched the subject matter. The story isn't even that interesting, but this is probably due to the lack of believability.The short, choppy writing style makes this difficult to read, exacerbated by the story line suddenly going back in time to explain something or other. And just as suddenly you're back in the present, and worse for the wear since the transitions simply aren't done well. They're more like afterthoughts.It would not surprise me to learn that Foryth did not write this. The writing style isn't like his books of old, the plot is far below par, and it is just not very good at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"Like the previous reviewer, I had my doubts that Forsyth actually wrote this. It reads like an amateur attempting to write in Forsyth's style. It's clumsy and convoluted, the characters are entirely two-dimensional, and what's more it's simply dull.I've loved every other Forsyth novel, but this is a real stinker."},{"rating":"1","title":"WAY too much backstory!","review":"You want details? You want backstory? Then this is the book for you. I bet there are not 70 pages in this book that take place in the \\"now\\" of the story!EVERY time a new character is introduced the author has to give us pages and pages of backstory - school, war stories, etc. Toss in asides about the \\"real story\\" of Vietnam or the troubles in the Middle East (in the author's opinion). This all turns what is an OK story in a long and twisted read.As to some of the plot devices - the Avenger is smart enough to get his entry visa when they didn't think to look and engineered on purpose what happens at the end of the book. Sure a lot of it is a stretch - but I didn't have as much trouble with that part of the story as I did with all the needless, verbose, backstory.Wait for the paperback on this one - or get it from the library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Avenger: Well worth the purchase.

And I was not disappointed.The novel's flow is non linear as a lot of reference is made to the past. This helped to sustain my interest as the unfolding details added to the suspense.I particularly enjoyed Dexter's ability to constantly remain ahead of the challenges thrown his way.A minor draw back while reading this were few repitions I recognized from another of the author's titles. At other instances, I also found detailed descriptions a bit distracting as I was eager to get on with the storyline.Overall, it was a thoroughly enjoyed read.Repositioned: The Journey"},{"rating":"2","title":"More of the Avenger, Please!","review":"A good book about avenging those wronged by slimeballs. I liked this book even if I did guess the ending. A lot of the plots I did not guess like Cal loosing his wife and child. It's not unusual for 16 year olds to get a hard head as they grow up and embrace life and Cal's daughter and only child was no different. Without giving the story away, suffice it to say, it didn't end well for her, her father nor her mother. Cal made it through difficult times and seemed to overcome a lot of strife in his lifetime. He was loyal to his friend (the other tunnel rat) and the favor was returned without him even knowing it. But I beleive in revenge and reading this warmed my heart.

An inspiration to any karateka studying the forms. Kanazawa really is a great master! However, this particular DVD is in the PAL format ( not readily viewable in the US) and my Toshiba DVD recorder (fairly new) will not play this disk, nor will my JVC or Sony. The only way I could watch it was on my computer. I would have given this DVD 5 stars if not for the format problem.

I bought and looked through all the books I could find on the subject matter.This is the best book on the planet for what I wanted.From the Power Sound Bite to the Power Close, the author lays out excellent ideas with great examples. The book focuses more on the content of great presentations (what you say) rather than the implementation of presentations (how to say it).I practiced my presentation over and over, and refined it with Wiskup's ideas in mind. My presentation went extremely well.

Most books read painfully like text books and others labor over the subject - and often use manipulative techniques in attempt to win over the audience. Presentation S.O.S. is an enjoyable read.

It is just amazing to hear Dave Brubeck talk about creativity or what Joshua Bell thinks about as he plays the violin. This book lets you inside the minds of these greats and lets you catch a glance at their genius and then allows you to be inspired by their inspirations. This book not only lets you peak \\"behind the curtain\\" of the musical legends but takes you in to their living rooms, childhoods and thoughts !"},{"rating":"1","title":"BAM! disgraces the PPG's.","review":"As much as I like the PPG's and an advocate for the resurrection of the Rowdyruff Boys, I'm disappointed with this game. First of all, I enjoy the fact they're finally in a 3D environment, but the story is just, well, pathetic. This is supposed to be a fighting style type game. Not the best fighting game I've seen. If BAM! wanted to make a really good fighting game with the PPG's, they should do it in the style like Capcom's Marvel vs. Capcom 2. That would really get my attention. Another thing I don't like, where are the rest of the characters? Where's the rest of the Gangreen Gang and the Rowdyruff Boys? BAM! really held out in that department. In the simulator mode, why can't you pit a PPG against another PPG? I like a little sibling rivalry. That's just stupid. If gamers like the PPG's, don't get this game. Stick to the Gameboy Color and Advance games...they're more challenging."},{"rating":"1","title":"It stinks( a 8 yr old girl and 14yr old boy)","review":"This is the worst game ever!

I like the PPG and have been known to watch a few episodes with my daughter. If I had a choice of watching a re-run of the PPG for the 10th time and playing this game, I would watch the re-run. This game is too hard for a normal adult. You are not able to block punches effectively nor are you allowed to run away to another part of the screen when you are getting (beat up) which is quite often. I was also hopeful that this would be an adventure/fighting game instead of a Mortal Kombat wannabe. For the age group they have targeted, this game is truly a let down. I wish I would have read the reviews before buying this. Do not buy this game unless you have nothing better to do with your cash."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an excellent N64 title","review":"I was very surprised at the quality of this title, especially so late in the life of the N64. The 3D versions of the Powerpuff girl characters are excellent and the style of the artwork suits the cartoon well. The game is very accessible too - it was easy to pick up and play and beat the first couple of characters. Later characters are definitely harder to beat but not impossible.The only thing that lets this game down is the appaulingly repetitive tune that plays continuously. So buy an X-Box."},{"rating":"1","title":"How long did it take me to beat this?","review":"Hmmm...oh,yeah..about 10 minutes.The \\"moves\\" aren't stronger then others,the animation is funky,and unlocking all the characters takes about 5 minutes..And where are the Amoeba Boys?They could have a special attack that you stick to them,or something...This was just a sorry excuse for a game,and it's not even good to rent.It had a good idea,but ended up being trash...PPG fans will be dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Game I've Ever Seen","review":"I bought this game for my niece.

Even my 8 year old son who is excellent at maneuvering controls, couldn't get a handle on the game.

Oh and when you try to get the free stuff he offers in the book the web site does not work very well and I was not able to getthe free offer so I don't know if that is just more hype or maybe I will find somthing of substance that I have not yet found from reading this book.

I was disappointed. The book has nothing new to share. Don't get me wrong. I like books that can educate you and prepare you to how to be rich. However, I think most \\"how to get rich books\\" such as this one are overrated. They are pretty much same, saying the same thing over and over again such as focus on opportunities, stay positive, and stay out of debt. I don't understand why people in general can't seem to live within their means, educate them self about how to make money in the stock markets, real estates, or any ventures that will make them money.

There are quite a few things said in the book that have made me think. For example, if you stay comfortable, that's where you will be, here.Cons:1. No joking, if on every other page, you find the author didn't mention his great seminar/tape/book, I'll give you a dollar. IT IS JUST TOO MUCH!!!2. It is true that action leads to result, but many of you must keep this in mind, 90% of business fail during the first year; 5% fail during the next 2; only probably 1% survive, if that.3. Getting rich involves a lot of hard work - even for Hally Barrie. If you are not willing to put down your time, energy, your health (very often), you CANNOT become rich by just taking actions.4. Save the get rich fast speech, please. Network marketing? Really? Are you kidding me?If the author could balance out the cons, which are easy to fix, I would rate this book at least 4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Few Good Tips","review":"I bought this book and the audio version too. The CD is difficult to understand with the sound fading in and out, up and down. Maybe T. Harv is not the right man for the job. His is not a smooth voice. There is an obvious lack of compression on his voice that is a bit distracting. Perhaps, reading the book first, then listening to the tape if you want reiteration, would help to understand Eker's message. The book does an excellent job of selling his seminars too. The first one is, of course, free. After that it can get quite expensive. I took two and decided to also take Eker's advice and stop throwing good money after bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Copy Of \\"Rich Dad Poor Dad\\"","review":"OKay... I have been reading this book and there are lots of things helpful.However one thing that bothered me is that he keeps advertising his seminars. In every chapter he relates the subjects he is defending , with what he teaches in his seminars...I personally dont like that..Book is written well and really takes the readers attention.Another thing is if you really want to understand the secrets of the millionares... READ \\"RICH DAD POOR DAD\\"...by Robert KiyosakiHarv Eker's gives almost same points as Robert Kiyosaki's book \\"Rich Dad....\\"So I recommend you to read \\"RICH DAD POOR DAD\\" before reading this. And when it comes to going to his seminars and paying thousands of dollars. Read other investment books of Robert Kiyosaki. I m sure that would be more helpful..!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing New Here....","review":"I was disappointed in this book for a couple of reasons. The first reason is that there is nothing new here. Anyone who has read at least two self help books in their lives, realizes that change in one's life of any sort starts from within. Changing your inner world before your outer world can change is definately NOT a new concept. What is the big secret there?? Eker writes as though he believes that he created this concept, but \\"don't believe a word\\" he says!!.The second part of the book lists reasons how rich people differ from poor people i.e. \\"poor people work hard for their money while rich people have their money work hard for them\\".Oh please!!!The number one reason I do not recommend this book is all the hype and push to spend more of your hard earned dollars and attend one of his seminars.Do yourself a favor and read \\"Start Late Finish Rich\\" instead.

His only hints were to become self employed and manufacture something that can be sold to many people, like pencils, or to produce something that can generate royalties.

They feel unworthy or feel as if they are obligated to return the gift, whether it is a verbal \\"you look good today,\\" or it's a gift of paying the bill at a restaurant.

It's more than just about money, it's about what a person wants out of life.Great joy can be had overcoming personal challenges and changing oneself for the better; asking for what you really want and then accepting the subsequent responsibilities.The resultant growth makes life a true journey and not an idle warm pond to soak in, (yawn), for eternity..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hits the nail on the head","review":"It is obvious that Eker has a good handle on the Inner Game of Wealth. If readers are able to overcome any emotional blocks and beliefs that get in the way, there is no reason why they should not be able to attain success.Unfortunately, I would not be surprised to find that many people will read this book and not act upon it - this would be a self-defeating response to the challenges presented to them by the ideas Eker presents.Those who really want to succeed will seek out the tools that will help them dissolve all the impediments to their success, and then make full use of the solid ideas and concepts found in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read For Everyone","review":"If you only read one book this year, it should be this one. Harv teaches you to totally rethink all your attitudes about money and wealth. He teaches you how your current attitudes were shaped by your parents and your experiences in the past.

For those who have a naturally healthy perspective about acquiring wealth, the book may seem shallow, but for those of us who were brought up to believe that wealthy people were immoral and greedy, Eker's insights and revelations are a deep, nerve-twanging catalyst for change.Some of Eker's mantras talk about the Universe as though it were a conscious entity ready to reward those who display the proper intentions. It's New Age crap, but doesn't get in the way of his overall message.If you aren't living up to your financial potential, you owe it to yourself to read this book.A.

I found this book to be a total waste of time. Many of the things he wrote about you can find online for free.I found the \\"The Wealth Files: Seventeen Ways Rich People Think and Act Differently from Poor and Middle-Class People\\" to be filled with assumptions. Some of the people who are Rich received an inheritance and never really did anything to benefit their money such as Paris Hilton.The only person that is getting rich is T.

Yes, the rich think differently about wealth. (Hence the rating of two stars as opposed to one.)The book offers rather nebulous strategies in wealth growth, but without any concrete suggestions. Those nuggets are teasingly alluded to, but promised in Mr Eker's seminars. And from the examples in the book, during the first seminar, you will be hounded to attend the next..and the next...and the next, all the while contributing to Mr Eker's coffers.I walked away with the impression that the main purpose of this book is to pitch the seminars, and the author does so with the fervour of a used car salesman. I have already contributed to Mr Eker's net worth by buying this book. I would hate to insult my intelligence by contributing further by going to one of the seminars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero stars: a waste of time and money","review":"No one seriously interested in accumulating wealth today thinks in terms of \\"millions\\". Accumulating wealth is a long-term project, and a young person earning the minimum wage and saving at a modest rate today can realistically expect to be a millionaire by middle age.Even as an outdated metaphor, \\"millionaire\\" is a sloppy term, characteristic of the misleading sloppy thinking and sloppy writing found throughout this book. You would do better to deposit $20 in a low interest savings account, rather than contribute it to the author's self-promotional enterprises and personal pursuit of wealth at your expense."},{"rating":"2","title":"HOW DO WE MARRY THIS WITH THE LOOMING MASSIVE DEPRESSION?","review":"While I found Harv's book very interesting and full of the \\"right stuff\\" as many reviewers note, I am struggling with how one focuses on building wealth in today's environment of the inevitable coming demographics driven collapse. Is there enough time left? Arnold's The Great Bust Ahead, which I read two years ago, has a 100% track record so far on its predictions, and has its primary prediction of a massive depression starting perhaps as early as 2009-10 and lasting 14 years now closing in on us. (The book's thegreatbustahead site is a good read). How does one build wealth with this looming?

Break out of any subconcious negative money conditioning you may have from your childhood.

It's quite inspiring actually. The main idea of the book is correct: it's all about what you belive in. As opposed to what you want to beleive in.

Of the 17 \\"wealth principles\\", many are worthless cliches, although several were sound and worthy of further reflection. The book is really spoiled by the author's reliance of several mystical beliefs, essentially bordering on the basic idea that if you think wishfully about money all the time, the universe will just provide more of it to you. The book is further devalued by the author's constant references to his additional products-I feel ripped out when I pay money for a book and instead of substantive information, I receive advertising. You can flip on the TV anytime late at night and watch advertising for various get rich quick schemes for free."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated and nothing special.","review":"This book is nothing special. Your attitude and mindset is important as this book says, but there are much better books that inspire and offer practical and actionable advice. The hype wears off shortly after.This author has built an industry of his self-help products and motivates you to want to hear more, go to the next seminar, purchase his next course in the series of teaching courses that his company offers.Save your money and borrow the book from the library if you really want to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of Clichés ..","review":"One of the reasons of not being rich is wasting time reading books about getting rich.

I expected another book on getting rich easily, thinking big, \\"visioning\\" your future, positive thinking kind of \\"wealth building\\" book. Secrets of the Millionaire mind goes deep into the psychology of why we do or don't manage to build wealth.

Was i surprised that his techniques of \\"tracing the fruit to the root\\" not only pertains to finances but can also possibly help diagnose something on the personal side too.Do you want to get back to make six? or seven figures or more again???READ THIS BOOK and sign up for the author's Millionaire Mind Intensive workshop!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"As an entrepreneur","review":"If the boss you argue with is someone other than yourself, you are not in correlance with this book in any way no matter how hard you try to be. The attributes within this book is something you are born with. It's not something you can force into your own mind. You cannot directly replicate the success brought on by someone else. You have to do that yourself.

I got a lot of \\"big ideas\\" from it, three of which I'll share later in this interview. However, I also feel that it has more an its fair share of \\"pitch\\" in it. The guy has to make a living, which I appreciate, but he's really pressing hard at getting you into his seminars and other Millionaire Mind stuff rather than letting the good ideas sell themselves. If you can get past that, there is a lot in this book that is very valuable.The big ideas I got:1. Play to Win - Obvious, right? A lot of people play \\"not to lose\\" though and there is a big difference.2. \\"Tap Roots for Better Fruits\\" - Work on the foundation of your issue and you'll get much better results.3. Work on yourself and your income will grow with you.If you are into things like, this you'll love this book. It is not a \\"make money system\\" but a way of life. It will require some changes on your part. I have found the changes worthwhile and very helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"One long sales pitch for his seminars","review":"Near the end of the book, T. Harv made a great point about \\"if you learned something, it was worth it.\\" - I don't think he was referencing the book, but i did learn a few things...and with this logic, it was worth the quick read. What I couldn't stand were the non-stop references to his seminars and subtle hints about how pyramid schemes can make folks money. I'm guessing there is some sort of referral/pyramid scheme with his seminars, hence the majority of the book came off like one big sales pitch to attend his seminar. Take out all references to his seminars and how much they'll help your or have helped others, and you are left with 1/2 of the content, which again, would be worth the read and has some good ideas/points."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!!","review":"I think Harv hit the nail on the head with this one.

I wasn't going to write a reveiw for this book until I unintentionally realized as I was comparing two terrible books that just finished within a month of each other were written by him. Money is inheritently connected to psychological behavior, however it isn't a deep seeded root of your subconscious whether or not you 'have what it takes to be a millionarie' as this book implies. Both of his books seem liked rushed attempts at self-help or personnel development and both missed the mark and made zero postive impact on my life. I'm just happy that Amazon let me buy the used version so atleast I didn't waste as much money as I could have. Stay away from this author and read The millionarie next door, and the Rich Dad Poor Dad series, and you'll find yourself getting the information that T. Harv Eker tries to present but fails."},{"rating":"2","title":"Say What You Want, But This Works...","review":"It may be difficult to accept the messenger, but I appreciated the message in this book. Absent an inheritance from a rich uncle, I just don't think it is possible to be a success in any endeavor unless you develop your mindset in a manner similiar to that advocated here. This book teaches workable techniques to allow you to rein in your thought processes. Some of the techniques are based upon affirmations/declarations and some are based upon goal setting and visualization, but the bottom line is that your ACTIONS have to follow your thoughts. This book can give you the means to translate thought into action. It is easy to read, but sometimes hyperbolic. If you can get past the hyperbole, you'll find many useful gems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly Useless","review":"I was unimpressed with this book.

If you've read any of the books by Ries and Trout on Marketing, you really appreciate how succinct they are in delivering their many lessons.

The levels are enjoyable in single player mode and all in all its a good game. I only have really one major problem with this game and that is in the multiplayer area. In some recent james bond games there have been bots that you can fight in multiplayer mode instead of going head to head. I find the bots very fun to play against and they provide a good challenge. The problem with this bond game is it doesn't have any bots which really decreases the multiplayer value.

EA doesn't have a great reputation of putting out great James Bond games but they were some good games. In this game you have to go after this man named Nigel Bloch & This Woman named Malprave who are holding world leaders hostage. You team up with C I A Agent Zoey Nightshade. Now this game isn't based on any of the movies I don't know if it is based off any of the novels. You get 2 driving levels & the car has weapons. The weapon selection is good of course you get The Classic Walther PPK along with assassault weapons. Controls are fine the enemy movement is sporadic & it is a problem I wish they could've fixed that. The gadgets are there & are fun to use. So this is a great game it's not up to par with Golden Eye so if you decide to play it expect some minor flaws.

The controls are different for different levels, so there is a slight learning curve.2. The levels tend to be fairly short. As you'll see, you get a bonus for how quickly you complete a level, which is based on a \\"suggested\\" time to complete. To me, it should take more than 3-4 minutes to complete a level for this type of game.3. Maybe this is just me--but at a few instances, I was unsure of what I needed to do. For example, while driving a tank, I wasn't sure how to switch weapons. During a fight with a major character, I didn't know you could steer missles after they'd been fired.Overall--very cool game, with some baggage."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for a month or party","review":"This is a great game. the only problem is that after you beat it the only fun left is the two player mode."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW!","review":"It's by far bested by Nightfire, but I gave AUF a 5/5 because it was great anyway!

Unfortunately, the unlockable stuff isn't really worth unlocking. I don't mind a game that gives you all options up front, but if you're gonna bother us with unlockables, make 'em good!If you have some friends, the 4P stuff is really quite good.

The plots always become to developed without you actually doing anything to invoke it, just shooting some people, and sitting through a cut scene. This game is no exception. There seems to be no storyline continuing into the actual gameplay, just the cut scenes. The levels don't allow any exploring. Further more, even though I enjoy an easy, fairly quick game, AUF takes both of those to extremes. If you're good, these measly 11 levels can be beaten in 2 hours.There are two good parts though.

Like in the 1st level if you complete it with enough points you will get the golden gun. Which unlike the N64 game (where you can kill the enemy's with one shot).

My happiness died a little after playing it. It's fun...sometimes, it has impresive graphics...usually, and the enemy AI is realistic...every once in awhile. Everyone makes a big deal about the game's 12 missions, an hour into it, I'm on mission 6, and with very good ratings in my finished missions. The problem really is, simply, the length of the missions and their simplicity are far too low.I have not played the multiplayer yet, but it could be fun, it supports the multitap. Interesting mix of 1st person shooter, driving sim, covert missions and a kind of Virtua Cop missions in single player. But the game is soooo short and soooo easy! BEWARE, it's good, but it won't last long and what 1st person shooter ever has much replay value? This one won't have much either.

As the first game on my new PS2 system, I prepared myself to be wowed by 007. And at first I was. The controls aren't as intuitive as Goldeneye, but the incredible graphics made up for that. Unfortunately, my excitement soon decayed into boredom as the inerrant auto-aim took care of all of my enemies. Run into a room, hold down \\"X\\" and you win. There's body armor all over the place so you can't die, and you can get shot a thousand times in the face with an automatic weapon and not even whimper. In other words, this game was no challenge at all.As for the multiplayer... possibly the worst multiplayer of any game ever. Again, the auto-aim lets you kill your friends with thoughtless ease. The only good scenario is one in which you must either protect or kill a VIP. Hours of fun in that one, though.Save your money. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bomb (...)","review":"Agent Under Fire is no joke. This is the real deal boys and girls.

The costumes are stunning. Colors are vibrant and the detail is a feast for the eyes.2. The cinematography is takes you through gritty black+white and transforms into full color - very much like Wizard of Oz when Dorothy opens the door after the twister lands the farmhouse on Oz. The effect is riveting.3. It's a great story - one that you could show to both an adult crowd, date movie, or the whole family. The faint sound you are now hearing is that of Walt Disney turning in his grave.4. The soundtrack is ingrained in our collective lexicon, and the performances, enhanced by the latest technology would make it simply if the projector were turned off.5. The movie's not perfect, but if you have a home theater this disc is not one to be missed. This will really show it off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"We loved this.

Even the phantom must accept that birds of a feather flock together and concede Christine. But the phantom outlives Christine and menaces Raoul by placing a rose on her grave.

Emmy Rossum is very sweet and has a fine voice for one so young and it's a shame she is let down by such a poor leading man.

Excuse me, but I wanted to see a movie and all I have is like putting some cameras in a Broadway theatre to watch the full entire version of the musical.Moreover, what we see in this \\"film\\" are not actors themselves. They are great singers but not actors. Emmy Rossum has the same face expression all along the film: is she scared, delightful, dreaming? I wonder. Another thing is: why the frontier between the ugly and the pretty is so wide? No twist is possible.Music: perfect. Scenario: brilliant. Make-up and custome design: alright. All static matters are superior. But the film is very poor in performance, development and plot. In fact I don't like the original story. It is so simple: to kill for love...Broadway is in your nearest cinema or your video-club. The musical genre has lost its interest.

I expected to be treated to a fabulous musical, much on the scale of 'Chicago' and 'Moulin Rouge.' Instead, I was treated to an ameatur technical filming of a fabulous set.There are plenty of shots where you can actually see the shadow of the camera, and the editing and photography of certain shots left me confused and dissapointed.The actors are too young, too bland for their roles. The music was overbearing and somewhat annoying. The plot seemed to draw out endlessly, the corpses of the actors didn't help. All of these actors are EXCELLENT actors, but their talent has been wasted on this film.Joel Schumacher too is an excellent director, he just seemed to get lost on this one.The sets and costumes are brilliant, I will say that.

Phantom the movie is straight-out fabulous.While a movie by its very nature lacks the immediacy and energy of a stage production, it also allows for nuances that are impossible on stage. \\"Phantom\\" takes advantage of these possibilities. The backstage life of the Opera, the outdoor scenes, the ability to go into tight focus then pull back, are all part of the movie's strengths. If Emmy Rossum and Gerard Butler lack the classic voices of the stage, they more than make up for it in looks. (Especially Gerard Butler. Mmmm.) Film is, after all, a visual medium.The costumes are wonderful, the choreography breathtaking--I love this movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Coul be used as corporal and psychological punishment","review":"To quote the Canadian comedy Red Green, 'The fact that they can't sing distracts people from the fact that they can't act.'Except that was talking about Camelot, which is much more enjoyable.The movie would have been far better if they found more enthusiastic and more skilled actors, like a bunch of fourth graders.Its as if the directors went to the greatest lengths to make sure the characters were their woodenest, they were spectacularly unattractive, and that the scenes were not only undramatic, but that they consisted mostly of standing around, walking in circles, and screaming like drowning cats in heat.The only thing mildly intriguing is the costumes, but if you bought any generic costume book about this story, you can get that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had excellent potential","review":"This movie wasnt a total failure, but was by no means a success. Whether the phantom was a little better looking than he should of been is not my gripe. My gripe is that he was supposed to have the most amazing voice ever. He's the key person that is supposed to out sing every one in the story. But he's the one that sucks. I mean, I know I can sing so I dont open my mouth. Why oh why did they cast this guy. I read a review about there being 11 other people that have played the phantom. Hell, why didnt they just take those voices or something. I mean, he REALLY doesnt do the role justice.

He sounded like he had a horrible cold the entire movie. He couldn't reach the high or low notes and barely held those in between.

The Phantom of the Opera is a quality production, but I simply couldn't finish it. The story line is not complex, but the length of time taken to crawl through it, together with what does not to me comprise very lively and interesting music for the most part (what is largely \\"connecting\\" music, where words are sung in barely melodic snatches merely because the medium is operatic), caused me ultimately to turn it off, satisfied that I had understood the idea well enough and somewhat frantic to end the tedium. Some of the story line and acting insulted the intelligence, with conflicts being prolonged unrealistically and unnecessarily, and that element didn't help, either.

I have been a customer for a very long time, but hesitate to order anything further since they cannot coordinate their shipping with such a simple issue as PO boxes vs. street addresses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Butler Big Mistake, this is a waste of money","review":"The production values and direction for the film are exceptional, unfortunately the miscasting of a musicless miscreate leading man in Butler sinks this film. I purchased this DVD for Christmas for my wife because she loves the musical so much. I have seen sections of the musical on video with Michael Crawford and although not a great singer at least he can do more than shout lyrics. Gerard Butler is absolutely horrendous in this role since it's obvious he can't carry a tune even in a bucket. Geez, they dubbed Minnie Driver, why not dub this catawahling catastrophe? Shouting a song is not singing. Horrid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exquisite!","review":"Soaring music, tense drama, beautiful sets--it's all there! I didn't think that anything could top the experience of the stage production of \\"Phantom\\", but this movie does an amazingly good job of adapting the timeless story to the screen. Emmy Rossum hits all the right notes (no pun intended) as the winsome heroine who is torn between her love of the Angel of Music and Raoul, and Gerard Butler is convincing as the tormented Phantom. Patrick Wilson's role is not nearly as interesting as the other two in the triangle, but his vocals add a welcome dimension to the duets and trios. Minnie Driver is a wonderful Prima Dona and the other supporting roles are played convincingly. The movie captures the magic of the play, especially in the large production numbers and adds an extra dimension afforded by close-ups and adaptability of settings. This movie is highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie for the Price","review":"I bought this DVD and we played it and my teenage girls sat and watched the whole movie without moving. This moving is a good movie and you see a lot of stars from shows you see on TV today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phantastic!!","review":"Being a huge Phantom phan, I could not wait for this movie to come out.

Very pleased with how fast shipment arrived and in perfect condition. \\"Phantom...\\" is one of the best love stories ever - absolutely love the music... we will enjoy this CD for a long time !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good.","review":"Well, this wasn't the first 10 bucks I wasted, and it wont be the last.Just a poorly done movie of a classic operetta. The sets, scenery, and morphing of scene to scene got so annoying, I had to watch in two parts.The only voice that was excellent, was the dubbed in voice of Carlotta. It took me a while to find out who owned that glorious voice.It belonged to Margaret Preece.Listening to her was worth the 10 dollars.Sometimes, you can ruin a masterpiece by trying to outsmart the genius behind the masterpiece.Maybe they decided to put loads of ketchup on top of a filet mignon to cover the weak and poor singing talents cast into this production; trying to cover it with hideous scenery and morphing!Too bad!Thank you,Fred Auerbach"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"I wore out my tape cassette of Phantom back in the 1980s, though I never got to see the actual musical on stage. It's nice to be able to have it on DVD so I can finally see the dialogue and sets while I hear the music. This is a very good production. Emmy Rossum has a beautiful voice and projects the sweetness, innocence and youth that the character should have. The rest of the cast does a fine job as well. Definitely worth the investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"show stopping service","review":"The Phantom of the Opera (Full Screen Edition)I had wornout my last copy of this dvd.

(Guess you could say I enjoy it). Do not buy this looking for a duplication of the live theater. DO buy it for itself! Enjoy it as a stand alone great version of ALW's PTO. I may be able save thousands of dollars in future airfares, hotels & tickets now that I have this DVD. Rich sound and color. The movie seems somehow to be an even more intimate experience than the theater. I think it is the extreme closeups of the emotions on the faces. The young lady playing Christine has perhaps the best voice & delivery of all that I have heard. The Phantom is no Michael Crawford or Colm Wilkerson but again don't compare - just ENJOY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful to look at","review":"I have heard some better singing, but this is an enjoyable film and CD. Probably not going to be a favorite of the straight operatic singer, or the high brow composer, but it appeals to the masses.

When this film came out, I had not bothered to see the stage production, because I generally don't care for productions that are based on books.Anyway, I ADORED this film. I thought it was a wonderful adaptation of the book. The actors, the sets, the costumes, and the music were all very appropriate.After seeing this film, I saw the stage production in a major city (a production that received high acclaim) and was actually disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing compared to the Broadway production.","review":"After all the hype I heard about this movie I finally watched it and was severly disappointed. Some of the music is watered down and the actors leave much to be desired (in singing and acting).If you want a good audio recording of this I recommend the \\"The Phantom of the Opera (Original 1986 London Cast)\\" CD. It leaves out some story but still leaves you satisfied. Also the singers are much better than in the movie. However, if you can't sit still for about an hour and just listen to a CD of this great performance, I guess you'll just have to settle for the poorer performance given in the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing singing -- and not much to make up for this","review":"Two centuries from now, Andrew Lloyd Webber's musicals will be hailed as the natural creative extension of opera verite that reached it's high point with Puccini's works.Although, Phantom was a phenomenal success as a stage musical, this movie version disappoints as much as the ill-fated Attenborough version of \\"A Chorus Line\\". As other reviewers have noted, the principles voices just don't match the excellent original (stage) cast recording (Michael Crawford, Sarah Brightman) and unlike \\"Evita\\" where the movie orchestrations enriched and extended the stage musical, there's nothing new here.If you are living on a desert island, have never seen Phantom on the stage, and you are curious, you might just buy this. But if you've seen the original, you are likely to be quite disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"First Part Was OK, then ...........","review":"The first part of the movie was OK. I had seen the show at the Kennedy Center years before, and loved it. I had the CD for about a year, and played it all the time when I was driving to and from work. And knew all the songs and music. I also bought the music book.I couldn't wait to see the show, and I wasn't disappointed. It was great. I watched it today on a DVD I'd had for a couple years; maybe because tomorrow is Halloween. I was greatly disappointed after the first half hour. Parts of it were like the show and parts of it looked like they were just stuck in. Most of it was pretty bad. I didn't watch it till the end. I prefer to remember the real show. The movie was somebody's interpretation, and his interpretation had little to do with Phantom.I give it 2 stars because some of the vocals were OK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stage show lovers don't buy this dvd.","review":"If you love Phantom from the stage show, you will be very disappointed with the quality of the singing in this movie. If they were going to lip sync anyway, why didn't they hire spectacular singers? The only shining star is Raoul. The rest are weak at best, except the voice over for Carlotta (Minnie Driver plays the character). I love the stage show and the music CD but this is a big disappointment. The costumes and special effects are well done but when the show is all about the music and that part is lacking, the costumes and special effects don't really matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hauntingly beautiful...","review":"If you are a hopeless romantic, and love a love story, this movie is definitely for you.Emmy Rossem is an enchanting and vulnerable Christine, wooed by the sensual, mysterious Phantom (Gerard Butler) while her childhood sweetheart, Raoul (Patrick Wilson), tries desparately to protect her.Don't compare this to the stage performance--just appreciate it for the depth it brings to the characters, and a new way of seeing and hearing the story. Butler's emotional performance will help you understand Christine's dilemma in choosing between her two potential lovers.You will definitely want to watch this beautiful film many, many times."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Amazing Phantom of the Opera","review":"This movie was in one word amazing! The sets are beautiful, the cinematography was excellent and almost everything else was amazing. The only downs were that the costumes were not colorful enough during the masquerade and Emmy Rossum,Patrick Wilson, and Gerad Butler's voices are nothing compared to the original cast in London. If you had not seen this movie or the play see the movie NOW!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Singing!","review":"I loved Phantom when I saw Michael Crawford in the lead role on Broadway. So I popped this disc into my player with reat anticipation. What a letdown! No one in the cast can sing! Avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"AVOID MOVIE AT ALL COSTS!!!","review":"If you love Phantom of the Opera, then do yourself a favor and stay away from this retched movie! Everything is pitch corrected, Gerard Butler is God-awful as the Phantom, the overall singing is bland, and the magic of the musical is nonexistent in this movie! The only reason why I am giving this 2 stars instead of 1 is out of respect for the other outlets that got me familiar with Phantom. Watch the 25th anniversary concert for the appropriate way to view this Phabulous musical. If you haven't seen this already, skip over it and watch the concert version, you'll thank me in an alternate dimension where you regrettably viewed this pile of rubbish."},{"rating":"1","title":"INFERIOR QUALITY","review":"DON'T BUY THIS DVD! The video and audio is inferior and should not be considered \\"Blu-Ray.\\" I am so disappointed, since the sound of this should have been truly spectacular, but I guess you get what you pay for (it's half the price of other Blu-Ray films). Amazon charged me shipping costs to return this junk, so once again, consumers pay the price for believing in their marketing hype. Disappointing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"Nothing short of excellent in acting, singing, choreography and scenery. A true masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I LOVED this rendition of the famed Phantom. Gerard Butler brings sexy to the Phantom.

Some minor differences but the music is still great and the cinematography is beautiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Phamtom of the Opera","review":"A real let down. Insertion of extra scenes to appeal to the movie going crowd really ruined the flow and character of the piece. Especially the jarring action scenes. (Set the Paris opera on fire? Really.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"See the Show - Don't buy the movie","review":"As an avid theatre-goer, I have seen many musicals throughout my life. The first musical I ever saw was \\"Phantom of the Opera\\". So I became enthralled when the movie was to be coming out. However, to my disappointment, the movie is lost in the visual spectacle that isn't even all the great to begin with. Why Lloyd Weber chose Schumacher as the director for this film is beyond my reasoning. Did he see \\"Batman Forever\\"? Honestly, the entire movie lacks the emotional power of the stage production, as well as the talent. The voices are bad, the acting is horrific, and the overall structure is slow moving and robotic. The actors knew nothing about musical performance. This is why I give this movie such a bad rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was B A D","review":"Oh lord was this horrible. The only redeeming feature of this movie was the phantom himself, and that's not to insinuate his acting was by any means extraordinary. There is one part at the end when Raoul just stands there weeping like a woman while the phantom loosely wraps him in some weak excuse for a noose, and he supposedly can't \\"break\\" free. Oh boy was this silly. The only musical rendition of this that could not beat this stupid movie is the one showing in your nine year old's back yard. NOBODY who has seen this on Broadway and has any sense would claim this even remotely compares in quality. If this is the best we can come up with than our society is sorely lacking, my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"A powerful and wonderfully made love story!","review":"This movie captures the awesome theatrical elements seen in-person!

I was highly disappointed with this movie. The vocals were not even remotely comparable and most of acting was just plain bad. This movie, in no way, did justice to the REAL thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Greatly Disappointed","review":"I've seen the Broadway show several times and have owned the original CD for since 1989, I am very familiar with the music and the stunning performances by Michael Crawford. It was a major blunder on Llyod Weber's part to not enlist Michael Crawford as the Phantom.The movie (and the play) is about the Phantom. It is there that the performances should be the strongest, the richest and the most powerful of voice. Sadly this new phantom has none of these traits... your average rock singer (limited talent) could have sung this role better.I have no malice towards Gerard Butler, I'm sure he is a fine actor. But he should never have been cast for this role. Instead of The Phantom standing out it's more of a backdrop. Even it they couldn't cast Michael they should have considered someone who has taken voice or who could sing. Perhaps Butler should have remained a lawyer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark, bad production","review":"I own the standard addition of the same movie and it is a great deal better quality than this wde screen format.

Is so pleasant to hear her sing...that it is impossible you don't fall in love with this movie.There is luxury everyway, the cast in general is excellent...the music is beautiful, when I saw the movie I felt so identified with the story, the passion, the feeling, the beauty of the story that I can say that this is one of my favorites movies ever.I saw it at the movies, then I saw it in HBO, and I ended up buying the DVD because it is a must have. It is soft, delicate, beautiful...a perfect escape of those full of especial effects and violent movies. If you like musicals, you will love this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great job","review":"Phantom has never been my favorite Broadway Show (I liked Jeckyl and Hyde), since I found the repeat of songs and themes in Phantom to get monotonous after awhile...... however...I like this movie adaption better than any of the stage shows I have seen.Newcomer Emmy Bossum is a REAL TALENT.If she can grow up with a level head and avoid the pitfalls of Hollywood, she can be great as she grows up.Her vocal talents were PHENOMENAL.Only criticisms, which are minor..... the film was a bit long and dragged at one point and the casting of the Phantom himself was the weakest casting as his vocal abilities were not up to par to the other performers............. However, all in all an excellent job done bringing this to the screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrendous","review":"I was appalled by the general quality of the film. However, I was more flabbergasted by the ratings given. The jumping scenes are awkward, the acting (especially that of Emmy) is horrendous, and man, the singing, is even worse than being amateurish. Any member from my choir could out-sing Butler or Emmy. I stopped watching after 30 minutes through the film.

But as for Gerard Butler [Phantom]..... whoever cast him should be shot.There are SO MANY actors out there who could pull off the role... why on earth they cast someone who couldn't sing to save their lives, I don't know.as a movie, it's beautiful. but if you have any background in voice or musical theatre, spare yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Phantom of the Opera (2004)","review":"The Phantom of the Opera (2004)I really enjoyed this movie.

I have seen the play and this is an absolute great film based on it. The visuals are stunning and the story is enhanced as only film can bring it to you. For the first time you will get some real backstory of the Phantom. The music is richer thanks to a super sized orchestra and the actors all did a wonderful job singing. Emmy Rossum's voice is beautiful and I liked it more than Brightman's! Gerard Butler is great and does an admirable job singing. He is not a trained singer but he brings an edge to the role. His vocal style is rough and I believe it works for the phantom. A great movie and should please all.NOW MY BLU-RAY THOUGHTS: Beautiful picture and sound. Nothing mind blowing and not a DEMO DISC to show off your Blu Ray power. All the special features are carried over. If you are a big fan than why not picK it up?

He was incredibly powerfull!I was so moved I then brought my parents.The play was even better on the second take.I've recently read the book, and have seen the movie once.The movie is excellent!The play is excellent, also!It's obvious that the movie scipt has more depth than play.I'd recommend that anybody buy this movie, see the play, and read the book.The most talented composers, screenwriters and author of the last century bring to us an unbelievably wonderful work of art.See the movie, go to the play, read the book!Seeing the play on Broadway is like one of 7 greatest things you can do!The Majestic Theater was remodeled in 1985 just for this production."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm a beliver.....","review":"I too had my reservations about anybody else doing the movie rolls of Christine and more importantly the Phantom. But you have to let go of the beatuiful job done by Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford in the broadway production. This vision on the silver screen is one of beatuy, and passion. Andrew Lloyd Webber and Joel Schumacher have done a great job transfering this story to the screen. They have blended the aspects of the original book by(Gaston Leroux) and stage musical by(ALW). My wife and I recently seen the movie and it still had the same impact as the Musical version we seen in Jacksonville, FL when Brad Little played the Phantom. Even though we've never seen Michael Crawford's performance and probably never will, it still was a great show.In closing I would like to say to the skeptics your missing a wonderful show and to those who are willing to give this movie a chance. Sit back and enjoy \\"The Music of the Night\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Other reviews have been so detailed that I can add nothing other than the fact that this movie IS fabulous.My main fear was that watching the movie would ruin my memory of seeing it on Broadway in NYC (one of the highlights of my life!) Instead I am now kicking myself for not having seen it in the theatre.Michael Crawford has an amazing voice as the Phantom on Broadway but the actor who performs it in the movie does a great job (although NO competition for Michael Crawford who is amazing) STILL it is very good....This is NOT a normal movie though with talking. That is what I expected. It is the next best thing to seeing it on Broadway. Outstanding. I've already seen it 3 times and my daughters love it too. FABULOUS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Movie Ever!","review":"I have seen a lot of movies (and plays), and I must say this is now my favorite movie. Not only is beautifully done, but the acting is great. I love the characters. I was priveleged to see a rendition of \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" (the play) last year in LA, and it turned out to be my favorite play! And as soon as I heard about the movie last year before it came out, I was so excited to see what the film would be like. I finally saw it last night. Throughout the whole movie, the audience was so quiet, you could seriously hear a pin drop! Which is very unusual. The cinematography was wonderful. As was the screenplay. Emmy Rossum shines as Christine. Beautiful voice, let me tell you! Hard to believe she's only eighteen! I STRONGLY RECOMMEND seeing this movie!

Or if you are cynical, somewhat of a purist when it comes to movie adaptations, you will have great cause to laugh and poke fun. The movie is visually decedent in many aspects, but the singing? First of all, the phantom's modern rock star voice doesnt help the fact that he cant carry notes worth a damn. And emily whats her name who plays Christine cannot hit high soprano without wavering and pinching her voice in a cringe-worthy performance. But yes, her skimpy nightgown and sexual suggestiveness when the phantom takes her down to his lair is hilariously ridiculous. Plus the eyelid fluttering during \\"point of no return\\"- subtlety is not an issue here. The first star was for some of the costumes and visual effects: the second? Because this film is more fun to make fun of than any of the films ever featured on Mystery Science Theater 3000"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mute button operational?","review":"Visually beautiful, but exercise your mute button finger in preparation for the Phantom's songs.

The entire film is mesmerizing from beginning to end. The cast could not be better. I am not going to pick it apart, build it up or tear it down. It caught me from the get go and the characters work together, the mood is excellent, the emotional ride is good. It's a great movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of The Best!!!","review":"The story of the Phantom of the Opera is of a disfigured man who haunts the catacombs of the Paris Opera House and falls in love with a young chorus girl named Christine. She herself falls in love with a childhood friend, Raoul, while at the same time becomes entranced with the phantom. The phantom is played by Gerald Butler who ,in my opinion, portrays the angst of the phantom perfectly and brings out the sexual appeal that the phantom holds. There wasn't a part in the movie that I didn't love and I am looking forward to seeing this production on stage!"},{"rating":"2","title":"SURPRISINGLY GOOD!","review":"I've never been a huge fan of movie musicals, so I didn't expect too much from \\"The Phantom of the Opera.\\" But, to my surprise, it was actually quite good! The awesome sets, haunting cinematography, fantastic visual effects, and great performances help to elevate it above the sometimes-mediocre songs. Gerard Butler (\\"Dracula 2000\\") made a great Phantom, and Patrick Wilson (\\"The Alamo\\") was good as Raoule, but Emmy Rossum (\\"The Day After Tomorrow\\") gave the film's best performance!

No more to this phantastic classic /full screen/ version of The Phantom of the Opera. Enjoy it one and once again because it is a treasure and a heritage for the humankind. The story, the music and the film are beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb, sublime, inspiring","review":"I didn't think it could be done-the magic of Phantom captured on film. Schumacher pulls it off. The overture rings deep in your soul and causes your spine to tingle. The Phantom of The Opera song causes your imagination to soar higher than the Himalayas. Gerard Butler as the Phantom brings a deep, guttural soul to the angst driven character. Emmy Rossum has the angelic, mystical quality to take Christine straight to your heart.Schumacher's sequencing between past and present with the switch to grainy black and white gives the movie a vital quality which captures the faded glory of the era and the opera house.Not a lot that more that can be said-it is a movie and a musical that must be experienced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't say the stage play was better!","review":"I have loved this musical since I was 7 years old. Since then I have seen the live show twice in L.A. and when I first heard there was going to be a movie I was thrilled! And when I saw this movie was NOT disapointed! I fell completely in love with it! So many say the stage play was better, but I feel you cannot compare the two of them. You can love both the movie and the live show for many different reason. The movie has so much to offer that couldn't be done in the live production! Both me and my best friend agree that while we love the stage show, the movie was totally awesome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best movie in the world","review":"Phantom of the Opera is definitely the best movie i have seen in my entire life. i am not a fan of musicals, but POTO captivated me and now i am a fanatic. i have read the book and the movie is definitly better. many have said that Gerard Butler's voice is too deep for the part of the phantom. but i ask, have you every found a man with high pitched voice to be sexy? a deep voice is the essence of appealing. a man with a deep voice is more coaxing and sensual than a man that sounds like a girl. i am not putting down any other actors that have played the Phantom because i have not heard them and i'm sure they played the role with talent. but a man that is supposed to captivate a woman sensually should have a voice that coaxes. Gerard Butler was amazing! me and my friend love \\"the look\\" he makes in the tunnel scene when the phantom is taking Christine down to his lair for the first time. Gerard Butler did an amazing job and truly made the phantom come to life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like watching Fabio in a 1 hour \\"I can't believe it's not butter\\" commercial","review":"The images are stunning. The costumes are devine. The cast is beautiful. The music is haunting. I can't believe I used up my \\"promise to see one chick flick with you\\" that my husband gave me on this. How could something with so many lovely parts be so wrong? I loved the Broadway production. I own the book. But this film which I waited for with baited breath was so....... blah. Okay. If the cover on a romance novel could come to life it would be this movie. Seriously. And at the end when they pull off Eric's mask... the dude is handsome. My husband leaned over and whispered, \\"Oh, no! I've got a zit! I'm hidious! Don't look at me!\\" And the ending (which they had to change so people who read the book and saw the play would have something new to see) is depressing. For all of it's breathtakingly beautiful parts, the whole is a Frankenstein."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Phantom of the Opera (Gerard Butler)","review":"Good movie.

It is awsome in the theatre, but also very good on the small screen. The music seems to \\"stick in your head\\". The voices couldn't be better and Gerard Butler is mesmorizing in his part. Even if you have seen the play, you must see the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"it's all in your mind","review":"this movie is such a visually gorgeous film. the sets and the colors are so vivid and bright. everything in the film keeps the action going. the music is tredendous, the story is well-known by all. i have to admit this film does drag at times (probably because i'm not much into musicals) but this film is amazing nonetheless. the gothic-romance horror of \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\" serves to populate the ages, being remade better and better each time. i have to admit, it was an odd version of \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" song being played, i mean, it sounded all sythentsized and electronic compared with the rest of the music in the film. i think if they did it the original way it was, minus the synthesized drums and electric guitar, it would have added a more dark and grim appeal. not that this version is bad, it's just weird. Emmy Rossum...yummy, but also an elegant christine vocally. the phantom is awesome too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark Side of Love","review":"This highly popular musical comes alive in the movie version, with the added dimension special effects provide. The singing, especially by the lead female vocalist, is wonderful, and the music captivating. No wonder this musical has set records for longevity in New York.The phantom is well played, even if his voice does weaken occasionally. However, his unrequited love tugs at the viewer's heart strings, and his plight gathers sympathy.This is a visual and musical treat, and a cinematic pleasure to view. The last scene is particularly touching and evocative of a romance that is unending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very different.... but good for what it is...","review":"I have always been a very devoted Phantom fan, so when i heard there was to be a movie i was concerned hollywood would ruin such a wonderful piece. when i first saw the movie i was foolish enough to try and compare to the original cast (which i was fortunate enough to see twice) but now that i have watched a few more times i have come to accept that they are very different, not necessarily making the movie bad. I am quite glad they did not completely change the story (like hitchhikers guide to the galaxy for example).... for those of us who need a release between theater seats this will be good to have in the collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!!!!!!!","review":"I will make it short and simple, it is an absolutely amazing production and movie. Gerald Butler does an amazing job as the Phantom. I recommend it to anyone and hope everyone gets to see the new movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shockingly Acceptable","review":"YES, I'VE SEEN THE MOVIE!!!Let me say, I'm the harshest Phantom critic I know. I've read the book, seen the musical many times, and had a hard time listening to Phantoms who weren't Michael Crawford. I was in despair over the movie...I mean, who IS Gerard Butler??? But I have to admit, I was pleasantly shocked. I don't cringe listening to Butler sing \\"Music of the Night,\\" and I've definitely cringed at other Phantoms. His Phantom made me feel for him throughout the whole movie. And, while the movie isn't the musical exactly, it's good enough that I don't feel like it's \\"cliff notes\\" (like I do for Harry Potter movies). Emmy is fine as Christine. Some details get a little fuzzy, but I don't think true fans of the musical will hate it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece of art","review":"A masterpiece of art. Outstanding musical work and outstanding blu-ray picture quality. Great casts. An excellent collection for anyone who loves musical movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely breathtaking","review":"I have never seen the Phantom of the Opera anywhere at all, have never read the book. But I have heard of the wonderful music of this production, and couldn't wait to watch it on the big screen. I wasn't disappointed at all, unlike some of the reviewers here - I think it's because I approached this movie with fresh eyes. Emmy Rossum's voice was clear and beautiful, and apart from a few errors that my chorus teacher would cringe at the movie was spectacular. I could feel the characters' emotions (even though I didn't like Christine's indecisiveness). The movie drew me in with its story and its gorgeous sets and costumes. I felt that Butler played the Phantom very well, dark and sensual. You should watch this movie and then watch the play; if the play really is better than the movie then it'll probably spoil it for you. The movie itself is wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Spectacular Vision with a Soundtrack to Match!","review":"The Phantom of The Opera is a beautifully done interpretation of the play. The character choice (Gerard Butler as the mysterious Opera Ghost and Emmy Rossum as the amazing beautifully Christine) and scene setup of the Opera take audiences away to a place where the play could only begin to touch. The musical scores redone and played by an amazing orchestra and set a haunting tone in this masterpiece.

Who sits through these ear shattering, glass breaking musicals anyway? (stuck up conservatives? Elderly people? Or geeky girls who get engulfed in romance novels?)When the girls voice wasn't pounding into my skull like a jack hammer, the movie was just boring. I had to stop it, I couldn't take no more. My level of insanity went up after watching this"},{"rating":"1","title":"Should never had been made.","review":"I hated this movie from the terrible beginning to the just as terrible end. There was only one good song throughout the entire thing. There was a love story, but this girl kissed the Phantom, then got with this guy, then kissed the Phantom again. This movie should never had been made. It was a total waste of time. I only wish they had a zero option for stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Phantom of the Opera","review":"This had to be the worst movie I've ever seen.

Loved the music wish i can see it on broadway. Emmy Rossum did great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing.","review":"If you are obsessed with the play and soundtrack, don't see this movie. Joel Schumacher's direction was terrible. Girard Butler, as the Phantom, is completely miscast. Minnie Driver, as Carlotta, saves the play. She is actually quite good. I had the feeling that she did not listen to the director at all and did her own thing, which worked well. Emmy Rossum is acceptable as Christine. The supporting cast is also decent. The script has several minor and major differences from the play. Those obsessed with the play and soundtrack will find even the minor changes annoying. Then again, the changes would have been acceptable if the acting and singing had been better; especially that of the Phantom who makes you cringe when he speaks or sings. Why did Andrew Lloyd Webber allow this movie to happen? whhyyy? whhyyy?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Problem","review":"This movie had a lot of potential. I did not even mind the changes in the movie from the stage production. BUT, any one with any singing experience knows that it is IMPOSSIBLE to sings these songs without opening your mouth! The leads are all running around singing intense songs with their mouths open a crack. I could not enjoy this movie at all because I knew they were lip syncing. If something like this bothers you, I would avoid this movie. The acting definitely falls flat."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Phantom of the Opera","review":"I still have not received my DVD and it was placed 5 weeks ago. I am very dissatisfied and will never buy through this dealer again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Movie","review":"The Phantom of the Opera was better than I could ever of hoped for. Other reviews have given the movie low ratings because Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford weren't in the movie. But if they had never heard Sarah or Michael they would have given this movie at least 5 stars. Gerard Butler as the phantom was the best choice they could have made for the phantom because unlike Michael he is young and handsome where michael was not. His voice simply blew me away. Emmy gave Christine an innocince that strengthened the movie a ton. If you haven't seen this movie go see it. I give it 20 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I've loved the Phantom forever and have watched this movie in the past.

It is so great! I love the music, I love the plot, I love the actors, I love the music, and did I menchen the Music?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brava! Brava! Bravisima!","review":"Director Joel Schumacher and producer Andrew Lloyd Webber are truly angels of music. This film boasts not only a wonderful re-orchestrated soundtrack with a new song and some new music, but a very talented ensamble of performers. While devoted fans maybe disappointed by the re-casting of Christine and the Phantom (originally played by Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford) Emmy Rossum and Gerard Butler have a chemistry that captivate the viewer. Emmy Rossum brings a touch of innocense and naiveness to Christine, while Gerard Butler's rock n roll edged voice gives the phantom his \\"power\\" to \\"control\\".The love triangle between Christine, Raoul and the Phantom is the mesmorizing main storyline; however, the smaller storyline of the new owners of the opera populaire proves to be a humorous sideline. With the climax making some viewers wonder what will just happen next, some viewers may want to keep the tissues nearby for the ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've read the book and","review":"this is clearly based more on the musical (which I've never seen) then the book, but a wonderful movie nonetheless. I enjoyed the music (especially the phantom's voice) so much I went out and bought the sound track. Also the acting is wonderful, the costumes are great, and the opera house is so beautiful you could watch the movie just to see it.I LOVE Erik MORE THAN YOU!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sublime","review":"As a die hard fan of the stage show (5 times), I eagerly awaited this movie and was not disappointed, despite a few minor quibbles:(1) The \\"through the mirror\\" scene, one of the first spine-tingling moments in the show, was done terribly.(2) Parts of the some of the songs were cut.(3) The crashing of the chandelier was moved to the ending.(4) I'm not sure I liked some of the little bits added in here and there.But overall, a WONDERFUL film, undeserving of the bashing it tooks from critics. Emmy Rossum is luminous and lovely as Christine, Patrick Wilson is a perfect Raoul, and Gerard Butler sizzles as the Phantom. Minnie Driver and Natasha Richardson also excel in their supporting roles. THe sets, costumes, and cinematography are also terrific, and much like the stage version, the ending will break your heart and send chills down your spine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollywood destroyed another musical","review":"I am very disappointed in this production. None of them could even sing except for Minnie Driver and SHE WAS DUBBED!!!!!!!!!! They probably should have dubbed everyone else. Patrick Wilson was just okay. His voice was a plain and vanilla sounding tone. Emmy Rossum had such a small voice that if she actually performed the role on stage without any cuts she would blow her voice out after the first performance. She has no vocal technique whatsoever. I think Gerard Butler is a great actor but he should never sing again. His voice sounded very strained and unpleasant to listen to. If you want to see a high quality production, I highly recommend the 25th anniversary DVD from Royal Albert Hall."},{"rating":"1","title":"great film but no feeling","review":"I seen the orginal cast on broadway and then seen it a few years later, when i saw the movie on dvd. It was great but had no real feeling of the story, When i saw it on broadway, i felt for christine, the phantoms torment. don't get me wrong the actors, the production was great, but the story is a love story and should have some emotion to it. i am preferenced to the musical"},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie to watch with your daughters","review":"Okay, I have seen the broadway production of this play and it was good. But, if you want to have something in your DVD drawer to watch with your daughters every few months, this is one to have. The singing is excellent for a movie and you will be singing the songs for two weeks after because they stick in your head. My girls play act for days afterwards . One will sing the Phantom's songs and the other will sing Kristy's. It is so fun to listen to them. But, the point is, if you are a father and you want to share something with your daughters that is memorable and fun, buy this and watch it with them. Yes, there are a couple of parts where the Phantom gets excited, mean, a little seductive, but it is a good movie made from an old story. So, if you want them to remember watching a movie with their father at night in the fall with popcorn and hot apple cider, this is a winner. They will never forget it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phantom of the Opera Is Marvelous!","review":"Strangely enough, I missed seeing this movie when it was released to the theaters. Now, having discovered it, I'm a complete fan! Gerard Butler is fantastic as the Phantom; his masculinity, the power of his vocals, the physicality of his performance are all part and parcel of a perfectly realized roll. Emmy Rossum is lovely, with a vocal range that is very pleasing.I purchased the single disc first and then went back to find the two-disc set. I have about worn out both in the short time that I have had the videos.I thank profusely the director, Joel Schumacher, and the creator of the music/producer of the film, Andrew Lloyd Webber."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fall in love all over again","review":"If you try, repeat, TRY, you MAY be able to spot a flaw or two in this movie. But why would you try? From the opening scenes to the final credits, one is swept up in the awesome beauty of this film. Just wait for the rendition of \\"All I Ask of You\\" on the roof of L'Opéra Populaire in the midst of a gentle snowfall. The fact that such a work of art will be sitting in my collection by mid-May (for $20.97!) will only make the rest of February, March and April seem that much longer! The Broadway to Hollywood transformation has never been made so successfully. Treat yourself to this fine film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great and Amazing","review":"I have seen the stage play and it was amazing. So when I heard about this movie I got very excited. I couldn't wait for it to come out. I finally went and saw it. And I thought it was amazing. The sets were bright with color and looked like the sets from the play. Even though the actors in the film aren't very well know they were also good. Alot of people didn't like Gerald Butler as the Phantom, but I thought he was a great phantom. I loved the Masquerade scene. I almost like it better than the play. Everything is dazziling, well filmed, and full of eye candy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"I might be a kid ,but I am classically trained. I have competed in many competitions and made high scores. My point is that I can tell a good singer from a bad singer. Emmy Rossum is perfect for this part. Her voice is not squeaky . It is clear and she has good tone. Same with Gerard Butler. He is a beautiful singer. I fell in love with his voice as soon as I saw it.

My order arrived in good condition and in a timely manner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dreamlike","review":"When I picked this movie up, I expected it to be like the broadway play. It was almost as good. Though you don't get the full experience of music and movement as if you went to see it live, this was a wonderful adaptation to watch when you're in the mood. It's also much cheaper than paying for the tickets!The movie was luxurious in color and detail, the cast did a fairly well job of singing and acting. The whole movie was like watching a dream and was hypnotic at times such as \\"The Music of the Night.\\" Though not a perfect movie, this was an enjoyable one to watch. There seemed to be symbolism portrayed as well in the mirrors, the masks people wear and the rose in bloom.I only wish that Michael Crawford could have played the Phantom. The one who they cast in this movie didn't seem as smooth or as polished in singing. But in the end, he garnered enough sympathy that I wished Christine could have stayed with him as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Young woman's perspective","review":"I too have seen the play twice in both Toronto and Detroit. The play is wonderful, why else would people see it twice? Now, like anything else, the book is ALWAYS the best version of the story. However, this is a great movie, I love it. If you haven't seen the play, you'll LOVE the movie...and if you have seen the play, you will still love the movie. It is a beautiful story, with beautiful music and beautiful actors who capture compassion, tragedy, romance and desperation all in one film. I also think it is noteworthy that there are parts from the book in the movie that were not in the play. This shows that the writers took consideration in making this film, which is rare, and a welcome addition. Oh, and as for the few poor reviews of this film, someone who truly appreciates this story would never refer to this film as \\"PofO.\\" Everyone can have an opinion, but this is a film that has earned its high rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Phantom of the Opera","review":"I have seen the \\"Phantom Of the Opera\\" twice on stage. I love the music, but found that the stage productions were missing something. I couldn't figure out what it was until I saw the movie. Gerald Butler was fantastic as the Phantom and Emma Rossum had the most incredible voice I have ever heard. The two character's meshed perfectly and the sexual tension between them was unbelieveable. At times I felt like an intruder. Hooray to Joel Schumacher for directing this movie so perfectly. The first time I saw the Phantom I slept through the first act and my husband slept through the second. This movie gets it's right. You won't want to miss a minute of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWSOME MOVIES, CANT STOP WATCHING IT OVER AND OVER","review":"I never liked opera, but this movie is outstanding, special effects are awsome and the music even more awsome.

Scenery, props, costuming... wonderful.I wish I had never seen it!!!The magic and mystery is killed as soon as the Phantom's mask is pulled of the first time, and it never recovers. I cried with a broken heart after seeing the movie. I am so in love with this play, but I cannot believe that the director chose youth over the neccesary maturity needed for the roles. Emmy has a beautiful voice... she's just not old enough for the part. Raoul is far too young. It's a joke. The Phantom needs to SING! Gerald Butler... he's not good enough.I pray that I can forget the trapdoors shown in the movie, and return myself to the magic world in the stage show. I feel like a child told that there is no Santa.I'm buying the DVD for one reason... the opening sequence, which I will watch over and over again. I'll turn it off after that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Snazzy movie, but a lot was wrong","review":"I loved the movie. It was a great movie.

I laughed when I saw it, I mean, did they really not have the ability to make it look ugly?4.Gerald Butler has no talent. He can't sing, and the only time the part fit was when he was mad. His songs made me cry when I realized how bad the auditions must have been to cast him.5. Is it just me or does his hair change from blonde to black in some scenes?6.

Schumacker said that he did not want to focus on the glamour and the grandiose and instead make sure to capture the love story. He failed miserably. The movie is nothing but glitz and bad music.First of all, the love story is conspicuously absent from the musical... it does not happen at any point that I noticed, though it is often spoken of. The images in this movie adaptation were certainly stunning, but made little dramatic sense. The music in no way enhanced the plot or characters. It looked like Sir Andrew and Schumacker just wanted to show off how much money they have.It was a truly awful movie adaptation of a truly awful musical. If you want the romance of the Phantom story, go for Maury Yeston's version. That one has its heart where it belongs, not in its wallet."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful","review":"The new movie is awful, I was SO disapointed.The movie is nothing like the Broaway.I have seen it, and I thought it was just a waste of time.If you love the Broadway \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" You probably don\`t want to see the movie.

EMMY ROSSUM HAD THE VOICE OF A BEAUTIFUL LARK, SOUFLUL AND BEAUTIFUL AND HER EYES SAID SO MUCH MORE THAN THE SCRIPT WAS TO CONVEY. I WAS WANTING TO SEE MORE OF HER AND BUTLER TOGETHER. TRULY A BEAUTIFUL LOVE STORY.A MOVIE NOT TO BE MISSED FOR THOSE WHO LOVE THE MUSIC OF ANDREW LLOYD WEBBER.

The choice of taking Gerard Butler to play the Phantom was absolutely perfect, his bearing, his manliness, his age and certainly his voice. Emmy Rossum was a perfect choice for the role of Christine, sweet, innocent and very beautiful, no wonder that a man who always was so lonely would want her! Who ever was responsible for choosing these two movie stars, did a perfect job.They could not have chosen anyone better than Gerard and Emmy. I enjoyed this movie so much that I play it over and over again.The music itself, the lyrics, the way this opera was sang, has overwelmed me so much, that I find it hard to describe in words what kind of effect it has had on me. But in short it is one of the best opera ever made, and how can this ever be topped?"},{"rating":"1","title":"It just didn't work for me","review":"I still remember with a sense of awe seeing \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" in London in 1992. I'll never forget the way the Phantom appeared through the mirror to Christine and the brilliant staging of their descent into a labyrinth under the opera house.But I really found this movie impossible to watch. The leads are all pretty or handsome and the staging is lavish. But it just didn't ring true. I felt that it was so very obvious that the actors and actresses weren't really singing in the moments I was watching them but were just being dubbed.This surprises me because I did like and watch the movie \\"Chicago\\" despite having seen and loved the musical. Maybe it's because the movie version had some serious star power while \\"Phantom\\" has a bunch of unknowns.In the end, I suppose \\"to each his or her own,\\" but I can't help but think the movie is a pale and most inadequate copy of the musical."},{"rating":"1","title":"phanton of the opera","review":"Chicago transferred to the movies as GREAT, WOW, SENSATIONAL. this Broadway show, what happened.outside of the actress who played christine is beautiful but only fairly talented and the rest of this mish mash of what the hell is it... altho stunning photographed. it is boring beyond belief. To take two songs and make a show I don't think so"},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic soundtrack","review":"I happened to catch this movie one month on HBO and fell in love with the soundtrack. I kept finding myself singing the songs all of the time to the point that I went in search of the movie and the soundtrack. I had my oldest niece over one evening and she asked if she could borrow the movie. She watched it with several of her girlfriends and they too fell in love with everything about the movie. Needless to say, my niece recieved her own movie and soundtrack for Christmas this past year from me. She was absolutely overjoyed!!!! Hope that everyone else sees the beauty in this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"HIGHLY RECOMMENDED","review":"Great movie. Starts in flashback and introduces you to the life of the opera house. Makes your heart bump. I really loved it. Emmy Rossum and Gerard Butler made an excellent job interpreting the Phantom and Christine. The music is great, and EVERYTHING is just really really gooooooooooooooddddd."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you hate musicals you will still like this one.","review":"My friend who lives and breaths Gangsta Rap and hates everything else really liked this movie. Why, because it so well done, and because the music is incredible. One thing for sure is that the sound and music or top notch. It is so immersive. The story will make you sad even if you are tough guy. This was one of those movies that did not get enough credit. This is high quality stuff, and it is BARELY PG-13, so don't worry about gore or anything. Rent it, buy it or see it at the theatre. Just see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadley a fake!","review":"The blu ray disc arrived on time and in great condition. Much to my surprise, the disc seemed to be in a case that was too thin and seemd to be over all a fake. This was only confirmed when I played the disc and no menu came up.. No options available. Stay away from purchasing this! I'm happy that Amazon refunded me and advised me to throw it out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Movie for Andrew Lloyd Webber Fans, Including Me. It Scares Me More Than Anything. I Don't Even Find it Interesting.","review":"To me, this has got to be the most disgusting remake of a musical I have ever seen. I cannot believe that the crew wanted to turn one of Webber's musicals into a travesty like this! I thought it was scary and completely insane the first time I saw it. It was a long time ago. But, the characters were violent and really offensive.My mother seems to LOVE it, and that is too bad. Becaus it is strictly VERBOTON in my eyes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beutifully done!","review":"I have a theatre and singing background, and I have many theatre friends who, basically, \\"snub\\" Andrew Lloyd Weber and his music. Okay, the guy does, shall we say, \\"borrow\\" many bits of music from some of the great composers - you can hear many Verdi and Puccini bits in any of his shows. But give the man his due - the music does set a mood, is memorable, and a joy to listen to. This is very true to the setting of the new movie. It is beautifully done - costume/sets/etc., visually very impressive, and something worth savoring on a DVD to watch again and again. My only real negative comment is that the gentleman chosen as the Phantom did not live up to my expectations. He simply was too \\"pretty\\" for the part, should have been older, and needed a more compelling voice. Having heard Michael Crawford in the original stage role, this Phantom's voice was too rough and uninspiring. I thing the other roles were cast very well, and sung equally committed. I recommend the experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect movie","review":"It's a great adaptation of the brodway show, I like it so much, It's one of my favorites musicals.I love how Gerard Buttler, show us a very nise phantom,It's a very good movie ,but don't have the same impact than chicago at the Oscars but steel a great movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite!","review":"I've seen the Broadway productions of Phantom of the Opera several times, and was so excited when the movie came out. Seeing it close up brings things to life and gave me a new perspective, especially \\"The Point of No Return,\\" oh MY! Now I can see this wonderful production whenever I want. Love the music, the sets, the costumes, the whole thing! One of my favorites!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy","review":"I enjoyed this movie the second time as much as I enjoyed it when I watched it at the theatres. The best part is that it arrived to my address quicker than the expected delivery date. I think I will have this company on my top 5 list of companies to purchase from."},{"rating":"1","title":"Choose better singers","review":"I love the music and the storyline in Phantom. However, as spectacular as the sets were, Gerard Butler absolutely ruined this for me. I was cringing listening to him sing. I would have thought that Mr Webber would have made a much better choice and scrutinized the vocal performances more than he obviously did. Is Gerard an actuall trained singer or not?If you watch this with the sound off (there goes the beautiful music), at least you'll still have a beautiful visual. What a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overall Disappointing","review":"Where do I begin? The stage design, costumes, lighting, etc. are fabulous. Gerard Butler as the Phantom is miscast or misdirected, even though I think he gave it his all. He is too handsome and not nearly ugly enough under the mask, and he smiles too much. The Phantom doesn't smile! He needed to be weirder, more sinister, and frightening, with a little perversity thrown in, yet still sexy. My main complaint is the last, and most important scene of the movie - it is all wrong, and I blame the director. The Phantom cries like a wimp, and the kiss scene between him and Christine is terrible. If you are a fan of the play/musical, as I am,than of course you must see the movie, however,it had such potential to be really fabulous with just a few changes, but was such a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful sets, terrible singing","review":"I was very disappointed in the girl that played Christine, her voice was so weak and breathy. Anyone with good vocal training, I suggest plugging your ears when Christine sings. I have to say though, the sets and costumes are very well done, it's worth to go and see it just for that. But, voacaly in this movie, don't expect much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly disappointed","review":"Highly disappointed in this adaption of the great story. I had expected something great. There was so much potential and it all fell flat, especially the two main leads, Gerard Butler and Emmy Rossum."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!!","review":"Me and my daughter have watched this so many times throughout the years. It never gets old!!! Noted my daughter is only 15 and this is one of her favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazed","review":"I was really surprised by this movie. Actors I don't particularly like did a fantastic job, music was great; overall the movie took me back to watching this very show in London. I would highly recommend this movie to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVED IT!","review":"Guys, this isnt the stage version, watch it with an open heart. I do a lot of casting in theatre and I thought the casting for this movie was ideal. My particular favorites were the Phantom, Raoul and La Carlotta. Minnie Driver is stupendous as a diva, Gerry Butler is incredible and undeniably sensual and Raoul is just so sweet you can see how Christine was torn between the two. Give it a shot guys, its definetely worth it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesnt work.","review":"The DVD doesnt work in any player ive tried. Very displeased. Why would I want to buy something I can't watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"spookykid certainly scared me!","review":"The product came late, and it was defective. Unable to play it on my DVD, I tried it on the computer, where it did fine. If the problem is my DVD player, it would stand to reason that other DVDs would not play in it. This was not the case. However, I am willing to give the seller the benefit of the doubt on this--and I am beginning to actually prefer VHS to DVD--VHS is more likely to be error-free, and DVD--even brand-new--is getting to be a roll of the dice. What bugged me most, though, was the non-response from the seller when I asked for suggestions. I did not ask for my money back, only for suggestions, but no response whatsoever. Again, I'll give the benefit of the doubt, and assume the seller didn't receive my email. But, whatever--you may be sure I will order no products from SpookyKid in future. Thanks for the opportunity to express my opinion. Normally, my Amazon sellers are A-plus."},{"rating":"1","title":"No refund for a returned DVD","review":"This product was incompatible with my equipment. When I called Amazon for help I was told that the DVD should play in my equipment and was probably a bad DVD (I had purchased two. One for myself and one as a gift.)Amazon replaced the product with exactly the same product. In my next phone call to Amazon, after I had returned the 2 replacement DVD's, I was told tough luck...no help. Even though one DVD was returned unopened I was given no refund...my order was considered to be the order that replaced my original order. Seems I'm out over $40.00 but Amazon is out of one pretty loyal customer who has a fairly good order record over the past years.

I thought it was one of the most puffed-up campily crazy and ridiculous things I have seen in a long time. I cannot remember being so bored and so offended wondering what these people all think they are doing traipsing about and shouting at each other while grimacing in all kinds of strange ways.For me this was one of those 'fooling most of the people most of the time' experiences that I can only recommend totally avoiding."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE SUBTITLES IN SPANISH ARE INSULTS","review":"I have seen the play in New York and the movies is just as perfect and even more than the play the voices are awesome but the subtitles in spanish are INSULTS not only for me that thank God I'm billingual, but for Mr Andrew Lloyd.The subtitles are poetic, sound good but are not related at all with the play in english, i know a piece like this is hard to turn into spanish making it sound as beautiful as in the original language but that is something that MUST be respect.The person who translated the play should write his own musical in spanish call Triangle or something but NEVER The Phantom of the Opera.I would sell it! It might sound crazy but I am not letting the play take a new idea!!!SHAME ON YOU MR TRANSLATOR, and in the company for allowing that Crime"},{"rating":"2","title":"AND I SAW THE MOVIE AND IT WAS GOOD","review":"The movie was very nice, very touching... I want to buy this DVD but I still have to wait a while for it to come out. I think that the cast brought the movie alive, especially the scenery. But the only thing that confuses people is why the old lady in the beggining is younger than old Raoul. Well, she is not Madame Giry, but Madame Giry's daughter Meg! I can't believe lots of people started to hate the movie just because of that one mess-up that isn't a mess-up after all!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravisima","review":"Though at times a bit more explanation would have clarified things, the beauty of the music and story overwhelmed technicalities like that. Only a truly hard heart would not find pity inside for Erik, and for Christine. If only pain had not maddened him, Raoul would never have had a chance to love her; but don't take me wrong, often times Raoul is portrayed as a wimp, a second choice. The man here is not any of that. It is a lovely story, if sad- but it's the kind of sadness that makes your soul grow larger and better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Disappointing film ... the cinematography was wonderful, the costumes were fantastic. Emmy is beautiful and a wonderful actress, but she's NOT an opera singer. Patrick is pretty to look at; too bad he can't act or sing. Gerard was perfect I think; great actor, just the right 'edge' to his voice to be convincing. The new orchestrations are lush and just right. I was most impressed with Miranda and Minnie, and quickly got over the fact that Minnie's voice was dubbed for the singing; she's a marvelous comedic actress and has been overlooked for far too long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only wish i got the 2-disk set!","review":"I didnt see the play or know anything about this movie.Then my mom rented this and i loved it we went and bought it.I only wish it was the 2- disk set.The movie is amazing i love it ,the songs, acting and eveything else about it. Whatch it its good!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't like musicals","review":"I really don't like musicals, so I'm still wondering why I got this DVD (other than the poor selection of movies and the video store). I watched this movie with a hair trigger finger on the stop button, but I made it through and I'm glad I did. The movie has many hooks, the music and a diverse plot will keep you interested, and almost fascinated that you are enjoying a musical. The \\"Andrew Lloyd Webber\\" music will seem drab at first, but once you get the hooks, it's like a 80's song that can't get out of your head. The cinematography is beautiful, it's like watching a weird nightmare on your television, black and white, color, both, I can't stand it any more, this movie is really freaking me out. Stick with it, there will be times that your attention will wonder, but in the end the movie delivers both a treat for the eye and ear that you will not soon forget."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phantastic Work","review":"This movie is a must see for all Phantom fans. Have seen the stage show twice in London and this movie is a true to form representation of the beautiful stage production. The movie changes a few of the lyrics and some lines that are sung on stage are merely spoken in the film. All of the music is intact while some flashback scenes have been added to explain more of the story that isn't included on stage. 5 out of 5 stars and WILL be purchasing the DVD once released. Very impressive!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Phantom of the Opera dvd","review":"This movie is great to teach about musicals and opera.

Plus, they are learning about the genre while watching and listening. Great teaching tool!"},{"rating":"2","title":"All-Time favorite.","review":"I purchased this DVD after wearing out my last copy of this movie-musical. I consider it one of the best musicals made into a movie. The cast is fantastic(they can SING!), and the scenes are breathtaking. A great rendition of the classic musical."},{"rating":"2","title":"The return of the Phantom","review":"I was pleased to see that Webber, an experienced musicial playwright was making his hit musicial, Phantom of the Opera, into a movie. I studied the Phantom of the Opera a couple years back. I read a play, saw a cartoon, and watched the silent movie and musicial from the 70's. It was really interesting.The time that the movie came to my town, I was so excited. It was getting close to my birthday and I was so ecstatic to go see the movie, as I was promised. On my birthday, turns out, the movie wasn't playing anymore. So, I never got to see it until now. I am proud to say that it is a great movie, but the musicial is better, I have heard.I give this 4 stars. Why not 5 you ask? Because the book is always better! The book, written by Gaston Leroux, is a great buy. I suggest you check the book out if you like this, or anything connected to Phantom."},{"rating":"2","title":"See the movie, buy the DVD","review":"The movie is wonderful.

After seeing this on here i felt compelled to comment.This show....WOW just not good. The special effects used literally look like they are out of a 1970's cheap film. The plot of this show was boring and the last 5 minutes of the series has got to be the WORST SEASON FINALE EVER. Made no since at all, was stupid and felt like they just thought it up before shooting the scene, didn't answer any questions, and was just laughably terrible.

The wind lifted the tonneau cover from the center, between the latches and on the hinge and was able to overcome one of the latches.

What else can you make of the police siren laden homage to Ol' Dirty Bastard on \\"ODB on the Run\\"? Even with Mr. Four Tet, Kieran Hebden, on production duties, the first half of _Sunrise Sunset_ doesn't quite gel. Individual moments have their spark, like the sparse funk of \\"Hippy Dream\\" or the dreamy twang of \\"Sweet Fanny Adams,\\" but they don't necessarily add up to coherence. \\"What You Goin' On About\\" integrates the rhythm and merges with the the bluegrass guitar better. When The Underdog takes over the production duties, the tracks become much more clean, but this can sometimes be a downside: the silliness of \\"Buzz\\" becomes that much more apparent. The langourous slide of \\"Down the Track\\" carries some country-western sadness, and the simple cello of \\"Blue Star\\" holds the weight of the world, but as a whole, though, _Sunrise Sunset_ seems too in love with its own eclecticism to make a strong musical statement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Read","review":"As a resident of Western North Carolina and a former teacher, I can identify with these characters.

You get a sensor base and a plastic sword. The sensor picks up all your movements in real time. You slash vertical, horizontal, and diagonal all in real time. As you progress you get special moves that are executed by several sword swipes in succession. The game picks up your movements in real time which is pretty impressive. There is a ton of strategy here as you have slash, block, and counter attack. The varied enemies all have different attack patterns, strengths and weaknesses. There are some really cool boss encounters as well. My only gripe is the graphics arent so hot. I grew up on the atari 2600 so this isnt an issue for me but for some, it might be.

Trick 4: This is the most important Trick of all, When Lurtz shoots arrows at you, Hit them back DO NOT block them. Also look for patterns in his arrows.

Don't try to buy additional chairs, in case you have friends, because these people assume you don't have any friends and don't need extras. A very nice young man tried to explain to me just now that this is the way they order them, or maybe the way the shipper sends or offers them. And he likened it to buying something from Home Depot and then going back to ask for additional chairs. Perhaps they wouldn't be able to sell them.Here's where we have a Throwdown, a la Bobby Flay. C'mon, Amazon, do a little bit better. Order and stock some chairs! Let's suppose UPS broke a chair on the way to me....what then? Could they produce one? Or would they take the whole thing back?

The 'bad guy' in it wasn't much more obnoxious than anyone else in the story. They are all whiny and needy without exception. The ending petered out without tying much of anything up.

Every other song on the album is as good as the two singles you hear on alternative radio. One of the best tracks on the cd is \\"Collapse\\", the verse has a brilliant Radiohead-like melody but a heavier guitar punch comes along in the chorus. Awesome track! Other amazing tracks include Sans Cosm, Cataract, Red Alibi, Assemble the Empire, etc... Pretty much all of them kick \\"butt\\". This cd sets a mood very easily! Listening to this cd is almost like a \\"high\\". Eventhough plenty of shouting is heard throughout the cd, it is very relaxing! Perfect mix, thanks to Jerry Finn.

But these guys are the lame parts. There are a couple of good songs on here, but you can always hear them on the MTV. If you like lame want to be punk rock like \\"Blink 182\\" then you will probably be lame enough to like this too.

The song sports some of the strongest lyrics of the album, and a great chorus and bridge. \\"Echodyne Harmonic\\" is my personal favorite song. The piano melody is just beautiful.The reason I gave this 4 stars (I would give it 4.5 stars if possible) is because I feel that Jerry Finn didn't do the greatest job at capturing the rawness and intesity of Sparta. I prefer the \\"Austere\\" versions of \\"Mye\\" and \\"Cataract\\" better, but I liked the newly recorded versions of \\"Air\\" and \\"Collapse.The cd is at a special low price at stores, and even if you haven't heard anything by Sparta, give them a chance.

Jim, Paul, and Tony (along with new bassist, Matt Miller) all return in fine form on this debut album. Three of the songs from their EP, Austere, appear on Wiretap Scars. Although I do prefer the original versions of Mye and Cataract, the new versions aren't much different and are in no way overproduced. The finest track on the album in my opinion is Collapse. It's atmospheric and calm, but it still has the loud shouty chorus. In fact, I prefer the quieter moments on Wiretap Scars. The music these guys create can be beautiful at times, highly recommended listening with headphones.It's a very nice debut and a sign of good things to come from them. Hopefully they get a bit more experimental on their next release, but until then enjoy Wiretap Scars."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good debut.","review":"I have to say that I like pretty much all types of music (well, except maybe country, don't care for it much), and this is a very good debut from Sparta. I like how they have taken the the raw energy of ATDI (check out In Casino Out, it is steller) and refined it. There are very melodic instrumental parts followed by teeth-grinding aggression even on the same song. Given a few more albums, these guys might have what it takes to create a classic album. Also check out fellow their fellow ATDIers in Mars Volta. The Mars Volta ep is very experimetal and might not be for everyone, but it is very good aswell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sparta review by Conor Kuzdas, Maximum Ink music magazine","review":"Former At The Drive In members Jim Ward, Paul Hinojos and Tony Hajjar get another chance at success with their new band Sparta. Although the sound is undeniably similar to At The Drive In with three fifths of the original El Paso lineup, the tone is more relaxed. As with their prior band, the songs are emo-core creations that open with energy and heavy distortion without the crunch of metal or the wining of emo. In the end, as with At The Drive In, the sound self-destructs into discord. Tighter drum work, fresh vocals and greater melodic complexity mean, however, that despite the similarities it's still an original product. Much of the raw energy of At The Drive In still remains and is displayed in a more finely polished product. Wiretap Scars proves that life after At The Drive In is possible.

At the Drive-In was innovative and had tons of energy packed into their music. Unfortunately, Sparta has neither. The guitar work is bland, and the singing sounds like a very sub-par copy of Cedric. After listening to this it's easy to see who were the main creative forces in At the Drive-In: Cedric and Omar. That being said, if you liked ATDI, then you'd probably enjoy the Mars Volta a lot more than this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Andyman90","review":"Andyman90, before you write a review you should really decide whether or not you have a clue what you're talking about. Sparta is a good band and this is a good Cd, although at the drive-in was far more advanced musically and original. And to say mars volta is the worst of the 3 is just plain ignorant. Mars volta just released what is possibly one of the most complex, original, innovative, musically amazing, while importantly still being very listenable Cd's of all time. Sparta is not even in the same ballpark as the mars volta. Think about what you write next time before you submit it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not that good","review":"I really dont understand why so many people like this album. I agree with everyone that Sparta doesn't sound like ATDI and the Mars Volta likewise. But I don't know, this CD was just very dissappointing, the lyrics weren't very artistic/creative/good, the vocals (stink), the guitars arn't even that imaginative (they're just lame, cheesy). The main thing that tees me off on this album is that it seems like it tries too hard to sound like most of the popular stuff thats playing on alternative/mainstream radio (im not really a fan of the mainstream stuff in music). The CD has some decent songs like \\"Cut your ribbon,\\"Mye,\\" and \\"Echodyne Harmonic,\\" but thats pretty much it (keep in mind theyre not great songs, but decent ones). Anyways i recommend the Mars Volta's Tremulant EP instead of this (thing). When the Mars Volta's De-Loused in the Comatorium comes out on June 24th, this Wiretap Scars LP will soon be forgotten."},{"rating":"1","title":"Middling","review":"When listening to this CD and the Mars Volta's De-Loused In The Comatorium, it's very easy to see where all the talent in ATDI ended up. And it's not in Sparta. This album is the very definition of safe, derivative and mediocre. Sparta can't decide what they are and at various times try to come off like an extension of ATDI, emo-core screamers a la Thrice, or, when I saw them at Coachella, clumsy political satirists. The best way for me to describe Sparta is through this analogy: If ATDI is Coca Cola Classic, then Sparta is Pepsi One and The Mars Volta is Jolt Cola."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst CD I Own","review":"This is by far the most boring album I own...If the opening track \\"Cut Your Ribbon\\" is the heaviest they can get then there is no impressing me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very descent album","review":"Most people like such as myself got to know this band well and also in live form while on the Pearl Jam riot act tour in the summer of 2003, and while on the tour most either loved them or hated them it seemed. Well it seems like the same go's for this album I feel. Some very good songs start to gorw on you with this album such as \\"Collapse\\" and \\"Light Burns Clear\\" and \\"Assemble the Empire\\" to name a few hits. The only really thing which seems to be keeping this band from stardom which they are trying to achive is being consistant, some songs on the album do not even sound like the rest, and are dull and lame. If the band forms this consistant sound with a completely talented album there will be no stopping them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album, but not At the drive-in","review":"Everyone who knew ATDI makes judgements on the Mars Volta and Sparta, saying one is better than the other. I think both bands are great and there is no reason to choose one being better than the other. This a very good album on its own merit. THIS BAND IS NOT ATDI, and NEITHER IS THE MARS VOLTA. If you want to hear ATDI, my advice is listen to ATDI."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like ATDI Without the Punch","review":"I was super disappointed to see the At the Drive In broke up, especially because I had tickets to see them in concert two weeks later. So when I saw that Sparta rose from the ashes, I was eager to hear what would materialize.Again, disappointment. This band sounds like ATDI if you take out all the piss and vinegar that made them rock so hard to begin with. The raw energy and intensity is gone here, and what is left is music that sounds uninspired and dry. There are a few good tracks here, but for the most part the album is just lacking punch. The version of \\"Mye\\" here I had originally heard on the Austere EP, and I liked it a bunch. But on this album the chorus is changed, and again, it lacks feeling after the change.Mars Volta, Sparta, neither one is At The Drive In quality, and it's sad because I really miss that band a ton."},{"rating":"1","title":"MISERABLE AND TRAUMATIC (SPOILERS)","review":"**SPOILERS** This book was suggested as a \\"must-read\\" to me, and so I borrowed it (I'll admit, without much of an open mind). The plot itself wasn't terrible- it is sci-fi, after all, you have to suspend some sense of reality. However, the story is extremely slow, and it felt even slower due to the horrible character development. I was ready for the idiots to die much more quickly than they did (Ugh, the names Anne and George still make me nauseous). When you blessedly arrive at the last stretch of the book, the story spirals into a sordid, disgusting account of what the priest endured on Rakhat (he was raped, repeatedly, and forced to live with other assorted species that were subject to the same treatment). It's just truly nauseating- \\"haunting\\" would be a good description if perhaps any other segment of the story had redeemed the ending, so I'm going to just go with \\"traumatizing\\". Please do not waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont waste your time","review":"I found this book to be very dissapointing. The whole premise of the story is preposterous, many of the characters are highly annoying, and the ending is weird and disgusting. The first 100 or so pages are OK, but after that the story goes off the deep end and really bogs down, and it's hard making it all the way to the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"anti male crap","review":"What a lot of rubbish ...the first hero is aged gay male...the second hero is sexualy assaualted on a far planet..the third hereo is a nudist/guru...What ... no transexuals.....lesbians...gender unspecifics!!Come on Ms authoress make your characters normal and bin the anti male themes..They tell me Brad Pitt is considering filming this junk.Hey Brad... wake up...I am as mad a hell about this rubbish book.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jesuits in Space...","review":"This is a solid first novel for Russell. Although at times the characterizations bottom out, the novel is at its best when Russell's earthlings ask the big questions in life. I'm anxious to read the sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining reading","review":"Not exactly sci-fi. Certainly not theology. A study of ethics and lessons of history? A little bit of all of these. Characterizations are a strong point of the novel and the alien culture is nicely imagined. Writing style uneven--mostly it pleases, but there are passages where you'll swear that Russell turned her word processor over to a three-year-old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculously over-hyped disappointment","review":"I began this book expecting to really like it, based primarily on the largely glowing reviews I'd read and heard. I found the premise of the story to be pretty fascinating, and I still do - I just wish it had been told by a more skillful writer. The characters in this book are so two-dimensional and simplistically depicted that they almost come across like puppets or stick figures. To me they all came across as caricatures and \\"types\\", and I was completely unable to identify or empathize with any of them. The plot is ok, but the absence of flesh and blood characters was too much for me to overcome. I just felt that the writing was not very good, certainly not up to the level of most good fiction being published today.To be fair, though, my wife absolutely loved this book. So you can imagine how annoyed she is with me at the moment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"At the beginning I enjoyed this book. The Sparrow is a Jesuit Sci-Fi novel and this combination is interesting. The nosedive begins when the characters easily manage to secure a live-a-board astroid (Jesuit financed) and then travel to a planet light years away. At this point, Russell asks us to believe Fate brought these friends together for this mission. This is a difficult state to reach with her heavy handed writing style. Still, I stuck with The Sparrow hoping its contrived elements were leading up to some profound religious or moral idea. Unfortunately, the ending crumbled away. I found myself reading a 21st Century author's version of the story of Lot. A version long on the misery, and very brief on the implications."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't miss it..............","review":"I loved this book....couldnd't put it down; not only was it a great story, but the philosophical ideas imparted gave the book great depth. I didn't want it to end and ws so excited to find out there was a sequel. The sequel is not disappointing either. Very good, albeit distuburing ideas like the first one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating premise, unforgettable characters","review":"It took me a while to get into this book because of the large number of foreign names and the dual storylines, but once I came to know the characters whose lives were changed by the discovery of a sentient radio transmission from Alpha Centauri, I absolutely couldn't put it down. I was absorbed by premise of this story of First Contact and the inadvertent mistakes even the well-meaning make, perhaps inevitably. But it was the humanity of the brave band of travelers that truly drew me in and held me.Highly recommended for those who enjoy intelligent science fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious, unenlightening","review":"Others have detailed far better than I what is wrong with this book, from the unoriginal idea to the unending exposition of pseudo-scientific data. I'll just say I found it tedious and uninteresting. The frequent hints of dreadful events to be revealed later became more and more annoying, as they coyly tried to keep the reader's interest up. I finally skipped ahead to the dreadful events just so I could be done with the book--to find more stereotyped plot. I'm glad I got it from the library, rather than shelling out money for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful read for anyone!","review":"This book is so unique! When recommending it to friends and asked what it's about, after several attempts to convey how it's NOT a science fiction book, even thought it involves space travel, I finally came up with this: It's the story of one man's struggle in his search for God. Loved it, though I'm neither a regular reader of science fiction nor religious writing. Uncategorizable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Sparrow by Mary Doria Russell","review":"This was one of the best books I've read. Even if you've never wondered about life on another planet, you can appreciate this brilliant, believable, compelling novel. It was thought provoking long after finishing it. I'm hoping for a sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"On the level of Left Hand of Darkness","review":"This book deals with the complex issue of what would happen if the missionary period were to reoccur. It could, on another planet, and it would be with modern people in a modern context. Mary Doria Russell poses that problem, and does not give it a Hollywood ending. Her characters are believable and likeable. She draws from a vast store of knowledge and interest in the missionary period of the Jesuit order, in astronomy, and in many other areas. Her sense of history adds as wonderful a dimension as Ursula Le Guin's sense of anthropology does to her writings. It is a book that will develop an ever expanding following."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful book, excellent writing, and thought provoking","review":"What an amazing book! I had never read any of Mary Doria Russell's books before and after reading The Sparrow that definitely changed. The overall plot of this story, the characters, the beautiful language, and the way that the story is set up is something that I haven't seen in a book in a long time. The images and the places described were stark and impacting. Nothing was sugarcoated. Russell is without a doubt a gifted writer.If you are a person who enjoys books that challenge your way of thinking, a sci-fi lover, and if you're just looking for an amazing book to read this is definitely it. You will fall in love with the characters, share in their triumphs and downfalls, and you will completely be engrossed in the plot. Definitely worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit grating","review":"I'm really interested in how it goes; I like the high concept. But about 1/7th in I don't think I can stand to read it any more. There's a lot of poorly written attempted purple prose that is exhausting to try to read and I don't trust that it actually -means- anything. It's not like reading Virginia Woolf or something. It's like reading a fanfic. The ideas are a lot of fun, there's some good quotes, but getting through each page is hard. I don't appreciate the \\"20 minutes with jerks\\" opening either.While I like the idea of and wanted to read it, I do not enjoy the experience of reading it. It should have been more rigorously edited.I'm at this moment strongly considering tossing it, though if I do press on and wind up liking it, I'll revise this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Science Fiction Ethnography","review":"This book reads like a ethnograph. Considering the author is a trained anthropologist, this isn't surprising. The story is definitely character run. If you dislike reading about the ethics, philsophy and problems of the meeting of different cultures, you will dislike this book. Very little 'hard' science is involved although the author seems to have a adequate grasp of basic physics. The meeting of the two alien cultures has very interesting and the main character's search for the meaning of God was enlightening. A very worthy read that was a bit weak on overall plot hence 4 rather than 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"An unforgettable storyline !","review":"This is beautifully written book which has left me both spiritually uplifted and profoundly disturbed at the same time. It reveals that concepts such as good and evil are merely a matter of interpretation, and supposedly inhumane acts can be seen as humane in the context of other another set of alien belief systems. Russell's detailed construction of each of the principal characters outlining their fears and hopes, makes other novelists' attempts at character-building look positively shallow. Sci-fi techno-babble is refreshingly kept to a minimum, and I liked Russell's technique of employing a 'flash-back' approach, alternating the storyline between the present and the past. A very enjoyable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nerdy anthropologist tries her hand at novel writing","review":"This was one of the most unappealing and just plain boring books I've read in a while. Toward the end I was rushing to just finish it so that I missed what happened to Jimmy and Sofia and then realized that I didn't even care. The characters were so one-dimensional and predictable that I couldn't muster any feeling for them whatsoever. And the trite, pedantic nature of her prose was completely unappealing. I'm sure Ms. Russell is a highly intelligent woman. She should use her intelligence in science, not creative writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spare me the Sparrow","review":"This was a selection of the book club I attend, would never have read it otherwise, science fiction mixed with gruesome murders and superstition. Though the Biblical connections, (viz the title alone) are abundantly clear, murder, sado-masochism, cruelty and maiming out weigh what apparently was meant to be a spiritual effort-- if Christian spirituality and science fiction coincide comfortably for a reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't even finish it","review":"I bought this book to read for a book club, and I just couldn't finish it. Lord knows I tried. I'm not a science fiction fan, really, and I couldn't get my head around what I saw to be the basic premise of the book--to colonize outer space as the Jesuits had done to the Americas. Several people in my book group really liked it, but for my taste, it was not very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow, Slow and wordy.","review":"A very slow read, with very little payoff if you fight your way to the end. Less Science Fiction than a character study of a group of people and their inter-personal relations (particularly the Jesuit priest), and for all the wordieness, the charachters are not that intresting. The flashback style drove me crazy, because it didn't seem to serve any usefule purpose. Billed as illuminating the conflict of man and religion, but even that is vague and wishy washy. Mary, take a stand, and tell us more about the planet, the trip, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardly worth the time or praise","review":"I found this novel to be increadbly poor in all aspects of the novel. Never once was a charater intresting, never once was the story compelling. Morals never seemed to work their way into the story. The Ideals of the novels are strangley familar Almost similar to question Ingmar Bergman posed in his films at thrity years earlier( See winter Light) Hardly intresting. Mary Doria Russel l is No Russell Banks or any kind of writer at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book unless you like throwing money away","review":"This book was slow (1/4 backstory), disjointed, confusing and, in short, one of the worst books I've ever read. There was absolutely NO character development so we couldn't get to know any of the people at all. The result, for me, at least, was that I despised everyone in the book and found them very unbelievable.There were many opportunities for Russell to develop her main character, yet she failed to do so, time and time again--I believe she doesn't know how. My advice to readers--don't buy. To Russell--learn to write before attempting to do so."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE INVISIBLE BOOK -- Zero stars","review":"It's an attempt at an after the fact- look back- type of tale. The only problem is........................................ THERE IS NO TALE to look back at!I kept reading & hoping but it never materialized.

I am a lover of good science-fiction (and contrary to popular belief, there are SOME good sci-fi works) -- \\"The Sparrow\\" was far more than sci-fi. The spiritual quest of Emilio Sandoz and his feelings of abandonment resurrected my own doubts of the Christian God. This book has awakened a need in me to search out my own true religious beliefs and make peace with my own soul. Who knew science fiction could do such a thing?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this book!","review":"You may find \\"The Sparrow\\" (and its sequel, \\"Children of God\\") inspiring and thought-provoking. It may drive you completely nuts. But you won't be sorry you read it. If you love SF but are fed up with the cookie-cutter novels clogging the shelves, or if you think you don't particularly like science fiction, this book is for you.And, thanks to one scene, you will never look at duct tape the same way again."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting read with a abrupt ending","review":"This book was a journey through many emotions, from sheer enlightenment and joy, to true disgust and sorrow. And it kept me interested throughout. My only problem with the story was the abrupt end. We are learning about the Rakhat mission, but we are also reading about the Jesuit priests who are discovering what happened. After the priests hear about the entire trip I would have liked to learn a little bit more of how it affected their lives and beliefs. Also, how it affected their feelings toward Sandoz and towards sending humans to other planets. An interesting thought is if any of the Jesuits would feel a sense of responsibility for the tragedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Original plot, but room for improvement in the delivery.","review":"In The Sparrow, Ms. Doria Russel presents the reader with an intriguing and original plot concerning discovery, the interplay between secular and non-secular relationships, and religion in general. The reader will find, however, that the story leaves numerous mysteries unanswered until the very end, which requires patience. On the downside, character development is a bit uneven and the author often resorts to simply summarizing significant events rather than purposefully weaving them into the story itself. Overall, I was pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Science fiction for the non-science fiction fan","review":"As someone who usually avoids science fiction because the characters are often one-dimensional characatures, I was thoroughly impressed by this book. The story unfolds in a very interesting way, and the world that the author creates is intriguing; however, it is the charaters that make the book worth reading. Russell is incredibly skilled at establishing relationships and evoking our sympathy for the charaters through as little as a few lines of brilliant, witty dialogue. Rarely have I found fictional characters so genuine and likeable, and never have I read dialogue that made me laugh out loud so consistently. Her sequel, Children of God, is slightly less impressive in this way, but offers a more gripping plot. A trade off, but both are worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dialogue does not fulfill the description of Sandoz.","review":"Author's prose is weak, integrating lame jokelines with stale plot. She puts in something for everybody and shows no critical selection. The characters are truly stereotypes with no originality. Even the horrors that occur are old and chewed-over. The author sets the reader up with expectations that fizzle with the outcome. The reader hears a lot about who Sandoz is, but never sees him fulfill this characterization in his own dialogue. Although I kept reading it, I now conclude the author would write better non-fiction as she cannot create believable characters or follow though with a strong plot line. More rewrites before publishing might have helped. It seemed to be a rush-job because they DO (as another reviewer pointed out) want to MAKE MONEY ON THE MOVIE which I, for one, will not go to see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great disappointment","review":"A wonderful page-turner with a cheap, maudlin ending. I was expecting a diabolically creative plot-twist to explain the protagonist's deep, dark secret. Instead, I find a common plot-device used in the trashiest pulp-SF.This author--with all her intellectual accolades--should have known better. Some could even interpret her ending as homophobic. I just thought it was stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Sparrow","review":"I got this book at the airport and was intriqued by the introduction and storyline. More than 75% of the book builds to some \\"event\\" which made for suspensful reading. I enjoyed the writing style but I found the end so ridiculous AND distasteful that I felt ripped off for spending my time reading something with such a ludicrous ending. I was surprised that the reviews were so good. I'm an average person leaning on the liberal side of life...so nothing really shocks me; but in this book it seemed superfluous. Perhaps a better title for Sparrow would be \\"Swallow\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"not well written","review":"This book is not very good. The first 100 pages plod along. It's supposed to take place in the future, but the language and references are all 1990s and sooner. The author tries too hard to show how intelligent she is. The peppering of Spanish, often without translation, is annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"interesting and boring","review":"The Sparrow is the story of a Jesuit expedition to Rakhat. The part about the actual journey and events is interesting, informed and well written. Another part of the book is about the linguist of the expedition, Emilio, who experiences a moral and religious crisis. This is boring. Emilio, morals and religion are of little consequence to the mission. With another linguist, other morals and another religion the expedition would no doubt have ended it disaster too.The real mistakes are for example the absence of guards and a political advisor on the mission. without political advice the members of the expedition manoeuvre themselves in a weak and dependent position, and become easy prey.So if you don't buy in to the writers analysis you are in for a lot of page skipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hugely Disappointing!","review":"I read this book when it first came out because and I was intrigued by the storyline. However, I was disappointed by the two-dimensional characters, the macabre twists and it's lack of heart. I feel the author went for sensationalism instead of content. I am shocked that so many people liked The Sparrow!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Disappointment","review":"I hate when you can tell by the text whether a book is written by a man or a woman. This book has such pathetic \\"girly\\" writing - especially in the references she makes to today's society. Clearly, there is too much effort, and not enough result."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Free SF Reader","review":"A bad book by a mundane religiously focused writer trying to be a science fiction writer, and failing, in general. Obvious, tedious, and worse than mediocre. This sort of thing has been handled many times before to considerably better effect. The religious preaching is so overt it causes you to grit your teeth and groan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous","review":"I was expecting to read something like \\"Contact\\" by Carl Sagan. The story was always implausible, but by the midpoint of the book it because so foolish that it was pointless to continue. Forget NASA, if we make contact with aliens, lets send the Jesuits!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very weak","review":"The idea behind the story is a good one - a religious expedition to another planet to visit an alien culture, etc. However, the writing style, plot and character development are so amateurish that whatever interest might have been generated by the story line is quickly lost.

That's what I was taught as a child and what many people seem to have forgotten. Mary Doria Russell remembered. She also remembered that a priest is a man; human, frail, sinful, and searching for God - just like the rest of us. This is a story of discovery, love, pain, and enlightenment. It is also an exceptionally well written science fiction novel. The characters are well formed and the premise is plausible. The plot is carefully ordered and exquisitely detailed. I've never cried over a book before, but this ending brought me to tears. Don't bother skipping to the end. It doesn't make sense out of context."},{"rating":"1","title":"Generally Lacking","review":"I started this book based on a friend's recommendation and was quite prepared to like it. However, I was rather disappointed by the many loopholes in the plot, not to mention the weak science and a cast of generally idiotic, intolerable, or two-dimensional characters. Although there were flashes of wisdom in the book, it was overshadowed by the author's own judgemental attitudes towards some of the characters. While I found Emilio's struggle to come to terms with his personal tragedy as well as the questions he raises to be profound, by the end of the book, I sensed that because of the author's love for this character, she has bedeviled or antagonized the others to the point that they become rather simplistic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating to read","review":"When I finished this book, I put it down and my thought was \\"what the hell was that?\\" The author takes the reader to a variety of time periods in a non-linear manner and gives a number of scenes where the foreshadowing is heavy-handed but leads to nothing but more fore-shadowing. She draws out her story line painstakingly slowly, and at the resolution there is no feeling of resolution for this reader. I read this book because my book group chose it, otherwise I would never have touched it as futuristic fiction is of no interest to me. I would not recommend it to anyone, and in fact I cannot even categorize it as to what kind of fiction it is. The author seems to be working out her own belief system and religious orientation at the reader's expense. I wish her well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unusual Space heme","review":"This book is not for the lineal thinker. The author found some value in shifting back and forth between decades, but I found it confusing and frustrating. The characters are varied and interesting, the plot astonishing, and on the whole the text is well written. There are occasional sparks of clever or even brilliant insight. Point of view moves from one character to another, leaving the reader somewhat adrift. There was enough techno-talk to support the premise of space travel for the average reader. If this is a serious book (and it is), the adolescent aspect of language and smirking over sex could be toned down to advantage. I'm not quite a fan, but the book will remain in memory for a long time. Much to think about."},{"rating":"1","title":"I regret ever starting it","review":"The Sparrow has an interesting plot idea and excellent character development, however I regret ever starting this book. While the beginning is intriguing and does get you hooked, the book for the most part is too long and dull. I almost gave up on it but decided to keep reading to find out what happened to the characters. So I struggled for weeks to get through the dull part, only to find that the end was all of a sudden very hurried and incredibly disappointing. A big let-down on such an intriguing beginning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh, don't bother.","review":"This is an easy ready but not a worthwhile one. It satisfies in that it doesn't waste time building up to the real action and the meeting of the aliens etc. But the price of the speed to gratification is a total abandonment of reality. Basically a mission is organized to another planet but it's not clear how they got the money to do it and they put a totally inept C-team on the crew, the rag-tag bunch who discovered the alien message. In the end, it could have been a nice book but it feels like it was written very quickly and paid little attention to the science or practicalities of accomplishing the plot. Don't get me wrong, I'm not asking for the engineer's version, just wish I could have bought into it enough to take it seriously. And the characters aren't that good either in case you like that in your science fiction--I ended up not caring about any of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Curiosity page turner.","review":"I found that I needed to find out what caused the deformed hands and what caused the lead character to be so destroyed. This kept me reading the book. The plot of Jesuits traveling the universe was almost an obstacle but the descriptions and imagination for the newly found planet kept me reading. The characters are well developed.I started it for a book club group that is interested in why bad things happen in our life experience. I don't think this question was answered by the book. The only thing evident was that things are as they are and current life karma does not equal the current life experiences for most of us. Bad things happen and there is no equals sign to balance the good things we do and the bad things that happen to us.If you start this book you will want to find out what happens at the end but it won't give you a clear, easy, or well developed answer if you are looking for one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, but only that","review":"The author has had a good idead, but barely little else. The writing is sloppy, the storyline is implausible and the characters are completely shallow. At the beginning, all problems are magically solved, as if the author hadn't enough imagination to deal with them. Then an expedition of unprepared, old people is sent to make contact with extraterrestrials. An then the aliens raping humans? Come on. I haven't seen any profound philosophical or trascendental questions, at least not more than the ones found in most good science fiction books. The science fiction frame is completely wrong - this should have been a plain fiction book, with the action taking place on Earth on some distant island, rather than trying to dress it like SF. It would have been much more credible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jesuits uninterested in spirituality?","review":"The question which I was left with at the end of this book was this: why did the Jesuit priests fail to inquire into the spiritual life of the aliens? Yet the main character continued to believe that spirituality existed on the strength of the beauty of the songs of the Singer. Of course, if they had so inquired they would have found the aliens to be devoid of spirituality which might have raised some red flags and ruined the author's tale. In the end, I was disappointed in this contrived plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Most Intense Sci-Fi Novel I Have Ever Experienced","review":"This novel asked the age-old question from the book of Job: \\"How can one have faith in God in the face of horror and suffering?\\" and combines it with an intriguing and disturbing exploration of several powerful themes: missions, the pursuit of God's will, and an introduction to an alien culture that is all at once compelling and revolting. It was a thoroughly discomfiting novel that left me in tears by its end; it is masterfully written and tense and gripping, and I have only praise for its author. It is science fiction at its best: a vehicle for focusing on what it is to be human, in all of its glories and hellishness. It will challenge your view of God, unflinching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Difficult but thought provoking read","review":"The author's prosaic writing style did not immediately engage me and I almost put the book down two-thirds of the way through. I'm glad I stuck with it - although it turns out to be a harrowing story with no easy answers. The author has tackled the subjects of faith, suffering, cultural clashes, love and betrayal. She has done it remarkably well for a first time novelist. The story will stay with me for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rare novel where I actually CARED","review":"I'm tired of \\"Literature\\" about the superficialities of Western civilisation. I'm heartily sick of Fantasy obeying no observed anthropological truths. And I'm well hacked off with most New Age check-your-brain-at-the-door 'mystical' twaddle. I am, however, fascinated by the new discoveries of real science - Leakey, Dawkins et al. So I approach SF with a certain cynicism. And I loved 'Sparrow' pretty well unreservedly. These characters were the people I wish I could find as friends, people who dismiss sentimentality in favour of a genuine love, and understand a relationship with god to require that we use minds as well as hearts. A marvellous, enriching book with no answers but some very meaty questions. Particularly appealing to those like me with a pretty low opinion of H.Sapiens in general.

At no point in it, nor at the end, did I feel dismissive: \\"oh this is a first novel, she lost control of the material at the end.\\" Only a materialist secularist reader could sneer at a jesuit priest who has a crisis of faith in a trying time. No religious person would. Faith can be hard. The Lord gave us the faculty of Reason so that we might understand his ways at the deepest possible level. Reason alone however can (and does) lead us astray. Ms. Russell captures this beautifully.For those unchurched who read this book with an open mind, will come to understand the religious better. The religious who read this will be impressed with the comprehensiveness of Ms. Russell's understanding of the Roman Catholic church (especially considering that she is a person of the Jewish faith.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too slow in the beginning and never speeds up...","review":"Sharing one of the reviewr's opinions below, I'm writing this review to pull down the average rate of the book. The synopsis and reviews sounded very promising, and I hoped to read some clever SF that I'm missing so much. The book definetely has its potential, but it starts slowly, painfully slowly.. tantalising the reader ... constant leaps to the past seemed often irrelevant. The characters are plain and dry with funny French last names. When they died, I felt no sympathy. Mr. Sandoz was the only one who evoked pity in me with his misery and because those other Jesuits were plaguing him constantly, but as the enigma of what happened to him was dangled in front of me for too long, when he told his awful story in the last chapters of the book, it never had the effect the author probably has planned it would do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Haunting and horrifying","review":"My reaction to this book was much the same as \\"Reader's.\\" The book is beautifully written, and the author crafted characters about whom a reader can truly care. I was mesmerized by a tale so wonderfully and deeply original, and I could not put the book down. But as the story progressed toward its ending, it changed into something sinister -- filled with shocking images and events. A bright promise and a fantastic read turned into a tale of unimaginable savagery. It was as though two different authors had written the story. Like \\"Reader, \\"I could not wait to physically separate myself from this book.

The author tries to prove that even priests are regular guys, and employs \`dirty' language in their mouths to prove her point. The characters are unreal. The only interesting chapter is the final one and, perhaps the next to final chapter. I recommend that if you're over 14 and curious, check the book out of the library, skim the last two chapters, and use the money saved to read Ray Bradbury. The book was so bad that I ended up feeling sorry for the author. The rating form doesn't seem to allow for a rating lower than one star. I rate it no stars, and hope the author gets a better editor next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good service from seller","review":"I can't rate the book itself because I bought it for someone else. I can say that the book arrived in a timely manner in the condition it was presented."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I give it zero stars?","review":"I am a long time Science Fiction reader who loves\\" literary\\" SF most of all and am always fascinated by religious and philosophical questions. Someone I love a great deal suggested I would love this book and from the various descriptions it sounded as if I, indeed, would. I hated it. I don't know when a novel has annoyed me more. I despised the characters and was hoping that they would die a lot more quickly than they did. These subjects have been explored so often and so much better by so many people. This is just a terrible terrible book. Stay away. If you want good thoughtful books about religion in a science fiction setting read Le Guin or read Robert Charles Wilson's Mysterium or heck, read Carl Sagan's Contact for that matter. Or read that wonderful James Blish story which apparently influenced this book. Don't bother with this overwrought nonsense. I am astounded that this won a Tiptree award. I doubt she would have approved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Book","review":"If you like quality SF written by the likes of Gene Wolfe, Vernor Vinge, Stephen Donaldson, John Varley, C.J. Cherryh and the like, you will hate this book. The plot is a con job with an anticlimax that will leave you asking for your money back. The characters are nothing more than different names with the same voice (presumably the author's). The science is so laughable as to be distracting. Most importantly, the philosophical/religious exploration is pure sophistry. OTOH, if you are 12 years old you might really enjoy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great debut novel, profound wonderful and disturbing","review":"Mary Doria Russell did some outstanding work in this debut novel. The Sparrow is a sci-fi fans dream, as it hits so many disciplines (astronomy, anthropology, aerodynamics)...But it is also a storyteller's dream, as the characters truly do live among the pages...By the time I finished this book, I was ready to cry for Emilio Sandoz, the sole survivor of the Rakhat expedition...The trauma of the entire experience is a parallel to the down-to-earth lives of everyday people, whose faith in God, family and country comes under fire every day...This is one of the best books I've read in a long time...Looking forward to reading Children of God..."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Sparrow\\" soars","review":"I loved this book! Whether you are an avid science fiction fan or a lover of character relations stories, The Sparrow is gripping and poignant. It deals with an exciting adventure story and a personal struggle with guilt and spiritual disillusionment. The characters are memorable and well-developed. Arguably one of the best books I've ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting premise .... Shallow theology","review":"Russell comes up with a unique perspective: The Jesuits seek out another worldly culture just like they did during the last 400 years or so. But her theology is shallow and weak. These Jesuits do not attempt to convert at any point in the book. She takes a radical approach to Catholic faith by alluding to female ordination (by having a main character, Ann, being told by the Jesuits that she'd make a fine priest - why I don't know because Ann is an atheist/agnostic) and by having the Superior General of the Jesuits (who's character resembles John Wayne with a very heavy Texas accent)revealing that he is a homosexual. Not good enough for a very contrived sequel. Readers would be better off with Canticle to Liebowitz by Miller, Dune by Herbert, or A Fire Upon the Deep by Vinge. There is more general theology in these books than this shallow attempt by Russell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not science fiction...more of a philosophical book on religion","review":"I chose to read The Sparrow because I found it on a science fiction best seller list, and I was very disappointed. This book is a thinly veiled religious self-help book masquerading as science fiction. While I found some of the anthropological references interesting, the writing often became boring and tedious with the characters quickly following suit. I finished the novel expecting some profound revelation, scientific discovery, or at least a decent plot; but alas, a simple fable of the perils of faith was enough to warrant only one meager star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought Provoking","review":"The Sparrow is an interesting and thought provoking book that sparks many questions and provides no easy answers. In addition, the characters are, for the most part, carefully and deeply written, and so intriguing that, while I read, I felt that they were alive and making decisions. Each person provided a part of the argument I have made to God at some point when I have questioned injustice, or God's guidance, or any number of spiritual, cosmic questions addressed by this book. The style of alternating the mission scenes with the scenes of attempting to deal with the fall out on Earth was effective in keeping the reader alert and attuned to the narrative and to the events as they unfolded and also, in a strange way, allowed the reader to experience some of Emilio's disjointed memories of his traumatic journey. All in all, a very powerful spiritual journey that lingers in the mind long after the book is closed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Theology and Science Fiction done tastefully","review":"The ending makes it all worthwhile. The novel presents you with an unbelievable situation at first involving a priest and a failed mission to a nearby inhabited planet. At first we are tempted to pass judgment on this priest. Gradually we are exposed to the reality that makes the situation believable and in the end we hear the truth. This is one book where I have to say that the ending is something of an emotional experience. This is not a book that can be passively read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting, Profound Page Turner","review":"absolutely wacky, spellbinding book. Jesuit priests in space on the search for God and how being religious and pious doesn't mean you are going to have a good life after all. That is, there is nothing in the books that says believing in God and abiding by him means you are going to loved and comforted. This point is captured in the most sexually violent form. On another level, this book captures the moral complexities of entering a new society in complete ignorance and how little things can lead to huge consequences (the butterfly effect). Strongly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Sparrow","review":"An excellent read. Science Fiction and God go together in this book like I could never have imagined. It was entertaining while exploring the God issues we all face in an way that is not preachy. Emilio Sandez is one of the most interesting characters I've met in fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"The time dilation physics is spectacularly incorrect!","review":"Time dilation is critical to the plot of this novel. Yet it is completely wrong as it stands in this book. As the trip is laid out in this tale, there would be *no* time dilation to speak of; yet the author assumes a huge time dilation factor. How an error as glaring as this could make it into a published novel is beyond me. But not as far beyond me as the fact that no one seems to notice!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow. Just wow.","review":"This is one of the 2 most amazing books I have encountered as an adult (the other one being its sequel, Children of God). It's highly entertaining, and the 2 books have a quite unexpected result. I don't even want to spoil the ending of the second book. Personally, I consider the 2 volumes to simply be a single book, split in 2, so while I initially found the ending of The Sparrow to be so disturbing I could not return to the book for almost 20 years (though I would not part with my copy of Children of God for love or money), I returned to it and, knowing how the entire work ends I no longer have a problem with the end of The Sparrow; after all, it is only the middle of the story, and as a whole it is a great story. Yes, there is a religious bent to it (Well, it IS about a Jesuit mission to a planet near Alpha Centauri) nut it is not overpowering and the narrative is just so compelling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new nothing much.","review":"I found this book to pose very few intresting questions. THe charaters where unlikakbe and not well drawn. The narrative it's self is very sketchy and is more confussing than compelling. Very little intresting of orignal craftmanship went into bot the form and content this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably the best speculative science fiction since Bradbury","review":"After I finished this book, I remembered a quote \\"The road to hell is paved with good intentions\\". This is very intelligent writing by a mature and well rounded individual. The characters are well developed, the hard science regarding space travel seems plausible, and its obvious the author did her homework--she probably didn't need to, the story is allegorical. There are some plot points that need to be cleaned up, but I suspect that is why there is a sequel which I have already downloaded to my kindle. This book isn't for everybody and it's not quick reading, but well worth it if you like thoughtful fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Greats","review":"Although Slightly depressing, Russell has a knack for making unbelievable events seem plausable. I love the way she writes and the way she develops characters. I will forever feel like I know the people in this book personally. A MUST BUY."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Many Reviews......","review":"Art creates reaction. Conflict. Mixed emotions. That this book has inspired so many and varied reactions speaks to its impact.The book raises many questions: moral, ethical, theological.Perhaps these questions are not new, but to those of us unschooled in the complexities of theology they are revelatory; disturbing.There are few new questions. That the old ones have yet to be answered beckons us to consider them anew.This book, and its sequel did that for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what I expected","review":"If you like science fiction with religious overtones you will like this book. A friend lent it to me and I was suprised at how good it was. If you like the Dune series, you will like this book. I'm looking forward to reading the sequel \\"Children of God\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Searching for Faith","review":"This book was enjoyed and disliked in our bookclub. The most common comments though were about the shocking nature of the events revealed at the end of the book. To me this book, although covering some most unpleasant episodes was mostly about faith. How do we find it? What is it? If we do believe and yet terrible things happen - is that the end? This book is startling in it's understanding of these issues. There are also discussions within the book about relationships and love that show a real insight into human nature. I eagerly await the sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh know, Jesuits in outerpace!","review":"A friend commented to me how sad she was about the difficulties encountered by the main character. My response was by asking how was his any different than what the Jesuits encountered when they came to explore the Americas. THE SPARROW is interesting enough to read even if it is unbelieveable in parts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully Stunning First Effort","review":"This is what science fiction can be when a writer of talent tries her hand. Insightful, moving, and beautifully written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time","review":"Ok, this book has a very good and intreguing idea and plot. The thought of two clashing worldviews from two entirely different planets is very good (and also over used, but that's ok). However, this book is very wordy and detailed. Details are good because one can truely understand the character. These details do not prove helpful in this book, but rather bog down the reading useless facts. The ending is rather disturbing, but is a good finishing point of the book. If you don't have a lot of time to waste, then don't read it. Find another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I don't understand why the author chose to punish her main character, a Jesuit priest, in this repellent, extreme fashion. This book could have been something special; instead, the reader feels weary and disgusted after finishing the last page. No pay-off, no illumination, no human dignity upheld. What's the point in the end?On the positive side, I did appreciate some of the characters--but felt that the author didn't really let them breathe properly. They all seemed merely to exist as part of the \\"set-up\\" for the nasty denouement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much information, no heart.","review":"This novel is wordy, cluttered, and unpleasantly empty at the core. It's actually very immature writing. Undergrad. level writing classes (if no editor available) would have helped. The author is under the impression that an avalanche of information and cleverness will suffice. It won't!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Immoral Aliens","review":"This was the WORST book I have ever read. The lone star that I gave this book goes to the author for her efforts in writing it.I was encouraged to read this by all the amazing 5 star reviews and once I was done, I felt defiled.I can appreciate good books, too....but this?? ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING.Sex addicts might enjoy this read."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Sparrow Does Not Soar","review":"After a promising beginning, this novel became more than deeply disappointing, I was angered that I wasted my time reading it. Set in the future, the story centers about a failed Jesuit mission to a newly discovered, inhabited planet. If the author's intent was to thoroghly gross out her readers by sketchy discriptions of the abominable acts that occur there, she succeeded. If it was to provide intellectual, thought-provoking material, she failed dismally. I do not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not C.S. Lewis in my book","review":"To portray life on another planet as so sadistic and cruel and humans as so scientifically advanced is a denial of the genre itself. I prefer Lewis and his portrayal of those other worlds!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I really wanted to like this book but I couldn't get there","review":"I decided to read the book based on the number of positive reviews but came away very disappointed. The set up took very long, nearly half the book before the main plot came into play. Yes, the characters and situation need background and set up but not that much time dedicated to back story. These pages could have been dedicated to the main plot and alien characters, with more time developing Rakhat. In fact, I unfortunately never came to care about any of the characters, even the main character.***SPOILER ALERT*** I also felt that I had read the same sort of story before in SF...one race has another race enslaved...space travellers upset the balance of power on another planet...so there was not much new SF wise. In fact, besides using an asteroid to travel the overall SF element was low. Then the final act was just too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"I must have missed something, slow, disappointing.","review":"When I read the reviews on the book, I couldn't wait to get my hands on it and read it. Idid. This book is an example of something definately not living up to expectations. I am not a science fiction fan,( however I thought \\"Legacy of Herorot\\" was exceptional), and thought I'd give \\"Sparrow\\" a try. I found the book exceedingly slow and boring. Such a good premise and such a letdown."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caveat lector","review":"With the exception of high-school textbooks and software manuals, never have I deliberately read anything this badly written. It is slow, pretentious, ineptly told, sophomoric -- need I go on?Learn from my mistake and never promise a friend you will read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Sparrow, a sparrow to the eagles of SF.","review":"The Sparrow, masquerading as a SF novel, is a silly, pathetic attempt at a romantic/religious soap opera. It is an embarrassment to honest soap opera, romance, and SF hacks alike. The target readers are women with the mentality of twelve year old Catholic schoolgirls who still lust after some priest of their adolescence; and women who are titillated by priests using dirty words.Ms. Russell's characters are incredibly trite, shallow, and most of all, predictable. The Sparrow is an excellent example of the pseudo literary writing style, meaning: characterized by extensive, superfluous bull hockey.Technically, the little physics the book contains is often wrong. The narrative is so filled with inconsistencies that I can only assume that Random House and the editor of this compost heap fodder are the laughing stock of the industry. Not surprisingly, after 406 pages of random manure mixing, the conclusion is a one page dump leaving many loose ends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"A friend of mine who reads a ton recommended this book, and although I am not generally a fan of this type of book, I thought I would give it a try. I LOVED IT! It had me captured from beginning to end, and I have told lots of other people about it and had the same response from them. If you are doubtful, open your mind and you will be engrossed immediately!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed in editorial reviews","review":"I found the editorial reviews on this book disappointing. Ikept wondering if they had read the same book I had just finished. Thecharacter the author developed was Emilio. The other characters were just not realistic or very interesting. I found some of the sentence structure difficult. I had to read quite a few sentences over to try to fiqure out what the author was saying. I enjoy innovative writing but this style did not add anything to the story except slowing the reader. The story was slow enough.

It's hard to explain how such simplicity can be found in each chapter. If you are unconvinced, just read any chapter (many are only two pages long) - concerning the miser, the corrupt cop, the pimp, and the advertiser. This isn't Rothbardian in that Murray Rothbard will argue down to the very philosophic principles to prove his point.

This drying rack is a good compromise, especially when space is a concern.I can hang up about two loads of laundry (from my mini-washer mind you) and overnight it should all be good to go.

From the first track \`Lit Up' to the last \`Drink the Water' you will be amazed by the enjoyment this album will give you, you will just play it over and over again. The 5 star rating is no joke, if you like good Rock music, with a hint of Punk, you'll be amazed by this album. I think that the sound is really quite unique, but if I had to describe it, I would say it is Metalica, with the more smoothed sounds of Green Day, the pace is also faster than Metalica. I really like this album as it makes me feel good, I know that is a cliché, but it really does, the sound is lively, and up lifting, I implore you to buy this album, because when Buckcherry make it big, you can say you had there album first."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Rock CD of '99","review":"Seriously one of the best rock and roll cd's of all time. Reminds me of the early GNR alot, and the lead singer Joshua Todd reminds me also of Chris Robinson of the Black Crowes. All songs are great, but the classic hits have to be \\"Lit Up\\" \\"For the Movies\\" \\"Lawless and Lulu\\" and \\"Related\\". If anyone is disappointed with the lack of good rock and roll these days, buy Buckcherry and you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sign of things to come?","review":"This album doses up an in your face style of rock n'roll, not what people would expect with the way music has been heading these days (disaster) but this album gives me and rock fans a sign of hope that rock could be on its way back to the top where it should belong!

I have not cared for one single \\"so called\\" rock album since 1991. Hold on...here comes Buckcherry! The boys from L.A. are keepin' it real (real good). With rock anthems like \\"Lit Up\\" and \\"For the Movies\\", it seems like they may just single-handedly resurrect good ol', in your face, kick your butt rock and roll. I even like the song \\"Check Your Head\\" which my band is now covering. It gives me a great feeling to know that no matter how many bands try to kill off Rock...it will keep rising from the ashes like the Pheonix!

Great stuff. But ...I can't fault the Kindle version, but Chesterton hasn't lasted well. The writing is good, but it belongs in a world where crooks are gentleman (\\"Raffles\\", perhaps) and the class system is alive and well. One story relies on something happening in a house where no-one has visited. Amazing. Well, (spoilers...) no-one apart from tradesman, of course.So, read it as a timepiece maybe.

So we thought that the PS1 game looked cool. But, when we brought it home and started playing, we had a huge dissapointment. The beginning is just like the start of the show, but when you start playing the game, it is totaly VIOLENT!! The only object of the game is to beat up the villain that you are pitted against. You throw things at eachother and use violent moves on eachother. My sister had to stop playing at level 5 because the villain was getting too violent and her fingers were hurting from all the action! This game is a TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY, and I hope that the store will let us return it!!!! DON'T BUY THIS GAME!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This game is violent","review":"This game is extremely violent. It bills as an adventure game and pits the characters against each other in battle where the only goal is to beat up the opponent. It does not teach cooperation, but rather settling things by throwing objects at each other and fighting unfairly (lessons a child does not really need to know.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"a violent disappointment","review":"My 4 year old daughter bought this with some of her Christmas money. It went back to the store the following day. The object of the game is to kill off the villians. You pick up furniture and other objects and throw them at the villian. When you hit him, a little puff of red (resembles blood) shows up. The meter that keeps track of the hits, fills up in red (blood red).In an already increasingly violent society, I feel this game sets the wrong example for our kids. I was extremely disappointed that my normally sweet child was yelling out \\"I killed him\\" and other similar phrases. Leave this game at the store."},{"rating":"1","title":"the right idea, but mediocre execution","review":"I love the look and feel of THE POWERPUFF GIRLS on TV, and had high hopes for this game. The 3D CG animated opening, which basically copies that of the cartoon, is really fun and enjoyable. That, with the inclusion of all the major PPG villains, made me think I was in for some fun.The game aspires to be something more than just your average fighting game, with it's use of all three girls and playpen style fighting arena. There are power-ups and props which are crucial to fighting, along with some special moves and character taunts. But with all that, plus reasonable PS1 graphics, the game is still a bit sluggish on the controls and quickly repetitive.I wish this game has faster controls, more varied gameplay, and a more involved use of the cartoon's sound fx for both the game and the interface.It could have been much cuter, I think."},{"rating":"1","title":"I liked the CGI movies in it, but...","review":"Frankly, the gameplay itself [stunk]. Mediocre graphics, and even more mediocre gameplay. Definately not worth the money invested. I only got it because I am a Lenny Baxter clone...: )My advice is to get the Game Boy Advance Mojo A Go Go. Fantastic graphics, and looks EXACTLY like the show. Much more exciting gameplay as well.As to anyone who buys a PpG game, and doesn't expect to see violence, what planet are you from? The PpG is the most violent cartoon I have ever seen in my life, but it is supposed to be that way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Was Hoping For","review":"I'm a totally obsessed Powerpuff Girls fan. I read the comics, buy the DVDs, and have the fashion accessories. So I decided to get this game. There aren't many \\"girly\\" games out there for a girl such as myself to buy... and this is one I shouldn't have bought.The characters in this game move extremely slow. It makes it difficult and frustrating to play this game. I may not be an obsessive gamer, but I am 18 and have the necessary motor skills to play a freaking video game! So obviously there is something wrong with the game. I wish I had read everyone's online reviews before getting this game, because I would not have gotten it if I had. I would recommend getting anything from the Spyro series if you're looking to play a cute, fun game. You can actually get somewhere with those! Also, Hello Kitty's Cube Frenzy is a cute game for girls."},{"rating":"1","title":"bleh.","review":"as much as i love the powerpuff girls, this was kinda a disappointment. it HURT my hands to play this game since the characters moved so slowly! i did enjoy the narrative commentary and the CGi movies, though. there isn't any real replay value i could find, and for the sensitives that obviously never seen the show this is a FIGHTING GAME that has VIoLENcE. in short, want a powerpuff game? try the computer one \\"mojo jojo's pet project\\" or the one for the GBA \\"mojo jojo a go-go\\". stay away from this one unless you're hardcore (like me. ^^;) nut."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS GAME STINKS","review":"This is the worst game I've ever looked at.

It is very easy to add pictures to the slide show, but that is where it ends. The program uses 99% of my CPU, as a result, my computer would freeze up constantly (2.6 GHz XP w/ 2 gig ram). There is not an easy way to save your work, so everytime my computer would crash, I lost all of the work I had done.

Good thing the program was only $20! We wound up copying it to a CD to be played on a computer, but could not ever get it to work as advertised.

It did neither. The software had some trouble converting the Powerpoint file and can't even properly convert to a DVD format and burn on to a DVD disc.

The author has done a good job on the text and narration of this book, but that is where the compliments end.When I buy a book with \\"Hiking trails\\" in the title, I am buying it for the maps. The author did not do a very good job on the maps to start with, which I knew from using the 3rd edition and as a previous reviewer has noted. But the maps in the 4th edition are even worse. No improvements were made, and the quality is much worse. If you sent all of the 3rd edition maps and pictures through a fax machine, that is what the 4th edition looks like. It is not often that a new edition is actually worse than the former one!In short, good narration, bad maps.

She is a fish out of water, stubbornly trying to remain unchanged in a country that is constantly changing.

Personally, I don't care because mine was given to me for free. It is said that it is supposed to increase the graphics on most games and mke them a little crisper, but I have not seen much difference as far as graphics are concerned. The plus side of it is that it really does increase the memory of your N64 console system. Overall, I would recomend getting this only if you have the money or you are getting a bundle such as Donkey Kong 64, or other games that require one. Most games out there such as \\"Perfect Dark\\" only recommend one. But if you are an accessory collector (such as I am) it definetly is a must have.

Not only does the expansion pak enhance Perfect Dark, but it also improves the graphics of every game that can work with the expansion pak, like The World is Not Enough 007. Now, I saw a big difference there! First, the graphics were a bit shabby, but I placed the expansion pak in the N64 console, and bada-bing, bada-boom, the graphics were amazing!

While it made the graphics in Star Wars Pod Racer quite a bit better, and allowed longer instant replays in a couple sports games, it was basically useless. But I kept telling myself that I would have it when Donkey Kong came out, and I would be happy. Now Donkey Kong has come out, but I had to buy it bundled with the expansion pack, because that's the only way it is sold.

The legit pack also has a red top, but it is flat and has little dimples that resemble a golf ball. Installation is easy. I found several different videos on [...] that show the process. The pack itself is a must if you wish to play Perfect Dark. It allows for you to play solo missions, which is not an option without the pack.

At best, Peter Levenda is an occult expert who really doesn't tell you anything that a true occultist would already know. At worst, he sounds just like another whining leftist who's upset that Communism has been battled and defeated all over the world by right wing groups."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great chair","review":"Chair is great!

Although it's certainly intriguing, it falls short of Zorn's other projects for me. The long compositions seem directionless and the endless reverb and delays are a little hokey.

Not having a Ph.D. didn't stop her from opening a college. She worked for FDR and can be seen as the spiritual ancestors of Maxine Waters, Barbara Lee, and ugh!, Condie Rice. This work says Bethune and her husband departed, but it doesn't say if they ever officially divorced. I question whether that means she and her former amour were celibate forever or not. This would be a great work to show for young Black girls interested in educational careers. Though the word \\"sexism\\" is spoken by one interviewee, I do question that \\"feminist\\" could have been said more.

There are trays there that I haven't seen before. The information given for each tray is great. It details the origin and date it was produced and the amount made. This book is well worth getting."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for the favorite Auntie!","review":"Read this book, even if you don't have kids of your own. I am the favorite aunt to three little darlings, and Dr. Buff's parenting book helped me learn the tricks to providing a wonderful experience when Mom was not around! Of course, as Dr. Buff will tell you on the radio, TV or in one of his fantastic lecture sessions, consistency is the key to raising children. That's why I bought this wonderful book for my sister, and she keeps it by her bedside as a reference book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought as a gag gift, and man, what a joke it is","review":"There's nothing new in this book, and no 'psychological tricks' either--it's full of the same old regurgitated bad advice other know-it-all would-be childcare experts have offered. His storytelling advice alone is laughable, and clearly comes from a person that does not often engage in storytime with kids.The worst offense, however is the shoddy fact-checking that allowed an urban legend to slip into the book--that old myth about kidnappers whisking children away into bathrooms for a quick haircut, dye job and change of clothes before making for the exit. (Don't believe me? Check out Snopes.com and read for yourself.)Don't waste your money on this book, just use a little common sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than his other two but still stinks","review":"I'm disenchanted by this author. I bought all three of his books here on Amazon and thank goodness I bought them used or else I'd be livid! What a waste of time. No such 'trick(s)' in this book! Just common sense stuff that you already know. It's all a marketing ploy to get you to buy a book that promises psychological tricks but when you read it, there's no tricks, but rather plain & simple parenting. Oooooh boy! That's so hard to do I need a psychologist to tell me how it's done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book, if you are a first time vistor to WDW","review":"This book is really good to get a lot of information if you are a first time visitor. However, for us veteran of WDW, this book just isn't for you! It's the same old info. that you can also find in other books. One things that may be convenient, or a security hazard...you can store information in the pockets provided. However, this info. such as hotels, family, tickets, airlines, is really quite a security hazard if you think about it. I would not suggest this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way overrated","review":"With the number of 5 star reviews this book received I expected something worthwhile, this was not it. Very little new information and most of the book is either blank pages for including your own notations or pockets. Any spiral notbook with pockets would be just as useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Look No Further","review":"You have found the perfect book to plan your wonderful trip to the happiest place on Earth. The detail is amazing. Each resort is given a six page lay out. You will see everything you need to see before getting there. The author's have a web site that can answer any question anyone can pose. The most up-to-date info can be found at that site."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indispensible before, during, and after your stay","review":"As authors of a new travel guide to the Orlando-area theme parks and beyond (Vegetarian Walt Disney World and Greater Orlando), we own more guides to the Kingdom of the Mouse than just about anyone we know! When we go back for follow-up research this Fall, Passporter 2000 will be the only one we bring with us. It's hands down the most useful guide to the parks, leaving all its competitors in the dust.The introduction of a new type of travel guide is a rare thing, but Passporter has succeeded in bringing a revolutionary idea to the vacationing public, allowing us to use the book not only as a guide to the parks, but also as an organizer, a carry-all, and as a scrap book upon our return home. Jennifer and Dave are on to something BIG. We look forward to future books in the Passporter series, making travel everywhere a whole lot easier!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A terrific idea!","review":"I have been 'Birnbaum' faithful for many years and didn't think I'd like any other Disney travel book. Boy, was I surprised! I truly love the PassPorter's pocket pages as they save me from wondering where I'll store everything. This book was a terrific idea and I'm glad someone thought of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good resource, BUT...","review":"As a 22 time extended stay veteran of WDW, I found this book very detailed in many things. I would caution anyone to ignore the authors rankings of rides and food. I thought they ranked a lot of things low. The Readers Choice rankings are a better veiwpoint. I suggest doing as much as possible and - you make the rank. Pay close attention to the way they ranked food. It can be a little misleading, after all a cheeseburger is a cheeseburger, be careful. The maps and folders are useful to try to remember after your trip what you did and when you did it. I would suggest for first timers to get a Birnbaum's WDW to compliment this book. It gives some details for the attractions that is not in the Passporter. Get all of the facts before going to WDW. Make up your own mind and have a great trip. As for the authors, by looking at the way they ranked some of the rides and food I am curious to why they even like the place."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll never need another book","review":"This is my second Passporter. I loved my first one so much that I preordered this one for our upcoming trip and I was not disappointed. This book has everything. It has reviews of every park, resort, restaurant, etc. It has color coded maps of each park. I simply love this book. I have the spiral edition. But it also comes in the binder edition. You have pockets to keep up with important papers, coupons, and receipts. These pockets also serve as a great note taking device. You are able to keep your plans for each day organized and neat. To top it off, they made the book closeable so that you don't have to worry about losing anything when you are not using it.I love every part of my book. I have a few other books, but this is the one I pick up everyday. They even have a website that you can log on and get answers to questions or just meet other disney goers. I'll never purchase another book as long as they continue to make the Passporter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give me PassPorter 2000!","review":"This book is great! It's hard to believe that the authors could have improved on the original, but they have. There are more pockets, for longer vacations, more and longer restaurant reviews, more tips and a sturdier book altogether. The maps are larger and more detailed. It makes planning a vacation at WDW a breeze! And it's still at the same price! Thanks guys, this is just what we needed for our next trip to WDW!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of only a few \\"hands-on\\" travel guides","review":"I have read just about every major Disney travel guide published in the past few years and the \\"hands-on\\" format of this guide makes it the most unique I've ever read. I STRONGLY suggest this for first time visitors or guests who have not been to WDW in a few years. Even though I will be making my sixth visit to WDW in the past nine years I can still find many ways to use this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't leave home without it!","review":"This book has everything. DisneyWorld is such an overwhelming place to visit, you definately need a guide. This is a guide and so much more. Not only does it have detailed descriptions and ratings of all the theme parks, all the rides, all the hotels, all the restaurants, and all the minor parks like DisneyQuest, it has pockets and forms to fill in all your reservation numbers, hotel names, flight numbers, etc. The pockets are for your plane tickets, confirmation materials, passes, etc. It also gives helpful advice about which parks to go to on which days, which rides to avoid at which times, how to handle children on the trips, etc. Everything you need to know, and a handy organizer to boot. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent all-around resource.","review":"This book does a great job of presenting and explaining all aspects of a WDW vacation, from planning your travel and lodging to good descriptions of all park attractions and resources. The book includes several write-on 'pockets' that are a great aid in organizing a vacation. It has been an invaluable resource for planning my own vacation, and if (when!) I return to Disneyworld in the future I'll likely buy another."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super for those who organize","review":"I have tried all the Disney guide books and this is the best one. It has the same concept as the regular spiral edition BUT with the loose-leaf format you can re-arrange things to your preference, toss aside the planning stuff (which is the best anywhere) when you your plans are set. The concept also allows you to add your own pages to the book and keep things like stamps and addresses handy and compact for the trip.Besides the concept, this book is well-arranged for the planner and the do-er. The planning pages are super and one of the most complete website guides anywhere! There is great information and a wonderful rating system. Checkout their website for updates and specials: passporter.comEither edition is good but if you like to go to the World frequently or you want maximum flexibility, get the deluxe."},{"rating":"2","title":"PassPorter is a must have!","review":"PassPorter is an invaluable tool in planning your next trip to WDW. The information on resorts, park attractions and restaurants is extensive, not to mention the many tips shared. The pockets in the back to store needed confirmation numbers and mementos from your trip is one of the best features of the book. I wouldn't consider a trip to Disney without it."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHAT A GREAT IDEA!!!","review":"I am absolutely thrilled with my copy of Passporter 2002. I am going to Disneyworld in August and cannot believe the amount of information packed into this Travel Guide/Planner. They even give you estimated wait times for ride lines,and how long it takes to get from point A to point B in any park!!! Amazing book, full of websites,money savers,plenty of pouches to store things in for each day's itinerary,resort and restaurant reviews,maps of the parks,airport,resorts...AWESOME!!! The best part is: They have a website you can go to for updates and more info!!! Get this Travel Guide..highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Has lots of \\"inside info\\"","review":"This Disney guidebook was very helpful to us because the authors give their own opinions of the rides, attractions, resorts, and restaurants, as well as the opinions of their readers. They also give tips and advice based on their own personal experiences. Another great feature is the maps of each resort which can help you decide which area or building you might prefer. The maps also show which buildings are smoking buildings. We used the Passporter in planning our 3rd trip to Disney and it was very helpful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't go without this book!","review":"Planning a trip to Disney World? Don't go without this guidebook. In fact don't even plan your trip until you buy one of these. The authors cover everything: budgeting for your trip, including money saving tips; transportation; where to stay; what to pack; and more. There are thorough evaluations of the amenities at the major resorts and hotels in the area. Disney restaurants are rated so you can decide in advance where you want to eat. Once you get there you will love the pockets they provide for storing keepsakes and photos."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic resource","review":"This book is wonderful. It is full of facts and helpful suggestions. I filled out my information on the first PassPocket already! It's refreshing to read a well-written guidebook by authors who genuinely enjoy Walt Disney World, rather than travel writers who have to write a book about it. I've read all the guidebooks out there and rate this one the best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Most useful information in smallest size","review":"The Passporter 2002 has more information gathered on WDW than any other guide, and it keeps it all in one compact place. The author's reviews, along with readers reviews from their website are great. You can really get an idea of what the attractions and restaurants are like just by reading these ratings. The Staying in Style (resort hotels) section is incredibly complete, with just about every bit of information you could possible want on the different options of hotels Disney offers. Each map in the book (from resorts to parks to layout of the entire \\"world\\") is a plus. Planning ahead should be a breeze. Now if only Disney were more willing to allow pictures to other publishers..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do you expect me to carry this book with me around the park?","review":"Oh please. If you have read any other Disney books (especially the unofficial guide) than you won't pick up anything new here. The information is vague. As far as the pockets for holding your stuff, it is a nice idea, but do you really think I want to carry a book this size around Orlando? I like to travel light around the parks and this book will not be coming along for the ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-have for any obsessive Disney planner!!","review":"The PassPorter has, without exception, the BEST resort descriptions I've seen. (And I'm more than a bit obsessive, so I've checked just about every guide book out there.) The PassPockets are GREAT for keeping the huge volumes of stuff I've accumulated in preparation for my trip neatly organized and readily at hand. I HIGHLY recommend this book for anyone planning a trip to WDW!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must-have for WDW travelers","review":"This was the ONLY book I used in my Disney World vacation planning. It's not the only one I bought, but once this one arrived the others were forgotten. It has everything you need to know to plan your trip. I especially like the worksheets for planning (making dining reservations, budgeting, etc.), the pockets for putting itineraries, etc., and the list of useful phone numbers at the back. The book is designed for you to customize, with lots of pages to write in your own notes and memories. The authors are clearly experts, and offer balanced reviews of rides, restaurants, hotels, etc. They even tell you their biases (who likes spinning rides, or seafood, etc.), and their daughter provides her own tips for kids.You can't find a better tool for planning your Walt Disney World vacation."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best on the market!","review":"Disney World is one of the greatest places on earth. But to have a good time there, you must plan. This book not only helps you to plan, but gives you all the information and tools you will need."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-have book for anyone planning a Disney World Vacation","review":"This is the most comprehensive and easy-to-read guidebook for Walt Disney World that I have ever seen.It is the very best source for on-site hotel information and includes maps of WDW resorts, room layouts, amenities, WDW transportation system times to theme parks, and more.Outstanding summaries of all major and minor attractions throughout Disney World include information on the waterparks, Downtown Disney, and Disney Quest.Whether you're a first-time Disney visitor or a seasoned Mouseketeer, you'll find this informative and visually pleasing guide to be invaluable. An added bonus for scrapbookers are the memory pockets that provide a handy place for journaling and keeping momentos from your trip.If you only buy one guide for Disney World, make it this one -- you won't be sorry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't go to WDW without it!","review":"After reading any number of books about Walt Disney World, including the Official and Unofficial Guides, this one is proving to be the most invaluable. It has the BEST information on all of the Disney hotel properties, even maps to help you decide if there's a certain building you'd like to be in. It's not as biased as the Official Guide, yet not nearly as negative as the Unofficial Guide. Not being Disney affiliated allows the authors to be unbiased and truthful about their experiences, and they are! The PassPockets are fun and convenient; they really help to keep you organized during the pre-trip planning and the trip. It's also a great souvenier once the trip is over; keep it with your photo album to look at your thoughts & comments in years to come. Corresponding website allows you to update your PassPorter with new/revised information and has additional tips & hints for your trip. Like the old commercial said...don't leave home without it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Vacation Aid","review":"Very good reviews and information on hotels and places to eat. Overall, I found the book both 100% enjoyable and useful. This is a great vacation aid. I recommend it to everyone I find going to the World. Can't wait for the encore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very fun...refreshing","review":"I am a huge fan fan of THPS 1,2,& 3 and was looking for a snowboarding game on the same level, but after reading the reviews of the Palmer Snowboarding game I was a bit turned of...then I tried SSX Tricky! SSX gives you the same feel of a Tony Hawk type game, but with a refreshing twist. You still get great tricks and combos, but the courses are set in a downhill race style...so not only do you have to master the tricks (which you build as you progress in the game)you have to hone your racing ability...you also can race or showoff (who can get the most points) in a two player format. Overall a wonderful game once you master the controls...just as fun as Tony Hawk...but certainly no rip-off or wannabe title!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great game with a great feature","review":"This is a fun game, the graphics are cool to watch, and the soundtrack is great to listen to, but what makes this game so much better is the fact that it has DTS decoding, and if you have a nice digital sourrond sound system it triples the fun, it sounds like a dvd, really it does, and the thing is I wish more games were on DTS or Dolby Digital because that's the best sound available, the other game that I played that had digital sound was vice city. so if your looking for a game to really get your system going this is it. enjoy"},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the original - it's better","review":"The original SSX game was so much faster/more enjoyable to play then this version.

EA should take a look at shaun palmers pro snowboarder. the game uses people like Mac. Where are the real snowbpoarders?

I expected much better from EA"},{"rating":"1","title":"SSX TRICKY HYPE=PURE CRAP","review":"This game is a total waste of $... . I didn't buy the game thank god but I rented it. This game is worthless. The handling of the characters are horrible. The best gamer in the world couldn't play well with the handling. Don't waste your money on this game but buy the original because it's better than SSX Tricky.

The characters are improved although they did little to no improvement on the graphics. The new tricks and tracks are hella-sweet. Hours and hours of entertainment. New tunes. A must have for any PS2 collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Game Rocks!","review":"After playing so much [stuff] and reviewing it (Army Men: Green Rogue, and State of Emergency) it felt great to finally play something worth-while. And it was great! If you haven't noticed YET, this game is so cool. Wacky characters (look at Eddie, the guy with the 'fro), sweet courses, and the all new Uber-tricks (the specials) are sure to please. The graphics are wonderful. The game is GREAT. My only problem is the computer opponents can be cheap... from time to time, but are mostly tolerable, usually. This game deserves more than 5 stars, but oh well.Best Feature: UBER TRICKS!!Worst Feature: I haven't bought it yet...Final Score: 10/5 :), This game is ONE of the many reasons to own a PS2"},{"rating":"2","title":"great game","review":"Okay, so the improvement from SSX to SSX Tricky wasn't quite as big as the statement that SSX made, but its still a great game. If you don't get this, at least get SSX, finally a fun snowboarding game (compared to any previous ones like coolboarders) It's unrealistic, but in a good way, and it just makes me want to land one of those tricks some day (IRL, i can barely land a jump, a normal one) Even for those who don't like snowboarding, this game is great, beautiful graphics and great gameplay."},{"rating":"2","title":"Un-Realistic? So what??","review":"I have not bought tricky, just because its too similar to the first one for my taste, but I have played it a lot. If you liked the first one, then this is definatley a good game, though some of the improvements were un-necessary. Lots of people say that the reason this game is bad is because it's unrealisitc...but honestly, thats the point. If you want realistic, you should buy ESPN X-Games 2002. If you want just a good time, and dont care about realism, Tricky is the way to go. The only reason I dont give this game five stars is because it is very similar to the first game, and it gives me a more of the same feeling, but if you havent played the original, this is a must."},{"rating":"2","title":"I DON'T EVEN PLAY VIDEO GAMES","review":"I usually don't play video games. The first one that caught my attention was SSX, I loved it !!When SSX Tricky came out I had to have it! I often stay up way too late playing even though I know I have to be up early. Myteenage daughters often tease me about being up so late and screaming TRICKY!!! and just one more time!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"best snowboarding game ever","review":"SSX is by far the best snowboarding line ever!!! Tricky is not as involved as SSX 3, but is more fun. Unimaginable stunts, insane heights, and ludicrous speeds are everything someone like me can't achieve on a snowboard, but TRICKY helps me feel that rush. Even though I have a 360, I still enjoy this PS2 game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrealistic","review":"This game is unrealistic. I think that pulling huge flips and spins that are 100% impossible in real life 1000 times in a row gets boring and repetitve after a while.

My husband and I play together for hours. It feels as though we are really skiing. I recommend this for gamers of all ages. The characters are unique in style and personality. The controls are easy to master so you can advance in your tricks to unlock new boards and clothes. If you rent it, you'll become addicted so it's definitely worth purchasing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best version of Once In A Royal David's City","review":"The best sung version of Once In A Royal David's City of any I have heard.The solo during the first verse of the first track is worth the price of this CD alone.The other carols are traditional Christmas classics that stir the emotion with haunting reverberations from the cavernous Wells Cathedral.The 4-5 carols from Salisbury Cathedral are a bit disappointing.This is an ADD recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to use","review":"This was my first install and I found this kit very hard to figure out and use.

But not expecting to be impressed I found I was gently touched by the everyday connections and details divulged about Diana by predominantly former employees of the Royal Dynasty. If the slowly building picture of personal information only Diana could have known which revealed the personal relationships each had with her while she was alive.......was cute but largely uninformative..........it did create a strong impression of sincerity on the part of all involved. What 'came through' was an uplifting but un-insightful picnic hamper of pleasant tidbits which is perhaps somewhat to be expected for mediumistic and channeled information. At least in my experience.Anyone who admired and loved Diana and is open to 'spirit' channeling from the other side, will find a comforting and heartening snack!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very sturdy","review":"this is flimsy.

It is clumsily organized and isn't worth 95 cents, let alone $95. It is supposed to be the textbook for the introductory writing class, but it assumes that the reader is quite familiar with English rhetorical techniques. The examples are often arcane and the author doesn't explain how the readings fit with the classifications.I understand that you might HAVE to purchase this book for a class, but buyer beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"I found this to be a remarkable book. It combines a rangeof different perspectives, so that we get a balanced view.It offers full-length treatments for many of the authorswho have otherwise had to fight with 800 word articles inthe media.

Angry that I am wasting my time and money.This book is using fish metaphor and quotes from other people over and over again. Seriously, there are more quotes then his own words.The words are meaningless yet it tries to look like there is meaning. There are no useful tips, no honest opinion, and no advise. It is very busy proving why men are like fish. That's it. For example, It says that you have to choose the right bait and explain why you should do so, but no explaining on how to choose the right bait what so ever. Just going around words and fishing metaphors and looks like it tries to confuse you.There are just vague and big and confusing words one after another.

Why Men Like Bitches are much more to the point and helps you understand things more."},{"rating":"1","title":"All Analogies","review":"All the author really does is explain how men are like fish. He gives many examples (I had no idea there would be so many), but none were really helpful or applicable to life (unless I was suddenly given a pop quiz relating men to fish). I think I ended up throwing this book in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wished I had saved my money!!!","review":"I purchased this book based on the reviews posted. However, it didn't live up to my expectations. What little advice he actually gives is basic common sense. He says this is what every woman needs to know about catching a man. Well, if you're in need of this very basic instruction, finding a man should not be your first priority. Also, he has padded the book heavily with quotes. I guess this is an attempt to compensate for the lack of original material. If you eliminated all of the quotes and references to other works, you'd be left with little more than a pamplet. If you are a single woman, and you are serious about finding a nice guy remember patience is a virtue. Don't waste your money on this one, unless you're in the market for a book of relationship quotes. This book gets one star only because of the clever fishing metaphor used."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could give this ZERO stars!","review":"This book is so terribly aweful! The most helpful tips were the appendixes, which would make a booklet only, and is published on the author's website for free!The author goes on and on with these metaphors and never really makes a point. The problem with the metaphors is that they're common sense and don't help you make *immediate changes* to better your chances with men. It's just too vague. It's definitely NOT a \\"how to\\" book.I would recommend The Rules by Ellen Fein and Sherrie Schneider."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubbish","review":"This book is absolute rubbish. It is just page after page of other peoples quotes. You will learn nothing. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on this one","review":"Talk about fluff! I love the fishing analogy used throughout this book. And while I agree with all the points the author makes, not once did I feel as if any one point was developed thoroughly enough to prove useful for anyone. It's all good and well to use the many cute metaphores and analogies, but without any specific action plans to put them to use, all they are is \\"cute\\". This book is definitely a light and fun read, but there isn't much value in fun when it gives you no specifics on which to go on. This is definitely not a book I'd recommend if you're looking for anything beyond simple entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"the Title says it all!","review":"After reading this book, I feel the only thing I got out of it is that \\"Men are like Fish\\". It really is a perfect analogy, if you go chase or try to catch fish, they all run away, but if you stay still and bait them, they will swim towards you. I get this concept, but I was hoping to get more specific details as to how exactly to \\"bait\\" men or \\"hook\\" men. Yes it mentioned about \\"love yourself\\", \\"take care of yourself, physically and mentally\\", \\"learn to spot the right fish\\", \\"if you can't hook him, then it's not the right fish for you\\" etc. I already know about these basic principals, but again, I didn't see any specifics on exactly what a woman needs to do, or be aware of, in order to hook a man and land in marriage.I think this book is too generic, and the title basically wraps it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing but quotations","review":"I bought this book based on the wonderful reviews here but I did have my reservations after reading the excerpt on Amazon. I should have trusted my gut. There's not much more to this book than the quotations, which are funny and a mix between insightful and obscure. There's almost no effort to explain the quotes and relate them to everyday experiences. There are a couple of really good lists about where to meet people but just those few lists are not worth purchasing the book. I will be returning the book to Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fish are Fish - Men Aren't","review":"This book's recent second edition (I didn't read the first) is amazingly trite. I get the impression that Nakamoto had a tiny kernel of an idea and decided, somewhat unsuccessfully, to expand it into a \\"self-help\\" advice book. I did, however, enjoy seeing how many clichés (often conflicting the sense of previously-cited ones) he could pack into his work. The title's metaphor makes one wonder why, if a man were truly a like a fish, a woman would want to land one: if a woman actually caught a fish, she certainly wouldn't plan to marry it, she'd be more likely pan-fry it. But perhaps the author unwittingly expresses my opinion best when he says, apparently without being aware of the pertinence to his own work, \\"[a] smart woman should always be on guard against bad relationship advice, especially from men.\\" To which I can only add, amen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book offering honest perspective","review":"I'm skeptical of self help books, especially when it comes to dating. I truly enjoyed reading this though. As all dating books, there were some points that are somewhat obvious if you know anything at all about men. I personally got a lot out of the points made about not scaring the fish away. I have some personality traits that can be perceived in ways I hadn't considered. Having an honest male viewpoint was really helpful and made me more aware of my actions and self-portrayal."},{"rating":"2","title":"SOME IINTERESTING INTERPRETATIONS ON DATING!","review":"I bought this book after hearing the author on a \\"Coast-to-Coast\\" Internet radio program. I was mostly curious about the \\"fishing\\" concept, not that I wanted to catch a guy or anything.They say that men think too much but that's what guys do best. And this book reflects a man who obviously has thought long and hard about this analogy with dating and love.What I liked best are:The Bait Self-QuizFavorite Fishing HolesWhy Men Don't Call BackIt's got a lot of other interesting things, too....all from a fishing perspective and reflecting what men generally think is true. I hope women can appreciate this man's point of view because it's pretty right on.Anyways, with a lot of other books out there on this same subject, I think it's important that women also consider the big picture as this book portrays.It's an easy read, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Enlightening & Entertaining","review":"I thought this book was both entertaining and enlightening. I recommend it to any woman who is looking for some insight on where & how to meet men :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gleam What You Can....","review":"From this book and put the \\"bait\\" on the hook!Author Of:Black Women Deserve Better"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a metaphor. it's a simile","review":"A real page turner. If you're jumping back into the dating game, it has a lot of information that will just pump you up and get you ready. If you're already dating this book will seem like a bunch of fluff. Still it's a good thing to go over to keep you up on the game. Don't buy this book; borrow it. It would be nice to read a book by Nakamoto geered towards men but I hope in that book he knows the difference between a metaphor and a simile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute Take on an old subject","review":"This book is very easy to read, very entertaining and even helpful. As Steve Nakamoto states in his text, he is not telling us anything new, but his simple metaphor really drives home what you already knew, and gives you lots of ideas to follow through on. If you are after some quick answers, or a little rusty on attracting men, you will find it a worthwhile read. If you are willing to think a little about how you might apply the metaphor and willing to read some other materials, and do some work on yourself and your approach to men, you will get a lot out of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got EM' Hooked!","review":"Enjoyed it, and learned a ton. It's like after you see a movie and you remember so much of the details where you keep thinking about it over and over...well that's how \\"Men are like Fish\\" was for me. I only read it once cover to cover and can recall all the analogies to fishing and (being a fisherwoman) I related and remembered vividly. Even if you have never fished, the associations are easy to read and comprehend. It made sense, the information was easy to understand and easily applicable. I'm living Steve's advice proudly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Catch the bigger fish!","review":"Excellent book! I recommend reading this book to all women that are looking to catch a fine, great man (or the biggest fish, to say)! Steven's suggestions make sense for us women, and it's very clear and easy to see it from a man's point of view. This book gives you practical advice about catching a man and to be the most alluring, beautiful, natural you (no faking) and get any man you want really hooked. I truly enjoyed reading this book, it's fun and entertaining, Steven has a special sense of humor, don't miss it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stop Wishing and Start Fishing!","review":"I actually ordered this book for my 20-year-old daughter, who always tells me that she doesn't know where to find \\"a good guy\\". I read it before I gave it to her and I have to say that Steve offers some sincere & practical advice, and, his fishing analogies bring humor to the subject matter. I could have used this book 20 years ago!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More women should learn how to fish","review":"I heard this guy on a radio talk show and at first thought it was gonna be just another vehicle for women to complain about the shortcomings of men. But as I listened, I found I was intrigued by Steve Nakamoto's use of a fishing metaphor in describing relationships. I decided to buy his book and was pleasantly surprised by his humor and insight in describing the dating ritual; i.e., the man does the chasing and the woman does the catching. Like fish, men are basically simple creatures. With the right bait & the right hook any woman can reel in the big one. The Bottom Line: I wish more women would take Steve Nakamoto's advice and utilize the fishing approach to dating."},{"rating":"2","title":"men are like fish","review":"some good strategies to get the one you really want. unfortunaltely two have to agree!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Boat Bag Packed and Ready to Go Fishing","review":"Steve's book was an enjoyable and light read explaining what one should bring on a fishing trip. Made me laugh. His friendly pat on the back will get you smiling and ready to recognize a good catch. Wear sunblock. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Metaphor! Interesting Man's Perspective!","review":"The salon that I go to had a copy of this book on display so I took a peek and was pleasantly surprised. As a regular reader of Cosmo, I get more than my share of monthly \\"dating\\" and \\"relationship\\" advice. This book is more of a conversation piece than strictly about advice. At first I wasn't too into the \\"fishing\\" metaphor, but as I got through the book I began to see how it all fits together. My friends and I are having a good time playing with this thing. I hope others will see how different this book really is."},{"rating":"1","title":"YUK","review":"This is the worst book on the subject that I have read. It is not written well - or even easy to read for that matter and with advice like have good skin, have a pleasant voice and don't have an opinion that is contradictory to your date's, Nakamoto's book is shallow and unhelpful. Other books on the subject like He's Just Not That Into You are much more realistic, empowering and helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"cliff notes from multiple relationship books","review":"Not a good book. The book is essentially quotes from multiple relationship books. He never does give great advice, well no advice that we haven't read from other relationship books. Read the authors biography and you'll see he's not even a relationship expert."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tells It Like It Is","review":"I've read this book, and it confirms what many of us know, but don't always want to believe. It takes focus and effort to find the right man, and there are no short cuts. Steve is right when he says that to be successful in not only dating, but finding the right long-term partner, we must first have our own house in order. Nothing could be more true. \\"Big fish\\" go for the best bait. Period. It's good to see a man's perspective on what men find attractive and what can lure them into a conversation, and ultimately a relationship. Thanks, Steve."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be \\"too smart\\" or \\"too tall\\"...","review":"lest you intimidate and therefore \\"spook\\" your \\"fish\\"! This book alernates between glaringly obvious advice - don't wear too much perfume, don't start talking about marriage on the first date - and downright insulting \\"advice\\": Don't be too much of a \\"character\\", don't be too smart, don't have successful exes, because your date's fwagile wittle ego just *can't take it*! All men are really scared little boys, right? Please. I'm not running a daycare center here. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"I bought this book based on the positive reviews. Don't waste your time with this book. It is basically a whole lot of quotes with very little substance in between. It is written in a way that makes it difficult to read and it isn't interesting enough to be worth the effort. Basically everything he has to say is in the title. Men are like fish so bait your hook accordingly and be careful reeling them in. There are a lot better, more thoughtful books out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not funny or insightful","review":"I was hoping this book would be entertaining and/or insightful, but was very disappointed. The advice and humor is very simplistic. \\"The Boyfriend Test\\" by Wendy Walsh is a much more helpful book at men and dating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sincere and Useful Advice","review":"In this book, the author advises women about how to \\"catch a man\\" from a guy's point of view. He starts with advising women against chasing and pursuing a man, which is against human nature. Instead, he advocates attracting a man with a woman's feminine grace. Throughout this book, Mr. Nakamoto uses the metaphor of fishing when he explains how a woman can attract (catch) a man. Major topics include how a woman can prepare herself for meeting men (e.g., one important point is getting rid of excessive emotional baggage from the past before starting afresh), where to go to increase the chance of meeting successful men, how to handle the competition, the importance of being positive, confidence in oneself, substance from within, giving each other space, as well as staying independent, etc.This book is fun and easy to read. While I was reading it, I could feel the sincerity of the author in giving useful advice to women."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good start to a trilogy","review":"This was indeed an engrossing novel. I couldn't stop reading. Most of this novel takes places before DOAFS in an intriguing part of Krynn. Herbert did much better here than on her long-winded Clandestine Circle novel. This was a much easier, well-paced story.Linsha & Varia are more entertaining & fleshed out too. There were plenty of other interesting characters including two very likeable Dragonlords & one not so likeable one. It'll be interesting to see what kind of villian the Brutes commander turns out to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overwrought","review":"Linsha Majere lacks charisma. There are a lot of details poured into her character, and she definitely comes across as a courageous, if unconventional, knight; but somehow I get the feeling that Mary Herbert is still trying to convince herself as to who Linsha Majere is. The writing seems a little overwrought, and the fantasy in the book (e.g. a modern city built around a spirit city) really doesn't serve the story. I'm still trying to finish this one, and I'm not sure I'll continue with the trilogy."},{"rating":"2","title":"ANSWERS AT LAST!","review":"Is it possible we can rescue our children from mental and emotional corruption, as well as physical addiction and illness created by ignorant, profit-driven marketing?

However, going through just the second chapter resulted in numerous errors. The most glaring being the most likely cause of hypercalcemia, which was alleged to be familial hypercalcuria hypercalcemia (in reality it is parathyroid adenoma in the general population, malignancy in the hospital). This is a very basic question, which made me question the rest of the book. Leafing through other parts of the book, I found more errors, and have decided to return the book.Although the concept of the book is great, the author should have invested some time in fact-checking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Liked it, but it rusted","review":"I started off really liking my Vev Vigano 6 cup. It's solid and sturdy and makes a good cup of coffee. But I started disliking how hot the handle got, and how I had to use an oven mitt or a towel all the time to lift it off the burner. And when it started to rust.....well, that's what sealed the deal. I'm getting a new coffee pot, and not this kind. It rusts on the inside because of the way the bottom is designed, with that flared base. Water never drains fully, even when I turn the detached base upside down. It started ruining the taste of my coffee, and I'm worried about the metal I'm ingesting with every cup.

In each work, Holiday blends his grasp of historical facts with the feverish, jerking rhythm of adventure. Hally's attention to detail is as solid as the pen is in his hand. You actually feel like you are inside the novel and participating in one of its numerous car chase scenes. The action is so real and so suspenseful that during one of the crash scenes, Hoply ejaculates you from the vehicle and leaves you dashed and spluttered against a wall.

I mean like I know that she knows her roundball from all the other stuff I read a hers. But i didn't even like this as much as his last book.

Writing is very difficult work. Writing for a living can be one of the most difficult and discouraging enterprises. I salute anyone, even the mediocre for giving it a shot.I give this book a C for content. There is nothing creative in the conspiracy theories contained in this book. They serve no instructional purpose and in terms of entertainment, we've all seen them before in various episodes of the X-files.I give this book a C for style. The writing has been described as hip, witty and entertaining. Maybe I'm a bit jaded, but to me it bears the stamp of another young person who really likes himself but whose prose is unremarkable.Final grade C+. Mr. Hawley, your grade at the end of the course will be based on improvement. You have every opportunity to get an A in the course.

And three days after finishing it, I still don't know what tall men had to do with the story.Plus, the author tries to prove what a good writer he is over and over again. He is a good writer, he just needs to work on creating plots that start with a mystery to draw us in and finish with conclusions that actually conclude something."},{"rating":"1","title":"That annoying little tic","review":"If you're accustomed to reading decent literature and if you like well written thrillers, then this book will irritate you a little. As you go through the canned, predictable plot, you can picture the author loving his ideas as they popped out of his head. Then you start to actually analyze the prose in terms of what is childish, what is copied from others and how much of it is canned, late 20th Century \\"crap\\". If the book were merely bad, I would have no problem with it. Unforunately, it's just good enough to make you realize why it can never be a good book.

Its easy to chew probably because it tasted too mushy and soft. The reason why i gave it a 2 star instead of 1 star is because it's was going for a good price.

Not something I would buy); the skin provided some resistance but then it was very mushy on the inside. Maybe my batch had a higher proportion of that than normal? I got the hot flavor, but that did not mask the weirdness of the taste.The reason for two stars instead of one: I brought it with us while we were camping, and we were a little short on food. The short sticks provided sustenance even if we all grumbled a little bit about the taste.

They became the biggest band in the world and rock and roll icons. This book deals with the creative process of the recording of this seminal release. You get some good insights into the thought process behind the album. The one drawback is the book's size. It comes in a cd jewel case and is the size of a cd booklet.

What a terrible message about adoption this book sends! Yikes! Of course all internationally adopted children may have feelings such as described in the book...but I know a lot of adoptive families, and no one has even come close to this kind of reaction from the child....especially at Allison's young age. At her age, her parents are her world, no matter the fact that they don't look like each other. These issues arise later, and not in the manner described. It is like the author is working out some personal issue through this story. Sooooooooooo many other good books out there.

Walters also knows little about police investigative techniques, judging by the interviews that various officers conduct. Sadly, I've been unable to complete Walters last two books, also boring and with unsympathetic characters. She has been a disappointment for me, for I really enjoyed her earlier works, The Ice House, The Scupltress, and the Scold's Bridle.

Although Schaeffer's books have philosophical bias, their philosophy is pragmatic in its inner core, and as I read them it became obvious that I drastically changed my outlook on what music is and how to do it.

The cd is strong throughout and all the artists are in top form. The rhythmic intensity of El Manicero (the peanut vendor)is complemented by a few beautiful ballads. Simon's own compositions are inventive and melodic without trying too hard for technical virtuosity as many young jazz composers frequently do.This is really wonderful music and a great find.

The first two chapters are introductory, and the first \\"practical\\" chapter (chapter 3) literally says first \\"before a bare hull is delivered\\".

I would love to see how the person who designed this saw does that. It would be fun to watch. So if you plan on removing the water tray, do not bolt it to the bench. Even if you don't bolt it, you can only remove it after lifting the right side of the saw, tilting it, spilling water on the table, and then slide the tray out. It is a really bad design for the water tray. At the very least these steps have to be mentioned in the manual. Also in the specs section Amazon lists this saw as having 1 HP which is incorrect. It is 3/5 HP, which is about 0.6 HP. The specs need to be corrected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Little Home Saw","review":"I just purchased this product because I was applying stone facade tiles on top of my existing brick fireplace and required a saw for cutting (Home Depot was goin to charge me $75.00 without a blade to rent one). I purchased this item on sale from another store for $60.00 and it came with 4 diamond-tip blades. My only concern was when I first took it out of the box it looked a little small to take on the 1\\" to 1-1/2\\" thick tiles. However, it did the job beautifully. With its small motor, you will need to cut a little slower and it is undoubtedly messy to use (I recommend an outdoor spot where the run off can drain to the street or an area of level ground dirt). However, for simple tile cutting with tile no thicker than 1-1/2 inches, this will do the trick and save you money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great saw!","review":"Product worked to my satisfaction.

It took a good bit of force but the blade did come into alignment and I then went on to lengthwise cut 9\\" long by 1 1/4\\" thick firebricks with great success. Once properly aligned the saw did a very nice job of cutting the firebrick with little effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"this was a piece of crap.the motor barely had enough power to cut through one 12x12 tile.threw it aside and went to home depot and got a Skill brand saw (for about 20.00 more)andcut over 30 tiles without a problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"this saw is nice for the money works well u have to make long cuts slowly saw bogged down a few times but still a great saw"},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"Lesson learned here.

First off I should say it does cut tile - which is what I required. BUT both the design and manufacturing leave a lot to be desired. You get what you pay for. My major gripe is that the motor housing is 5-7mm out of true with the table, and there is no way to adjust it. That means the fence is almost useless, unless one is making many repetitive cuts and can manually set the fence to insure orthogonality. You cannot just set up the fence on and expect it to be parallel with the blade. I'm not found of the blade guard either, and if it isn't perfectly adjusted your tile hangs on it while being cut. Oh, and no mention whatsoever in the instructions as to how to install the blade guard. Yes, I figured it out, but I shouldn't have had to. There were other minor things that led to my low rating as well, and at this juncture I really wish I'd spent an extra $25 for a better machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beauty beyond compare","review":"A Life of Contrasts is a carefully written, brilliant biography by perhaps the most beautiful woman of the 20th Century.

Young Orrec's gift is wild and could kill the ones he loves - so he blindfolds his dangerous eyes and rejects it, as does his good friend.

I felt as if this book was thrown together haphazardly and the author expects the reader to fill in the blanks. Why did the boy really wear the blindfold so long? The lack of foreshadowing and the ultimate resolution of the father, son relationship was disappointing.

I think as my first replica purchase it is a very cool sword replica to have and own. When they decide to make a full tang of this sword I will buy another one, but till then. As consumers we are stuck with this for now. I gave it a four for this reason because of it being made with one of the cheapest steal in the world which is Pakistan steal.

If I offer it her in the morning and then fresh servings at lunch and dinner, she barely nibbles at it and sits by her bowl and mews.

There are plenty of REAL books on the law of attraction out there. This one is just someone scribbling random ideas on paper and calling it a book. It does not have even half the information it promises to deliver. I really can't see how amazon permitted this to enter their product list.

These shoes are great for babies/toddlers just learning how to walk in shoes. These were the 1st pair of shoes my son ever wore and they've worked great. If you want your child to learn how to put his own shoes on, this is the shoe for you. Since the tongue opens up to almost the toe, it's easier (compared to other shoes) for the child to slip his own foot in unassisted, yet closes snuggly with Velcro to keep out water and cold air. They're not the cutest when you 1st see them, but when your son puts his own shoe on for the 1st time and gives you a beaming smile, they definitely become the cutest out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe I got a damaged pair, but my son who never cries for more than 2 mins, cried all day while wearing these shoes.","review":"these shoes are cute to look at but they almost made a permanent groove in my 16 month sons toes.

I bet it was a defective shoe because usually I love stride rite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fell Short","review":"I really wanted to like this book, but I just couldn't. The premise is very interesting, everything that happened at the fall of the Roman Empire. But the delivery fell short. The formatting was just terrible, without clear paragraph breaks or section breaks. The author used different spellings for the character names depending on whether the person narrating was Roman or not, and I understand what she was trying to do, but it was confusing. If that were the only problem the book had I could forgive it, but there were too many other problems. It's a shame too because I think there is a good story there, but it just didn't work for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great at first, then it broke","review":"This item worked great at first.

I scanned through about 12 songs hoping to find some racial and cultural diversity - they did do a great job on inserting a token African American girl and boy! The fact that I had to look hard (across 12 songs) is pretty indicative of their what they consider their target market segment to be. I guess I will have to rethink whether to make my son watch this....well anyway, that's my opinion, and you are free as responsible adults to do as you please..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I do NOT recommend this book","review":"I was attracted to this book by the post 9/11 plot device, but was completely turned off by it. It is poorly written with very little character development. It requires you to suspend belief at many points (failure to monitor e-mails, performance at a military training course, etc.). Nearly every Arab character is a terrorist. Christian values are exalted over other religious beliefs. In this book, Iraq has WMD and is actively involved in planning a major terrorist activity -- clearly proven untrue. Finally, the use of a lot of real characters (NY Mayor Rudy Guiliani and others) mixed in with the fictional ones could mislead the unsophisticated reader and makes me wonder how much the political views of the author were influential in shaping the plot. I don't think we need more literature that foments anti-Arab sentiments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time","review":"This is truly a terrible book.

This book surpasses this threshold and has added new meaning to the word \\"trash\\". I suspect it sucked out at least 30 IQ points from my basic intelligence. A person will basically become retarded after reading this book.The most interesting part was looking at the author's picture on the dustjacket.

I could'nt put the book down and read it every chance I got. I really loved this book. Not only was it well written but the story line felt so real and leaves you on the edge of your seat with every page you turn. I was very surprised that this was a first time author and I honestly had the feeling that this was the author's 3rd or 4th book.

This book is a hopelessly vulgar take on the tragic 9/11 events of the US. The heroine of the book is a status seeking \\"socialite\\" in NYC who seeks revenge against a \\"terrorist\\" who used to be her lover. It's an unsmart, unsexy, and an uninformed reordering of the serious matter of terrorism, and reads like a laundry list of places to be seen or people to do, or know, if you're in NYC. I thought it was just a bad book, then I googled the authors name and discovered she's something of a nefarious, man-chasing, social climbing woman in NYC. Ultimatley it's a thin veil for what must be the author's own ghastly existence.
