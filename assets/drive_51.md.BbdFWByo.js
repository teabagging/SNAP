Now only until now, after reading the reviews I know what happened. The british guy's voice is very annoying and misplaced. They have swayed away from trip hop. There are only a couple of songs that are good, a couple that are ok, the rest not good. Don't waste your money on this album if you really enjoyed Kelli's vocals.

It's very easy to get stuck on \\"Kiro TV\\", \\"Sick\\", and the aforementioned track (all very catchy and amazing songs) and subsequently ignore the rest of the album; I'd strongly advise against it, because the other tracks are where the band's genius really shines. \\"Fuel\\", \\"Bloodsport\\", and \\"Think Harder\\" are more electronic-y sounding songs, whereas \\"Blue Movie\\" and \\"Small Town Witch\\" are more haunting, slower tracks with amazing beats.

The movie features a romantic love story happening a hundred years too late, so, as always in Truffaut movies, the characters are out of focus, they live a virtual passionate love that could fill hundreds of pages of a novel but are doomed to suffer in the trivial reality of the beginning of the XXth century.A superb musical score by Georges Delerue and a Jean-Pierre Léaud lunar as usual should tempt you even if the quality of the DVD presented by Fox Lorber is no more than average.A DVD zone your library."},{"rating":"2","title":"An AMAZING Trovatore","review":"Callas, Lauri-Volpi, Elmo and Serafin team up for the greatest Trovatore in history.

Picture placing 4 thumb tacks on the bottom of one's shoe. That is the sum total of this product.

Number 1 there is no one to show you how to do a lower impact or easier workout if you are a beginner. She does tell a few times how to do it slower but she doesn't show you so you don't know if you are dong it right.

The moves are pretty basic and Minna has exelent cueing and instructions. After the 30 minute circuit workout there's a 15 minute toning section which is also effective if you are using the proper amount of weight. I recomend this for intermediate and advance exercisers. If you're a beginner you may have to modify it a little."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW, this one really works","review":"This video really works.

Foward & Backward Walks, & 3. Throwout. If I was able to preview the tape beforehand, I wouldn't have bought it. I many ways I thought it was merely an attempt to get you interested enough to take lessons at Fred Astaire Dance Studio's, because it was so, so, basic. Worst Point - In the \\"Cha Cha\\" both the lady and gentleman dancer wore clothing that tended to obscure a good view of the thigh and knee movements especially. Best Point - I guess both demonstrators were perfectly technically correct in everything they did."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Teacher?

Something that all teachers need, new or experienced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Country to the core","review":"It's perhaps unfair not to award the CD a full five stars as the vocal performances by Ricky Van Shelton are of the highest quality. Stand-out tracks include Borrowed Angel, The Best Is Yet To Come (a new song, not the Sinatra/Bennett standard) and the title track, Making Plans. There isn't a trace of watered-down pop country and Ricky's vocals are expressive and heart-felt. My only criticism is that the album is ballad-heavy and would have been stronger with the addition of two further up-beat songs at the expense of It Wouldn't Kill Me and He's Not The Man I Used To Be. I'd recommend this to any fans of real country music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Variety To Help You","review":"I have really enjoyed this DVD. I am a bit overweight and wanted to do something.

You'll actually here her mess up the dialogue and say something like \\"man, I can't say that word today\\"... it was distracting. Plus, I found her voice to be grating. Need I go on???

The practice is defintely Iyengar which is what I am familiary with, a detailed precise practice aimed at improving or workong on a particular bodypart at a time.

The instructor's voice is grating. She sounds similar to Denise Austin so if you, like me, are sensitive to voice tone: be warned. And then there's the unsettling psuedo-mansion parlor background complete with pillars and fireplace which, to my mind, is entirely wrong for a yoga routine.If you're looking for a yoga DVD with a customized workout feature, I'd recommend the beautifully filmed and excellently instructed \\"Yoga Shakti\\" by Shiva Rea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this!","review":"Terrible voice, depressing indoor scenery, incredibly disjointed routines.

Most of the time, and practically till the end I was guessing how it was going to all work out since there are not drawings of the pattern or clear explanations of what seemed more like a puzzle than anything else.

I am using the exact same yarn as recommended (Rowan All Seasons Cotton, which is truly lovely yarn to work with), and my gauge is dead-on, too.

William Golding is the Nobel winning author who is best known for his first book, Lord of the Flies. His literary plunge into the depths of the age of sail during the Napoleonic wars has the same claustophobic tension of this earlier work. Told primarily in the first person, it is a voyage of self discovery of a member of the 'lower' aristocracy as he makes the long trip from England to Australia. During his voyage he is forced to question long held social, political, and personal values. Golding's ability to chart the change of his main character's pompous and self righteous view of the world to a more open and sensitive one is the internal beauty of this trilogy. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Authentic","review":"I was completely caught up in this saga of a sorry ship and its haughty, pretty much unlikable main character.It's unusual to somehow care about a person who for most of the story is an unsympathetic snob, yet one who makes the reader root for his redemption.

I have a large facial port wine birthmark, and it's the only conceler that has worked to cover it completly. It's water proof for swimming, easy to apply, and a small jar lasts for about 3 months. The only thing I don't like about it is how thick it is. But to get the coverage I need for such a dark birthmark, it is needed. I can apply thinner layers for lighter spots but have to apply it fairly heavy for my darker area's. So it looks kind of caked. This company makes a liquid type, that may work with an cosmetic airbrush. I hope to try it someday to see if it will cover and yet not looked so heavy on my darker areas. Overall, the cream in the jar is excellent and I have tried just about all the different brands on the market for birthmarks and still go back to this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"rip-off","review":"A FAN OF ANTONIO CARLOS JOBIM, I BOUGHT THIS BECAUSE OF THE PUBLISHED FORMAT,DTS AND BECAUSE OF THE TITLE-RIO NIGHTS LIVE!

The dialogue was terrible in the first episode - the characters seemed to always be either shouting or sulking, often both within the same scene.The second episode had improved dialogue, but the plot made no sense, and had very little suspense. The mystery is basically solved when a minor character simply confesses his involvement, and the bad guy (who's been onscreen for less than a minute by now), confesses as well. I don't have the heart to watch the remaining episodes for a while - barring a massive improvement in the writing, the Frost series ends at Season 3 for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Touch of Frost-Season 4","review":"A Touch of Frost is as interesting and well written as Inspector Morse, Midsomer Murders, Inspector Lewis and Foyle's War. David Jason is a very talented actor and very believable in the part of Inspector Frost . His interaction with the other characters gives you an intimate feeling as if you are part of the story.

There is video of the instructor (sometimes with a split view to show both hands), songs to play along with, an animated fretboard, audio clips with more suggestions or reminders, a guitar chord dictionary, and the aforementioned tuner and metronome.

This unfortunately isn't it. Rather, this is a sketchy and superficial book for the beginner. Chapters are short and cover nothing but commonly known information. Particularly annoying are the chapters on famous makers of high-quality arms such as Cooper and Kimber, which read like PR releases from the manufacturers. There is a chapter on the .17HMR (not a .22, obviously) but almost nothing on the .22WMR. The chapter on Winchester is a sort of company history, much of which has nothing to do with .22 caliber weapons.In addition, the illustrations in the book are of very low quality, and not particularly well-chosen.

Pray does just that with lyrics that praise and honor God. I also appreciate the fact that Rebecca St. James' lyrics are simple to remember - after just a few times of hearing her songs, I find myself singing them all day! Be sure not to miss the hidden song \\"Be Thou My Vision\\" on the last track. It is the best version of the best hymn I have heard to date.

It really speaks to me personally that with the Lord I will always feel safe.

Talk, Plus One, and Steven Curtis Chapmin, but not R.S.J."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, Awful, Awful!","review":"This is the singularly most awful Christian music CD I have ever heard in my life. Rebecca St. James's voice sounds pathetic and whiny, and her lyrics are overdone and drab. She sounds like a little kid whining for some candy at the sweetshop. I'm glad that I got this CD as a gift, and didn't waste my hard-earned money on something this stupid. Do you want to hear some real Christian music? Listen to Jennifer Knapp's \\"Kansas,\\" dcTalk's \\"Jesus Freak,\\" and \\"Supernatural,\\" and Point of Grace's \\"Life, Love, and other mysteries.\\" But whatever you do, DON'T BUY THIS CD!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Super-natural!","review":"This album is, stylistically, an interesting departure from her previous album \\"God\\". This is mainly a fusion of rock melodies, pop hooks and programmed drums, which surprisingly complemented each other to give it an energentic, dance-like feel. The album closes with a hymn in \\"Omega\\", building a good contrast.Rebecca is, as usual, sincere and straightforward in her lyrics. This time, she explores on what constitutes a functional relationship with God - thus the title \\"Pray\\". The actions, manifestations and fruits of prayer, servanthood and humility is what this is mainly about.The music is rich and the messages constructive and uplifting. What more can one ask from a Christian album?Hint: Be a doer, not just a hearer.Hint #2: Watch the volume knob carefully, especially if there is a subwoofer nearby :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"Pray features Rebecca's beautiful voice with very uplifting lyrics. I listened to this recently after not having played it for a couple of years. I have ended up listening to it several times since then.There are several songs on it that are very good and none that aren't enjoyable. I particularly like 'Pray' and 'Come Quickly Lord'. If you like Rebecca's music, you should definitely enjoy this. If you are not familiar with her, it is not a bad place to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"She's great","review":"Rebecca St. James is one of artists that I like and love to listen to. She is inspireing and when she sings she sings with authority. Rebecca is remarkable in all her works but pray just takes it to the hieght that all artists look to reach. Ash Renault"},{"rating":"2","title":"No better Christian artist!!","review":"No offense to Michael W. Smith, Steven Curtis Chapman, etc., but the edgy, driving voice and style of Rebecca St. James, especially on this CD is unbeatable. I have literally worn this CD out. No one hit wonder here. There are at least 6 \\"hits\\" that I go back to each time I listen to the CD. As for her style, hers is not simple music. This album was put together with every hook and catch line she and the producer could come up with (for just the opposite, listen to Collective Soul, who could have been an outstanding group who's producing is so shallow and unimaginative that as you hum along, something is \\"just missing\\").If you want an album to play to some non-Christian friends to get them interested in Christian music, this is the one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most incredible CDs I've ever heard","review":"I first heard Rebecca St. James' music about six months ago. I loved her immediately. Pray is an awesome album.Although I love every one of the songs, my favorite is probably \\"Omega\\". It is such a tribute to our Creator. The anointing is so powerful on this song.This is definitely an album I would recommend to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not the best","review":"This album is great overall but more work could have been put into it. Rebecca whines and breathes too heavily when she's singing sometimes, and doesn't sing with all the power she can, but she does have a great voice. Some people may find \\"Hold Me Jesus\\" depressing, too, but all the others songs are great. Rebecca and Tedd T. are very talented at writing, too, the lyrics are very moving. Some of the best songs are \\"Give Myself Away\\", \\"I'll Carry You\\", \\"Mirror\\" and \\"Peace\\", and her remake of originally Keith Green's hit \\"Lord You're Beautiful\\" is really cool. Now, about her voice, not to say there's anything wrong with playing with it, but sometimes she tends to over-do it a little. But still, you should buy this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"This CD was one of RS James best. All the songs were encouraging and had a great tune. Keep it up!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Second to none","review":"I have heard and seen the future of ministry thru music and it is Rebecca St. James. 'Pray' is an excellent follow-up album to her 'God' recording. Although a bit over-produced when compared to 'God', there isn't a bad song in the collection. Her vocals, lyrics and MESSAGE still cut right thru the production.The songs 'Pray,'Give Myself Away','Hold Me Jesus' 'Come Quickly Lord','Peace',and 'Mirror' really hit a soft spot in my heart and soul. But none of the songs are to be overlooked.To compare her to any of her contemporary peers would be unjust. Buy and listen to 'Pray'. You won't regret it. You will also be supporting Rebecca'a ministry by doing so. She really is second to none!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Book in bad shape","review":"I bought this book a while ago.

All of this makes a jazzy CD with slight pieces of ambient or even electronica, I would definitely said that this CD would tie with some Cafe del Mar compilation (minus the upbeats songs), the music here is not intended for the Dance Floor or even to have it in a classy restaurant, this is solely for your listening pleasure, which is not bad but there are better CD's fos that same purpose. (I only liked the track 10 \\"Did I give you much?\\".)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Homer Price","review":"Homer Price by Robert McClosky was a great book.

Unfortunately, Homer Price falls in the latter category. As a kid (40+ years ago) I loved having my mother read this to me. Listening to it on CD recently with my wife and 10-year old son, we had to turn it off midway through. The old-fashioned situations and corny dialog were simply too painful to listen to. I am giving 2 stars, but only because it was once a classic. Not trying to be mean, just honest."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of paper, printing this book","review":"The author wrote such a crummy book that he had to pay to have it published. No doubt it was turned down by any publisher who saw it. A waste of money and time.

Horchow says so, but other sites recommend hand washing. Check out multiple sites for pricing. I've seen them from $39.99 to $85 for a 5 piece place setting."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was very disappointed in this book.","review":"I bought this book hoping to find imaginative games my puppy class students could use in addition to everyday games. Instead I was met by a book that talks about the three most common things everyone plays with their dogs--fetch, tug of war and ball games. The rest of the book deals mostly with variations of these three games along with a small section on agility. I did however like some of the ideas for builting simple obstacles out of everyday items. This is not a book I will recommend to my puppy class."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Great Little Book!","review":"This book may only have about 65 pages, but it's full of color photographs and lots of suggestions for activities for your dog. There are activities for dogs to do by themselves (some of which would be excellent for averting problem behavior) and ways to spend \\"quality time\\" with your dog. Both indoor and outdoor activities are covered, as well as safety tips. This book even gives a good foundation about Agility activities! I was totally delighted. It motivates you to get up and start enjoying your dog. Aside from being a \\"doggie mom\\", I've also raised and bred Golden Retrievers for several years as well as being a dog obedience class instructor and I give this book two paws up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was quite disappointed with the book which focused on things every dog owner should know already (ie. Fetch, tug), etc. Even with the basic fetch and/or tug, there were no instructions given on how they should be done. There was only 1 trick in the book which was to teach the dog to hold a piece of cheese on his nose, then, on your command, throw it up in the air and catch it with his mouth. The instructions given to teach this trick were very simple and even if my dog could figure out what he was SUPPOSED to do with the cheese, I'm not sure he would be able to do it successfully. There are no scenarios given for what to do in case a trick fails. Unless you have no clue what to do with your dog this book is not useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best sets","review":"Thanks for the speedy wonderful service! One of the best collections available for all the Vicente Fernandez fans of the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"A letdown","review":"I rushed to pick this up after seeing the movie, loving every second, and was happy to see the entire film being a one volume comic adaptation instead of a 4 part mini-series or something. After getting past the awesome cover, replicating the film's poster, I was happily surprised to see the art style being that of film-image duplication for the majority of the book. These panels were lifted right from the movie, which itself is rare with adaptations of this sort. However, some panels were overly scratchy and rough, the art style intended of course, but regardless it left a lot to be desired, especially in the slapdash way the final 20 minutes of the film were compressed to a page and a half in the comic.Overall I'm still happy to have it, and I smile whenever I see the book, its just that I likely won't be reading it again for a very long time thanks to the artwork, which is a shame what with the adaptation being spot on with the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not universal.","review":"The page claims that the mount is universal for flat-panel televisions within the size/weight range.

The anthologies on truth and action do not have much new material. This anthology has some excellent previously published articles on self-knowledge/epistemology and rationality, which has become necessary reading on these respective topics.Also, look out for new stuff in Vol. 4 and 5 in this series.I also recommend Stroud's work on Davidson, which can be found in both of his recent collections (Oxford UP)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Subjective, Intersubjective, Objective","review":"In this work Davidson explores various issues surrounding knowledge and epistemology. This work is progressive beginning with essays that deal with knowledge of one's self, moving to knowledge of other people, and then moving to knowledge of an external world. Through his triangulation thesis, Davidson shuts the doors on various types of epistemic skepticism, specifically, knowledge of one's own mental states, knowledge of other minds, and knowledge of the external world. While Davidson is by no means an easy author to read, his arguments are insightful, and his contributions to modern analytic philosophy are undeniable.

Sadly, there is not enough real content to help a beginner learn to ride. Most offensively, Mary English defines the things you need to do/have if you are going to mountain bike, including stretching and the all important need for a chiropractor (ehem, given that English herself is a chiropractor, this is nothing more than a shameless plug; what a disgrace).

It was my opinion that this book is not so great. Whenever the author couldn't explain something he easily dismissed it. Basically, religion is made by man for man. Religion is believing in what someone else is telling you to believe. When someone in the modern world claims to speak with God, everyone thinks he/she is crazy, yet millions are so willing and gullible to believe it really happened in the distant past when man was more primitive and easily confused natural events for those of the supernatural.

I was happy to see he agreed with what I believe, as i was raised protestant, but always prayed to G-D alone, and felt jewish. I AM Jewish, just haven't learned all I need or officially converted yet.Rabbi Blech uses great wit and anecdotes throughout with his \\"schmoozing\\" notes and \\"Let there be light\\" notes and boxes throughout.

Its sort of... not to be rude ... a lot of fluff in the book. Like how many times to you need to tell me that sex is kosher? Like i get it already.Furthermore, the book kind of glosses over talk of the afterlife, and prayer, but spends extensive time talking about the Oral Law that accompanies the torah, sects of Judaism, and the sabbath.

However, it's unfortunate that the vocabulary often upstages the content or the attempt to convey meaningful content. The writing style could have been more clear.

I felt I had to re-read many sentences and paragraphs and de-code what the author meant, sometimes unsuccessfully.

The men in the shooting party are highly competitive, exact count is kept of how many birds are shot and by whom, a practice which ultimately leads to tragedy. By the end of the weekend, many lives are transformed forever. This is underscored by the ending which denotes who goes off to war and what happens to them.This is a wonderful movie, so well acted.

Without the deep fall colors and contrasts of the original, \\"The Shooting Party's\\" minor flaws, its sentimentality and heavy symbolism, take over.

That's especially noticeable on \\"Will the Circle Be Unbroken\\".But that does not impact the value of this set. It gives a complete picture of The Band and their history.

And, as a member of that choir, I contend that the book alone is worth the price. Also, the few live performances provided on the DVD were a most welcome surprise, as all of them were worthy performances showing the Band at the height of their powers.But, regarding the unreleased musical material, sadly, I don't feel that any of it is essential, as the best of it has already been included on the remastered original albums.So the attic has proved to be bare. No matter. Truely this box set is one of the finest you'll see.

I'm very traditional; I like to know the grammar. My book is more like a primer that can be use with another grammar book.One thing I had a serious problem with in this book is Kaufmann's definition of the word \\"linguist.\\" A linguist is not anybody who can speak two or more languages. That's the old definition of \\"linguist.\\" A person who speaks two or more languages is called a \\"polyglot.\\" A linguist is a person who studies the science and mechanics of language (gerund, past participle, phonetics, morphology, etc.).

It takes approximately 6 minutes for any job to reach the printer, and an additional 3 minutes for multiple pages to print. Don't even bother to attempt the manual tray. You have to manually hold the paper till the printer decides to grab it, then wait another 6 minutes for it to print.Once there is a jam - which happens often, or any sort of disruption with the print job, you have to turn the printer off for a few minutes to clear the memory, and send it again. If not, the error light will continue to flash even after the problem (jam, replenish paper etc.) has been resolved.

Its a really good Thriller, like most vampire movies. I think the only vampire movie that would even come close to horror would be Bram Strokers Dracula.

It has great performances from Jason Patric and Keifer Sutherland and Corey Haim and Corey Feldman are together again for more eighties teenage high jinx.

The menu has no 'play button'. That's right. No 'play movie' option. You can only 'select a scene' (which requires 2 clicks in order to actually start the movie from the beginning). Lame. And, the special features are nothing more than trivia 'readers'. Basically, the lamest kind of special features to have. Needless-to-say, I was very disappointed.

I think it is really a movie about the corruption of character that may or may not happen to you during your vulnerable adolescent years. The Jason Patric character, despite his \\"cool\\" attitude or perhaps because of it, is easily turned by the head teenage vampire, brilliantly played by Kiefer Sutherland. The somewhat geeky younger brother, interestingly enough, is impregnable. It is as if Corey Haim's character is protected by his relationship with Nanook, his ever present pet dog, whose instinctive generosity gives him a real sense of humanity that cannot be swayed by teenage peer pressure.So, the moral of the story is: if you want your children to be safe from vampires, be good to your dog!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blu Ray Review","review":"This is a 5 star movie for me overall, but the Blu Ray is a major disappointment. I'm noticing a clear trend with WB on their recent BR releases - they're a very minor and insubstantial improvement over the original standard def DVD that certainly does not merit the upgrade. This one is no different, and disappointingly so. The Lost Boys is an absolute classic of vampire cinema, and deserves much more than Warner Bros did to release this Blu Ray.

Don't get me wrong, this is a good movie, and I really enjoyed it. The acting isn't top notch, and it was made a while ago so neither are the effects, but it is still a fun little movie. It is a nice alternative to to the gore filled vampire movies that are so prevalent.

Still holds up well after all these year.What I also like about this movie is, though it is fairly gory in some scenes (vampire death scenes and a little on the beach party), it does not rely upon gore to the degree that more recent vampire movies do. Instead, it mostly relies on the story it is telling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guilty Pleasure","review":"Reading these reviews, it's clear that \\"The Lost Boys\\" has some irresistable magic going for it; I've loved it ever since I saw it in the theater when it came out. The '80's trappings are at least authentic, as the film was made in 1986 when the splashy colors of Corey Haim's shirts were actually chic (believe it, kiddies, I was there).But what really makes it work, I think, is the care the writer (or writers) took to get the details of vampire mythology - the \\"hellhound\\", the importance of inviting the vampire into the home - right even as they re-shaped it to fit the contemporary setting. The twists all work, and the ending is just brilliant (\\"..all the damn vampires\\"). It's a solidly entertaining and engaging horror film, possibly deserving a place in a \\"top ten\\" of the genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thou Shall Not Fear","review":"Lost Boys... being one of my favorite movies of all time, I love the cast, the plot and even the bad clich's.

Sutherland does a fantastic job as the lead bad guy (with a momentary lapse with a tear for what he is...)Jason Patric is a troubled Jim Morrison doppleganger, and the two Corys are, honestly, hysterical as they try to save Santa Clara.

What is it with the vampire theme that impels Hollywood to crank out mostly second rate films on the subject decade after decade, ad nauseum?! I'm sure it has something to do with the short attention span and reduced expectations of America's youth culture today (including the 80's). For some bizarre reason, vampires sell.

Each chapter is a tangent to the company's journey to IPO day. Some are more relevant than others. Furthermore, the author has a style of switching persons while telling the story, which makes for confusing reading a times.However, the book does provide good insight into detailed trials a company faces during its IPO route.

He doesn't pull punches as to who he blames for the loss of firefighters that day. Lack of adequate equipment, department cuts, etc. I think to a certain extent he has a valid point, but I also know that there were many other factors involved as well. Mr. Picciotto's focus is understandably on his personal experience and his emotions around what happened that day. I am glad that I read it, but I have to be honest and say it is what it is. Mr. Picciotto will probably not win a Pulitzer, but he calls it as he sees it and he was there and I wasn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Half Good/Half Bad","review":"I just recently read the paperback version of this book. The first half of this book is pretty interesting and heart pounding in detailing what it was like to be in the World Trade Center while it collapsed. The second half was very disatisfying. It was very self-serving and is mostly about Mr. Picciotto praising himself and his actions and criticizing absolutely everyone else. I also find it interesting that Mr. Picciotto said how hard it was for him to return to the site and that it took him a very long time do this. However, in the acknowledgment at the end of the book, he returns barely a few weeks after the collapse and with his collaborator of this book.

Seems the department had suffered some severe cutbacks, so the only tool belts most of the men have are made from seat belts taken from old cars. Their communications system doesn't work so well either, which surely would have saved more firemen on 9/11. I can't believe the city of New York lets this go on after 9/11.The book is fast-paced and well written. It reads more like Picciotto is talking to you than writing about what happened. I don't think he's patting himself on the back, as some reviewers have said, just giving us the facts.

The author sets himself up as the one-and-only hero in his world of self-centeredness. We can certainly admire anyone who went through the events that he did, but this type of storytelling tends to diminish the whole thing. I find it very hard to believe the truth of much of his perspective.

If you want to read a book that has a story line that goes something like this \\"me, me, me, I'm great, I'm in great shape, I'm the Chief, me, me , me\\" then buy this book. It should first be renamed to \\"First Man Down - One mans account of himself\\". With any common sense you can see that Picciotto abandoned his post and his men on a number of occasions that day. Yet he still tries to turn it all around so that he can achieve some kind of Super Man status, while belittling the bravery and hard work of other fire fighters (especially those of lesser rank).

Not being aggresive? Not being good firefighters? This chief \\"saved\\" the whole company! I wonder what the men from Ladder 6 have to say. I have been a firefighter for 26 years.

Not because of the selfish and auto-congrulatory mode, but due to the literally (or lack of) characteristcis of the book. I think it's badly written, even with Mr. Paisner at the helm.As for Picciotto actions those days, only people under that kind of stresssful situation could know how they would have acted... Generally, I think he did the best he could for his city and for his companions and for the civilians he encountered.For all his detractors, I put the question: if he had died along with the shocking number of victims, even with all his \\"faults\\" he would have benn considered a hero, ego or no ego involved.

Anyone that saw the Naudet video or read Dennis Smith's book could plainly see that Father Judge died just off the lobby of Tower One at the bottom of an escalator.

He is someone used to being in charge. Though rough, his style communicates honest emotion and no \\"poetic license\\". At many points I found myself looking for more guidance from his contributor, Daniel Pisner. Finally I realized that it is just not the style of Richard Picciotto to be edited. He is a person used to defining the world from his own perspective since this is the vantage point most familiar to him. This is the kind of person he is and I imagine has always been. \\"Last Man Down,\\" gives an insiders view of the collapse of WTC I. Picciotto's graphic descriptions of the raw terror of the moment the tower came down are riviting. The book does leave the reader wanting more though.

If so we could have had one speaker for each instrument and then have the chance to \\"miss\\" Koopman and left Savall alone. That wouldn't be the sonatas, but at least it would have been pleasent music."},{"rating":"2","title":"playing with intensity","review":"Live at the Village gate is a tremendous album, one that deserves a listen. Once you get it, I suggest quickly skipping to #4, Afro Blue, not because the preceding tracks lack merit, but because Afro Blue is almost perfect. Sun Ra once said somethign like, \\"Whenever you play, play with intensity.\\" Well, here it is. This track is the definition of intense. Listen to the rhythm section and their polyrhythms, layering 3, 4 and 5 time all over each other. Oye Como Va is a fun track, but once Milestones is heard, watch out. The Latin Jazz All-Stars earn their title with this track. This is a great album, one filled with fire and a cohesion of purpose that is often found to be lacking in many group efforts."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Tito's best.

I've had this card for about four years now, and while it occasionally says that the \\"card could not be read, please put in a new card, etc.\\" when I first boot up PSO, the only inconvenience it's really given me is that I have to pull it, and then out and put it back in.I've never had any major corruption problems in the last four years, and I've used my Gamecube (and this card in particular) at least four times a week, for several hours a day. As always, do more research on this product before you buy it, but I'm just letting you know that not all people get faulty cards (or perhaps, have faulty Gamecubes)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This is an amazing film.

After this first experience I had the chance to watch other four Cirque du Soleil performances, but none of them was as exciting as Dralion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dralion","review":"Very disappointing. Does not come near La Nouba, Alegria, Quidam, Varekai, or even Corteo. The main problems are very poor picture quality and VERY poor lighting. Many of the sets are so dark it is impossible to see detail."},{"rating":"2","title":"The juggler and the clowns","review":"This production as a whole did not hold my attention as much as it could have. I feel that the camera angles and the editing could be improved. Nevertheless, Cirque du Soleil is as always incredibly creative as demonstrated in the special features section of the DVD. The overall tone of \\"Dralion\\" is a little darker punctuated by some suberb individual acts that do indeed light up the audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best!!","review":"This CdS is captivating regardless of your age. My little boy loves this DVD and watches it over and over. The performances are spectacular and is a must for you CdS video collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"electrifying show/crappy filming","review":"I went to see this show live, and then got the DVD. Even on the screen, it was unbelievably stunning. However, in a few parts of the show, the filming was choppy, fuzzy, and unfocused on the right things. It seems like the filming crew handed a camcorder to an audience member and said, \\"Hey, would ya shoot the next two acts for us? We need a coffee break.\\" So that detracted from those acts quite a bit. I would have given it 5 stars otherwise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Cirque du Soleil.","review":"My family saw this show in person and it was fantastic. So of course I had to have a DVD of it. I have seen 3 of their shows so far and have never been disappointed. This product was delivered on time and in perfect shape."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY disappointed!","review":"The performance was terrific, but the editing and camera work were TERRIBLE. There were countless times when at the most exciting moment of a stunt, the camera would cut away and show the audience. I also think they spent too much time with the camera on the singers. Don't get me wrong - the singers were great and added a lot to the music, but by filming them, they missed some of the stunts. A couple months after I saw the video, I saw Dralion live and it was amazing. It was hard to believe it was even the same show. Whoever allowed this video to be released should be ashamed. It is not at all representative of the wonderful work Cirque du Soleil produces."},{"rating":"1","title":"disapointed","review":"My order came in a short time.

Since the price has gone completely over the roof, I wouldnt even think of going again. That old Cliche \\"there are no bad seats in the house\\" don't belive it. You absolutely don't want to be up front in any of the Cirque performances... Now back to DRALION. I found it boringbeyond words, too much juggling and the singer seemed to be the main attraction always dressed in exotic over the top gowns and a voice that sound like the wrasping of the birds in the movie \\"Pysco\\". she should have just not be in the performance at all.

It looked and felt like nothing but recycled acts from prior shows thrown together with a few new twists, new costumes and music.The only truly shining moments of this tour were the clowns who were superb and it is a real shame that their fabulously funny numbers were the only highlight of the show the 6-8 of us saw that day.Yes as compared with the average circus it is stil superior to anything else out there but compared to its predecessors it just simply doesn't stack up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moods Holiday Edition","review":"If you like the \\"Moods\\" series of recordings, you will also enjoy this Holiday selection from the series, it is light, soft, and up tempo when you want it to be.

Hell I was thinking \\"why ???\\". But after one episode I was hooked, even if the first couple of episodes are pretty much just remakes of episodes from the first season, only shorter and done a little different. Being an half hour shorter those episodes actually work as well as the original ones they are based off of.While the original episodes are about as solid. I'd recommend renting the Supernatural Anime Series before buying it though, just to see if it's for you.

I had to force myself to watch the whole anime series. Most of the episodes are regurgitated story-lines from season one and two of the live action series, except for the ones that deal with Japanese mythos. My love for the original show made me watch the entire anime. I don't recommended it, try to just watch the Japanese mythology ones. I feel that my time has been wasted by watching it, I don't know what I would have done if i had bought it. I had expected it to be episodes that could go in-between the first season's, other hunting tales that Kripke couldn't fit in. Instead approximately only 2 episodes are original plots."},{"rating":"1","title":"were is dean","review":"i feel this wAS A WAST WITHOUT JENSEN IN IT. WHY DIDNT HE DO THE DEAN PART.

I had to stop watching it after they brought out Bobby.I wish they would give it a second shot; come up with different story lines, remain true to the characters, and please, please back off on the cheese Anime stuff, it's only cute on Pokemon.

I found Minna to be pretty annoying, some of the comments she makes are truly innane and instead of focusing on the pose, I find myself wondering what the heck she meant by the comment. She sounds stilted and unnatural, like she had a script to memorize and is simply reading it. After doing a pose, she'll say - I know this is hard, its hard for me, too; and she sounds so artificial. The final annoying piece is the other people doing the workout - they have bright, fake smiles on their faces throughout the workout. No one I know actually grins through a tough workout.

Luckily the store also had the Moving Comfort Maia which I tested and then purchased as it performed well. This was 2 yrs ago and I still run in it, though I think it is time for a new one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try something else","review":"I purchased this because of the amazing reviews for how supportive this bra is for large busted women. I am a runner and just can't quite find enough support. This wasn't it either. The fabric felt like it didn't breathe and just wearing it around my apartment felt it was too restrictive around my ribcage to breathe deeply. For $60 it should have some sort of adjustment around the ribcage. And I am not that large around...I wear a 38D normally. For the $$ I would try something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good support","review":"Very comfortable, with good support for the active woman with a larger bust. Very well made with high quality materials. True to size."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it.","review":"This very comfortable to wear during a workout.

I sent it back and shopped locally instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"way too big for 34d","review":"by measurements/sizing charts etc I ordered the size that should have fit 34D - it was way too big up front - I returned it and got myself 34D moving comfort Maya instead. Much better fit for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Order","review":"Please save your time and money and don't order this sports bra. I have researched sports bras and tried many sports bras. After the research, I had to try Enell. Everyone was positive about it. I did read several comments about the thick seam across the breast, but I ignored the comments and ordered the bra. I was so excited to receive the bra in the mail, but after putting on the sports bra, I was extremely disappointed. The bra is supportive and holds you in place but you cannot wear the bra to the gym under a t-shirt. It looks awful with a thick seam over your breast and it is impossible to hide. So, I returned the bra. Trust me, don't waste your money!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally Secure!","review":"This is the sixth Enell sports bra I have purchased and I can honestly say this bra has changed my life! As a large-busted professional doing active work, I was never able to find a sports bra that fit correctly. The enell gives me the support and \\"containment\\" that I need to do my work more confidently. I originally bought this bra just for work, but found it so awesome, that I ended up wearing it everyday. No more constantly pulling up straps or readjusting the band. My clothes fit better, and I don't feel like I am always in danger of \\"falling out.\\" I also have had a huge improvement of headaches and back pain since wearing this bra. I now feel this bra is something I can't live without. Make sure you follow the size charts, as sizing can be a little difficult at first, but once you find the right size it is well worth the extra effort. I don't mind that it costs a little more, because of the awesome comfort and support, and superb quality that lasts a long time. Thank you Enell!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sports Bra","review":"This is the best sports bra ever invented for those of us who have fuller figures. It is comfortable and very stable and secure.

That being said i am loving this bra- I do feel like an astronaut and feel like i am hooking about 40 little clasps (exaggeration) but LOVE the support and feel of it. I also find it very easy to put on and amazingly accessible since i am nursing;0) Well I have nothing but GOOD to say about it!! I will definitely buy this one again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally worth the $$","review":"This sports bra is amazing.I'm a nursing mother who is trying to get back into shape.

I would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, a sports bra that works","review":"I started running, and I've been looking for a sport bra that actually works for people like me who do not have a runner's body.

She also showcased many of her other albums, which prompted me to buy this one. It explores some avenues of creativity and maturity in life and being a song writer. People will probably either like or dislike the changes in style. However, Bonnie Raitt is a performer and worth trying some of the audio samples if unsure whether you want to buy it or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"OK, I guess after 30+ years of generally spectacular music diamonds, everyone is entitled to plunk down a lump of coal. That's just what this CD is..a dull clunky lump of coal.I've been listening to Bonnie for most of those 30+ years. I still have Streetlights and Home Plate on vinyl. For the past many years, I didn't even listen to her new music before purchasing. I just bought em! There were always bound to be a couple \\"popular\\" hits and more than a couple undiscovered diamonds on in the tracks. Not so for this CD. I Will Not be Broken is acceptable...the rest of the tracks sound almost off key and in some places, even out of tune with herself.Bonnie is still one of my all time favorite singers - but I wish I would have saved my $$ and not blindly purchased this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"my least favorite Bonnie Raitt CD to date","review":"Just saw Bonnie in concert here a couple of weeks ago, and bought this CD there. Had I heard it first, I wouldn't have bothered. She said more than once in the concert that she is going to have Maia Sharp write a lot more tunes for her. If so, I won't be buying a lot of her CDs in the future, as two of Ms. Sharp's songs on here are just noise. I've never owned a Bonnie Raitt CD before where I run over to the CD player and hit \\"skip track\\" more than once like I do this one. I am really disappointed in this one - - it's not up to par with everything else she's done. Bonnie was fabulous in concert, however, and her voice is a musical instrument."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay with the older style","review":"I've always been a Raitt fan since the '70s. Gave this new one a try and was very disappointed. The style seems to jump around and is not the sound she's known for. All you need to hear of this one is the free samples. Don't suggest you buy this one if you really like the songs she's built her rep on."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I'm a Bonnie Raitt fan...loved her music for years. I bought this CD because I liked the 1st cut, I will not be broken. Unfortunately, I should've down-loaded just that song, because the rest of the CD is bad!! That's it. There's not another song on that CD I want to listen to. I wasted my money...and I can't believe it!!

But will they actually ever get it together? With many mix-ups, misconceptions, ill communication and much deception; it's hard to say up until the end of the novel.

Characters are totally relatable I hope to find more of her books soon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A slew of characters but a great ending","review":"The narrator's 'voice' isn't quite as snarky as the author's first book. There are more characters to keep track of in this book, which makes it difficult to remember who/what it is talking about at times. The story focuses more on other characters' dramas than the main character, Harriet. Like the first book, lack of self-confidence and paranoia feature prominently, and most of the drama stems from these plus a lack of communication. However, I found the ending of this book much more satisfying than \\"Asking for Trouble\\". If you enjoyed that book at all, you will enjoy \\"A Promising Man\\" too."},{"rating":"2","title":"quite good!","review":"okay, i'll admit i've never understood the \\"lingerie-on-the-cover\\" scheme on both of young's books, but despite them the books are wonderful and different and refreshingly fun. after reading \\"asking for trouble\\" i didn't hesitate picking up \\"a promising man.\\" i find young's heroines extremely witty, sure-footed and independent, which is a breath of fresh air from the insecurity of bridget jonesque characters (even though i do love bridget!). young is hilarious in her delivery; the dialogue is the kind that makes you burst out laughing for no good reason and i found myself finishing the book in one sitting then wishing i hadn't gone through it so quickly. definitely recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun!","review":"Elizabeth Young has a great way with dialog. You almost need a player card to keep track of everyone in the beginning, but this book is well worth the time spent sorting everyone out. Witty and fast paced, Ms. Young keeps you guessing--usually incorrectly--right up until the ending pages. This isn't deep dark drama, it's a fun romp through romance!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun!","review":"This book has a fabulous ending! And just when you think the book is coming to an end... there's still more to go! Which I love. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun to read","review":"I enjoy books that take you away to someone else's crazy life. With all the stress in my life I enjoyed the funny wit and humor. You know with chick lit that this is not going to be a serious drama, just a fun read. I have read all her books and think she has gotten better with each book. I love that she ties her British history into her books, although I don't always get the slang, but I enjoy it. I wish she was still alive to give us more of her work."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasant book","review":"If you like British \\"chick lit\\", you'll like this one.

I've recommended this book to friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"A treasure trove of archeological information","review":"Have just watched \\"The Bible Unearthed \\" for the second time and know that I will watch it again and again. This DVD (and book) is a treasure trove of new research and scholarship in the field of Biblical archeology.

A real eye-opener and brain-opener."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"The Bible Slammed\\" would be more acurate .....","review":"I didn't know and the cover doesn't say whether the DVD was going to endorse the Bible or present it contrary to its own testimony,\\"inspired of God\\" 2 Tim.3:16. The first 52 minutes \\"argues\\" there is no archaeological evidence of camels, Philistines during Abraham's time and no evidence of Abraham ever being in Ur, so therefore the Bible is wrong on those issues. (I guess there is nothing left for archaeologists to find, they found it all!) \\"Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.\\" They also say Abraham, Isaac and Jacob were never father, son and grandson with no proof and contrary to archaeological finds! Go figure! Just more Bible-predicted degrading of God's word."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Written, Full of Cliches","review":"I couldn't get past the first two books in this set. The first seemed really dumb and contrived...we knew what was going to happen, the characters seemed flat, and it didn't really keep my attention.

On my initial reading I thought it heavily favored the daughter's point of view. Since rereading it recently I found it ofers a fairness I hadn't seen before, and some profound insights into the value the book offers. Examples: \\"The best advice you can give yourself is yours.\\" \\"May you have the joy of following your own advice.\\" And particularly the thought that if after reading the book we can see the way we can change, we are in a powerful position. On the contrary, if we think in terms of underling sections just to point out to the other how wrong she is, then we've lost that power. I appreciated the fact the book did not tell us to run out for a therapy session. We have the power and the potential within ourselves to change and to compromise for the sake of a wonderful daughter/mother relationship."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mothers And Daughters Making It Work","review":"I enjoyed this book in that it covered many aspects of what women go through as a daughter and as a mother in trying to find one's own separate identity for both the mother and the daughter.

There was no plot, and when you think you have a chance of figuring out what is going on, the end comes, and you have no idea of what just happened. Christian Bale is normally a good actor, but in this movie he is a really bad over-actor. The only reason this is getting 2 stars instead of 1 are the visuals. Aside from the plot and the acting, the film is the definition of surreal. When else are you going to see a nail gun pointed at the back of a woman's head or a prostitute being chased by a naked guy with a chainsaw. That's about all the movie is about, folks. If your feel like wasting time and money, rent (or buy) it, but I'd just wait for cable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good, seen it before","review":"The premise seems forced and overdone, the \\"twist\\" was predictable, and no real social commentary was achieved.

I would recommend rewatching other movies rather than going to this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"American Psycho - OVERKILL","review":"'American Psycho' is about a man who thinks his 'mask of sanity is about to slip'. He has a tendency to go crazy and kill guests at his home. He uses chainsaws, axes, knives. Lots of unpleasent things to make sure his innocent victims stay DEAD. You don't see him killing anyone. Just the dead bodies, but that is not the point.With such talented actress's like Reese Witherspoon and Samantha Mathis, it is extreamely disappointing to find that they are totally wasted in this movie. They deserve a lot better. They are not even in the sex scenes, that aren't even very good. Hopefully with such small parts, people will forget that these two women are in this shocking movie and not hire it.This movie should have stayed as a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moving beyond adaptation","review":"While I agree that Harron and Turner's adaptation of Ellis' dialogue and themes is masterful, the subsequent presentation borders on the mundane. The writing duo trim the 399 page novel down to a workable film length, but then add certain mindnumbing and distracting scenes which cripple the pacing of the film. In particular, the chainsaw sequence becomes a lengthy chase scene reminiscent of a film student aping Brian Depalma aping Hitchcock. Derivative scenes such as that not only mar the film's pacing, but move the film from dark satirical comedy to ludicrous farce. Maybe Harron was a better choice than Oliver Stone or those pushing for a ultra-violent version, but better is relative and should not be confused with excellence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christian Bale is Phenomenal!","review":"Although the movie is overall dark in subject matter, it's a must-see-movie thanks to Christian Bale. The character he plays is hellacious, but Christian is heavenly. Not only does he look so beautiful from head to toe, but his acting skills far surpass most others. And luckily, for people like me who don't like gruesome material, the director cuts away from the violence taking place in the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good movie, bad DVD","review":"As much as I love the film, American Psycho, I can't help but feel cheated by this \\"Uncut Killer Collector's Editoin.\\" There is only one minute, and I'm not exaggeration, of extra \\"uncut\\" footage. Not only that, but the footage is almost unnoticable. The only decent attributes of the DVD itself are the new deleted scenes, however there are only four. The rest of the speical features were junk, a TV special on the 80s, which I didn't care for, and a reading of an essay by some Blonde chic. Huge sell out if you ask me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just wonderfully sharp!","review":"I loved this movie so much. I thought that the acting was really good.

The second American Psyco is pretty hilarious too... good good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christian Bale, We Want More!!!","review":"American Psycho is a great movie, full of colour and tone. Although the violence is rather severe in some scenes, it's brushed off as nonchalant business by the yuppie, male-model, capitalist, bourgeoisie \\"pyscho\\", played devilishly by Christian Bale!

If it was supposed to be \\"disturbing and dark,\\" the director needs to get over himself. David Lynch films, which are highly criticized at Amazon, are dark and disturbing. This looks like something a hormonal 14 year old would put together. The acting was terrible, except for the one shining moment of Reese Witherspoon's portrayal of Evelyn. Oh, and for the comment on those \\"people that expected it to be like SCREAM or something\\"-- I despise Scream and those teeny bopper movies and this movie did NOTHING for me. It seems as if it were some sort of \\"message movie\\" to warn against the dangers of capitalism. The soundtrack was pretty good, but the problem is the best songs are not on the soundtrack. Do yourself a favor, do not waste your money or time watching this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the Book","review":"After first reading the amazing book, I was looking forward to seeing the movie and was drastically disappointed. Rather than weening out the best parts of the book to tighten up the story into a feature length film, the movie seemed like a random summary of the book, rather than a story in itself. The acting was wonderful and a few points captured the emotions and tone of the book, but it is nothing in comparison. If you want to experience the desired effect of this story of 80's greed and yuppiness, then skip the movie and read the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Entertainment-Free Movie For Most","review":"What would the world be like if the stereotypes of the 80's Wall Street Yuppie were extrapolated to the extreme? The shallowest characters ever seen, bantering endlessly about restaurant reservations and business card printing. The emptiness leading a man to psychotic fantasies about inhuman slayings, thus the destination of 80's materialism. As a documentary of a characterization of a stereotype of the 80's, the movie succeeds, and that is its only attraction. If you love bashing 80's materialism and yuppies, you may get gut satisfaction out of this movie and use it to reinforce your world-view. Otherwise, it is detached from reality, it has no plot, the characters are deliberately ultra-shallow, and it is not entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the... ???","review":"This was the worst movie I have seen since \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\". I'm sorry..I just did not get it. Maybe the horrible acting distracted me from the integral plot points, if there were any...."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time...","review":"Sorry, but I have to agree with a previous reviewer who noted the \\"sterileness\\" of this movie. The author portrayed his role in such a cold, unfeeling way that I couldn't get into the movie. And I don't mean the kind of \\"coldness\\" that a crazy killer is presumed to feel. I just mean the acting itself didn't raise any emotions out of me other than embarrassment that I was watching it. The movie appeared to be just a way to get some \\"hacking and slashing\\" on the screen under the guise of a \\"good\\" movie. It fell short for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"goodmovie","review":"what a movie.This movie, though not for any softies out there, kicks ass. Christian Bale proves in this movie that he is not just a handsome meathead, he is a true talent. He is so slimey and believable in this his character still creeps me out when I think of it. What a statement on US culture too. I need to read this book. Bale character is funny, sadistic, and witty. however, im still confused about the ending (fake, real)?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A stylish, disturbing thriller -- worth the ride!","review":"Excellent bizarre film, reminded me a little of a mix of How to Get Ahead in Advertising (classic British film), with Psycho, and even Wall Street. Having come of age in the '80s, much of the dialog of the post-modern era hits home. It's wacky, and over the top, but leaves you wondering if any of the events actually happen outside the main character's twisted mind... (much like \\"...Advertising\\"). He knows he's nuts, he's taking pills to fight it, but he envisions chopping people up because they have cooler business cards. Tour de force acting, including Willam Defoe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Preconceptions at the door, please","review":"American Psycho, in its literary form, is a difficult read, as it comes off as pure graphic exploitation. The violence is so strong that many readers were blinded to the sporadic humour of the piece, often laugh out loud funny. Happily, the film takes all the redeeming qualities of the novel and builds on them, creating another beast entirely. The film plays as a black comedy, not horror. There is a little bloodshed for the Fangoria hounds here, but most of the violence is off screen, left to the dark pits of imagination. Christian Bale gives a career making performance, making Patrick Bateman a ridiculous blend of Casey Casem and any masked axe wielding killer you could think of. But most importantly the film acts as a satirical look at the cultural emptiness of the eighties, and the emptiness of Bateman. Don't be afraid! This is a great film just waiting to be discovered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somehow A Nice Try But&#65533;","review":"I know. I shouldn't have gone to watch the film based on my favourite novel anyway. But I did. Out of curiosity. Wanted to see how bad it got, how much they'd ruined this great great piece of literature.In a way I'm surprised, positively. 'Cause the film has some good ideas, some good parts. Like the visualization of Patrick Bateman's apartment, or his anger caused by pure jealousy and unfulfilledness.But all in all, it is not a very good film. The story is reduced to nearly nothing. Some unnecessary (and very poorly done) stuff, like the killing of some policemen, is added which is very annoying to the whole concept. And although Christian Bale starts out well and is well-chosen for the role, he somehow gets too nervous in the long run.If you have read Bret Easton Ellis' superb novel, then don't go see the film. They couldn't have put it to the big screen anyway - but they did try."},{"rating":"1","title":"I actually paid to watch this?","review":"Here is the plot in a nutshell: Bateman kills a lot of people. The End (Really).Maybe I just don't get it, but I TRULY thought this movie was bad. No, not just bad.....appallingly dreadful really. It's supposed to be a satire, but I just can't see the humor in watching a naked man chase a prostitute with a chainsaw. The scenes of gratuitous sex and violence are kind of extreme, and the message is trite: Bateman lives a life of material excess and thus is numb to ordinary pleasures, forcing him to find his only source of fulfillment in murder. You watch the film, hoping, praying even that there is actually a point here, but sadly, the ending just leaves you even more confused. I feel like such an idiot for watching this movie; I want my money back......."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, guess you had to be there...........","review":"Maybe the book made sense or something but this movie, although some of the dialogue was good in some areas, otherwise sucked really REALLY bad. I mean, I love the good \\"chop em up\\" movies as much as anyone (and believe me, i have taken a lot of criticism for liking even some of the worst), but this movie will leave you totally wishing you had your rental money back or even worse, the money you paid to buy it with. Just mediocre acting, not a whole lot of scary murder activity and an ending that will leave you totally lost."},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst movie of the year!","review":"this film is garbage. poor acting, even worse dialogue, and for fans to even compare it to Fight Club or Natural Born Killers is an absolute disgrace. having a script with zero substance and no compelling characters must have been a real pleasure for the director to work with. along with Virgin Suicides, this would rank as my least favorite DVD rental in the past 12 months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bale at his best","review":"American Psycho is a compendium of serial killers staring Christian Bale. I believe it's his best work and he's amazing at pulling off a decent into madness in a narcissistic corporate world. This slash and chop movie is so classy that it is levels above the other slasher genre. Bale is known mostly for his Batman role but his acting in this movie blew me away. If you like murder in an Armani suit there is no better then this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"As social satire, this one's a killer!","review":"Bret Easton Ellis' novel was a creepy, frightening portrait of self-aware yet detached evil. The movie version of \\"American Psycho\\", on the other hand, is a cleverly drawn social satire, choosing black comedy over graphic violence to make its point. The movie is closer in spirit to the similar Jules Feiffer-scripted 1971 classic \\"Little Murders\\" than say, \\"Friday the 13th, Part VII\\". The core subject matter is so dark and despairing that the occasional laugh-out-loud scenes are quite welcome when they occur.Christian Bale does an admirable job portraying Charles Manson as a Yuppie. Those who think Bale is too \\"pretty\\" and smart to play a serial killer should remember that Ted Bundy was considered an attractive,charming and intelligent person in casual social situations! Obviously not for all tastes, but a winner for those who enjoy a twist on the norm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"I tried, I really did. In the end, I watched most of this in fast-forward, hoping that something just a few minutes later into the movie would redeem it. Heck, not even the soundtrack redeemed it, and I love 80s pop. The was-it-real-or-imagined aspect was rather neat, but the characters were just too weak. It's hard to make a movie work when none of the characters has any more depth than a shedded snakeskin and you just can't care if they live or die.I know the characters are supposed to be shallow (they are, after all, 80s stockbrokers - Hollywood's ultimate soulless weasel stereotype), but they lack even that much depth. It's almost possible to generate some sympathy for the prostitute or the secretary - almost. In the end you just can't care. Live? Die? Whatever - just get to the bloody point already.In the end, you'll feel exactly what the main character feels -- nothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"Great movie!

If you've read the book and really enjoy it, stay away from the flick. Several key events are omitted, the acting is poor, and the movie does not draw the audience in like the book does. The movie is corny and not believable.Pretending I have not read the book, I would still give the movie 2-3 stars, for the lack of good acting or pacing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Haven't we been here before?","review":"Well here we go with some originality. A \\"comedy\\", or is it a satire, about the Eighties. In my opinion it's merely an excuse for bloodletting and Christian Bale to strip down all the time. I found it's intellectual content to be shallow, acting to be marginial, and it's moralistic overtone to be questionable. First of all why does it require death and violence to be a satire on America in the Eighties and second of all since when has multiple homicides been humorous? Looking over the reviews I'm not sure what I found to be worse. the fact that so many talk about the laughs that broke out during the murders or the folks who go on and on about the Eighties soundtrack and clothes. Perhaps the real statement about the American way of life should be the lack of reaction that this movies didn't invoke from people. I dare say we aren't so far removed from the Romans as we may think."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT for anyone under 21; as an adult it still haunts me...most disturbing movie I have ever seen!","review":"This is the most disturbing movie I have ever seen.

There is \\"ringing\\" and dirt in this transfer and I think given the limited number of Bluray titles out there, they ought to make a more concerted effort at keeping the quality higher than this. I guess I was expecting more, and reading the faint praise of the other two reviews, I see it's not just me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blu-Ray Review","review":"Note: This is not a review of the movie. American Psycho is a 5 star film. The Blu-Ray edition deserves no stars. It appears that the Blu-Ray edition is a direct transfer of the DVD. The picture is very ugly complete with artifacts and a flat picture throughout the film. The sound was good, but it's most likely the same sound available on the DVD. The special features include a commentary from the director, a separate commentary from the co-writer, deleted scenes, a mini-doc titled \\"The 80s: Downtown\\" (which has little to do with the movie, very much a space filler) and trailers of other Lions Gate movies. This is not a true high definition version of American Psycho -- perhaps ranked amongst the worst Blu-Ray discs."},{"rating":"2","title":"American Psycho","review":"American Psycho is the type of movie that is only for certain tastes. You like it or hate it. It's a good movie but it wasn't as good as I expected. It relied on sex too much in certain scenes to drag out the running time. Most of the sex scenes weren't necessary for the plot.Christian Bale plays Pat Bateman, a well-to-do exec with a dangerous nighttime actvity... he likes to kill people.The film is not as gory as one would expect given the title, but that doesn't mean it's bloodless (because it's far from that). The film does give off some black humor including a scene in which Bale tries to feed a cat into an ATM machine.Over all it's a real good movie. It's too bad it has too much sex or else I would've given it five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"the final word on the Reagan Era, Trickle down , and the rest of the lies we were fed","review":"At first I was put off by the violence, but came to realize this movie is probably the best commentary on the 1980's era and the attitudes of the 1%ers since then. Bale's performance is stellar as he embodies the benumbed mindset of the Masters of the Universe that Tom Wolfe wrote about in \\"Bonfire of the Vanities\\". The Bateman attitude towards others continues to this day by those in power and those that stand in the shadows behind them. Bateman's violent rampage, his crack up and recovery when he realizes nothing will happen to him and he won't be punished is Vulture Cannibalistic Capitalism writ large. This movie is not for the faint of heart or squeamish, but it is an unflinching look at our values as a country and culture, and where we'd rather not look."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite movies","review":"I rented this recently on Netflix, and immediately came to Amazon to purchase it.

It's so humourously evil in the same sense as Fargo, where what's going on in the scene makes you squirm and chuckle deviously at the same time.For those with a warped sense of humour or even those who just enjoy an amazing movie with superb acting, I recommend this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Grey humor and creepy stuff","review":"I say grey because the movie is too goofy in so many parts to call it dark. If you like to laugh at stuff that the average whiner refers to as horrible, this movie is great. The acting is great on all parts. \\"Bateman\\" will really convince you he is nuts, and all of the other characters do a great job of playing [exagerated]corny yuppies that take themselves seriously. It's as if the director knew it was a joke but the actors didn't.For all of the humor and rediculous eighties characteristics, it gets a little creepy at the end if you pay attention. There are a few different angles to psychotic behavior you could gather, all of them at odds with popular attitudes. If you don't get into all that, it's still a fun movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"In defense of American Psycho","review":"This film was marketed completely wrong. Watch any of the trailers, and they make it out to be another one of those slasher movies. But it's so much more. It keeps the essence, and wit, and sarcasm of the book, while adding a level of elegance and sophistication that was completely unexpected. Add the absolutely flawless (not a term I would ever use lightly) performance of Christian Bale, and you have a near perfect picture.Sure, it's different from the book, and cuts a lot of great stuff out. But when you watch a movie, you have to realize that it's a form of art and entertainment all it's own. You need to disconnect the book and the film, the two separate art forms, and enjoy it for what it is: Brilliant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"All the comments on the blu-ray transfer are correct. I rented this movie 2 years ago and was blown away by the pristine pq. Lionsgate really messed up bad with this which doesn't surprise me.

Christian Bale's acting is occasionally interesting but the character of Patrick Batemen fails to gel.The oft-cited satire is played in a ham-fisted manner and comes off more as the usual propaganda from the usual suspects then anything revealing or entertaining.I felt the movie was overrated first, because of all the talk of violence when the film was released, and secondly because all the glowing user reviews.Since so many people do seem to like it, I would rate it a rent before deciding to own. This has been a review of the unrated version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, very wierd","review":"American Psycho is an awesome movie, no matter what anyone may say. It is hard to understand, and the plot is all twisted up, but still a good movie. I still don't understand the ending of it, but the movie is still worth watching and trying to understand anyway.

It just goes on and on, and about halfway through it stops making sense. Hollywood physics runs rampant through this movie. As well, it has the bumbling Hollywood police who apparently never do anything right except die as quickly as possible. Beyond that, the main character just drones on and on about bad 80's music. To put it simply, its not even remotely scary, it does NOT make you think about anything except why am I watching this, and the only people who would laugh at this are complete idiots. You should want better. Thank you"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I consider good.","review":"I just watched this movie over the weekend and I have to say I didn't like it.

The entire movie was predictable- and the fact that it was all in his head wasn't a very good \\"twist\\" at all. Besides Christian Bale, every other actor and actress was very annoying in this movie. In the end he goes on a killing spree that is more hilarious and over the top than shocking and horrifying like this movie wants you to think it is.I think this movie could have been made much, much better- the killing scenes could have been more violent- the sexual scene in there I thought was totally unnecessary, the girls weren't even pretty. Although I do have to say the sex scene does get the point across how sadistic and disgusting Bale's character really is- and that is what basically is the only good thing about this movie- Christian's character and the way he plays it.

One has to be better than the next, and higher up is where they all strive to be.Who has better looking, more expensive business cards for one example.It's about how money rules who these young men really are in the corporate world. One is so infatuated with himself that he actually gets crazy about it and starts to kill.He kills one acquaintance of his who he really doesn't know, and takes him for another person. Of course Jared Leto is a very nose in the air kind of personality as his friends all are, and gets killed in this movie to, and he is actually the first murder victim.His place is also where Christian's character goes to lure in his victims and where he also hides them.This movie is very good if you like suspense thrillers.

Bale is excellent at depicting a character who has become so shallow and empty that he rebels in his American Psycho way. Scenes like Bateman in the shower and his morning prep routine and the business card comparisons are hysterical in the way the point out some of the absurdities and foolishness of this era. Bale is so slick and so wired in his extremes in behaviour and his voice over dialogues are performed to perfection. It is so subversively witty - that the social aspects of this time come across as almost more scary than the violence. Were we that bad? Other performances are great here too: dafoe, mathis, leto, and Chloe Sevigny who is the only one who can actually steal her scenes away from Bale.

It was not what I expected. I normally like movies that make you think and are not main stream, but this movie sent chills up my spine. Patrick was a pig, plain and simple. He was a self centered, egotistical man who cared nothing of the people around him. I believe he lived in a dark fantasy world dreaming up that he killed all these people without anyone noticing.

This movie was obviouly thrown togather to attract a simple minded gore lover. The story line is very basic and the end is a rediculous faust of a film ending. Its as if the director knew that this movie was going to be bad so he just quit it allDo Not Buy This ... It is Terrible"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting movie ruined by Cliche ending","review":"The movie started out very interestingly and though graphically violent it kept me interested throughout. Then the ending just ruined the entire film.... so cliche I wanted to ask for my money back. What a waste of a great idea exploring the excess culture of the 80's. I had not read the book so possibly it was better handled and explained in it, but if you have not read the book, the film ending is flat-footed and deeply unsatisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has anyone read american pyscho?","review":"It's not that bad for a movie that was obvisously only finaced because some fat hollywood producer was hunting for more copies of a 'gen X' black comedy fight club clone, satirical? sure it was meant to be the 1980's but we have progressed, the movie is naive of it stupidity. Christian Bale is perhaps the most tragic figure here, having altered his face and body so dramatically to play a role that spits him out onto the screen and makes him look like a tragic copy of Tom Cruise. If you see the film and you hate it, read the book, no print to screen translation can be worse than this, seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really didn't understand it","review":"I got this movie for a friend for chirstmas and she loved the movie.

If I wanted a Social message or a Message about Greed and the 1980's I'd pick up a Rag like the NyTimes or The Nation or some other Rag,The movie is over rated not only because of it's so-called description of the 80's(Wall Street-Another \\"80's\\" movie) but also due to it's lack of it making any sense,as much as Abstract Art Can be called \\"Art\\" I am sure others will disagree with me And call the Movie \\"Brilliant\\" and Factual. I say it's Just another so-called \\"Smart\\" movie where they were too lazy to write a Ending,but I guess it is hip not to make sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just bloody awful","review":"I tried, I really did. I expected to enjoy this movie, even just a little. In the end, I watched most of this in fast-forward, hoping that something just a few minutes later into the movie would redeem it. Heck, not even the soundtrack helped, and I love 80s pop. Don't bother hitting \\"pause\\" when you go to the bathroom - you won't miss anything. The was-it-real-or-imagined aspect was rather neat, but the characters were just too weak. It's hard to make a movie work when none of the characters has any more depth than a shedded snakeskin and you just can't care if they live or die. Yea, I know the characters are supposed to be shallow (they are, after all, 80s stockbrokers - Hollywood's ultimate soulless weasel stereotype), but they lack even that much depth. They're wet-paper thin. It's almost possible to generate some sympathy for the prostitute or the secretary - almost. In the end the apathy wins and it doesn't even matter that it's only a movie. Who cares?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubbish","review":"Very simplistic and cliche \\"ooooh, he's so evil\\" screenplay, and Bale gives yet another stiff performance, with the same frown and pursed lips as in every other film he's done.

I waited with anticipation to see this movie... I wanted, I really really wanted to like it, and it just sucked.

GEE! zzzzzzzzzzzz...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Without the Drill","review":"I recently watched this movie and must say I was terribly disappointed. Christian Bale did a good job, but he was failed by the script and the direction. I can't compare it to the book, because I have not read the book. If it was attempting satire it misfired. This was essentially a cross between the classic \\"Psycho\\" and a David Mamet play. The voice-over narration was intrusive, an almost \\"Wonder Years\\" gone dark. If it was attempting to discourse about the boundaries of sanity and insanity, this was already better handled In Roman Polanski's movie \\"Repulsion,\\" with Catherine Deneuve. The idea that preppies of the eighties were a shallow lot, and that some people in power may not be altogether sane is not exactly a news flash. In fact, the latter can be found in \\"Das Kabinett Des Doktor Caligari.\\"Worst of all the movie was just plain boring. Hollow with cold surfaces."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sick little yuppie.","review":"American Psycho starring Christian Bale is just pure garbage! This film tries so hard to be edgy, provocative, and clever but the director fails to achieve any kind of dark humor. Reese Witherspoon plays against type and even though Bale is a talented actor, I just feel this role doesn't do anything for him. There are some graphic and grotesque images in American Psycho, not for the faint of heart. I just couldn't stand this movie, pretty ordinary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible movie, but like seeing Christian Bale nude","review":"This movie was such a disapointment. I thought it was going to be so voilent but it wasent. Only 2 murder scenes. There was more sex scences than murder scenes. The murder scenes didnt even show anything. In a later scene they show dead bodies all over the house but it never showed him killing them.Christian Bale is naked alot in this movie. Which was the only reason to watch this movie. His acting as a psycho was scary though. The ending made no sense. It was like he fantasized the whole thing. Confusing. Horrible movie, big let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rent it - if you want to see an awful movie","review":"Let's just say that I wish I could rate this movie less than 1 star. It was the worst movie that I have ever seen, and I have seen some pretty bad movies in my time. American Psycho was actually painful to watch; I think I would prefer someone to tie me down and rip off my fingernails one at a time than watch this movie again if given the choice. The social commentary was valid but demonstrated in such an in-your-face-yet-trying-to-be-subtle-and-smart way that it completely lost any respect that it may have deserved. Christian Bale did a fine job portraying Patrick Bateman but he could not make up for the horrible dialogue, storyline, producing and everything else involved. I only recommend this movie to people who wish to see one of the worst movies to come out of Hollywood in a very long time. If you want to watch a good (sorry, great)movie with approximately the same commentary, buy American Beauty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Luckily","review":"the movie skirts around the really nasty issues found in the book.

Christian Bale captures the character of Pat Bateman so well its remarkable. If you say this movie is bad it's because you don't understand it. Really get an indepth look in the movie if you combine it with some of nature's finest."},{"rating":"2","title":"From a Teenager","review":"this movie is much more than a story about murders and sex. its a reflection of how our society refuses to realize warning signs. many times patrick bateman (christian bale), main characher, tells his \\"friends\\" and his \\"fiance\\" that he is crazy one time blattenly telling another man, \\"i like to dissect girls, did i tell you im utterly insane.\\" in the book he carries around a cardboard sign sayin mass murderer. no one notices. hes invisible to people and they are so self absorbed they dont realize what hes tryin to tell them. i dont know if this is a great review but i do know that this is a great movie/book that should only be viewed by people who are willing to see past the sex and gore. yes i agree it is pretty apparent but its what you dont see that and what you realize that makes this movie great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intriguing Yet Distubing at the Same Time","review":"Christian Bale stars in this adaption of Bret Easton Ellis' story of the same name. The main purpose of this movie was to tell the tale of a ruthless serial killer that looked like an average guy. It takes place during the 80's and just as in the book, the movie focuses on greed. Money is an object that means nothing but can get you everything that you desire. Drugs, clubbing, eating expensive food, and keeping yourself looking good. All of these are the items that mean everything to the main character. What was disturbing about this film was the killing. It was done with a satire feel, which in itself was interesting and original, but was odd and made you think twice about what you were watching. Bale does a fabulous job with the role, playing a serial killer/business man to the \\"T\\". It was a good movie, you just have to keep an open mind while watching it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed","review":"The film is disjointed as it relies heavily on a previously gained knowledge of the novel. Bateman is not properly introduced and the film succumbs heavily to the afore mentioned fault. Despite this, if you have read the book, then the film is interesting to watch due to the images you may have created in your head and how they differ to those generated by Harron in the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"WILDLY SHARP SATIRE! ONE OF BALE'S BEST!","review":"I had never seen this movie before now and I must say it took me completely by surprise. Bale gives another winning performance in this dark satire about 80's yuppie life. The film is totally engrossing in the first three quarters, but does seem like a bit of a let down in the end. For that reason I give it a 4 star rating.

Extremely under-rated, it's a must have for fans of Randy Newman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Randy at play","review":"I have always found this album to be as playful in its nature as Mr. Newman has ever gotten. His self-parody on the cover says it all. And no particular strata of society is picked on. It's almost as if he's written songs about what he saw in the paper one morning. Spies, gay truckers, English rock bands, sheepish men, exhibitionists, silly rich people, a man telling about the women in his life, etc. Just random stuff. When you listen the songs compliment each other so well that the cd ends well before you are ready. As ever, the sound and musicianship is top notch. \\"Half a man\\" makes me smile every time I hear it. The picture he paints in my mind is truly hilarious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent backpack with hidden features","review":"when I first saw the price of this pack I was a lil disgruntled but I bit the Bullet and bought it anyways.

Not only does it have compartments for everything but it has some hidden extras that some of those who bought this bag may not be aware of. the waist straps can tuck in to the lil side pockets kind of like a hole that was not stitched there all the way. The other hidden gem is the chest strap has a lil whistle that can be used if your lost in the woods and people are trying to find you.

This is the first song I've ever heard her sing and she is incredible! I visited her website after hearing this song on the CD and I read her biography and am really impressed by her commitment and Christian values.

I'm sure you have to be a German to get a true feel for the context (Berlin and East Germany).

Simon is a moderate, kind, sensitive and artistic man and seeing the horla destroy both his life and reputation is really touching. His love for the doomed Odette wins the audiences heart and when the horla goes after her it's a shock. There's not a whole lot of gore in this movie.

They seem to have such fun playing together. The program is a mix of originals, Brazillian pieces, Manuel de Falla's Canciones Populares Espanolas, and the famous adagio from Rodrigo's Concierto de Aranjuez, on which Larry Coryell, two-thirds of the way through the piece, plays a skittering improvised steel-string guitar solo that ices the musical cake.

I'd like to think that a man today can appreciate a woman who is both feminine and his equal, perhaps even be attracted to her because she is in some ways better than he. This book was a response to the early days of the women's movement. But we're past that now and know we don't have to choose between being an individual and being feminine. If you want to know what fascinates Mr Andelin or what fascinated men of the 1960's, read this book. If you want to fascinate your husband, talk to him.

I like a lady that could fix her own car but also want to be the one that does. I do feel like protecting and providing.

They actually like stronger, career minded women and look down upon the \\"little, helpless acting housewife.\\"They appreciate a woman who can bring some money into the household and relieve them of the stress of all that responsiblity. It also costs a lot more to live now than in the 60s too. Having a helpless acting woman gets really old and it makes the woman look really stupid when she ventures out into the real world, yet acts and looks like a helpless child.

Everything from the patronizing manner it was written to the incredulous reinterpetation of Tolstoy's marriage - I felt frustrated reading this book in part due to the author writing as if her audience was ten years old.One of the biggest issues my grandmother faced after my grandfathers death was that she had no idea how to take care of herself. Maybe some men would like the traditional wife, but if he dies or leaves then the woman is completely vulnerable. I think it is naive and arrogant to not learn how to be an independent woman, especially in this day and age. It is a travesty that there are still women who still read this and believe that in order to be loved, they must show how weak they are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing and inaccurate...","review":"This book is truly sick. The author uses scare tactics in order to make women crumble. Her stories are not even accurate! My favorite is the one about the marriage of Leo and Sofia Tolstoy (her name was actually Sonya). She whips up this tale about how Tolstoy found Jesus Christ and wanted to follow Christian teachings by giving all his wealth away. Mean, nasty \\"Sofia\\" rebelled against his rightful manly leadership because she liked wealth and sin. In the end, the Countess begged for his love, but he hated her. This is made up drivel! Tolstoy was brilliant and, as is often the case, VERY difficult to live with. He embraced first one ideal, and then another...creating a life of insecurity for his wife and the many children they had together. She was loyal to the end, however.

It is sexist to a point of blatent disrespect to both the woman and man in her idealogy of marriage.If you are following Author's crazy, emotionally regressive advice,you are not in a happy marriage, you are living a lie.This perspective is not about truth, it is about control and inequality and if you agree with this perspective, I honestly believe you either need serious therapy or should be blatently ashamed for ignoring your true identity as a person...I was shocked and saddened to learn that woman are still actively subjecting themselves to slavery in 2007."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great guide on how to treat your man","review":"Although quite a bit of this is very old fashioned and somewhat religiously based the theory behind it all is actually really good, as I'm not religious I tend to just giggle at the references to the bible and ignore them, instead I just take in the advice and have been putting the relevant parts into practice which has seemed to really work and made my relationship a lot more relaxed and happy.

It's so quaint and poorly thought-out, it can't be taken seriously. I've spent hours with friends reading passages and rolling on the floor with laughter. A great gag gift for birthdays, wedding showers, etc.!Two, as an anthropological artifact. The customs and beliefs described herein are fascinating. Intelligent and educated people in 1999 put about as much credence in these ideas as they do in the idea that the earth is flat, but it's interesting to consider that there are those out there who think this way. And it does lead to important questions, like why is the author is so full of self-loathing and why is she is intent on squashing the talents and ambitions of other women.Third, those who have heard that the Mormon church is antifeminist and misogynist will find ample support in this book (the author is Mormon).Aside from these, the book is worthless.

The racism is throughout the book it is very obvious this is intended for upper class white women, and there are direct racist remarks. I found the advice that wives should be \\"childlike\\" to be very disturbing. Any man who takes to this is looking more for the child than the wife. I think the author thinks that adult humans are quite stupid and need to lie and manipulate each other in order to have a good marriage.If you are married in an honest and loving relationship with your husband and he likes you for your intelligence and maturity then this is not the book for you. This book is not about feminism or feminity it is a book that advocates an unequal union and manipulation as a way to get what you want.

I am even more appalled at the writer's suggestions of how to handle an abusive husband. In my opinion, the writer implies that it is the fault of the wife when the husband is being abusive. This is 100 steps backward for educating women about domestic violence. The writer should be ashamed of what she has written. She should be more ashamed that she represents her ideas as Christian.

The man who believes he is in control because these women pretned to allow him to be, or the women who think they are actually in control (at the good graces of the man) yet gives her power to the illusion of being in control?

It is cloaked in a dirty robe of religion. God never asked us to manipulate people to get what we want. To act childish to get a man to love you is to have a man who never grew up himself. This writer is dysfunctional and so are the men she writes about.I was raised on this book by my Christian school. It did more damage to me than I can say in this short review. The big keys are obedience & submission. Both are not godly end all be all qualities. Sometimes the godly thing is to stand up to your man and defend your child or someone else.

Were there drive by shootings? The women who attack the author based on her religion have never picked up a bible and actually read it. In all truth, this book is simply stating God's instruction, regardless of religion, of women's role in society. We are supporters, peace-keepers, and nuturers.

Yes, say nice things to your man and let him know you admire him. After all, you like HIM to do the same for you. HOWEVER, the BAD advice is to assume men want to financially support a woman! Ask ANY man, and he'll tell you he wants a woman who can and will WORK outside the home and do her part to bring in money. Sadly, she gives women bad advice by telling them to REFUSE to work.

Jackie has made good music in the past as his Apple output shows...but this stuff is slick white R&B with lots of horns and girl singers to boot. It's not the progressive rock Badger at all...it's a funked up Jackie Lomax R&B fest in disguise."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Alchemy Reader","review":"This book offers an introduction to alchemy through the words of some of the art's most notable authorities, and because the number of works is enormous, few readers will perhaps be satisfied with all the readings. Invariably, questions of inclusion (or exclusion) will arise that even the ablest defense may not justify. For example, the brief selections of Plato and Aristotle are included, not because they deal with alchemy per se - although many spurious treatises came to be fathered upon both philosophers - but because they set forth important background ideas (e.g., on prime matter, the transformation of the elements, and the formation of metals) that were long-lived and exerted considerable influence on subsequent alchemical theory.See also Linden'sMystical Metal of Gold: Essays on Alchemy And Renaissance Culture (Ams Studies in the Renaissance)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creative Labs Sound Blaster Live!

After waiting for it to get better, I thought I'd warn others there's little humor and like most movies, the characters aren't very deep. Are there any redeeming aspects? Nope, no car chases, nor any chase scenes to cut to, no gratuitous sex, the violence isn't satisfying, and I didn't care enough about the characters to finish it.

This is dark comedy at its best. I think everyone at some point feels like a 'Veronica' surrounded by 'Heathers'.

Little does she know that her growing relationship with him will prove to be fatal, for her soul, and for the lives of those around her.This is one of my favorite black comedies, ever. The acting is excellent, as well as the sharp dialogue. Though not all high schools are made up of kids this cut-throat, it is still a good portrayal of teen angst taken to the extreme. Years later, Jawbreaker was made in an attempt to recapture the brilliance of Heathers. It was a formidable task, and Jawbreaker couldn't compare. In fact, it was hardly even worth watching. Watch this 1989 classic instead.Some may find the movie offensive. But honestly, it's a great satire."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Is this as good for you as it is for me?\\"","review":"Probably. I'm beginning to love Winona Ryder now because of this movie. It talks a whole lot about suicide with high schoolers and homosexuals and comedy all in one.

The dialogue is wonderful, the extreme actions are riotous, and the acting is superb. This is my favorite Winona Ryder movie, and it still gives me much respect for the abilities of Christian Slater. The abilities of these two actors really make up for the fact that Shannon Doughrty is in the film. The cinematography is excellent, the set designs are believeable, and the whole movie is so terrific that it puts all current films to shame. The realistic design of the sets only adds to the extraordinary circumstances it profiles.

When I first saw it I couldn't help laughing, the second time, thrird time, fourth time... the same and even more.I knew this movie because I'm a fan of Shannen Doherty. She doesn't have the most important part but a good one and she's quite funny, just like in the first season of BH90210. So if you're a fan of her, buy it because it's her major film for the big screen.The story is quite good.

Quite simply, it's money. It's much, much cheaper to simply re-release a film with a proven track record than to gamble on the initial DVD release of an (albeit wonderful) 13 year-old film like 'Angus'.Studios will never halt their process of releasing a title 2x,3x,4x,5x, etc., due to money. Ever heard of Sam Raimi's first film 'The Evil Dead'? How many releases has it had so far on DVD? I think the last count was 666 (???) A classic teen flick such as 'Heathers' has a fan base of which a certain percentage will buy **every edition* ever issued on DVD.

I always figured the IRS threatened to audit the owners or something, but who knows?The ending of the movie turned out to be eerily similar to later events in Waco, TX.Anyway, it's a great, family-oriented movie.

Each of the sixteen tracks zip by with a surefire mix of pop sweetness and sassy lyrics backed by a great band and even better production.

He was an Austrian Jew who immigrated to Belgium and joined the resistance in the late 1930s. He was captured in 1943 and tortured in Auschwitz, but survived to make the experience the subject of his greatest work, published in English as \\"At the Mind's Limits.\\" After the war he moved permanently to Belgium and discarded his German name (Hans Mayer), replacing it with the French-sounding anagram under which his subsequent works were published. Like so many survivors of Nazi torture, he ended his own life. The essays in this collection are not profound in the same way as his Auschwitz book, but they describe the workings of a brilliant mind confronting a universal experience. They are worthy of our highest respect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grim and somewhat disappointing","review":"This book is a compilation of several radio lectures that the German- or Austrian-born author (the name is a pseudonym) delivered over French radio in, if memory serves, the 1950s.

My parents were kids in that time, but where they lived (Northwest DC), I don't think they were affected like others. Or at least, they haven't told me anything.What happened to these girls as well as Emmit Tille disturbs me beyond control. I got a library book about him, and I could not get past the page where they described his condition after his death.

Yesterday while shopping at Other Music in NYC I did just that. I noticed Cinerama in there (import) and figured it was probably just out of place and had nothing to do with my favorite band but then I checked the back of the CD and noticed that all songs were written by none other than David Gedge! The band is basically Gedge and Sally Murrell with an assortment of additional players including Marty Wilson-Piper of The Church. It sounds essentially like some of The Wedding Present's latest (mellower) stuff. I've listened to it 4 times today and have grown quite fond of it already. My favorite is Hate (track #3) which is a beautiful song with very funny lyrics (\\"Almost everything about you makes me wish that we'd never met...\\") Same is true of Maniac (track #1) Great stuff.

But not for the main character in Blacker the Berry, Emma Lou. She is very black in a family that is not that black.BtB is about her struggle against color prejudice from the white world in the 20s but also within the black world. She tries fighting this but trying to be more white and also by bleaching her skin to appear more white, but mostly to no avail.This beautiful and somewhat sad story is great to read more about colorism and/or color consciousness. the irony in the book is great. Watch out for a Rent Party and a man called Truman Walter, I think this is Thurman Wallace speaking.great read, one of the better in African American Literature"},{"rating":"2","title":"Engrossing and Provocative!","review":"It is a real shame this book is a \\"lost\\" classic. The characters in this book are so real I feel I might see them walking down the street.The only flaw I can spot in Thurman's book is an over reliance on exposition. I understand he probably wished to keep the story moving and he had a lot of ground to cover, but this story just screamed for more conversation between the characters. Besides, Thurman, also a playwright, is a master at conversation.If you are reading this, then you obviously have some sort of interest in the theme. If that's true, you owe it to yourself to read this book. I read it over a 24-hour span. I bought it for my fiance, but when I opened the box and read the first few pages, I was hooked. I told my fiance that she would have to wait until I finished it before she could get it. Luckily, it was so engrossing, I finished it the next day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, could not put it down","review":"Thruman's The Blacker The Berry was an outstanding piece of work. His vocabulary was exquisite. Emma Lou evoked sorry, shame, and anger in me all at once because I refused to accept her as the \\"underdog\\" and her constantly looking for the \\"right sort of people\\" to make her feel whole and accepted. I did feel empathy for her because she longed to be truly loved but did not recognize that the ultimate love comes from within and the sooner she accepted herself as a worthy human being she would forever be dissappointed in her relations with others. The book had a lot of passion and for a brief moment I thought Emma Lou was going to suffer a major depressive episode or commit suicide because she seemed so hopeless. The ending was unexpected and it left me wanting Emma Lou to say more."},{"rating":"2","title":"CD: Ars Subtilior, Dawn of the Renaissance","review":"Excellent music and performance.

Overall, these rock!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Corn Holders!","review":"These holders are awesome. I really like that they lock together. The peg holes go all the way through so that when washing, all of the corn gunk gets out of them. Once dry, they fit nicely together and don't take up a lot of space in the drawer.

I don't know how we ever ate corn on the cob without these nice, big and sturdy corn holders! You can really get a good grip on these and chow down! When I think back to all the years we used those 'cute' little yellow corn holders, I don't know how we managed without these.I also love the fact that you can place them in the silverware tray in the dishwasher because they aren't going anywhere.

I recommend getting a bunch of them so you are ready for picnics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nicely engineered -- chuck the old corn holders","review":"This set of cornholders definitely beats the old style in the shape of corn holders that I previously had. First, each pair fits into each other so you can safely put these away and also take care of fears of hygiene and rust. Second, they are are way bigger than the original corn holders so you get a real good grip. The only corn holders that give you a better grip would be OXO's but those sometimes with all the butter and BBQ sauce can have a slight rubber smell. These holders are hard plastic with steel prongs.To make these holders more effective you will want to trim the ends of the corn's ear, but you would have to do that anyhow for the older versions so that' not too bad.Overall, worth the money just for the easier storage and cleaning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading Title","review":"These songs/artists are no more the godfathers of grunge than I am the King of England.

There is not a word of truth in any of these books. They are composed of nothing but gossip and urban legend.

Any middle-eastern person, or person who has first hand knowledge of middle-eastern weddings (Muslim or Christian) knows exactly what I mean.

However, this author is capitalizing on the West's ignorance of Muslims and Arabs and our customs. In addition to entertaining her audience with these fabrications she claims to be true, she does one other very harmful and hurtful thing: Spread misinformation and perpetuate stereotypes about Muslims and Arabs. She makes a habit of misquoting the Quran in \\"Princess. This book and its predecessor \\"Princess\\" are tragic examples of how one person can perpetuate their racism and play on other people's ignorance in an effort to make money. It serves as a good example of on person's blatant disregard for responsibility in writing and for accurate portrayals of the people she claims to shed light on.

However, I was sorely disappointed. What a shame that such an important and riveting subject such as the hidden lives and sufferings of women in other cultures is treated in such a childish and vapid manner! Granted, Princess Sultana is a real person who is recounting her story, but that does not necessarily imply that this story should be presented as one of maturity and triumph. The final insult to women's suffering all over the world is Princess Sultana's post-mortem adulation of Princess Diana and her humane work.

She travels in private jets to different countries, spends $328,000.00 at a time at Bergdorf Goodman's in New York, and sucumms to alcholism.

In this edition of the Mary Frances Book, the pictures of individual stitches are quite small, and I'm not sure that anybody could learn these classic stitches from this book alone.The book seems to be a re-issue for those who simply want to re-experience earlier readings of it - it does *not* fulfil the purpose that the original did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid","review":"This paperback black and white edition is horrible!

In fact, it seems to illuminate their flaws. Maybe my settings aren't right, but I see a lot of grain and I'm not getting the almost glass like quality I see on some HDTV broadcasts of older material. It makes me suspicious that they're not remastering these in HD, but simply throwing them onto the Blu-Ray format without proper restoration. I did a comparison and watched some cartoons from my Looney Tunes Golden Collections and they looked as good, and sometimes better, than my Blu-Ray Mouse Chronicles.That being said, I love finally having the Sniffles cartoons I've wanted all these years, and I love the Hubie and Berty cartoons as well. Thank you.

This action-packed military movie stars Wesley Snipes and Emma Samms. Both of these actors do an ok job with what they are given to work with. Like another reviewer said, let us be thankful they did not try for any flashbacks to tell back-story in this film.The story line has the U.S.A. being tricked into targeting a fully functional nuclear reactor that was captured by Chechen rebels. And as we watch the missile being launched that will cause massive chaos for the region, if not the world, the Special Ops team led by Snipes figures out a way to stop the disaster from happening in an all to convenient and simple way.

This one was SO bad that I couldn't turn it off ... it was like watching a train wreck. The editing was horrible. I've seen better stuff on YouTube. Actors would be in one position, then a moment later, they'd be in a completely different position.The story-line had HUGE gaps in it, and spent time introducing events that had little/no relevance to the overall plot. And then there was some allusion to some romance between Snipes' and Emma Sams' characters that made absolutely no sense.Worst of all, if I was an Army Ranger, I would sue this production company. This movie made the Rangers look little better than Keystone cops. I actually laughed out loud at two lines which I'm quite sure were not intended to be funny.

This story (bad guys in a foreign country get close to atomic capabilities that would threaten the world until one turnaround soldier man saves the day and the globe) has been told so many times that the audience can sing along. The use of a lot of night shooting is obviously well considered as there isn't much to see anyway.What happened to the Wesley Snipes who used to make really interesting films? Obviously the producers felt his star power could drive this dud as the remainder of the cast is unknown (though many seem to be really fine actors without the benefit of a script).Thought about not wasting time reviewing this film, but then on the other hand, if enough people speak out about the bad movies that just keep coming down the pike, perhaps the studios and theaters will begin to pay attention.

Or bad idea? Maybe the other actors needed to get work badly. But Snipes had no excuse. He fell three notches on this one. Go back to being a vampire.

It used to be the best back in the 80's and 90's, but now the publisher tries to make it a mix of some type of MMA rag and Soldier Of Fortune. The combination doesn't work and leaves out the core reader: traditional martial artists. The MMA puff pieces are a joke. Combine that with the fact that the \\"magazine\\" consists of about 90% ads and 10% articles, and it's only a matter of time before BB goes the way of General Motors. According to Kenpo karate legend Al Tracy, Black Belt magazine circulation is only about 1/5th of what it was 10 years ago.

Since reading this book, which caused me to do some serious research in Catholicism, I have come within one doctrine of converting to this historic faith. That doctrine is indulgences.

I thoroughly enjoyed this book; however, it wasn't just an \\"easy read\\". I found myself checking references, scriptural and otherwise. I had to \\"work\\" my my through it, but the journey was well worth the effort. I would especially recommend this book to anyone interested in why Roman Catholics believe what they do as juxtaposed with \\"Fundamentalist dogma\\". The next time a \\"good\\" Catholic is verbally assaulted by a well-meaning Fundamentalist, he/she will wish they had read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most highly recommended!","review":"Karl Keating has become THE Catholic apologist of the last decade, maybe of the last quarter of this century, and if you read this book you'll know why. Keating's style is direct, accurate and highly readable. He knows his facts, and cites references to support them, including many from the Bible. His responses to the Fundamentalist positions are powerful, but always done in a charitable manner. Anyone who isn't convinced of the truth by this excellent resource has already made up his mind and doesn't want to be \\"confused by the facts\\". This should be required reading for every Catholic high school level religion program. It would also be excellent material for RCIA (the program for adults who are joining the Catholic Church). I highly recommend it for all Catholics and anyone who wishes to learn more about the Biblical and rational basis of the Catholic Faith."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Have","review":"This is a must have book for Protestant or Catholic. Karl Keating is Blunt and to the point, the reviews on the back cover just barely scratch the surface. Every budding christian apologist should read."},{"rating":"2","title":"a bit dated, but still the best antitdote to fundamentalism","review":"Karl Keating's book is a handy reference for anyone who has come away from a conversation with a Fundamentalist absolutely frustrated. All of the chapters are coincise and describe a particular ministry (like Mission To Catholics), a particular doctrine or devotion (i.e. Marian dogmas, Infant Baptism) or the sourcebook that most Fundamentalists draw some of their more venomous charges from (Lorraine Boettner's \\"Roman Catholicism\\", who I found out after reading the book, lived about 10 miles from where I went to college).Some of the groups Keating covers have faded into obscurity, however others have taken up the mantle left by the Boettner's and the Brewer's of the world. While some at least try to interact with the Church Fathers and Catholic beliefs that aren't horribly caricatured. They all inevitably fall back on many of the arguments that have been ably refuted in this handly little book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible and dishonest.","review":"If you enjoy strawmen then by all means order this book. Either Mr Keating forgot to do his homework or he is just a dishonest man. I was hard pressed to find any accurate representation of a Reformed belief.

The first thing I read is \\"....quasi-Christians like the Mormons and Jehova's witnesses..\\" Oh, great, here this guy is defending his church from the viscious attacks on it by anti-Catholic hate books, then he does the same thing to other religions that he is defending Catholocism against. No wonder the rest of the world hates Christianity. They never learn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of Keating's Views","review":"I think this book is an excellent source for learning what the Roman Church is all about. Whether you're looking to become Catholic, or you are studying the faults and failures (as I am) this book at the very least makes it very clear what the Church teaches. Keating has a terrible 'bed-side manner' but his arguments represent the best of the true conflict between the two ever-opposing faiths. He is extremely knowledgable, articulate, goes for the jugular so to speak, and is a great apologist. Many Catholics depend on this book for support of their faith, and for the antagonist such as myself, you need to treat this book seriously. He is a force to be reckoned with, in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely well written and great for beginning apologetics","review":"This book is a great book for the beginning apologist or any Catholic who wishes to see answers to fundamentalist charges against the Church.

However, when someone comes up to me and hands me anti-catholic literature it angers me. Mostly because it is so full of lies. I don't believe any of those things they say I believe in. So naturally, books such as this in our defense are inevitalbe and greatly needed. It was a great starting point for me and I am anxious to read some of the many suggestions he offered at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for the budding apologist!","review":"This is a great book for any Catholic who has been handed an anti-Catholic tract or, worse has a friend or relative who's been bamboozled by one. You know the type -- 10, 20, 30 verses from sacred Scripture taken out of context plus some claims about what the Church teaches that are at best inaccurate and at worst, well, strange. (One of the amazing things about the World Wide Web is that you don't have to go far to find this kind of stuff. Sigh.)Karl Keating gives some helpful background information on some of the main groups pushing this stuff. More importantly, he demonstrates where their arguments go wrong: the parts of Scripture that they ignore or gloss over, what the more common Fundementalist \\"proof texts\\" actually mean, examines the evidence of history (which Fundementalists despirately need to understand!) and shows where they just flat out misunderstand what the Church teaches."},{"rating":"2","title":"KEATING AT HIS BEST IN THIS INDISPENSABLE VOLUME","review":"Karl Keating, director of Catholic Answers, provides an insightful defense of the Catholic faith against its fundamentalist critics. Scholarly yet concise, this volume is accessible to both the academic in the ivory tower and the layman in the pew. Keating makes his finest arguments in his chapter on Marian beliefs. His adroit treatment of this most misunderstood area of Catholic theology is admirable.

In a sense, although I would like to agree wholeheartedly with Keating's position, there is room for me to believe that the Fundamentalists are right, too (or that neither of them is!).Anyone interested in analyzing modern religious responses to the Christian Bible would do well to look through this book. Mr. Keating writes lucidly and well on subjects which are obviously dear to his heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it and rejoice!","review":"This is a clear concise book that unveils the lies that abound concerning Catholism.

After reading it, I feel like I can answer almost any question about my faith, and in fact want to explain every bit of it to whomever asks. I had no idea how irrefutable our doctrines are, nor did I realize how poorly thought out the accusations against our faith are (what they lack in quality they make up in quantity). This book, along with Scott Hahn's Rome sweet home and Lamb's Supper, have set me on fire with a hunger for theological knowledge that joe-pastor down the street cannot satisfy simply because he's working with such a limited knowledge base for interpretation. Excellent work, God Bless!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boat Missed; Awful","review":"As someone who believes that Catholics can easily trump fundamentalists in a doctrinal interpretation of CHristianity, I find this work awful. He drifts from serious argument to \\"Ad hominem\\" insult with no organization or consistency. There is no real defense of the faith and systematic exposition of fundamentalist errors. This will only convince the convinced. It gets one star only because it respectfully notes that Catholics become fundamentalists out of honest and serious belief and not merely out of psychological factors. Beyond that it's a major disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Introduction!","review":"Keating's work is an excellent introduction to what Catholics \\"really\\" believe, as distinct from what Fundamentalist Protestants CLAIM Catholics believe. Many fundamentalists and evangelicals would resent being lumped with Jimmy Swaggart, but their arguments against the RC Church are remarkably similar to Swaggart's, so such objections are really moot. I highly recommend this book to all who want a rather good-humored look at the Catholic/Protestant controversy (at times it is actually rather funny!). Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A most disengenuous attack on a straw-man","review":"One example of Keating's practice of misdirection can be found in his attack upon Lorainne Beottner and his book, Roman Catholicism. Keating mis-quotes Boettner, pulls partial phrases out of context, and attacks the man himself. Keating's work is almost insulting, as could be discerned by any careful reader. I heartily recommend a book published as an answer to Keathing's attack on Boettner... \\"FORMIDABLE TRUTH: A vindication of Lorainne Boettner,\\" by Robert M. Zins, Th.M., in which Mr. Zins, with surgical precision, proves Keating wrong on every point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simplistic and ultra-conservative","review":"Like most of the popologists (\\"pop apologists) at Catholic Answers, Karl Keating has a simplistic and, ironically, an almost fundamentalist approach to Catholicism. Keating holds ultra-conservative views (much like James Akin, Tim Staples, Bob Sungenis, et. al.) and works from the ultra-conservative fringe of non-scholarly Catholicism. This book is consistent with the ultra-conservative Catholic approach. If you simply want to dispel some common fundamentalist misperceptions of Catholicism, then this book is reasonably useful. Otherwise, I would stick with genuine Catholic Biblical scholars like Raymond E. Brown, John P. Meier, and Joseph A. Fitzmyer. While more difficult to read, their scholarship is vastly superior to pseudo-scholars like Keating, and their moderate and orthodox approach to exegesis is refreshing in the recent resurgence of Catholic fundamentalism and biblical literalism that those like Keating advocate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where did he get that from???","review":"As a Catholic, some protestants have been asking me some scriptural questions so I got this book. I was hoping that this could answer some of my/there questions. I was disappointed that Karl's use of scripture was not really supportive of what he said it meant. I know as Catholics we understand the Bible is not reliable. Karl should not have lead me down this goose chase that we should look anywhere except to the Pope and the magesterium for answers.

Clint Eastwood directs this movie like my 15 year old son who doesn't understand how to show me something that he knows really well and I don't.

Most people probably think that surf music is dead, but this is simply not true.

It was a must have for me because the Ventures are one of my all-time favorite bands. The average listener might find this stuff a little cheesy, but if you are a Ventures fan or a surf music fan you will love it. No, not all of the songs are surfing songs, but remember that the Ventures are not actually a surf band.

The case leaves no room to accommodate the cords to be plugged in...the car power cord and the cord that connects the two units. The case that came with my players had slits for the cords to plug in.

No explanation of the control tower, the cockpit, loading the plane with supplies or any of ther other interesting things I was hoping to see. I definitely got the feeling that the only reason he made this video was so he could write off a family vacation on his taxes.

No lullaby and Heavy horses sound alot heavier and cooler in live recordings from this era. Living in these hard times and broadford bazaar are decent additions. I was surprised not to see Blues instrumental included on this cd. It is a very cool blues/fusion song from 1978 and would make my fave songs from this era. Also, A stitch in time and Beltane are two other goodies which were released on Stormwatch and Songs from the wood remasters respectively, but those songs were from 1978, so I think they should have made this cd.

It's a simple, straightforward introduction to astrological symbols; it presents a vocabulary of planets, signs and houses and teaches you how to put them together yourself. Unpretentious, often humorous and completely good-natured, this book is rooted in the idea that humans have free will and that astrology is a creative art."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most readable basic astrology book for any beginner in Astrology","review":"I have read several beginner's book and this one I have actually purchased and given to friends to start them out. There is a simple and natural pattern to Astrology - in fact it's so natural, we modern people have a hard time getting it. To understand it, you have to put yourself in the shoes of one of your ancestors of 5000 years ago. Astrology is about nature, and human nature, and how the two interacted in the natural world. This book really gets it. Steven Forest lays things out in a simple, understandable, and entertaining fashion."},{"rating":"1","title":".","review":"Occult book.

Daniel Higgs is one of my favorite lyricists of all time. he's right up there with Captain Beefheart, Tom Waits, and Neil Fallon of Clutch. Unanimous Hour is probably their best album. the casual listener may not be able to notice much of a difference between each Lungfish album. they're all very similiar (like Ac/Dc). but the more devoted fan knows that each album has it's own uniqueness. the differences are so slight from album to album, however if you listen to their newest album vs. their first album, the differences are pretty obvious. Lungfish's music is very repetative and mantra-like. the hypnotic quality along with the cryptic, poetic lyrics is a beautiful contrast. an aquired taste for some, Lungfish are the true definition of \\"alternative-rock\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some of the more honest practicioners of music...","review":"In the world of the arts we look for someone's own unique perspective on things, the way they proccess information and return it to us. Over the years (1988-present) Lungfish has been an interesting force far and beyond the usual perspective. The band's frontman, Daniel Higgs, has certainly abandoned the norm (even in the world of experiment) an given the world a piece of himself that seems as genuine and honest as the notion of gravity. \\"The Unanimous Hour\\" is a truly emotional work of art; and as always, I come away from them [lungfish] with the real sense that I have been given a gift of great labor. This is certainly not typical in today's music, of any kind. This band is a real gem.

Almost the perfect entertainment for under tens.Best exchenge: in the Chinese restaurant where the Stupid children mistakenly think the waiter has kidnapped their father: Petunia: What would you suggest?

And the score is really great, which is strange--really, it's better than it even needs to be. I think most of the acting is fine, and it really is funny. My complaint (and the reason it gets four stars rather than five) is that it needed a heavier hand in editing.

While drama & tragedy thunder from every page like an Italian opera, & a young man's sexual yearnings & adventures tickle you into giggles, it is Larry Cuocci's lambent language that illumines his memories of administering to his tortured mom, & grasping life with both hands, & doing it his way.---------------------------------"},{"rating":"2","title":"works fine, but a bit tough to get alignment correctly","review":"I have to say, it's hard to find a digital gauge that is easy to get a reading from.

It's just a wait and see. I paid well over $300 at the time of purchase only about 9 months ago. I loved it for 9 months but it sorely needs updating and probably will never have any. So far, Navigon isn't worried about the customers. Backing up a product is 50% of the 'business to customer relations'. I would not purchase this until the map update issue is resolved.

It has some quirks, but when you become familiar with it, you will wonder how you got along without it. As with all GPS, it sometimes takes you the long way, but I have found it to be quite accurate. Changing from state to state is tedious. You have to follow a rigid sequence when entering a new address: City, street, then number. There is a large POI, but some are not included. like the Queen Mary in Long Beach. I consider these minor as you can use the address instead. It comes with an excellent windshield mount. Satellite tracking is excellent. It is quite small and easily carried in a pocket. I have had it for two months and have already used it quite often in three states.

Instrumentally, they are listenable, but certainly not polished. They never inhabit the music the way King did in previous Ode records or the prementioned session players. However, the main problem is the singing (Mark Hallman's ?), often off pitch, nasal, and strained. I usually avoid negative reviews; being a musician myself, bad days or misconceptions of how something should sound happen haunt us all. However, someone should have stopped this record before it hit the press. I can guess that the only reason it is here is for those of us Carole King fans who want to explore some tangents.

I kicked it off with Foxfire, which was one I hadn't read before. As in all of Seton's works, her re-creation of the time and place is wonderful. Also, her characterization is excellent; although this isn't a long book, she manages to develop all of the main players enough to make them more than just two-dimensional. You can feel the emotions and conflicts that each battles within themselves, as well as amongst each other.Although the plot was good and the story well-done, I don't consider it one of Seton's best works. It just didn't draw me in to the same degree as some of her other works.

Obviously, whoever wrote the script for this did not.Anyone with even minor knowledge of police or military tactics would laugh at the antics of the \\"red\\" team of the movie's fictional government agency, who're supposed to be some sort of elite anti serial-killer organization. If a real officer or operative acted in the manner they did, they'd probably get themselves and their colleagues killed in their first encounter.And what were they thinking casting Cathy Moriarty to play the female agent? She's ugly, and it's a good thing they didn't let her take off her clothes. My deepest sympathy goes out to Patrick Muldoon who had to suffer through two love scenes with that pig.

As a student we're required to enter scientific rationale for each intervention which is a lot of typing. This software does not let you resize your text boxes in no way. Therefore, all of my text would end up off the page. It was a mess. I ended up having to take a screenshot, pasting the picture in paint program and then cutting and pasting the text I needed to move. I then pasted that in word and printed my concept map.

I had to return mine because it didn't have any backstage footage, interviews, day in the life, DVD-ROM stuff, etc. Only came with basic concert footage (no special angles), Rock DJ w/behind the scenes, and Dance with the Devil.

I had read an excerpt of the book as a kid and when I found this version for free I jumped on it to get it. The book itself is great, the initial mystery that turns into an adventure that has a happy ending couldn't have been told any better. My one big problem with the book was that the prose was difficult to read most of the time. Some of the words used in the book are the old Scottish English and they are scattered throughout the book. You have to constantly highlight and get the meaning from the dictionary since these are slang terms from old English. I am not sure if the paid version of the book is any better, but that was my only concern.The kindle version of the book is great, the index works and the different properties (change of text size, landscape versus portrait version) also work.

DO NOT BUY IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Miserable","review":"Stevenson was arguably the world's first thriller-writer. His literature addressed no moral issues, satirized no social class, or explained any personal philosophy. He was out to give readers a good time. But as anyone who has read thrillers knows, the best thriller-writers are only the ones that slip the least. No one can write edge-of-your-seat thrillers every single time. So these inevitable slips (for example, Michael Crichton's The Terminal Man), when they come, are often just terrible.Kidnapped was a terrible book. The most rewarding facet of the book is the minor lesson it gives you in archaic Scottish dialect. It was, by far, the worst experience I have ever had in reading a book. If you want Stevenson to deliver, check out Treasure Island or Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good fun","review":"It's amazing that I could follow, let alone enjoy, this classic adventure tale, considering large parts of it are told in an almost impenetrable Scottish dialect. But somehow the sheer joyous energy of Stevenson's story-telling busts down the linguistic barrier. When I was a little kid, I devoured an abridged picture book version of Kidnapped. Only shards of memory remained -- a treacherous staircase, a shattered skylight, something about the Jacobite rebellion of the 1740s. When I finally (decades later) got around to reading Kidnapped, I enjoyed it immensely. Its virtues include a genial narrator with a good sense of humor and a character for the ages: the vain, big-hearted, stalwart yet ridiculous Alan Breck Stewart. The most thrilling scenes are in the first half of the novel. The second half is a lot slower, though it offers up some treasures too, including a bagpipe contest between Alan and his blood rival, a son of the legendary Rob Roy MacGregor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite rightly a classic","review":"With not one but two believable, strong protagonists, a fast moving plot, sufficient excitement and suspense to carry your attention along, and a smattering of historical accuracy, this is a book which demands you willingly suspend your disbelief of the opening sequence (the only weak point to the book), and be carried along to the satisfying conclusion. Alan Breck Stewart is one of literature's great heroes: Not entirely likeable, nor completely honest, he is true to a fault, loyal, faithful, knowledgeable, and a great bag-piper to boot!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A simple conversion of the Project Gutenberg text","review":"This review is for SmartBookWorms' Kindle edition of Kidnapped: B003RWS6FOParagraph formatting mostly good, although the dedication is all centred.

Since all the action you have to keep reading to see what happends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Literary Analysis of Kidnapped","review":"This classic tale of action and adventure is an amazing book. Stevensondid did an excellent job on writing this book. The use of details in the setting and charecter traits are extraordinary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story; less-than-competent narration","review":"Kidnapped is a classic adventure tale, and stands on its own. My rating and comments are about the production. The sound is good, although the announcement of each new chapter clips off the heels of the former. The real disappointment is the reader, Frederick Davidson. First choice of the publisher should have been to find someone with a real Scots accent; second choice, to find someone who could be coached to create a credible Scots accent. The best reading was in the [very short] speeches of Davie. The speeches of the other men were mostly done in growls. In the long narrated parts, Davidson starts out trying (unsuccessfully) to sound Scottish, but by the end has apparently gotten tired and given up completely. He sounds, actually, like a Dick Francis hero--completely the wrong kind of voice for this tale.I liked the story very much, but the quality of the reading detracted from the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classioc Scottish Novel","review":"A great read with good contrast of Highland and Lowland Scotts.

After the success from his first record, Seal, he needed to find a way to duplicate the feel from his first record. With the opening single from his second self-title record, Seal on the line, it was a way to get his soul burning again. Prayer For The Dying is a very dark, soulful song that captures the feel of the artist. Still, it almost sounds as dark as Crazy did from his first record. Still, it was a minor hit, until Kiss From A Rose came along. However, this song is truly for any die hard Seal fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best product out there!","review":"I have dealt with a scaly scalp for about 30 years, and have used this product for the past 8.

It is 100% theory and history of synthesis, written in a typical pedantic British style of writing (sorry, Brits) with 0% actual practical content. It's a mix of a bit of synthesis history with a bit of acoustics describing how these things make sound. But it seems to miss the point, and one could learn more just by playing a synthesiser for an hour than learning this book from cover to cover. If you're investingating this book with an eye towards learning how to program synths or better understand them, I think you'll be disappointed. It spends a lot of time discussing the pioneers (DX7, etc.) but doesn't even mention some of the most important synths of the day (Waldorf, Virus) and there's only a brief mention of softwaresynths (Reaktor, Reason) and none of softsamplers (Unity, Giga, etc.)) I think this book misses the mark; it fills your head with facts and figures but doesn't give you much that's actually useful.

Satire the drama is supposed to be, and satire Brecht does well. Admittedly, I didn't catch that he was satirizing specifically bourgeois society until almost the end (and I found Brecht's notes much more confusing than helpful), but that didn't subtract from my enjoyability of the book. I had expected it to be a much harder read, quick only for its short length, but found it overall very accessible and entertaining. It also helped remind me of the basic plot of John Gay's The Beggar's Opera, which I read a few years ago and also enjoyed. I only wish I knew what the music was like. Does anyone know of a good performance of The Threepenny Opera that can be found online?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Global Top 5","review":"I've not bought or read this book, however, what I can say is that this restaurant is unquestionably one of the top 5 restaurants I've yet had the pleasure of eating at. Finding it requires nerves of steel, especially if you are walking from San Marco, as it is to be found as an oasis of culinary excellence in a labrynth of time etched architecture. The service can be described with one word : class. The food, with a menu that changes daily depending on the ingredients available, was true art. This is not food of the nouvelle cuisine variety but rather food that is a direction indicator ~ this must be one of the leading edge restaurants in Italy, which is fusing old ideas with modern presentation. The after taste of the food was of unquestionably traditional tastes and flavours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential for anyone interested in the history of the West","review":"This is so well-done, deep analysis blended with suspense, characters, scene-setting, motivations, terrain, it's exemplary history. While it covers a generally ignored portion of the Civil War, as other reviewers point out it really explains so much of the next 20+ years West of the Mississippi from the Sioux Wars, the Western Railroads, the Denver Mint, the odd hybrid culture of former Confederates that influences the West still, and more. What surprised me is that there haven't been far more books, movies, and television stories based on the adventures Josephy recounts...it's a lot more riveting stuff than most."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish There Were 6 Stars!","review":"This is an unusually good work. Focusing on the Civil War west of the Mississippi, the author covers not only the major North-South actions, but also the Indian actions which were necessary as well. There is full coverage of the Bayou Teche campaign in Louisiana, Pea Ridge, New Mexico, the Red River Campaign, the Minnesota Sioux uprising, Sabine Pass, the War on the western migration routes, the Mormons, etc, etc.This is as good as it gets. The writing is clear and concise, the events sequential. This history is written so well that at times you will think you are reading a suspense novel. This is a very excellent work by a good historian who just also happens to be a gifted writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Broad Overview of the Western Civil War","review":"Josephy does an excellent job of giving the broad overview of the Civil War in the American West. From paroled Confederates fighting Native Americans in the upper Mid West to a Confederate attempt to take California to the many battles in the bayous of Louisiana, Josephy tells in a riveting fashion the story of those men who fought so far from the better-known battlefields of the East.The biggest flaw with the book -- and some might consider it a feature -- is that the reader is likely to be left wanting more information. In tackling as large a swath of time and geography as Josephy has, it is inevitable that readers will find them looking for additional sources of information on the U.S. West in the 1860s."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clever Knits: Great Looks for Kids","review":"Good book for knitting with heavy/bulky yarns. detailed instructions for some of the more complicated features; i.e., knitting shoulders with 3 needles to eliminate a seam.

Time travel and the various paradoxes caused by time travel always makes for tricky sci-fi that never really works. Asher makes a valiant attempt, but I did not find myself engaged by the story or the characters in this setting. Read The Skinner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unpleasant","review":"I don't know, maybe I'm getting too old for this kind of thing. Perhaps there are some good ideas here, but it's full of cliches. Every male character is a brutal soldier, and the main female character is the standard \\"hooker with a heart of gold.\\" Overall the whole thing just feels so misanthropic I couldn't really find a way to enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Neal's typical fantastic work","review":"First novel I read after I ran through all of the \\"Polity\\" series. I was disappointed. Was very 50's ish sci-fi. Heavy on corn, difficult to follow the storyline, the \\"science\\" lacks authors typical believability as was present in the \\"Polity\\" novels. Disappointing ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Time sideways as well as for/backwards","review":"Asher goes all out in this time travel novel, not being satisfied with going back or forwards in time but going into alternate time pathways as well. He creates mega-villians but his protagonist(s) are themselves flawed people and we watch as greater threats knock them off their fates and into new opportunities, with the \\"godd guys\\" not always acting so good. The tale Asher tells is labyrinthian and it takes an effort to track who is doing what to whom but it moves along and keeps you interested, with nuggets about earth's long term history sprinkled throughout."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 100-word book review","review":"From the writer of the Polity series, Cowl is a stand-alone novel, which nonetheless has all the elements that make Asher's other books immense fun to read. Human factions from the future are fighting each other on a shifting battleground that encompasses all of recorded history, and most of prehistory too. The two vulnerable protagonists, from our near future, are caught up in the action and find themselves drawn back to the dawn of life on Earth - where the formidable Torbeast lurks. This is a fast-moving rollercoaster of a science fiction thriller, chock full of twists and clever touches."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining read with a few logic flaws","review":"Very entertaining read with a couple logic flaws and even more typos. Neal needs a new editor. Anyway, if you enjoyed his previous efforts you will not be disappointed here. There is some of the strongest character development Asher has ever done in this book. While I don't think this reaches the level of \\"The Skinner\\", his best work to date IMHO, it was an enjoyable quick read with a satisfying ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"VanVogt's heir writes a graphic novel","review":"\\"Cowl\\" was only my second asher novel.Asher's introduction of concepts and technologies is done in a breezy enough way, that it sounds like a real expert explaining things to a \\"layman\\".I found it hard to put down---EXCEPT...the story has so much explicitly described violence, dismemberment, and pain that I found it cumulatively repulsive.Fear in a novel may be cathartic, but incessant intimidation, coercion, and bullying is too much for me.Neal Asher has the sense of future/scientific understanding/ daily use of wonder-machines that made VanVogt take Science Fiction's suspension of disbelief to Fantasy levels, but I'm too old to suspend the sensation of this much pain and cruelty.Otherwise, it would be a quintestellar rating!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly forgettable sci-fi","review":"There really isn't much good to say of this book. It mashes together time travel, cyberpunk, combat and horror. If you are really into sci-fi, go for it. If not, it'll just confirm your prejudices against the genre.The plot is really an excuse to string along a bunch of jumps back in time by the good guys, who are fighting bad guys. With lots and lots of cool weapons, historical settings and dinosaurs. And, wait, there's more: a really really bad guy (Cowl) and a light-years-sized monster, the Tor. The combat scenes are cool, the historical scenes are cool. Great brain candy.Naively, I kept on expecting some plot to develop, and a larger meaning to come out, but it never quite happened. It does seem like there were bits and pieces of several interesting books here, but the sum was very much less than its parts. Bad 1950's sci-fi updated to 2005.Wanna try Neal Asher? \\"The Skinner\\" is much, much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Patti is Great, Shame on Flare, the record label though!","review":"I am a fan of Patti Page and has been collecting her CD through the years.

Very good book and deserves the award."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vivid Descriptions!","review":"Charles Johnson's Middle Passage is a masterpiece by all definitions. This story of a former slave who accidentally ends up on a slave ship is well woven and is full of gripping descriptions of the horrid conditions of life on a slave ship. All of Johnson's characters, despite their stereotypical air, come across as three dimensional humans, as opposed to hard-nosed sailors. However, one of this novels biggest draws, is also one of it's biggest shortcomings. Johnson's eloquence and amazing grasp of the English language entices readers with sights, sounds and smells, but they seem a bit much for the character of Rutherford Calhoun, a former slave and professional thief. Perhaps he would have been more believeable in third-person, speaking in New Orleans vernacular as opposed to the King's English. Similarly, Johnson's Calvinoesque use of allusions is a little confusing, but gets the point across. Definitely a must read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Serves more purpose as burning material than a novel!","review":"I have to say, this is the first time that I couldn't read past the second chapter of a book.

His dad Bob Log Jr. pitches in on Kazoo while \\"Pancake\\" supplies the backup vocals. The tunes have a certain sameness to them resulting in, what seems like anyway, one long 35 minute jam.

The French actor plays a stupid fanatic who forgets he has a life. This whole story might be true but the voice is terrible and the rythm of the movie is sloooow. I bought this movie because of your review but after I had seen it I returned it to the store to exchanged it. Compare this movie to Bird or Mo better blues and you will give those two movies a 10. With all due respect to Dexter Gordon's musical genius, Tavernier should have chosen an actor with a better voice. Typical french movies, they throw things at you that you must like beacause it is supposed to be deep and intellectual. Wrong. as Serge Dassault inventor of the Mirage jet fighter once said: \\" a plane can be technically the best, but without beauty it isn't a plane."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gordon rips off Bud Powell","review":"This is a rip off of the Bud Powell story, plain and simple. Francis Paudras was an artist of sorts, similar to the graphic artist in the movie. Francis lived with his girlfriend rather than his daughter. Buttercup was the devil woman in Powell's life, they don't even bother to change the name here. Making money off of the story of Bud Powell without having to pay anyone for it seems ridiculous to me. If you want the real story behind this movie, read \\"Dance of the Infidels: A Portrait of Bud Powell\\", written by Paudras himself. The book, while tedious at times, is drenched with the emotion of a truly heartbreaking story, rather than this cheap ripoff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Robbed For the Oscar by 'Boxing Judges'","review":"This is one of my handful of all-time favorites-and I think awarding the Oscar to Paul Newman for 'The Color Of Money' becausehe didn't get one for 'The Hustler' is a boxing robbery in the worst sense;real life-and all time great tenor sax player Dexter Gordon's portrayal of an expatriate tenor sax player Dale Turner living in Paris was in a class by itself.The film is dedicated to sax player Lester Young and pianist Bud Powell and is based on the book 'Dance of the Infidels' by Francis Paudras about his relationship with his idol Powell,a genius with mental problems-and by any standard,one of the top few jazz pianists,ever.I still think they should award Dexter Gordon an Oscar,posthumously."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Cinematic Love Letter to Jazz","review":"If you don't love jazz -- I mean LOVE jazz -- you probably won't get much out of this movie. There's not really much of a STORY per se. The cinematography is beautiful and the performances are wonderful to watch, especially jazz legend Dexter Gordon in the lead role (and a small but frenetically funny cameo by Martin Scorsese toward the end). But what this movie is really ABOUT is jazz -- straight-ahead, pre-fusion, bop-heavy, swingin' jazz. And not just the music, although there's plenty of that. The film is also about the romance of jazz, embodied in the tiny, smoky underground club in Paris; the dingy rooms and corridors of a fleabag hotel, the city streets at night, booze, southern cooking, humor, sadness, love, loss. It's required viewing for anyone who loves jazz and/or anyone who's interested in how jazz and jazz musicians have been portrayed on film, from \\"The Glenn Miller Story\\" to \\"Paris Blues\\" to \\"Mo' Better Blues\\" to \\"Bird.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A jazz classic","review":"Roun' Midnight tells the story of an American jazz player in Paris, whose life changes when he meets a kid who loves his music but is too poor to get into jazz clubs.

Yes, this movie moves slow, but I think that it's meant to mimic the pace of our own daily experiences. Dale and Francois are meant to be, perhaps, uncomfortably real, hence they each have their disturbing flaws. (Incidently, I don't count Dexter Gordon's voice as a flaw... it came with the great musician. Get over it.) Still, I found myself endeared to both. Lots of metaphores thorughout the movie between music, music making and living. The music is great, if not something of an anachronism. There are many scenes that seem unecessary, but I think they are unexplained elements that are, perhaps, meant for us to interpret for ourselves. This move is constructed differently than most, so I urge you not to apply the same criteria you would other movies. It's like looking at a painting for a long time and coming away with your own meaning. Probably the most artistic movie in my collection to date."},{"rating":"1","title":"This film is boring and insipid!","review":"Maybe I'm not as articulate as the usual film critic, or self-indulgent for that matter, but after viewing 'Round Midnight I thought it proper to tell the persons in the jazz populace not watch the film! That is,unless you want to over-serenaded with ballads and blues oriented chord progressions! Francis' obsession with Dale Turner is what one might call \\"icky\\". Dale Turner himself, is a garbling fool whose speech patterns simply annoy the viewer. The friendship that the Parisian and the ailing be-bop musician form is anything but inspiring. It is riddled with montages and various rescue missions. That is, Francis coming to the aid of Dale, drunk in the alley, thrown in the police wagon, captured at the hospital. Francis, get a life.

Unlike Hollywood movies featuring a well-known jazz musician, this one delivers the real thing, music-wise, with no fading the music and cutting to the main characters dining and talking. But the writing is a little tedious at times, making the actors say some corny, self-conscious lines, as if explaining and talking down to an audience that's never heard any jazz before. Dexter's character, Dale Turner the celebrated tenor sax player and alcoholic, is subjected to some unnecessary humiliation to sledge-hammer home the message that if he goes back to the bottle, it's curtains for him. And some silly, unreal and unnecessary minor characters, added merely for color. However, the movie is satisfying as the story of one American jazz musician among the many that were drawn to Paris, where nobody noticed the color of their skin."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's more than a movie about jazz.","review":"Round Midnight is the most delicate, sensitive and deep movie I've ever watched.It's a movie that goes much beyond jazz and musicians.It's a movie about love, about the possibilities, about us, human beigns.And amazingly played by two INCREDIBLE actors: Dexter Gordon and Franois Cluzet. Dexter Gordon was a special human being, he was an angel. I really belive this. It was up to Bertrand Tavernier to see it and he did. That's why the movie is a masterpiece, it's a combination of untouchble and unique souls."},{"rating":"2","title":"fascinating lady","review":"Mary Maclane was an emo chick WAY before it was cool.

Don't expect a prehistoric film like \\"One Million Years BC\\"...this one is strictly a jungle adventure (for the first 20 minutes it resembles a Tarzan film from the 50's!). It's all about a tribe of skimpily clad babes who worship a white rhino (with a big phallus shaped horn). A male hunter comes to their camp and all the babes fight over the stud. Sexy Martine Beswick hams it up as the Queen and there are many laughs (and MANY tribal dances), but it all wears out way before the 91 minutes are over. Still, it's nice to finally see it and the widescreen image on the DVD looks very good. The flip-side of the disc has some trailers and one of those Hammer specials."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor","review":"This is without doubt one of the worst Hammer films that you can currently buy. It is mercifully short (under 90mins) but even this is too long. There are numerous scenes of dancing and singing which drag on and in truth the film need only have been about an hour in length.My understanding is that this was made after \\"One Million Years BC\\" using the same set and costumes, which obviously enabled Hammer to get another film out very cheap (probably as a B movie). However the acting is on occasions wooden and the story/script must have been written in an afternoon.Its only redeeming feature (for a man) is lots of women in prehistoric bikinis! This is also available as part of the 21 disc Hammer boxed set collection (only region 2 I think). If you must own this film it would make sense to buy that and get some good films into the deal as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Granted this is not the best movie ever, BUT...","review":"It's a given that this movie does not have the best storyline in the world.

A dish that I can make quickly, with easy-to-find ingredients (probably already in my frig or on my shelves); a dish that transports easily; and a dish that won't embarass me, and an empty dish at the end of the day.Secondly, I collect old cookbooks and old recipes. This book contains quite a few old-time recipes that I've not run into before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short observations on life in the South","review":"This book is a collection of short essays about life in the Deep South, many of which appear to have begun life as newspaper columns. These stories reflect the character of the South, friendly, casual, and plain spoken. They are also quirky and often amusing. Whaley clearly loves his native South, and helps explain its allure to those of use raised elsewhere. Because these essays are organized by subject matter, the book does sometimes feel a bit repetitive, but as a collection, it is easy to pick up and read for a few minutes at a time. Not a deep, meaningful book, but entertaining enough to be worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two Thumbs Up","review":"I saw this documentary on Nationation Geographic Channel.

It's an intensely personal visual and emotional record of Bianchi's relationships with men from youth through the date of the book. The black and white photographs are beautiful and his memories of the subjects are written out by hand, giving the reader the sense of perusing the author's personal journals and his innermost thoughts about the men he's loved. It's a quick read, but you'll want to read it a second time to get the sense of his emotional journey through adulthood. I think it's his best book. Most of the others are fluff. The photographs are great, but stop at being erotic. This one is so much more.

IF I wanted FISH products in my protein bar I'd buy a FISH BAR, but the fact that Balance Bars use Fish Gelatin in their ALMOND BROWNIE wishes I could SHOVE THE ENTIRE 6 box order up their noses.It's so sad the ingredients and the junk that almost any company will put in your food. I will NOT BE ORDERING THIS PRODUCT EVER AGAIN, and I doubt that although I've been a huge balance bar customer, that I'll EVER ORDER BALANCE BARS again, as they are FISH GELATIN bars in truth. SEE LABEL.I'm done."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would have to say I was not ...","review":"I would have to say I was not very impressed by the quality and taste of this product. I guess I really expected more from this product, as they seem so expensive. The peanut-butter taste was very strong and the texture was very grainy and dry. I don't think that these bars are very filling. You have to drink a lot of water with them to even get them down. I would not recommend this product to my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious and good for you","review":"Of the countless power or meal replacement bars on the market (I've tried most everything), the honey peanut Balance Bars are among the best taste wise. I'm trying to watch my weight and especially what I have for breakfast or lunch. These are tasty, convenient, and better for me than other choices I could make.

They are moist, and the chocolate coating on the bar really does taste like chocolate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good balance bar - But they sent an old box","review":"I have been eating the Balance Mocha Chip bar for several years now (it is my afternoon snack in the office).Now, there is a \\"Best By\\" date on the box. However, the fact is that even within the sealed packaging the bar starts to dry off well before the \\"Best By\\" date.The ideal condition for the bar is that it should be soft and chewy and not dry and hard.When I buy these from a store, I test it by pressing one of the bars. If it can be pressed using slight pressure, it is good.The problem is that not many stores carry this flavor.I joined the subscription program with Amazon thinking it is a hassle free way to get these.However, they shipped me a box in March 2009 that had a Best By date of July 2009.Whereas, I had bought a box in Feb 2009 from the local store that had a Best By date of December 2009.Needless to say, the bars from Amazon were hard and dry.I cancelled my subscription and am going back to buying these from the local ACME store."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent nutrion, but cheaper at Target","review":"I love these bars. I don't like nuts, so this is my favorite flavor. Unlike a lot of nutrition bars, it doesn't make your jaw ache trying to chew it down. It's small but filling, and has a very high amount of protein. The taste is very good, not chalky or pasty.However, you can get these cheaper at Target - a box of six is only $4.99, which is 83 cents, compared to over a dollar here (before shipping)."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a good snack or break food. ...","review":"This is a good snack or break food. After my afternoon workout, it filled me up and gave me energy. It satisfied my craving for a sweet chocolate taste too.

It was a bit high on the calorie range, but had all the nutrients to keep it healthy."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a tasty bar, not too heavy ...","review":"This is a tasty bar, not too heavy on the chocolate. It isn't a \\"\\"candy bar\\"\\" or \\"\\"brownie\\"\\" sort of texture (it's lots drier) but for heavens sake, this is a nutritional bar. If I wanted a brownie's moisture and flavor, I'd eat a brownie. For what it is -- a nutritional bar -- it's quite good. And I like the fact that the protein and fat are balanced in a way that helps me absorb the nutritional benefits. Overall, it's tasty snack that's good for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was really pleasantly surprised when I tried ...","review":"I was really pleasantly surprised when I tried this product. For all the nutrients it contained I expected it to taste a bit like chocolate-flavored paneling or something comparable. It was actually great. Had a dense, yet rather moist consistency, with a very good flavor. The size is such that it's easy to carry with me on the go and could easily be slipped into a shirt or jacket pocket. I really liked to have one after a workout to give me a very nutritious boost. I imagine if one is looking for a quick, nutrition bar that in NO way skimps on flavor, this one is worth the money. I would definitely recommend this to family and friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame subscription option","review":"While I do like the bars themselves, I feel that Amazon resorted to bait and switch.

Then I did some research and found out that much of their protein is from gelatin or collagen which is 100% worthless to humans for building/maintaining muscle because the amino acid is not good. Also lots of palm kernel oil in these which isn't too good for you. There are much better options out there. If you want something with better protein (but still has some palm kernel oil) and tastes great, try Metabolic Drive protein bars. If you are ok with eating something that is just ok tasting, then Zero Impact are by far the best bars out there. Great protein, healthy fats, low sugar, no sugar alcohols. I haven't found one bad thing about them. I just feel ripped off for the years I spent eating Balance Bars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy Balance Bars from Amazon.com","review":"I eat these bars all the time and thought it would be a good deal and convenient to get them from Amazon.

I would probably pick this bar over others now that I have tried it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Balance Bars had a good taste without any ...","review":"Balance Bars had a good taste without any chemical after taste. For someone on the run this product may be ideal in order to get some of their daily RDA (recommended daily allowance of vitamins and minerals) instead of skipping meals or getting fast food.

The chocolate on the outside was good but again, not too much flavor. It needed to be sweeter, and the raspberry flavoring was weak. Tasted like I was eating an old candy bar, and a stale one at that. I had to keep checking it to see if it was old and out of date. I actually gagged on it a couple times while eating it. I did eat several of them (nine). The wrapper looks too formal, not appealing to the eye. It made me feel like I was eating a health bar and not a fun item! I thought the carbs were a bit too high also. It did give me a full feeling when I finished with it. Didn't fulfill the need for something sweet, though. If I'm going to eat chocolate, I want to know I ate chocolate. I wouldn't recommend this to my family or friends. I'd rather recommend Slim Fast Bars for the vitamins and health aspects."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sorry to say that I wasn't impressed ...","review":"I'm sorry to say that I wasn't impressed with Balance Bar 40-30-30.

I used it for breakfast and was very pleased with how well it satisfied my hunger. I didn't get as hungry for lunch when I usually do. (Previously, I would normally eat a bowl of cereal for breakfast.) The taste could use some improving upon. The nuts did create a better taste. I've used Slim Fast before and this seemed to satisfy better than the Slim Fast products.

The bar looked delectable and smelled wonderful, but that was as far as it went. They are plain awful! The chocolate coating is good, but whatever they have on the inside is sickening. It's not very sweet, but it's the texture that's so bad. It's like chewing wet sawdust. We immediately spit ours out, and the box of 14 is still sitting on my counter.

The honey yogurt peanut flavor is the best I've tried, and they are great with a glass of cold, skim milk for breakfast or a snack. Without the milk, they aren't very filling, it's true, but they are still very tasty and better for you than candy. However, it's also true that since they are made with HFCS they aren't as healthy as some of the other bars available. They probably have a fairly high glycemic index.Still, if that's not an issue for you, and you want to soothe a sweet tooth, or find a fairly healthy fast breakfast or snack for on the go, give 'em a try.

Also the nutritional \\"balance\\" is at least on par with others-- bear in mind this qualifies as a meal (by the numbers if not for real), not just a snack.CONS--It will melt in heat (as in shipping); there has been some batch-to-batch variation for whatever reason, maybe the shipping, but they're still tasty; and as with other of these fairly dense protein bars, I prefer eating them with fluids, for better digestion. If I'm going to grab one heading out the door, for a breakfast, better get a drink too, or just eat half. 16g of protein is a big breakfast."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it","review":"Love it.

That is a wrong way of looking at it. Russia is a symbiosis of Slavic/Christian and Turkic/Muslim elements. David L. Ransel's fascinating book reflects this dual nature of Russia and gives an insight into its complex inner soul. A wealth of details and astute observations make this book a pleasure to read.Most recent books about Russia concentrate on its urban aspects or on its general political or economic aspects. Unlike them, Village Mothers presents a picture of its rural life. Russia has been a largely rural, agricultural country for many centuries. Its industrialization started only a few decade ago. That's why it is important to understand the village life in Russia.

The first chapter, written by the editors, is a great introduction for individuals uncomfortable with chaos theory, especially as it applies in the social sciences. An area that was also intriguing was the explanation of Long Wave Theory as it applies to economics, written by Brian J. L. Berry and Heja Kim. Long Wave Theory is typically the ground for Kenyon De Greene.

Just looking at the old box, if you don't actually check reviews and trailers on it, you would have no idea what this movie is about. It also has an alternate title: Time Shifters, but is still referred to as Thrill Seekers in the new release. The title Time Shifters, gives a better idea of the story-line of time travel, than Thrill Seekers, which is a good explanation of why the people are time-traveling.

I hope that this music can have the same affect on my children that it has on me. My mother is a huge Stater Brothers fan, and after years of listening to them, and being a lover of music, I can appreciate their harmony, and absolutely love their music, especially the Christmas albums.

I read the lesser, although well-intentioned book by Stanley Weintraub, but this is clearly the best book on the subject of the tragically short Christmas Truce, 1914.The very fact that the truce even arose, suggests the idea that even World War One was a war orchestrated by the World Banking System. There was no logical reason for the Brits and the Germans, who had fought together (as the Prussians) to defeat Napoleon at Waterloo, to go to war with each other.The more you read about how much the troops had in common, and how much they resisted resuming combat, the more angry you become at the sheer fraud underlying modern conflict. I seriously question whether there are any 'honest wars', and I am no pacifist.

The comedy is derived from the strange predicaments in which Dugan finds himself (the old fish-out-of-water ploy). The movie is one of Disney's better live-action comedies. Since much of the comedy is of the zany, slapstick variety the movie has aged well, and is still humorous twenty years later.

Try it out for yourself, you won't be dissapointed.

While the movie is no masterpiece it is a good movie. It moves a a good clip, and has some amazing gore involved.

Let's just say that, had it not been for the fact that I rented the classic horror filmBlack Christmason the very same night, I would have been banned by my friends from picking rental choices from then on. This movie is an out and out mess from beginning to end! This movie had to have had one of the worst screenplays ever written, complete with terrible dialogue and events that are just impossible for me to suspend my disbelief. (If you're wondering what I'm talking about, you'll know when you see the miraculous happenning in the movie's climax.) I can't believe Dario Argento allowed his name to be put on this film.

There's more corn in this flick than the State of Kansas. The single entertainment value this film holds is that it provides a medium for a group of drunken men or women to polk fun at something. There are maybe one or two admirable scenes in which Argento's uncanny editing and camera work shine. Otherwise its a feast for the idiots; green blood, bad make-up and all.

A mysterious man in a metal mask hands out film tickets to unsuspecting commuters. This sets in motion a chain of events that leads to the unleashing of a plague of demons upon the earth.Bava cleverly uses the film-within-a-film motif to comment upon the horror film genre (this device is more extensively used in the \\"Scream\\" trilogy, which I recommend to fans of \\"Demons\\"). Also well-used is the claustrophobic movie theater setting. The film is gory and violent, with some real gross-out elements. Although the film's imagery can be absurd, at its best it is exciting, inventive, and genuinely horrific."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT THE REGULAR DEMONS","review":"THIS VERSION IS DIFFERENT THAN THE ONE YOU KNOW WITH SALLY.

At random, people are picked for the premiere of a new film, but when the audience begins to turn into the title characters, the survivors can't escape the theater and are left to do battle with the drooling beasties. All of this is a lot more interesting than it really is, basically because director Lamberto Bava (who brought us the MST3K favorite \\"Devil Fish\\") is no Dario Argento. Most of the events are utterly unbelievable (a helicopter falls through the ceiling for no reason), the dubbing (and acting) is bad, and the soundtrack (featuring a wide range of has-been 80's metal bands) is laughable. \\"Demons\\" is no \\"Deep Red,\\" but might be a hoot if you view it with an open mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good scare","review":"\\"Demons\\" is very similar to \\"Evil Dead\\" in its sense of claustrophobia and impending dread, and makes for a fun Saturday-night guilty pleasure.

It was awful. It was so boring that I actually found myself scanning through the disc to get to the good parts. Unfotunatly, there were none. So 80's it's sickening. I think that the Friday the 13th films at there worst were still better than this. If you are unfamiliar with Italian horror films, I STRONGLY suggest that you rent this first and see if it is for you before buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well Done for an 80's horror film, but doesn't go anywhere!","review":"This was a neat film at the start with great music scores by Motley Crue, Billy Idol, Accept with other 80's groups, but most of this film takes place in a movie theatre as demons possess people in the movie theatre as well as on screen. Watching it once is okay, but not for a second time. Frightening stuff though."},{"rating":"2","title":"In my top ten horror list for sure","review":"Although cheesy in terms of plot, nevertheless \\"Demons\\" is a great horror flick that can actually do what it is supposed to do, and scare the heck out of you-not for the squemish. Very stylish and creepy bloodfest. Highly recommended for all ghouls."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very 80s Horror","review":"This film was produced and co-written by Dario Argento and directed by Lamberto Bava (son of horror maestro Mario Bava). It stars Argento's daughter Fiore, who visits an old cinema called the Metropol in Berlin, and once inside it is not long before hordes of crazed demons start to show up. It also features some good mid 80s songs from artists like Billy Idol, Go West, Motley Crew and others. The picture in widescreen 1.66:1, and the sound in Dolby digital 5.1 are both good. The commentary is ok from the three Italian guys. The extras show some scenes of the makeup effects and some other info. The menus are impressive; each time you access a menu a demon roars and comes out the screen at you. It is a disc worth adding to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zombie Slayer","review":"Demons is a great horror film. If you like to be scared this movie will do it.

Not only is this movie poorly paced and BORING as hell, but the music was poorly concieved and does not fit in at all with the subject matter. Contrary to what everyone says, Demons is rather light on gore and what gore there is is so badly done that it really doesnt even count. The plot was moronic as were about 90% of the casting decisions. Lamberto Bava's only decent efforts I've seen are Blastfighter and Blade in the Dark. Other than that, he's just a hack. A pale imitation of the great man his father was. Bobby Rhodes was cool in this movie though, so I give it stars for that. For the true Italian horror experience, see one of the classics like \\"The Beyond\\", \\"The House by the Cemetery\\", \\"The New York Ripper\\", \\"Zombie\\", or \\"Surpiria\\". Try and steer clear of this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply awful.","review":"I have been a zombie fan my whole life. This flick caught my attention due to the numerous positive reviews. In my humble opinion it does not come close to the Romero films. It really is not worth buying. If you are intrigued by the reviews please rent it first. If it wasn't for Sergio Leone, I'd be ashamed to admit I'm Italian."},{"rating":"1","title":"Argento's biggest mis-step to date(That I have seen)","review":"True it can be fun on a boring night or day, but Demons has little else to offer. Like most other Argento films, Demons does have moments of uter brilliance(only this time they are very few and far in between). I'm guessing him and Lamberto Bava were trying to make a better Night of The Living Dead, they failed miserably. The only thing to recommend in Demons is the excessive gore fx(which aren't bad and there's plenty of them)and the truely awful acting. If that's your cup of tea this is your movie. Also, there is a very good hidden message about,\\"Do movies make people murder?\\", but by the end you will probably forget all about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brutal","review":"I was shocked to read the rave reviews that people gave this CD.

Those who are seeking direction in their lives will find an easy-to-understand, no-nonsense approach to Christianity and what it's all about. Those already in the faith will find this resource to be a good check-up on where they stand in their faith, helping them to stay focused on the essentials and not get too caught up in non-essentials.

Although this book does provide a basic outline of christian beliefs, the author lets his personal bias slip into his writing much too often.

So if you want a fair and unbiased book outlining christian beliefs, I would recomend that you look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too hip/glib/slangy For You","review":"I was looking for a nice overview to Christianity.

But this book is dreadful.IF YOU ARE OVER THE AGE OF 23, and/or IF YOU HAVE MORE THAN A SIXTH GRADE EDUCATION you'll probably find this book insulting, and way, way too hip. There is a dreadful, hip-ish cliche in virtually every paragraph, every other sentence.The actual content seems rather slight, superficial. The author is apparently way too close to the subject to really give much of any kind of critical analysis.Luckily for me, I'd borrowed this book at the library. The language is so juvenile, so hip, that I cannot bear to read anymore.

Which is a personal relationship with God.I was hoping for a better continuation in this book, but it didn't really happen. Mr. Wagner does have a wit and a sense of humour. But this book is rather dry. The book is more about how Christianity works than anything to do with a personal relationship with God and all the good things that come from that ie. a revolution of character, peace of mind etc.This book is for those who are looking for a good overview of the \\"technical\\" aspects of Chritianity.

He is a ruthless womaniser and she is a fool for falling for him. Don't bother, unless you are a Gere or Ryder fan. To make the viewer care and empathise is the aim of the director in a love story.

It is awfully boring, sappy and filled with fluff and not much substance.Richard Gere, in my opinion, does a poor acting job in this movie and doesn't seem all that believable as the leading man in this movie. Sure Gere makes nice eye candy, but that is about it.Normally I enjoy the roles that Winona Ryder plays and find her acting to be wonderful.... However, I was sorely disappointed in the shallow development of the Ryder's character by the writers of this movie.The only redeeming feature of this movie was that it didn't have the typical/predictable Hollywood ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"An awful love story!","review":"There is a clear similitude between this movie and Love Story; nevertheless this picture maintains a very special charm by its own.The sexual chemistry between Wynona Ryder and Richard Gere worked out into a perfection level.Arresting photograph around this poignant and sensitive subject.

I have a feeling this movie will make many 10 worst movie lists of the year."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star is too much for this film","review":"This film is not a love story. It is a poorly scripted and poorly acted tale of a 48 year old sex-compulsive womanizer (Will, played by Richard Gere) that beds an immature poem-reciting pseudo-wise 22 year old with a terminal illness (Charlotte, played by Winona Ryder). It tries to show Will's transformation from creep to sensitive grandfather, the catalyst being Charlotte's impending and ultimate death, but it never reaches believability. Gere's performance is insincere and Ryder's is academic. This is a definite must-miss. Too bad I had to watch it to find out."},{"rating":"1","title":"A missed opportunity.","review":"This film wasn't as bad as I expected, but it was one of those frustrating experiences where you felt they could have done so much more with the material. It almost seemed like they decided midway through the production to go traditional and forget about doing anything different. The movie turned for me during a taxicab sequence midway in the film. They took the safe route between the Gere and Ryder characters instead of going for something with more bite. Perhaps that was their intention all along, but it seemed like they had the material in place during the first half for something different. A commentary track on the DVD might have shed some light on things, but they didn't include one. They didn't include any extras at all. Definitely another minus if you like those things."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst movies ever!","review":"This is definitely one of the worst movies I have ever seen!

Too bad the story regarding poor young girls with heart defects that end up badly is only a story, and an immature one at best. I thought the story was simply ridiculous. I'm supposed to feel badly for poor, stupid Richard Gere, who cheats on this fine young thing because he didn't know what else to do. I have no sympathy for this guy who finally finds true love (still he cheats) and is left broken hearted. Also I find her very weak in taking him back, as if he's the catch of the world. He didn't even have to true very hard in order to win her back either. I don't feel bad for him because he is nearly 50 and shanking a 22 year old with a heart defect. NO!I also found stupid the fact that they go on one date and are professing their love toward each other.

It can't work","review":"Bottom line, the method proposed in this book is nothing more than showing flashcards. Yes sure a baby's brain will memorize them. That's all. Babies may very well memorize dots on the flashcards and associate them with a number. But that does mean that they are understanding the more complex abstraction of the meaning of quantities a number represents. It's wishful thinking that babies are actually understanding the abstract concept of quantities let alone additions and multiplications! They are not. It is a good idea to start early in stimulating a babies brain, but I'd recommend more traditional methods, such as kids books with numbers and shapes, that are far more engaging and fun for both parents and kids, and more effective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Idea","review":"I bought this along with Teach Your Baby to Read and I can't say whether or not it's working yet, but if nothing else you spend some time with your children.

They are right. It however misses many basic points of investing/trading. It recomends buying penny stocks. Not a good idea. It recomends buying stocks that have been going sideways for a number of years as this shows accumualtion. This can work some of the time but certainly not all of the time. I've seen many charts with sideways action that ultimately went down or bankrupt and subsequently stopped trading.

The ideas are unsound and very dangerous. As someone with considerable experience and success in the market place, this book to me represents some college professor's fantasy of how things are supposed to work in the marketplace. In reality, those grandiose theories seldom work out and big losses ensue. It's no wonder most authors and business teachers in the colleges and universities never make a dime in the markets.

The only way to make a million dollars in the stock market using the methods in this book is to start with two million. It will become one million fast enough. The main premise of the strategy is to buy stocks which show a prolonged sideways pattern, supposedly because accumulation is occuring.

I have always thought there was a way for the \\"common man\\" to make money buying individual stocks and Ted knows how. Buy low and sell high. Forget about all those high price stocks and fast movers. The way to riches is over time. The richest men in America's history knew this and acted accordingly. If you are looking for solid principles to follow for the long run, look no further. I have used these principles to find some real bargains in the stock market during this volatile time and they aren't the stocks that have recently taken a beating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad information has never cost so much","review":"What is with the $75 price of this book? I've read much more clear and concise stock market books that cost a fraction of what this garbage costs. Even Magee's 600 page hardcover copy of \\"Technical Analysis of Stock Trends\\"(which is a true stock market classic) doesn't cost this much. The author rambles on without really explaining anything in a manner that the reader can utilize to make money in the markets. Don't waste your $ on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Vague to use in the Real World","review":"I found the author unclear and vague in the implementation of his techniques. So you spot a long-term sideways base. So what. That doesn't tell you when to put your money in that particular security. The stock or commodity you are considering could go sideways for a long, long time or worse, it could go down. For the $75 price tag of this book, the reader deserves much more precise instruction on the use of the techniques."},{"rating":"1","title":"STAY AWAY FROM THIS BOOK AT ALL COST!!","review":"Unfortunately, I did not heed the warnings from the other reviewers and purchased this book and subsequently lost 25% of my money in 1998.Upon further relfection, I realize that the material in this book is nonsense. I followed the \\"methods\\" in this book with a great deal of unfounded hope and faith. I definitely learned my lesson and am approaching the market in a more traditional approach.For all of you hopeful investors, remember this saying \\"Inch by inch it is a sinch. Yard by yard it is hard.\\" In essence, don't bite off more than you can chew. Use a sound and tested systematic approach that will get you there in the long run.

This is a very conservative,long term method that is not advocated by any other book that I have read. Many other books can tell you more than you ever wanted to know about stop-loss methods. This book is short on those kinds of details but \\"long\\" on the most important thing-long term charts. There may or may not be \\"manipulators\\", just watch the patterns for the real opportunities. The chapters on commodities were pretty vague and didn't offer anything I hadn't read before. The revelation is in the stock section.

Names like Jesse Livermore and Bernard Baruch. These were truly geniuses in the business of the markets. There's a reason one never mentions the name Ted Warren in reflecting on the markets. One reading of his book will tell you why. His principles are as unsound and dangerous as an any I have ever seen. The publishers must have been thinking that by resurrecting the deceased author's book after being out of print for some time that the greedy public would somehow feel grateful that these \\"long-lost\\" secrets could now be revealed once again.

I've shown this book to a few fellow professional traders who also agree that following the advice in this book is the quickest way to the poor house. I also agree with the person below who wrote that the absurdly high price of this book is a ploy by the publishers to fool a greedy public into thinking that they have to pay a higher price to get Ted Warren's \\"holy grail\\" of the stock market.

It could be possible based on the \\"strategy\\" he is selling. It's a pretty sad version of \\"buy and hold\\" that allows the true professionals and manipulators to profit off the suckers.

A better market investment would be towards stocks which have a proven track record and will actually MAKE MONEY, rather then turning them into declared losses.

Fortunately I played with a small amount of money over the last year to test Ted's system and suffered a %50 loss. It amazes me that some of the positive reviewers claim to have losses in some stocks but arrogantly claim that they'll come back. Only losers in the market game talk like that and if losers are endorsing this book or the people trying to sell it, then the book itself is a loser."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to make the stock market take your money","review":"Take my advice , dont buy this book! I tried Ted Warren's techniques and lost.Whenever something sounds to good to be true, it probably is."},{"rating":"1","title":"The High Price is a Good Marketing Attempt","review":"I think the publishers of this book thought that by making the price of this book obnoxiously high that they could fool potential buyers into thinking that they were getting a quality book on ivesting. I also think that's why this book isn't available in stores(unless you order it). If the publishers tried to sell this book at that outrageous price to somebody that was browsing, they would never sell a single copy-espicially with so many more useful and low priced books that would sit next to this one on the shelf. I'm lucky that the store that I ordered it through allowed me to check it out when they got it and gave me the option to refuse purchasing it-which I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blatantly ignores the downside","review":"I found this book somewhat similar to other books on chart analysis like \\"How to Make Money in Stocks\\" by William O'Neill but with one major difference that I believe to be a serious flaw. This book explicitly tells you not to cut your losses short if the trade doesn't work out. WRONG!! Any successful trader/investor that utilizes charts in his analysis will tell you to cut your loss short if the trade goes against you. Why Ted Warren thinks his method of reading charts warrants going down with the ship is beyond me. This book was probably his last chance at staying afloat-financially that is."},{"rating":"1","title":"A TOTAL WASTE!!","review":"You can take or leave what I have to say about this book, but it's coming from someone with twenty-five years professional experience in the financial markets. THIS BOOK IS A TOTAL WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY! There is absolutely nothing of value within this book that will help you make a dime in stocks or commodities. The only one who is going to profit from this book is it's publisher(I believe Mr. Warren has passed away). I have yet to meet anyone(fellow professionals included) who have profited from the information in this book. Save your money for the market itself where the real learning is done."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sucker is born every minute","review":"This book is a complete waste of time. I have read it and I have also gone through Ken Roberts' course-I returned both of them. He's a scam artist on the level of Wade Cook. If you believe that you are going to win in the complex game of the stock and futures markets by commiting just fifteen minutes a day, you'll accept anything as the gospel-which is just what Ted Warren and Ken Roberts want you to do. By the way, have you noticed how the \\"good\\" reviews of this book have an eerily similar tone of the book's promoters?"},{"rating":"1","title":"In this case, the crowd is right","review":"I have to admit that at first, I was a little surprised by the high number of negative reviews of this book. But after purchasing and reading this book, I believe the majority of reviewers got it right this time. I have been involved in the markets for many years and have had my own ups and downs(fortunately more ups than downs) and have read many well-known books along the way. I found this book to be redundant, unclear, and in many cases very dangerous in the approach that it takes to investing. There are much better sources to take from if you want to educate yourself in the stock market."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bad Analysis of Stock Market Action","review":"This book advocates the use of stock charts in making investment decisions-that's the good part. It didn't explain how to time the buys and the sells of the investments-that's the bad part. If your going to use charts in stock market decisions, you may be right a certain amount of the time, but your also going to make mistakes. Ted never explains how to handle situations when your wrong, which will inevitably happen(it happens to everybody including Warren Buffett). In fact, Ted believes you should let the loss ride until you are finally proven right(or broke). Overall, a poor investment philosophy."},{"rating":"1","title":"If at first you don't succeed, write a book!","review":"This book offers no practical information for investing in today's markets. Using this so-called approach will send you to the poor house in a hurry in a bear market like the one we're having currently(July-Oct.'98). You might get lucky during a wild bull phase but if you don't identify when market conditions are changing you're going to be toast as one of the reviewers below me found out. Maybe Mr. Warren found this out the hard way and tried to make up for some of his losses by writing a \\"how to\\" book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is the best thing that has happened to me!","review":"Two years ago I started using Mr. Warrens investing principles and have been delighted with the results. I had never invested in other than mutual funds and got pretty well cleaned out in Oct.1987. As an investulator, he will teach you to buy stocks on the bargin counter and impart the confidence to hold through the 'shakeouts' for the inevitable big rise. Out of the 25 or so stocks that I chose to follow starting in early 1996, more than 80% have doubled with about 10% going 400-700%! The writings of Mr. Warren offer an exceptional insight into our markets, but they are not for the short term investor (speculator). I can not offer enough praise in a 1000 words!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ted's insight was amazing!","review":"I received my first copy of Ted Warrens' book in 1993. I've had quite a bit of time to test and use his techniques and the results have been phenomenal! Anybody can learn to use the simple, proven strategies after the first reading. And the best part is you can try them on paper and find out that they do indeed work. Ted's insight was amazing to say the least. He understood that all markets are manipulated. But more importantly he understood how to profit from the knowledge. I've read many different \\"how-to\\" publications about the stock market but none can touch the prudent, sound, easy-to-use strategies that Ted Warren taught. I can't think of a better tool for any investor! 'How To Make The Stock Market Make Money For You' gets two thumbs up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best book on technical analysis","review":"Like it or not, Ted Warren's principles actually work, for how else could he - a mere uneducated laborer - invest his way to becoming a millionaire? Yet despite his success in stocks, Mr. Warren struggles to pass on his self-taught secrets to the reader. His chapters lack the focus on step-by-step instruction that a how-to book should have. Also, he does not provide any empirical evidence that his strategy actually works (which is a chronic shortcoming of technical analysis in general). Nevertheless, he urges the reader to adopt a long-term perspective, and his rags-to-riches story - though not skillfully written - is an inspiration."},{"rating":"1","title":"buy this book and you'll probably go broke","review":"If you don't go broke paying the obnoxious price of this book, you probably will go broke using Ted Warren's strategies(if they can be called that). As a professional trader I found this book mildly entertaing. For that I would have given it a rating of 3. But the fact that this book is $75.00(!) makes it a complete rip-off. Buccaneer Books should be ashamed for putting such an outrageous price tag on this book especially when there are much better books around at much lower prices. Ted Warren does not advocate taking losses early (a very dangerous policy) or at all for that matter. Two books that offer much more precise buying and selling strategies(and have made me money) are Nicolas Darvas' \\"How I Made $2,000,000 in the Stock Market\\" and William J.

If you are easily offended by such content, it would be best to steer clear from this collection. On the other hand, these instances are presented in such an honest, innocent, and realistic approach, that the content does not seem pornographic.We get to see the creation, innocence, seduction, and fall of Adam & Even live and in color in the photo-realistic paintings provided in this collection.

The postures in this book are very basic and most of the information here is broken down in just a couple of pages in the book I recommended above. Anything that's left out, like stuff regarding spices, isn't too hard to find on the internet.Now it's not a TERRIBLE thing to have and it kept me occupied for awhile but when you realize you can go way further in the same practice for the same amount of money, why bother?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic fighter pilot film","review":"Iron Eagle is a 1980s fighter pilot film with an enjoyable fiction narrative.

Please remove and replace with this one. If I could, I would rate this book with no stars. This book is not only biased and very slanted towards one point of view, it also contains many factual errors about living people. The author, who claims to be a scientist, did not do his research on Kennewick Man, some of the individuals mentioned in the text, but also on other significant finds which indicate that the early Americans came from areas other than Siberia over the land bridge. This reader from California wishes for a more balanced presentation of scientific fact instead of personal prejudice combined with blatant slanderous statements."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finale of the earth arc","review":"If you've seen earlier episodes, this is where the cast of characters finds out which ones will move on to the space training facility.

But artists are not always the best judge of their own work, and while I wouldn't rank this Christie novel quite as highly as some others, I certainly don't consider it among her weaker efforts. A wealthy father's gift of a famous jewel to a headstrong daughter sets murder in motion, and Poriot must unravel a complex plot involving jewel thieves and con-artists to reach one of Christie's more satisfying solutions. Lightweight, perhaps, but no less charming for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent book","review":"This one doesnot fall in Christie's usual category but nevertheless a very good mystery. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Christie did a much better job on The Orient Express","review":"An heiress murdered, her newly acquired rubies stolen, a lover, estranged husband & mistress, a young girl who has inherited money and Poirot all get entangled in the affair; it's a mess. MURDER ON THE BLUE TRAIN plods along at a snail's pace and it is actually a pleasure to reach the end. The murder victim doesn't earn our compassion or contempt, the side trips into the life of our newly moneyed young heroine are tedious and Poirot muddles through without his usual aplomb. Even when the killer is revealed, it lacks the usual drama of Poirot's theatrics; it's almost an afterthought. Christie does a much better job when she puts Poirot on the Orient Express."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ever felt you didn't care who the murderer was?","review":"Yes, thats exactly how I felt after going thru 25 chapters of this book. As some other reviewer mentioned, Christie seems to have stretched out a little murder mystery into a full-blown novel. Probably the best thing Christie does with this novel is that she reveals the murderer at a point when you are in a quandary as to read on or not. Just too much to read to get to a mediocre ending. I've read 3 Christie books now and this is easily the worst."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trust the Train!","review":"What is your favorite Hercule Poirot mystery? While the classics like \\"Murder on the Orient Express\\" or \\"Death on the Nile\\" or the \\"ABC Murders\\" rate high among possible choices, The Mystery of hte Blue Train is definitely my pick! The story begins on a train bound for the French Riviera. A young heiress on the train is killed and her jewels, priceless rubies, are stolen. Now, Hercule Poirot, who was on the train, must put his \\"little grey cells\\" to the task to solve the murder. One of things I love best about this book, besides being such a classic Christie puzzle, is one of the last lines in the novel. A young girl named Lenox despairs in the face of love and loss. But the wise Poirot advises, \\"You are young, younger than you yourself know. Trust the train, Mademoiselle, for it is le bon Dieu who drives it.\\" \\"Trust the train,\\" murmurs Poirot, \\"And trust Hercule Poirot. He knows.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of her greatest","review":"I have to admit, this one left me a bit confused and uninspired. The final whereabouts of the Heart Afire ruby were a bit vague and I'm not sure how it ended up with who it did, plus the identity of the murderer is easy to guess, as well. In this one in particular, Poirot seems grumpy and pushy and in some passages, downright surly and rude. I didn't find this to be one of his more riveting cases. Murder on the Orient Express uses the train setting much more cleverly and even Miss Marple's 4:15 from Paddington was more involving. This, I hate to say, because I love everything Christie writes, came off rather flat. The characters aren't really interesting, either"},{"rating":"2","title":"1st class operation - all you could want in a supplier","review":"ordered the product from Bluecoat Books and received 2 wks earlier than promised for starters. coming from overseas I think this is amazing.

I've ordered other Triton products and all the others were correct, so I'm blowing this off as a one time packaging problem.The hooks themselves are nice and sturdy and will hold up some real weight, I suspect the pegboard would rip before one of these breaks (I've had some cheap hooks like this just break off when trying to bend them slightly just to make a tool fit well).Very good hooks, but require planning, as you don't want to be moving them around often, since they leave somewhat damaged pegboard behind."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT ANIME VIDEO","review":"Ok this is one of the best anime videos you can buy.

When I read Dune, Herbert made it clear that Paul was like an adult at an early age due to lack of kids his age around the palace on Caladan. So why is Paul kicking his feet up on tables on treating everyone like they're trash? This movie threw way to much crap in that needn't be there, where as the 1984 version left too much out.

Really helps with pronunciation also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dune Review","review":"I liked the 1980's movie better. Sting was more intense as a villian. You could see the drive, desperations and motivations openly expressed in each character then. The sets were slightly out of place, low budget looking and gritty, as you might expect from a time and place far in the future on a desert world. This new movie in comparison was too clean and well-wardrobed. Too many pastels and soft acting. Being drawn into a movie or show is important to me. I want to feel like I am in their world, not mildly interested so that I see them as just actors playing a part from a script. This movie lacked an inner fire. I prefer my Dune memories of the 1980's movie and the first six books. Now the books are a very detailed, religous hard-scifi set well worth the purchase. I give the first six Dune books a 5 rating.

For all the special effects they gave us they never were really able to give us a reason to hate the harkonnens, to like the atreides, or to fear the fremen (or the sardukar). The actors were awful, the costumes were hideous, and the music was mostly heisted from the David Lynch version.

I was ashamed at some of the horrible costumes. (No person in their right mind would be afraid of the Sardaukar in Harrison's version...and the stillsuits didn't even look like they worked).The Baron was a much better one than Lynch's version. He wasn't just disgusting, he was someone you could hate so easily because of his character. The Emperor was much more powerful than the original, and very well cast. Princess Irulan was well cast as well, and her character was a bit more in the open than in the book.Now...some of the sets looked cheesy, but it was a TV mini-series.

Harrison's adaptation lacks the power of the book. I suspect part of the problem is that Frank Herbert's characters and dialog are bigger than life -- and it must be difficult for actors to make that fine balance between overplaying the part to point of sounding silly and grandiose (e.g. Ian McNeice), or underplaying the part and sounding wooden (e.g. William Hurt and Alec Newman). Harrison and Co. made a valiant effort all the same.

Also, most of this movie was shot in a weird orange or blue light, and in sceens with the Harkonnens, the camara was tilted at a funny angle.

Unfortunately this is a version that went bad from the beginning. Compare Alec Newman with Kyle MacLachlan in the scene with the pain box. Alec is barely registering any emotion while Kyle is barely able to hold it together. It's a great introduction in what is to come later. This is pretty much how the whole production feels. The acting is stiff (William Hurt is terrible as Duke Leido), direction is very slowly paced, cheap special effects.Even the music in Lynch's version has a driving theme that's swirls into the passion of the attack with the Freman atop the worms. Fantastic.Lynch's version is far from perfect and I definitely prefer the version without the narration.

Just watching it you will never know how powerful Jessica is. Where is Tuffir Hawat? -- that guy isn't he. Many important details were cut out, such as the secret Bene Gesserit message Lady Fenring left for Jessica. And so on. The special effects are poor; take a look at the Maud'dib rat of the desert -- they took it from the Muppets Show!Please don't give up reading the book because of the bad impression the DVD might give you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Centers on the Fremen","review":"While not perfect I'd have to rate this far and away above the Lynch movie. Besides hackign the plot to death in totally unecessary ways, the Lynch movie lsot the real story-- the story of the Fremen.This is emphaticly **not**the case in Harrison's movie which centers around them and their struggle against opression. As a sci fi allegory combining both the mythology of the middle east and the history of the Brittish empire's emperial presence, this movie succeeds as the book does.Thsi is not to say its a perfect film. Tehre are some scenes in the middle of the film where they clearly made due with inferior and obvious abckdrops to save a few bucks in production. Also, someone should point the scene designer at the dictioanry definition of an ornithopter, as none of the vehicles in this movie were in fact ornithopters at all.Still, gvien that Dune was oen of the formative books of my youth this movie left me happy, whereas Lynch's movie left me depressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Effects, Bad acting.","review":"While this movie has good effects, the acting is *terrible*. In the beginning the series follows the book closely, but towards the middle-end it starts to rush through the storyline. And some of the characters are not well represented. That said, if you haven't read the book, or books, you might enjoy the movie. But if you're a die hard sci-fi fan, I stronly recommend you read the book, which is philosophically superior."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love SciFi","review":"I love SciFi and this one of my favorites. I was glad when this came out on DVD. I also have the origial verson. I liked the original version because it has Patrick Stewart, and I liked Sting also for his part.

I quit watching after the first episode because the script, acting, and costumes were atrocious. This is the age of CGI like the Matrix and Toy Story 2, yet the Dune mini-series didn't even have half the quality of special effects needed to save it.My disappointment about the original Dune movie was that not enough of the Dune world was able to fit in the it. I wanted more. The costume and set designers of the movie were able to put on screen what I could not muster from my imagination with my best attempt. I must admit I started to watch the mini-series with very high expectations, but the show was barely watchable."},{"rating":"1","title":"TRUST ME ...","review":"Trust me on this one ... having read the entire DUNE series 317 times, I justifiably consider myself an expert ... dare I say, even more so than Frank Herbert himself. I can list literally dozens of scenes and characters that don't perfectly match MY mind's vision of the story ... and I should know.

I started to, but I got interrupted and never finished it (which may indicate how much of an impression the first few chapters made on me). However, I have read a lot of science fiction.I liked this series. I thought the graphics were spectacular. The acting wasn't always that good, but I was so involved in the story that I didn't really notice. As a general sci-fi fan, I agree that this went leaps and bounds past the movie.Maybe if you've read Dune, you're at a disadvantage in appreciating this work. Perhaps a fan of lighter science fiction will enjoy it more. I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very very good","review":"I was pleasantly surprised by how much I dug this tv movie.

Despite the claims on the 'Technical Info' page that this DVD is anamorphic, it is not. Also, the audio hasn't been remixed to be 5.1 surround; it's only Dolby 2.0. Finally, the disc is lacking extra footage that was cut from the US TV version of the mini-series to accomodate commercial breaks, rumored to be about 20 minutes of additional material.Supposedly, this \\"Director's Cut\\" version of the Dune mini-series is owned by a German company who wanted quite a bit of money for its' use in the U.S. According to the series' production company, New Amsterdam Entertainment, it is quite likely that a \\"Collectors Edition\\" of Dune will be released at some point in the future with the longer version of the series and a 5.1 soundtrack. I don't want to buy the same disc twice; I'll wait for the Collector's Edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"Many don't like Dune but I love it.

Yes, the Lynch version has its problems, but it still has a better overall feel than this adaptation, which disappointed me greatly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawwwwwn...","review":"First, I must mention that I simply love Dune - as it was originally written. Though many have scoffed at the David Lynch film, after seing this TV version - I must now say that the Lynch version is brilliant and superior. This newest attempt is so bad, and so boring. The casting is terrible. I cannot imagine worse casting. Paul is a whiney, immature, wanna be Mark Hamill from the original Star Wars... The viewer cannot avoid developing a hatred for him. In fact, one cannot even develop any interest for any character in the film. William Hurt, although a fine actor, is terribly cast as Duke Leto. Weak. Paul's mother is a Hillary CLinton look alike. Avoid this waste.."},{"rating":"1","title":"a movie on the cheap?","review":"All i can say is that I am glad I rented this DVD before I bought it! The acting is wooden and the effects are cheap. the set painting is truly terrible, often with a complete lack of perspective.A shame, it is a complete hash of a great story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far less interesting than the original","review":"My hopes were extremely high for this adaptation, as I am a fan of the books and of the 1984 film version, and I was very, very disappointed. The acting is terrible... Duke Leto has no personality, Paul is a whiny baby during the first couple of hours, and the supporting cast has nobody even remotely interesting. They managed to use nearly the same dialogue as the 1984 version, and add in long periods of looking at the desert, apparently to kill time.The producers of this fiasco would have been better served to have tried to do a sequel to the 1984 version, than rather to copy it using worse actors and worse effects. The Dune series of books deserves far better treatment than this. My advice is to get the 1984 version and read the entire series in paperback!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Battlefield Dune","review":"OK, the title for this review isn't fair. I shouldn't insult Battlefield Earth like that. While they got a few things right - the look of the Navigator, the initial sandworm sequence - this series is a plodding, soul-less mess. Why is this book so hard to adapt? They had SIX HOURS to tell the story. Why did they leave so much out and add so much that had nothing to do with anything? Why did they make Paul so whiny and annoying? Why did William Hurt stumble around like he was on tranquilizers? Why were the Fremen running around outside during the day without stillsuits (Paul and Chani have a PICNIC outside without suits on!)? How the Fremen remain masters of stealth with eyes that glow in the dark? Why did the Baron have to rhyme his last line before every commercial break? Why did Feyd have a glowing white tortilla sticking out of his back? And just who is responsible for all those goofy hats? I could go on, but why bother. Don't even rent this one. Just read the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Speechless....nearly.","review":"Never have I seen such absolute garbage.

Maybe it's the best they can understand. \\"Dune\\" is a superb novel but this film bears little relation to it aside from the title. As other reviews have noted, there's no acting whatsoever. Direction is at a loss too. It's as though somebody \\"wrote\\" a collection of scenes, working from a Cliff's Notes of \\"Dune\\", and the \\"director\\" just pasted scenes together. If you really think you MUST see this and have nothing else to do, do yourself a favor and rent it. I think you'll find that one viewing is more than enough unless you use it as a cure for insomnia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gawd-awful","review":"Where do I begin, there was so much wrong with it! The costumes!! What on earth were they thinking? And to have the baron all clean as he was, did the director of this thing even read the books? The settings were wrong entirely! The clothing was wrong! The ages of the characters even were wrong. The entire thing was wrong and I am glad to be rid of my copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"falling short","review":"Having recently seen the Lynch movie and having reread the books after some years, I looked forward to this series as the film tried valliantly but fell short. I hoped with modern digital effects and a longer play time maybe this could be better.Sadly NO while the sets and backdrops are very good indeed and capture the feeling of the books very well 8 out of 10 that's were it ends.The script is hopeless I don't expect verbatum from the novels but some point of contact would be appreciated 1 out of 10.Now to the acting Hurt very good, but for the rest third rate would be complementary. But what really saddens is the portrayl of Muad'Dib as a spoilt tempremental American teenager with no self controll the opposite of what he is supposed to be I gave up on the DVD after struggling for an hour and will not be going back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting additions to the book","review":"This movie combined a lot of material taken directly from the book with some very interesting additions and alterations. Without giving anything away, some of the background plots are fleshed out, and there is at least one major change at the end which will make the next mini-series interesting too. If you enjoy science fiction, this movie will show you how it should be done. Lavish sets, bizarre and beautiful costumes, interesting plot, well-acted. Very well worth seeing."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the...<naughty expletives>?!","review":"I have read the entire series including the prequals by Brian. I came to Dune kind of backwards, I played the computer game, then saw the Lynch version, and then read the books, so bear with me. I greatly disliked the set and costume design of this production. The Bene Gesserit are above all practical, hats with \\"wings\\" are not practical. Many of the scenes in this miniseries seem rushed and lacked impact. I would not recomend this miniseries to anyone who's first exposure to Dune was the Lynch production, you will be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nicely done","review":"I like this miniseries much better than the movie from the 80's. I have read Dune twice, both versions new and old stray from the book. But I find this one much more appealing and interesting. When I try to play the older movie at home my wife is totally disgusted by much of Harkonen's actions (many of the disgusting segments weren't even in the book in the first place-like spitting on Lady Jessica's eye). In response to the previous reviewer who thinks that anyone who likes this new version is uneducated etc., who do you think you are? To imply that someone is uneducated because they like something that you do not is a truly uneducated remark. I only wish Mr. Herbert were still here to give us his opinion of this miniseries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad mini-series","review":"I love the book, so I'm doing the horrible thing of reviewing a film against the book it's based on. In that spirit, I have to say this was a terrible rendition of DUNE. To start with, the character portrayals are way off base. William Hurt's performance is wooden; the guy playing Paul mistakes his literary counterpart's confident self-assurance with haughty arrogance; and Jessica is turned into a royal priss instead of the world weary intelligent woman she was in the novel. The sets were terrible and generic. Showing the navigator was just dumb--Hitchcockian allusion is the way to go with the navigators. And all of it looked like every other sci-fi miniseries, thus reducing a founding novel into an uninspired, derivative TV show. If you want the best movie version of DUNE, go rent Star Wars. It's a much better translation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad","review":"Have to take it for what it is, a pretty good attemp at a very complex story.....Don't pick it apart and you will enjoy it much better....after all it is NOT the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The acting needs work, but other then that...","review":"Much better then the movie that was released in theatersThe cinematography is a little odd but at least this one does a much better job of following the storyline then the David Lynch version did.My one beef with this movie is that some of the time when you have a camera shot in this movie it is situated in wide pan, not close up. This means to me that the camera shots look fake(really fake) in some placesI think that the little parets the scifi channel added actually made the story better.Overall-Some parts great some parts not so great but it is still allot better then the 1984 version."},{"rating":"2","title":"BadMoon","review":"This is afterall a work of fiction...not reallife. As such it accomplishes what it set out to do...to tell the story of Dune.

If you like a book version of a movie...no movie can live up to that...no movie can be better than your imagination. However the first Dune confused me and turned me off...this one I understand, i see the politics...the layers... the play of one caracter against another...as far as the idea of some of the caracters being wooden...i have noticed the higher the responisiblily of people...the more wooden they seem...its not how they feel...its how they come across however. The only problem with this film that i didnt like was a jump in time...actually two jumps...one when Paul all of sudden was a parent...the other...but i get ahead of myself...check it out and see if you agree and see if you find the other jump..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"For those that read and loved the book, this is a must-see mini-series.

If you like the books, I guarantee you will like this DVD. Although the special effects were lacking somewhat, the acting and cast were superb. All I can say is that if you get a chance to buy or see this DVD, you should.I have also seen the film made in 1984, and I found it terrible. It didn't follow the book, especially the ending.

I wish I could give it less than one star. I have just seen episode 2 on cable here in Australia. I love Dune the book, and although I think the 1984 film version was far too brief to do the characters justice, it was a valiant attempt, with excellent cast.This new offering does not do justice to the book. I don't mind some poetic license; but this offering completely ignores the book for most of the time. I did not like the 1st episode, I sat in pain just to force myself to endure the rubbish that was the second expisode, I wont be watching any of the rest.I was so disappointed in this that I went out immediate to re-rent the 1984 version, just to wash the rubbish from my mind.Poor acting, poor casting, a nd a butcher let loose with the script.

Was this the movie Dune or a free for all blood and sex showing party?","review":"I recognized the movie was an attempt at Dune with the sand, Arakis, and the giant worms, but poor acting, stupid costumes, poor acting again, and blood and sexual themes all over the screen. It looked like they hired the WB network to re-make a creation of a classic movie, and it's rank with WB style acting and plot. Don't get or watch this movie, go for the 1984 classic Dune Directed by David Lynch. With Francesca Annis, Leonardo Cimino, Brad Dourif, Kyle MacLachlan, and (the best) Sting with his stand in part as Feyd-Rautha."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, bad, bad, ...","review":"The costumes are funny: there are triangles behind heads, cheap-looking polyester shiny clothes on the Imperial family, boat-sized hats, Irulan's butterfly party dress, and Paul's white bathrobe at the end (no wonder Newman looks so glum).Another major downer (and I mean downer!) is William Hurt. His performance was so dull, depressing, and somnabulistic, I dreaded seeing him. OK, so he's doing the role for the money. But it wouldn't have hurt him to show a slight interest in the proceedings.The production looked really cheap, and Harrison, the director, commented on this aspect. They should have saved some money by getting simple costumes, and not hiring Hurt!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultimate Cure for Insomnia","review":"I'm an avid reader and movie-goer with a high tolerance for pain but this movie I just could not sit through without dozing off."},{"rating":"1","title":"I cannot believe the high ratings for this rot.","review":"While the Lynch version had many flaws, this version demonstrates what a superior director Lynch is. TERRIBLE acting (puppets are more expressive) and an overall vision that lacks the creativity and originality of the first version mark the Sci-Fi channels attempt at filming \\"Dune\\" as an also-ran in a race that nobody won."},{"rating":"1","title":"disgrace","review":"Ok, most people have already said all the main points for why this movie was terrible so i will try to keep this simple. I have read Dune about 20 or 30 times, i have now lost count, but needless to say i love the book. Being a fan of the book, i can say that despite its differences, I love the David Lynch movie. One reviewer said it best when he said it was great because it could stand alone as a movie of its own. The sci fi verson wasnt good alone, or as a person who had read the book. One of my biggest complaints was with Mohiam who wasnt in any way like the reverend mother in the book and with Paul, who was simply cast poorly. Anyway, the Lynch version is a really entertaining movie that is fun to watch despite the differences from the book. This version on the other hand will have most dune fans frustrated the whole time. My advice is to buy the David Lynch version and rent this version if you really must see it. Otherwise, stick to the book and watch another movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a very boring mini-series","review":"First let me say this, I have not seen the David Lynch version of Dune. It is hard for me to believe that it could be any worse than this mini-series.

This mini-series would be a good cure for people who have insomnia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short and sweet...","review":"Im going to be short and sweet with my review. Im really glad that i rented this film instead of bought it. This has to be the WORST version of Dune that i have ever seen and i would rate it as one of my worst 5 movies of all time. Yes, there were differences between this version and the one from '84. This version is truer to the book in some respects, but i swear that noone proofread the script before they started filming. Lots of scenes didnt even make sense because they would leave very important details out. There were no real actors, the backdrops were a joke, and they didnt pay nearly the attention to water that either the book or the original movie did. Im a big time Dune fan. I was hoping that this version would cover parts of the book that the original did not. But, i didnt even bother watching the last hour of the movie. Sorry, but the film sucked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stunk, read the book instead","review":"After struggling to watch the first three hours I couldn't find the strength in me to finish off the last hour and a half. Although it followed the story line pretty well it didn't seem to really connect well (for example Paul had no real transition from a 15 year old kid to Muad'dib--just happened) This was a very poor adaptation of Herbert's masterpiece, read the book and you will know what I mean. This seemed more like an after-school special effort than an epic sci-fi movie. I was also disappointed with enormous amounts of \\"skin\\" that they put into the movie.David Lynch's 1984 version (although quite strange like all David Lynch movies) was much better. There were great acting performances in Lynch's version. This version seemed over-acted and half-hearted all at the same time"},{"rating":"1","title":"This mini-series is not up to par","review":"I absolutley hated this mini-series. Everyone is saying that this one is better than David Lynch's feature adapation and with the exception of a few special effects, they are wrong. In their adaptation, Sci-Fi channel has taken the liberty of adding things to the screenplay that were not there in the book. At least Lynch's adaptation was faithful to Herbert's story. And the actor that they got to play Paul, where did they did him up? The casting director should have gotten fired for that one. For me, the original is the best, and Kyle McLachlan IS Paul Atreides."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frank Herbert's Dune (TV Mini-Series)","review":"It is amazing that the Sci-Fi channel could produce such slop.

Given a longer screening time, I would have thought the characters and storyline could have been fleshed out a lot more.

Read the book and you will agree."},{"rating":"1","title":"As dry as the desert this is set in.","review":"This movie takes place on a dry desert of a planet, where the new ruling family must prompt the flow of a mystery \\"spice\\". Unbeknownst to the new family, the Evil Emperor is awaiting with a huge plot to destroy them once they have accomplished the flow of spice. After that, it's kind of endless. There are battles, desert worms, fierce fighting and strange beings, and the special effects are fabulous. One young boy sees visions in which he is the Messiah of the freaky desert people, come to save their tribe from extinction. I never did figure out if, in the end, he actually fills that role. William Hurt is the new leader, temporarily. He plays a good and solid part, while whoever plays his wife is a bit daft. Star Wars like vehicles traverse the air over the unrelenting dustiness of the desert, but it isn't time for Darth Vader to move over just yet. Dune is dry, it is long, only mildly interesting, and not worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than The Movie","review":"I saw this on VHS, so will comment only on the drama and not the DVD-related technical features. Compared to the movie, the TV mini-series captured the DUNE universe better. The movie was too short and very disjointed--very hard to follow, plus a lot of oddness and gratuitous grossness that wasn't in the book (heart plugs!) Some of the acting in the mini-series was a bit weak (esp. William Hurt--half asleep? still in the Accidental Tourist role?) Kyle MacLachlan as Paul Atreities lacked a convincing messianic character. One reviewer found him \\"too fragile.\\" I found him to be a sort of Luke Skywalker without a cause, despite the murder of his father by the Dune evil force, Baron Harkonnen. A number of reviewers were put off by the foreign accents--I think it created a real cosmopolitan feel.Overall, a very enjoyable movie to watch at one sitting on a long Saturday afternoon, especially when it's raining outdoors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"This movie is perhaps one of the worst movies I've ever seen. (I haven't read any of the other reviews, but I'm sure they've said everything I am going to say.)1)The actors in this movie either need to take lessons or get new jobs.2)I've only read this once and I can see how much the book gives you, and if I hadn't read the book I would be lost. The movie doesn't do a good job of explaining what's going on.3)They over use the special effects. Every scene it seemed to be powered by these effects in some way or another. If they had used some of the funding to shoot at some place that actually resembled Dune it would have improved the movie alot.The only reason you should consider watching this movie is if your family is being held at gunpoint and the only way to save them is to watch this movie.I'm sure there are more points, but I have a feeling this movie has been attacked enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"What about the story?","review":"I'll make this short. This version of the Dune saga is touted as a more accurate rendition of Herberts vision. It is not. How can it be more accurate when they significantly change the plot? Any cinematic version of this story should be dark at times. The Harkonens are sadistic monsters. They should be portrayed as such. How can Paul's \\"son\\" be killed? He did not have a son; he had twins - a boy and a girl. His son goes on to be emperor of the universe for the next 10,000 years.

Lynch is better!","review":"This movie in no way compares to the original Film. While it is one thing to tell verbatim the story in several hours(And quite dryly I might add), it is the true artist that can tell such a sweeping scope in just a two hour movie and still keep the ambience that the book had. Everytime I watch the original movie, I still get a shiver down my spine when Aliah says,\\"he IS the kwisatch haderratz!\\" At the end of this new weak mini-series, I just yawned, rolled over, and farted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor - If you ever read the bood, stay away!","review":"(Saw this on the Sci-Fi channel last nite.)

They changed the story, god knows why.If you pre-ordered this, cancel now before it is too late!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dune: The Real Book Adaption","review":"This mini-series does justice to the novel in this one. I'd say between the movie and the series; the later is better. The new version explained that the two fighting houses were mining spice. Spice is what makes the universe whole. Like heating fuel is to us. It runs the starships and gives the society an industry it depends on.In the film there was too much territory covered in too short a period. The characters were too rapidly introduced. The new version gives us a glimpse of what inspired the Star Wars myths. I know this novel was written at time when science fiction was seen as low brow literature. Herbert has proven them wrong. I'd like to see all the books adapted for telivison. If a little drama and additional writing is needed; so be it. Long live Dune."},{"rating":"1","title":"How come anybody liked this?","review":"I really am mystified as to why there are so many good reviews for this depressingly poor mini-series.I will not get into details, let me just say that the directing is awful, the acting terrible and the fx sophomoric.I had high hopes for this, as I thought a mini series was the only way to do such a masterpiece any justice. God was I wrong...After watching only about twenty minutes I was so depressed I actually turned it off. My first impression was Batman of the 60's. Yes, it does have tilted cameras and garish costumes.Suffice it to say that, flawed as it is, Lynch's movie is a much, much better adaptation than this film-school project on steroids."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's terrible!","review":"You just look at Paul, his mother and the reverend mother Gaius Helen. The actors say proper words, do proper moving etc, but they're not what they trying to pretend to be. Would you believe that this pimply guy is Muad'dib? Well, maybe you would. But not I :) Look at Kurosava's \\"Seven samurai\\" to see how what real actors should be.

I was very excited about it. I thought, they can't possibly screw up such an unbelievable story. But they did.If you have read the books and think you'll like the movies, please don't do it. It's terrible.

CGI Graphics are nice and stunning (I like the sandworms) except for the background walls for desert scenes. It looks obviously fake and unnatural. Well adapted from the book on screen. A great 5 hour movie. Costumes look cool.But the book is alot better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Visually arresting but slow, slow, slow","review":"I really tried to like this. I had read the Dune books years ago and really wanted to get immersed in a wide-ranging epic movie. But this is just boring and slow. It moves along at a glacial pace and the actor that plays Paul has utterly no charisma - he just seems uninteresting. Even William Hurt, who undeniably is an outstanding actor, seems wooden and uninspired. On the plus side, as other reviewers have noted, the special effects are generally good and the sets, particularly the banquet scenes, are magnificent and colorful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good all around.","review":"All I can say is this is just good. I'm a big dune fan and I didn't like the original movie, it failed, but when I saw this one, it was like Whoa! I loved it."},{"rating":"1","title":"COSTUMES AND ACTING RUINED IT!","review":"I'm one of the few people who cannot bash David Lynch's dark and dramatic film, especially the 190 version of that monumental film. I did get excited when I heard that the Sci-Fi Channel was doing a new miniseries based on the Frank Herbert novel. I could only sit through the first three hours before I decided not to watch any more. I always thought of Herbert's novel as dark, but this miniseries is anything but. It has some great visual effects and some fine fight sequences. But this version's gripping story of murder, revenge, love, religion and political intrigue is lost in a mishmash of horrifying costumes, lousy set designs, bright scenery and horrible acting. The only good performance in the film is that of the planet Arrakis, or Dune. Watch the David Lynch film instead of this horrible waste of time and energy. At least Lynch's film has character \\"oomph\\" thanks to a fine cast (Unlike this piece of ...). Grade: D-"},{"rating":"1","title":"not engaging","review":"you know i watched a little bit of this on SCIFI the other day and was quite unimpressed. yes the costuming was impressive, but man, it was just not engaging. i didn't care for what the characters had to say. Duke Leto did not look like a duke at all, hunched over and speaking softly. terrible casting in this film. Paul Attreides looked like he was always in a sour mood. i must say that i did wish that the older version had more of the political games found in the book, but i find it a far better version of the story as it engages you in the world Frank Herbert created for us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie magic at its best.","review":"Sci-fi miniseries about a young man who becomes a messiah to a group of tribesmen on a desert planet called Arrakis. Frank Herbert's adaptation is an epic presentation, running at 265 minutes (long but never dull), boasts fine performances (Especially Saskia Reeves), incredible special effects and production values, and exciting action sequences. Often awe-inspiring, always entertaining and engrossing, a true example of pure movie magic at its best. Immeasurably superior to the 1984 David Lynch version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cool sci-fi flick.","review":"Very cool sci-fi adventure flick about a young messiah who rises to power on a desert planet. Great production design and special effects to boot."},{"rating":"1","title":"How could they have gotten it SO WRONG","review":"The book was about the characters. This mini-series didn't give any insight into the characters as Frank Herbert wrote them...What character development there was, was completely wrong. If you read and loved the book, don't bother with this, it will bore you to tears. At least the movie version was fun to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Way better than the David Lynch version","review":"Unlike David Lynch's take on it, this one you can actually follow without having read the book first. There are no annoying thought voiceovers from any of the characters, no heart plugs or \\"weirding module\\" sonic blasters, no hideously cheesy special effects. Ian MacNeice's Baron Harkonnen is much more entertaining, more sarcastic and witty than the previous one. The Fremen are painted to be more primitive than before, it's not as melodramatic, and stays pretty true to the original novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of SciFi Channel 25th Anniversary Edition Mini-Series","review":"Call me a \\"classicist\\". I enjoyed the original movie, based on the original Herbert book, much more than the mini-series produced by SciFi Channel. The SciFi Channel's version is based on the 25th Anniversary rewrite of Dune. Does William Hurt seem to sleep-walk through the first part? I couldn't think of a less exciting portrayal of Duke Leto. And he is given top billing? Like the 25th anniversary book, this film version lacks the character development and intensity of the original. There is, in my opinion, over-emphasis on the Fremen adoration of Paul, and little time to character development; the characters of Thufir, Gurney, Duncan, Pieter hardly seem to exist."},{"rating":"2","title":"brilliant","review":"I bought this dvd for my husband he thought it was brilliant! He is a real big fan of DUNE.He had read the book which was jam packed full of detail and this one was the closest to the book, not like the original one he has on video.To all Dune fans this a must watch movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Version by Far!","review":"There is no question that this version of Dune is far better than David Lynch's attempt in 1984. This version gave a more accurate presentation of the story and what truly drove Paul to do what he had to do. I only hope that if Mr. Lynch wants to improve his adaptaion that he takes both versions of his Dune and use this newer verion as model to re-edit his and maybe release a better one, but only maybe."},{"rating":"1","title":"mediocre all the way","review":"weak actors, unbalanced storytelling (sluggish start, hasty second half, abrupt ending)...prove once again: Dune cannot be filmed"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gift","review":"This was a gift for someone so I did not see the movie. I can tell you that I had no problems with the order and that it came quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice try, but not cigar. . .","review":"Amateurish acting, costumes that look like they came from a high school drama department, laughable special effects (not all), and, most importantly, totally devoid of Herbert's vision. Anyone who really likes this version does not properly understand Dune.Lynch's Dune is weird and difficult to understand if you haven't read the book, but it is much darker and much closer to Herbert's vision, unlike this version."},{"rating":"1","title":"look to lynch","review":"I found this interpretation of Frank Herbert's Dune novel insulting. If you haven't read the book, I recommend watching David Lynch's version of the movie. Lynch's version envisions the personalities involved with a vigor that the TV series lacks entirely. The TV series has Paul, the hero, as a whining non-participating member of the plot, almost like his arm is being twisted to embark on this universe-changing story. The acting was flat almost all around. I was sorry to see William Hurt in this as I find him to be a good actor, but nothing he could have done would have saved this haphazard attempt to recreate Frank Herbert's brilliance. Again I recommend Lynch's interpretation. It's a bit bizarre in places but reflects well upon the book. Of course if you haven't done so, read the book and you'll know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dune from the Mirror-Universe!","review":"I've read the book, watched the original film by David Lynch and just watched this mini-series. Well, I tried. At the beginning of the second part, I just couldn't take it any more. The Bene Gesserit are portrayed as helpless females (especially his mother who IMHO can really take care of herself!), Paul Atreides resembles a high school bully with bad attitude who chases girls for a living and let's not talk about the finer points of Dune's multi-faceted story-line. The book is my favorite, but even David Lynch's adaption is much more in the spirit of the original (NOT in the specific details, obviously!) than this worthless version! Enough said."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Doom of Dune","review":"Very disapointed in this movie. The actors/actresses potrayed the characters poorly. I didn't like the way they changed personalities of the characters. The visuals were fairly good and that is the only good thing I can say about this. The acting wasn't up to par, I felt as though I were watching a bad high school production. I ralize it was made for TV, but daytime tv has better acting. I don't recomend watching this, read the book, or watch the actual movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, don't waste 5 hours of your short life on this film","review":"This movie was a huge disappointment. The acting was abysmal, the story developed silly themes that were irrelavent in the book, the costumes were laughable, and the sets and special effects were hit and miss. I suggest any Dune fans forget that this mini-series was created. In sum, this was one of the worst viewing experiences I can remember."},{"rating":"1","title":"The cash must flow","review":"Let me say right off that I have not read the book, though I am told that this TV-adaption is true to Herbert's novel.Be that as it may, \\"Dune\\" clearly suffers from the restrictions of the TV-format. In other words money. An epic like \\"Dune\\" cannot be done (well) on a TV-budget. Sad but true. The computer generated scenes/backgrounds look cheap in most cases. Only a few of the flight-scenes look OK. Actors are another issue. Less money means worse actors. William Hurt (who plays Duke Leto Atreides) is - of course - one of the few exceptions.There are two reasons why I give it two stars instead of one. Firstly, some of the fight-scenes look pretty good. Secondly, adapting a 'inaccessible' story like \\"Dune\\" to the screen is bold. And bold TV/movie projects should be rewarded because in these days they are rare.If you want a accurate adaption of the book by Frank Herbert - buy this one. If you want a good movie - get the one by David Lynch."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"I eagerly anticipated the release of this miniseries, being a huge Dune fan. I was, unfortunately, disappointed by the finished product. Now the 1984 movie changed some fairly important plot elements to fit the Dune story into two hours but it did maintain the integrity of the characters. This Dune miniseries also altered the plotline but at the same time made significant changes to the personas of major characteres. As I watched it, I felt that the miniseries was untrue to Frank Herbert's legend, and as the it went on, I became only more convinced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, Awful, Awful","review":"Awful, Awful, Awful.

This is due to the fact that there is quite a bit of non-Linux specific security tips, like physical security. The downsides to this book are many. Lots of file output and lots of resources to look up but not a lot of content. It just seemed to me like most of this book was filler and I didn't get anything out of it. This is perhaps because I have been involved with Linux and computer security in general for a few years. So, from an experienced systems administrator's point of view: everything in this book is available on the web and can be easily found.

This book doesn't. The first part of the book covers Linux basics in an easy-to-understand manner, but with a focus on security. I found the information on partitioning for security in the installation chapter to be very helpful. As the author points out, most Linux books cover installation from a procedural perspective with no consideration for the fact that you may be using the system as an Internet server where security is important. Naturally the book gets progressively more technical, but thanks to the presentation of the material in the early chapters, the more technical info is easily understood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"I've been using linux since 1995.

The other performers don't fare any better from Casper Von Dien's playing a GI Joe of skydivers, Ron Silver as Baldwin's boss and Dennis Rodman, too.

I would rather use a zip tie then hang my maglite on this.Every time I would sit down, the button would pop off, or every time I have to run or jog, the button would pop off.I don't know, if you just need something to temporarily place your maglite in on your belt, it works, because the only thing that does work with this is the plastic D-Cell loop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Newer LED Success!","review":"I had the old three watt led maglite with three AA's.

The high and low settings are absolutely wonderful and useful. The unit is far brighter than the old 3 watt model and the batteries last a little longer than advertised. I take about a 3 week to month window to use up the batteries at work. The 3 watt lasted about 2 weeks tops. The SOS and blink mode are not useful to me but some survivalist would enjoy that feature.

It's a decent flashlight--just don't expect it to be that much better than the original ones. If you don't own a maglite already, you might want to get the LED version.

I had to repeatedly do this every few weeks. I also had brand new batteries on several occasions leak within a very short period of time in both lights. The light was always kept in the house and was never exposed to adverse weather conditions. I'm guessing it was some type of reactions with the types of metals used in the light since batteries from the same package worked fine and never leaked in other devices. These lights appear sturdy and well constructed, but their lack of reliability was very frustrating and both of mine eventually went in the trash and I would never buy another one.

The Maglite AA LED finally made it to South Dakota and I'm quite happy with it. I like the focused beam and the same head twist switch as the regular Mini Mag.

For the same price at this over-hyped, underperformer I could get a flashlight 5x as powerful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic","review":"I bought this thinking it was one of the nice law enforcement grade holsters. I was wrong. This is a cheap made in china piece. The leather is not high quality at all, the ring is made of HOLLOW PLASTIC NOT METAL! The snap is also made of plastic. I gave it two stars because one, I know it will break soon, two, it is not what I wanted, and three it is not maglite quality. I have 7 maglites, all of which I have bought from the maglite dealer on amazon. I have never been unsatisfied by the dealer here, or the maglite brand.

He uses the basics which is great! It requires items you already have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good resource","review":"Book may have been a bit worse for wear when it arrived at me, but after reviewing it i can see why it was so well loved. This is truely worth the money spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aren't too clear I my thoughts for this book..","review":"This book is, like another reviewer though, lacking. It has more pictures and illustrations - which are beautiful - and less real, hard-core information on Earth Magick. It also has more spells then you even know what to do with - which is good if that's what you're looking for. I on the other hand, was looking for more of a historically factual book then a spells and ritual book. If you're looking for information, go else where to find it. If you're looking for simplistic spells, you're right on the money with this book. I believe that your view of this book has to depend on what you were looking for before you bought it, truthfully. So, I guess I was looking in the wrong place.."},{"rating":"2","title":"A plethora of ritual ideas","review":"Though I'm not to fond of Cunningham's writing on religious subjects, I found this work on earth-based magic to be particularly interesting and worth my time. I read about beautiful and inspiring types of spellwork and divination that I probably wouldn't have thought of otherwise. This book truly teaches you to make use of the most potent tools available to pagan practitioners today-- those in nature. As someone who is quite offended by the rampant materialism of witches today, I was delighted to see a book that rejected the purchase of magical accessories in favor of using the power of the earth itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reach out and Touch the Magic","review":"One need not extol Scott Cunningham's many virtures as a writer, and this is but another of the fine volumes from the sweet Soul of the late author. In this small book, magical workings are explained, and spells given. It is not a study of high magic, nor is it intended to be. Instead, it is an introduction into the means of acheiving change by means not yet understood by science. However, it is not a primer on magic either. Those areas are better covered in Cunninghams's earlier works of Wicca and Living Wicca. This work presupposes a working knowledge of the Craft, and of the practitioner's serious desire to improve his magical ability. It is also a joyous celebration of a way of life in harmony with the divine and the world as we know it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful book","review":"Terrific collection of simple spells to help you along your journey through life. very good, Very complete, but a little hard to navigate."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is really cool!","review":"This book (and pretty much every book by Scott Cunningham) is great for new Wiccans.

But at least we have his wonderful books."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is fascinating, teaches a lot.","review":"This fascinating book taught me a lot of what is important in the world around you.

It has nice and simple technics of magical practices. There is a clear explanation on the elements and of a simple way to work with them. I advise you read this book with an open mind and when you practice it's rituals do it with no doubt and with intense feeling and concentration or they may fail. I study magick for some years, and this book would had been a help in my begining. For highest studies on magick read Eliphas Levi and Papus, read also S.L. MacGreagor Mathers."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is awesome","review":"I came across it while helping a friend move and have been entranced by it ever since. It told me a lot of interesting things that I wouldn't have discovered if I hadn't found it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Earth Power","review":"This book didn't really jive with me. The writing was just way too simplistic. I guess I thought I'd get a book that was more in depth. This wasn't it.I did end up giving this book away to someone who was looking for a copy. They were tight on cash, I wasn't looking to keep this book, so I passed it on to them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat childish","review":"I didn't find this book as great as other readers have but I must admit that I didn't read it thouroughly. As I remember I got the impression that it was more about using the earth as a resource then using you're mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing and simplistic","review":"It's a great reminder that the most potent magick comes from oneself and Mother Earth. Complex rituals need not apply!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique","review":"Although people may think that is it too simple. I find that the spells and suggestions are great. It's been many years since I've practiced and wanted to see how you can simplify your technique but still make it effective. Although I admit some of the writing is childish but it teaches us that magick is indeed found in the simplest form. It gives you a more broaden perspective of the art instead of thinking elaborate for your workings. Definitely intended for nature lovers and to learn how to make use of your magick with the natural elements around you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dissapointing","review":"1. Very poor quality edition: the book has a lot of pictures. The quality of pictures is unacceptable. You can hardly see the details. 2.

So it was only right for me to buy God's Son. Ok, It might not have the creativity that Stillmatic and Lost Tapes has, but the knowledge he spreads on the cd makes artists like Commom look like high school drop outs. Songs like \\"I Can\\", \\"Revolutionary Warfare\\" and \\"Heaven\\" can teach alot more about life than a text book can. Other songs I really like on God's Son are \\"Get Down\\", \\"Book of Rhymes\\" and \\"Mastermind\\". If you liked Stillmatic and The Lost Tapes, you will definitly like his new cd. Its no longer Nasty, Escobar or Nastradamus, Its God's Son era now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snoozer","review":"This CD is flat out boring.

Sorry Nas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Liked the CD, but issues with \\"I can\\"","review":"I liked the CD, but I have issues with the song \\"I can\\". The song is a positive message to children, encouraging them to stay in school and such, and I'm glad a rapper is encouraging school instead of 40s and blunts, but in it NAS attempts to say Africans are Egyptians. Although Egypt is in Africa, the similarities end there. I shouldn't need to go over how different the two cultures are, right down to appearances (Egyptians look Arabic, not black African), but I'm disappointed NAS chose to try and link the African culture with Egyptian culture to give African culture more respectability.The African culture has enough accomplishments on their own without linking them with cultures they're not related to. If you doubt that than visit any of the African heritage museums around the US, but don't be surprised if you don't see the Egyptian pyramids under their list of accomplishments like NAS would have listeners believe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boringgg","review":"Nas is my least fav mc in the game even tho lost tapes shows his skills he lost it with the rest of his albums till it was writtin till now nas has only release weakness after weakness and realy boring and weak beats.

This CD is one of my favorites in my collection. It's inspirational and serious and with sharp like a knife lyrics. I Can is great, Made You Look is HOOD! The remix w/ Jadakiss is great! I don't need to go reviewing every track because this is simply a great cd with a great track listing.

Also another intruiging track is \\"the cross\\" produced by eminem! if that wasnt enough he drops so lyrical magic on \\"heaven\\" just to prove that this nigguh can rhyme. Ohh and the limited addition cd was a nice bonus"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yet another tight entry from Nas","review":"What else is their to say about Nas? The man's lyrical skill is one of a kind. Their are few artists and I mean few who can drop albums which r different in their own right. That's what separate Nas from a lot of other artists. I get so sick of people saying that he fell off since illmatic. Even the editors on this site said tha same crap. Those editors and whoever think that need to get a grip. It ain't about making another illmatic cause that chapter is done. Being consistant is whats important which is why he is still in tha game today(Unlike Jay-Z who pretty much ran out of sh*t to say). Another thing I can say about Nas is he been an independent artist his whole career without a crew or group to roll wit. He don't need a group like g-unit to stay in tha game. Being the last real ni**a alive is an understatment for Nas and any Nas fan wouldn't tell u any different.

The songs that really stood out are 'Get Down', 'I Can', 'Master Mind', 'Heaven' and 'Dance'. He even gives a quick jab at Jigga on 'Last Real Ni*** alive', and tells his tale about becoming the artist he is today, and even admits beef with Biggie at one point. The only real bad joint on the cd is 'Zone Out' featuring the Bravehearts, which has a wack beat, and below-average rhymes by his project-mates. Neverless, Nas proved he can finally be consistent in having good cds, and some of the best rhymes in the game. I think this is a must have cd for both Old School heads, and New School. The King Of New York should not dissapoint. Peace"},{"rating":"2","title":"NAS IS KING!!!!!!!","review":"Nas proves he is the aboslute best in the game with his new album.

Nas doesn't acknowledge his beef with Jay-Z that much on this album although he does have a track dedicated to it called \\"Last Real Ni**a Alive\\". The few standout tracks are \\"The Cross\\" (produced by Eminem), \\"Warrior Song\\" (produced by Alicia Keys), and \\"The G.O.D.\\", found on the bonus disc (produced by Swizz Beatz).

God Son receives credit by its own right and content. Who ever doubted Nas as a rapper, is blown away in this latest creation. This albulm along with tha lost tapes makes up for the very weak 'commercial' Nastradamus. Why even begin to compare Nas to Jay Z when you hear tracks like 'Get Down', 'Warrior Song' and 'Tha Cross'. Even though the albulm may be personnal as it is dedicated to his late mom (Ann Jones) this is rather a strong point than a flaw as it bring's out Nas's deepest lyrical talent. The second CD may seem pointless with only 3 tracks however 'p...y kills' is a mad track. Instead of wasting your money on Jay Z's Blue Print 2 pick up God's Son and tha lost tapes and you should be satisfied for at least a couple of months.

Tracks like \\"Made You Look\\" and \\"I Can\\" are the best songs recorded by the artist. The album is more street than hip hop, but is still good listening. Nas also focuses more on his music than his beef with Jay-Z and the Roc-A-Fella family. All tracks on the album live up to the name God's Son. Nas features artists on his album such as Alicia Keys, Kelis, and the late Tupac (2Pac) Shakur. The second bonus CD is also great even though it only contains three songs. This album is definitly worth buying and it's worth all 5 stars that have been given."},{"rating":"2","title":"Skills, Street Knowledge, Sincerity, Passion....","review":"Straight like that..hiphop is back!..it's been back since Nas released the Qb's finest album of underground hard core rap..but now within a year he released 3 full length albums..Stillmatic, Lost Tapes and finally the cream of the crop God's Son...Honestly there's not much to say except..it's a classic his 3rd in a row and he has solidified his position as one of the greatest rappers of all time...Nasir Jones has raised the bar again, setting a standard that artist cannot reach...It's time to give it up..He's the best bar none...he's had the album of the year for 2 years straight now...c'mon..he's got verses better than rappers albums...Nas is crazy...street knowledge, book knowledge, sincerity, honesty, passion etc...he does it all. This is an amazing album, which I'm sure you will enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally the \\"REAL\\" Hip Hop","review":"I really enjoyed the album it had everything you could ask for hard tracks, songs in retrospect, and songs relating to real life. Its good to hear an album that is not centered around how many chicks you have slept w/. or are planning to sleep w/. Nas takes it back to the essence of Hip Hop when lyrical content actually meant something...well for people like myself it still does. I love every track on the album w/. the exception of \\"Zone Out\\" but his verse was still hot as he proceeds to rip into Cam'ron on this one. My favorite tracks are 3,4,7,8,10,11,13 and 14(this is the most hypnotic track out of all of them). Nas this was quite a follow up to \\"Lost Tapes\\"(which is a must have if you don't already have it) and \\"Stillmatic\\", it is albums like these and of course \\"Illmatic\\" that makes any \\"true\\" Hip Hop fan mention Nas as one of the greatest if not the greatest emcees of all-time...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"God's Son is a weak attempt by Nas to get back to his glory days.

I like the tunes, but am a little disturbed that some people listening to this CD may actually believe some of what he's saying. i naively assumed we were outgrowing racism and bigotry, but Nas effectively epitomizes both and rubs them in your face. if you want knowledge, read a book; if you want to bob your head, listen to this CD and try not to pollute your brain with his drivelling lyrics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blessed&Cursed Rapper","review":"Nas really started out with a Bang as a Artist&showcased a Raw Talent.but then over time He has become Hit&Miss&depending on the subject matter somethings work&others are just taking up CD space.this Set fits that spirit.with Nas you never know which direction&stance He is gonna take&Nas Himself seems not too know as well.lets get a few things straight:He is a Far Better Lyricist than Jay Z.and Can Flow on a groove with Him equally.but the battle seems too be hurting Nas more so than Jay Z&that is a easy answer too that.Nas has more as a Artist too offer but He is being baited into a mindless duel that does nothing for His Skills.Him&Jay Z are too different type of Artists&different Musical Appeals as well.Nas starts off Good&then sinks over time on this set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"There is only one word I can use to fairly describe this album--disappointment. After the Lost Tapes I was anxious to hear some more Nas material--what I got was a rushed package that consists of too many R and B singers, kids choirs, and worst of all- The Bravehearts. Nas tries so hard to outshine Jay Z-that he put out the second worst album of his career. Nas-Shame on you for putting out such a wack album. Better luck next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hey Nas...what were ya thinkin?","review":"Heres something to think about..Whats cornier?A) Alicia Keys on a rap album?B) Claudette and Kelis on the same track.C) Claudette and Kelis on a track called Hey Nas?D) Bravehearts---period.E) Nas trying to beat Jay..and falling short like LeprechaunsF) Nas being a hypocriteG) The childrens choir on Nas's next single?H) All of the aboveI give the nod to H.

They are both great rappers who can come up with both Radio hits and jams to fill the CD up with. Okay, Nas's lyrics is definitely there, and delivery is great, as a veteran in the game should be. The production is SO-SO when it is at this level. Comparing to other major rappers, this CD does not have many catchy beats but Nas brings it up alot. There are some songs that are not good, therefore it brings the CD down by a little. The Radio Jam are definitely worth listening (Made U Look, I can), there are also some other good 1's. Not many guest appereances but it's alrite, Nas sounds good enough. This album is worth buying if you enjoy nice rhyme flow, it is not, however, worth buying if you want to compare NAS and Jay-Z because they have a \\"beef\\".Deliver: ARhyme: AProduction: C+Overall: A"},{"rating":"2","title":"UNDENIABLY SOME HOT SHIZ","review":"This cd further proves Nas is a great rapper.

Some of the best tracks he has ever wrote are on God's Son, including \\"Book of Rhymes\\" and \\"Dance\\".

God's Son is easily one of the best rap albums of 2002. From beginning to end, you can feel the emotions flowing through his songs. My personal favorites are \\"Made You Look\\", \\"Book of Rhymes (you can hear Nas reading from old books, flipping pages, tearing up wack rhymes, even though all of them are banging), \\"Warrior Song\\" (Alicia Keys does a GREAT job on this song, \\"Heaven\\" (another song dedicated to his mother featuring Jully Black, \\"The Cross (produced by Eminem, really great beat) and Last Real Nigga Alive, which shows how everything went down from about 95 until now. Pick this up now.."},{"rating":"2","title":"All I Need Is 5 Mics","review":"Nasir Jones has done it again. Finally a CD that isn't filled with materialistic bull.

Stillmatic was okay, but Lost Tapes was amazing so I had high hopes. This CD is just empty. It feels rushed with weak production and quite frankly, lame lyrics.

It starts of very promisingly with \\"Get Down\\" but then you have ... like \\"The cross\\", \\"Zone out\\", \\"Hey Nas\\"(obviously targeted at Carson Daly's brainless minions) the astonishing, stuttering failure that is the Alicia Keys produced \\"Warriors\\" and the childish \\"I can\\"( childish in every sense of the word from the stupidly simplistic production to the totally unimaginative, repetitive chorus) The time wasting \\"Book of rhymes\\" which is a weed session masquerading as a brainstorming session. Most dissapointing of all is the acoustic \\"thug mansionz\\" which seems a lame attempt to rival Jay-zs \\"The dream\\"What were left with is'nt bad but it's not that good either.

The instant I heard the first track, \\"Get Down\\", I was floored. Nas has takin it to a new level with this album. This is one of the most impressive album I have heard. This is the best story telling album since the days of Slick Rick. I can't explain how much you need to cop this album, you won't be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gods Son","review":"This album was Nas. It wasnt fueled by JayZ or haters, or any beef. It was Nasir Jones, the man, the artist straight from the heart and mind of a man to our ears. Dealing with the lost of his mother Nas had other things on his mind than beef as Stillmatic demonstrated with the Dis classic Ether, he rarely called out Jay-Z. The album seemed more personal, with songs about what he would like in a woman, \\"Hey Nas\\" was weak at points, but a catchy hook and beat made up for it, The Classical laced \\"I Can\\" gave hope to the underprivledged youth, and of course the break out single of the album \\"Made You Look\\" appeals to a larger group of listeners. A mellow Nas is revealed with the \\"Thugs Mansion\\" song with the greatest who ever did it, 2 pac always helps an album. Also a song in deciation to his mother \\"Dance\\" was pure genious and passion proves Nas is one greatest, yet still unreconized for it.

Tracks like \\"Made U Look\\", \\"Get Down\\", \\"Book of Rhymes\\" are some of Nas's best tracks. A must have cd. And if you do not have Illmatic, It Was Written, Stillmatic & Lost Tapes, you have to buy those ones to. Nas is one of the only mainstream artists that is actually keeping it REAL.

Jay-z is a good rapper but he dosen't have substance. What's missing from Hip-hop is the abiltity to make someone think.

Nas still amazes w/ his ability to give words a life-form, while staying lyrically sharp. Others in the game will be quick to rap about how rich they are and how great they are on every song!

BLANK! PERIOD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"We might be lookin' at another classic.","review":"Great production and a raw, creative, rhythm-driven flow have always a Nas classic made. In view of that Nas's latest, God's Son, is replete with great production and incredible lyrics, we may just be looking at another album that NO hip hop collection should be without. From beginning to end, Nas proves himself to be what he's always proclaimed - a rapper born of the streets and rappin' about the streets. He's introduced several new words into the English Language (e.g. \\"street hop\\"), and gives fans a solid hip-hop album to listen to.He's a storyteller on \\"Get Down,\\" a New York legend on \\"Made You Look,\\" and a modern day griot on \\"Last Real N***a Alive.\\" The clubs will love \\"Hey Nas,\\" and school teachers can write lesson plans off of \\"I can.\\" \\"Book of Rhymes\\" will blow your mind.Nas is Nas on this album: nasty.

The Kindle edition of this particular book and the other books in the series is not very readable -- it has been formatted with too much leading in between paragraph, forming \\"rivers\\" of white space that are very distracting. You can only read a few paragraphs per page and have to flip frequently (even for the average reading speed). I would've expected more attention to text formatting like some other excellent Kindle books but was quite disappointed.

Robb's overzealous rip of all things conservative was so annoying that I painfully made it through this book and will never read another book of hers again. I ACTUALLY believe I would feel the same way if it were against Liberalism as well! I thought the character development was fantastic - but Robb's underlying feelings just never went away throughout the book. Also, her use of the F-word - although I don't mind sometimes, was a bit much. I can't believe that in the future when every other thing has been \\"fixed\\" in the mind of Robb - they haven't found other language to use...like \\"frak\\" (for the Battlestar Galactica fans).

If you want female cops that aren't whiney and bitchy, read about Rizolli and Isles or any book by Lisa Scottoline.

Eve met Roarke.This is my FIRST Nora Roberts/JD Robb book! I finally broke down and got Naked in Death on audio from the library. I am so glad that I did. While I didn't think I would enjoy a Futuristic Romantic Suspense, I did. The future that JD Robb made is quite creative and was very entertained. Let me just say that the reader is THE BEST reader I have ever heard on audio. Roarke's Irish voice is amazing and she brings life to all the characters.

(If not, it can get confusing trying to understand progressive storylines and relationships.) Set in the not too distant future, the main character Eve Dallas is a tough NY city cop investigating the murder of a female licensed companion (prostitution is now legalized). Complicating her investigation, is her growing attraction to the prime murder suspect - the enigmatic, handsome billionaire Roarke.The book has something for everyone: murder mystery and action, romance and a healthy dose of comedy thrown in to keep things from getting too heavy. Robb's fleshing out of vivid and likeable secondary characters adds to the book's appeal. Makes for great beach reading and you'll want to continue the series to learn more about what happens next to Ms. Dallas and company."},{"rating":"2","title":"Naked in Death by J.D.

High enough to show that I indeed enjoyed the plot and the suspense, but no final 5th star for Dallas herself. For a book under the Romance genre, I was pleased to find that this book had a forward moving plot with good guys and bad guys and twists in the story. This was more a glorified police procedural than a drippy romance. That I liked. But I found Dallas, our cop, to be a bit too hard around the edges. Too much swearing and trying to be a male-wanna-be. Please Ms Roberts/Robb ... for those of us who are strong women, please don't portray the need for profanity and extreme rudeness as methods to get ahead in this world. Her \\"character\\" would be unbecoming in either a man *or* a woman. Good thing Roarke was around for the passion and compassion in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"I forced myself to finish this book. I don't know why. The solution to the \\"mystery\\" was painfully obvious from the beginning and I am not a romance novel enthusiast, but I slogged through anyway. The characters of Eve and Roarke were ridiculous romance cliches of damaged needy heroine and rouge with a heart of gold. This book is probably interchangeable with thousands of others. Two stars because Nora Roberts at least had a passable plot and can write above a 10th grade level. Otherwise bleh."},{"rating":"2","title":"1st in a trilogy of romantic and suspenseful mysteries","review":"The beginning of the struggle for detective Eve Dallas tosubmerge her feelings in work.

I was after a light read after a few heavy crime novels and JD Robb's novel hit the spot. Unfortunately, now I remember why I got into great crime novels..to get away from the romantic suspense novels, that are basically Mills &Boon with a bit of crime thrown in to fill up the pages.I was able to read Naked In Death in a few hours, the plot is ok, nothing exciting but really, a billionaire that is still avaliable goes after a interesting looking cop, she has an affair with him & her superior doesn't really mind..ok.A bit of realism wouldn't go astray, but then again, this is really just a bit of fluff to fill my Saturday lunchtime at work.I don't think that I will be getting another JD Robb book again unless I was completely bored and the library burnt down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lib alert; be forewarned about author!","review":"This is one of those books, that is fairly enjoyable, and then when the climax comes you realize this is just a way for the author to cram down his political correctness and anti-whitey propaganda down your throat.Another weakness is that the male protagonist is wealthy beyond belief, incredibly attractive, incredibly tall and lithe, and incredibly sensitive and intelligent. Think 'female victorian pseudo porn' with an lefty world view.I will skip JD Robb's other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are we all talking about the same book?","review":"I could only get through 10 pages and had to put this book down. Does every book nowadays have to be the lowest common denominator in sexual projections. In 10 pages I noted that the book was antigun, pro homosexual,and anti high moral standards. I hate it when obvious political ideaologies get stuffed down the readers throats. Don't waste your time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A thriller, which doesnt thrill","review":"This was a mildly entertaining book. The author seemed to spend most of her time describing various sexual acts and not enough plotting. It appears to be lazily written, with things such as naming the futuristic weapon \\"a weapon\\". I desperately tried to enjoy this book, but did not. Two stars is a bit generous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just didn't do it for me","review":"I bought 20+ books in this series not knowing much about them but after reading all the reviews thought they would be terrific. I found this book to be slow and not as futuristic as I was hoping for, although there is a lot of sex and sex crimes. I have started the second book and find myself putting it down looking for something else to read. Looks like it will take me a long time to get through all those books I purchased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible start to a great series","review":"I've read all the In Death books and novellas and this is still my absolute favorite and one I re-read over and over. I was drawn in from the beginning and was riveted by the story and the romance. The characters were intriguing, the mystery complex. I wanted to know more about them. I had never read any romantic thrillers and picked this one up on a lark and I am so glad I did. I found a whole new world and genre to explore. I have tried a few of Nora Roberts other books, and I appreciate her writing skills, but this series is what I will continue to read and enjoy first and foremost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, the beginning~","review":"I felt some closure upon reading \\"the beginning\\" of the Eve Dallas saga! I am a big fan of the audio book as I spend a great deal of time on the road in 1/2 hour to hour spurts. I started with the print versions but really enjoy the audio. This cd did not have the characters/voices developed as the future ones did but that could be expected. I always felt something missing by not knowing where Nora Roberts/JD Robb initiated the lives of her characters. I am comfortable with that now and will continue to listen to all the cds as they continue!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Meet Eve Dallas, et al....","review":"This book introduces the reader to the world of Eve Dallas, Futuristic police detective living on a war-torn planet Earth.

(You'll learn more about him later in the series... I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't read it.)By the end of the book, if you're not hooked on Eve Dallas, chances are you're not going to be... but I highly recommend this series. Read at least the first three books. If you don't absolutely fall in love with this macabre cast of characters, there's something really wrong with you in my opinion!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Naked in Death","review":"I'm not a Sci-Fi fan, but I am a Nora Roberts fan. Writing as JD Robb, she didn't let me down. In Eve Dallas she has again created a wonderful female lead with all the flaws and passions of modern women, I love that her characters aren't dumb. I also love her enigmatic leading men.

I LOVE this series but will admit it's not for everyone...but there are A LOT of us out here!!! Do yourself a favor and begin at the beginning."},{"rating":"1","title":"What about inflation???","review":"I could complain about the stereotypical junk in this book. The \\"tough as nails\\" cop that \\"truly cares\\", vacillating between steely eyed stares and crying \\"oh the humanity\\" at the violence she sees. And I could go on and on about how every man in the book is either a complete evil jerk except for two: Her assistant, who is ok because he does whatever she tells him to, and mister perfect, the billionaire who chases her around like a lost puppy.But let's move on to why I'm really writing. The money. At one point in the story it's a big deal that a guy spent $25,000 four times to shell out $100,000. That's a lot of money!In 1995.But the story takes place in 2058. Assuming 4% inflation per year that's about $2100 a time. Not really the \\"smoking gun\\" the characters make it sound like. This changes it from \\"that's more money than he makes in a year!\\" to \\"that's enough money to buy a decent used car!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get past what plagued the main character...","review":"The book started off ok but then the reader discovers that Eve, the main character, is plagued by a very violent crime involving a little girl. Without giving too much away, I just found myself as a reader having a hard time getting past this point. It seems to me that the crime involving this child was ultra violent and something that did not need to be fictionalized for a book. Nora Roberts is a creative person who could have come up with a myriad of crimes that could have been just as effective in terms of a catalyst for a novel and a main character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much graphic sex for me","review":"This was an ok book. Not one that I would ever reread or one that makes me want to read the next one in the series. It could have interested me except for two things. One: there's lots of graphic sex and a description of sexual child abuse that I found very disturbing. Two: the writer has an agenda. The bad guys are \\"Conservatives\\" who want to give everyone guns, stop prostitution, and take everyone back to the horrible 21st century by forcing their \\"morality\\" on everyone. This was repeated over and over again in the book. Eve keeps going on and on about how horrible it was when everyone had guns, and people were shot by guns, and how violent guns are, and how much better everything is now that no one is allowed to have a gun. Oddly enough, she is a homicide cop whose last case was a horrific child murder done with a knife. But knives are okay. Hacking someone into pieces is much less violent then those horrible guns!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Had the pleasure of meeting this writer once...","review":"Had the pleasure of meeting this writer a long time ago...What A Rush!All of J.D.

Eve is a cop of ten years, and is dedicated to her job. All of her energy goes into hleping people who are murdered, and finding their killers. Eve is driven to do the best that she can by a past that she cannot remeber.While investigating the murder of several licensed companions she is introduced to Roarke who, though a suspect, intreges and intrests her. As Eve fights these new fealing the murderer continues to kill his chosen victims. Can she solve the case before even more loose their lives, or handle the memories of her past that the case awakens in her?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and Predictable","review":"I guess I'm going against the grain though I feel like I'm being generous with a two-star rating. Based on the other ratings I was expecting a lot more. Why two-stars? The story was incredibly predictable. I like at least a couple of twists and turns, and was hoping for a surprise ending, and..... nothing. The story was slow, way too much time on an incredibly predictable love story, (gee - tough, poor good-girl cop with a history gets incredibly wealthy, elusive, handsome guy who just can't seem to resist her - who woulda thought?!), unrealistic conversations, and not in a good fiction book way, the person who you think is the bad guy turns out to be, oh, the bad guy, too little action. I regretted the time I spent reading it and not just putting it down and instead waiting for at least a good ending. Sorry J.D., my first and only ever read of one of your books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read!!","review":"I picked this book up and read the back cover as I am alway intereste in cop mysteries. When I read that it was set in the future I wasn't sure I would like it but picked it up anyway. Wow was this book well worth the read. It is extremely well written and keeps your interest from begining to end. It is not predictable as many are. This is why I stopped reading Mary Higgens Clark as I could figure out the killer by the middle of the book. This book is a must buy if you are interest in cop mysteries as it is so well written that it makes the future believable. I couldnt put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Way to Start a Mystery Series","review":"Naked in Death is the first book in a 34 book series (so far) by Nora Roberts (writing under the name \\"J.D. Robb\\"). The series is about a police officer named Eve Dallas. She is a homicide detective, she takes her work very seriously. She has a tragic past.This book concerns a case of three women who were murdered and Eve's work to find the killer and bring them to justice. As in every good mystery there are twists, turns and surprises along the way. She is romanced during this investigation by 'Roarke' a mysterious wealthy man who may or may not have something to do with her case.I was engrossed with this book while reading it. The characters were interesting and complex, the plot was realistic, and the way the story unfolded was entertaining to the reader. I would recommend this book to those who enjoy mysteries and contemporary action with moments of chilling surprise. This book does have adult themes, not for most under 18."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Burglar and the Blizzard - a Christmas Story","review":"I truly had a great time reading this story - and it was FREE!!!!!!!!

The characters are unbelievable, the plot is unrealistic, and it's very sexist. I don't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good!","review":"This book seemed to have the elements of a good story but it just never came together. One of the basic premises of the story is that the burglar's sister, who is the embodiment of everything good, beautiful and brave (!), does not realize that she lives in a shanty in the woods yet has possessions like the stolen sable coat and never even suspects that something about these very valuable items and her brother's acquisition of them is suspicious. The supposed instant love between Geoffrey and Cecilia did not ring true at all nor did McVay's behavior induce me to believe that he would get away from punishment for his crimes. The ending was also very unsatisfactory and unbelievable. Overall, I didn't like this story and would not recommend it to anyone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keeps you reading, but disappointing","review":"This book kept me reading to the end, but I am disappointed. I am disappointed with this book because in my opinion, the burglar does not get what he deserves for his crimes.

So far they were very worth the price that I payed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as pictured","review":"I ordered these as part of a party favor for my child's birthday. I was expecting them to look like the ones in the picture but half of them are cheesy looking with random generic animals on them (that aren't represented in the picture). These aren't as cute as the ones in the picture by far. Also, we didn't get a single smiley face ball. I blew up a couple and the size is consistent with the stated size. I'm just disappointed I didn't receive what I expected to from the picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Work","review":"I ordered these balls as a party favor for my 2 year old's birthday party. I opened one and tried it when I received them I was very disappointed.First, I believe 5\\" is the length of the ball when elongated and deflated. When inflated, they're just smaller than the size of an adult fist. I was unhappy with the size, but I would have still used them if they worked.The real problem and the reason I rated them 2 stars was that they don't stay inflated. Because they're so small, it's impossible to inflate them and get it closed before all of the air escapes. If you do manage to get your finger over the hole and get it closed, a little squeeze on the ball made the valve pop open again 75% of the time.Over all, I returned them because they just didn't work for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Bargain and Excellent Customer Service","review":"The small beach balls were very popular w/my daughter's lake swim team.

It does fall for some of the routine story lines that are in every movie like this, but it is still a funny movie. The best part is probably when they visit Tom Green's grandparents. I never can get over the dog that talks, lol. Overall, like I said, if you like teen comedies then you will like this movie. Avoid it if you don't"},{"rating":"2","title":"Deseves ****1/2 stars","review":"This movie lived up to its hype of ruanch and laughs.

The DVD of this movie rules, the color and audio on it are great and there's lots of cool extras including a cool music video for a good song \\"Mr. E's Beautiful Blues\\" by The Eels. It rawks. This movie also had the best trailer EVER.The plot is kind of worn out and thin but once you get into it and you see the characters it is like no other movie. The characters are just so funny.

ROAD TRIP is basically a rude, crude, nasty movie from start to finish! People may be offended with the rude acts in this movie, but forget them! It's supposed to be fun.When a college student named Josh accidently sends an lurid and incriminating tape having sex with a girl to his girlfriend in Texas, he and his pals decide to travel 1800 miles in three days in order to prevent the tape from getting there! The results are laugh out loud funny. They go through several detours including a blown-up car and mishaps with stereotypical people. Tom Green is the funniest member of the talented cast by \\"narrating\\" his story to us.Seann William Scott(AMERICAN PIE fame) also stars in this 2000 unrated edition DVD, which shows more nudity and crude acts not seen from the theatrical version! So watch it if you like funny movies!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Road Trip","review":"I saw this movie a long time ago, but it's been on my mind recently, especially since the death of Mia Amber Davis, who died back in June, and plays Rhonda in the movie. It's a slapstick movie but a group of misfits that go on a cross-country trip so that the character played by Breckin Meyer can stop his girlfriend from finding out about him cheating on her. Most people between 30-40 remember this movie as a college student, and that's who it's geared toward. I hope that a whole new group of college students will \\"discover\\" this movie, and appreciate it for what it is: light-hearted comedy. Not the best movie, but certainly not the worst."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious","review":"Road Trip is the story of Josh Parker(Brecken Meyer)and his childhood crush and girlfriend Tiffany Henderson(Rachel Blanchard)As Tiffany leaves for college in Texas, her and Josh promise to keep in touch and commit to a long distance relationship.

He videotaped his one special night with Beth and accidentally mails the tape down the University of Texas where Tiffany can find it. Now with his mid-term on the Horizon Josh and his friends must quickly travel to Texas and retrieve the tape. With Cars exploding, a black fraternity, stealing school buses from the deaf, and other hilarious road blocks, and Josh's student teacher Jacob (Anthony Rapp) who's trying to get him kicked out of school because he's jelaous of Beth and Josh's new relationship. Road Trip is one of the funniest College comedies of the 2000's decade. I definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Road Trip","review":"This movie was really funny. I gave it 4 stars because the comedy kind of dies off. This is a great movie for young, horny guys because if you can get away with watching it then you better be ready for a lot of nudity. The funniest parts are when a fat guys has some fun with french toast, when a guy gets some 'help' at a sperm donor clinic, and when a guy steals a bus from a blind lady. Overall this is a gross and funny movie but if you're offended by naked women and things like that you should stray away from this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"average raunch comedy","review":"\\"Road Trip\\" is just yr average teen raunch comedy (in addition to being one of thousands that stuck their fingers in the American Pie) and while certain parts of the movie are enough to inspire a grin or a chuckle, the movie's points are scored by the posters in Breckin Meyer's room: Archers of Loaf, Swans, Superchunk, etc etc etc...but perhaps this was just used to up the hip factor.Save your $$ and buy albums by any of these three bands!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly disappointing...","review":"I was expecting a laugh-riot the likes of \\"American Pie.\\" Instead what I got was a cheap imitation and another annoying performance by Tom Green. While I'm thankful that he's barely in the movie (Green can't act and isn't funny anyway), he's still in it, meaning he's still annoying. Breckin Meyer and Seann William Scott are the only reasons to see this movie. While true, Scott's character in this is a carbon copy of his Stifler character in the funnier \\"American Pie\\" films, it still works here. There are a few good belly laughs in this movie, but overall it is a forgettable experience and just a ho-hum movie. The unrated version really doesn't enhance the movie at all. Actually, any differences between the R-rated and Unrated go completely unnoticed, proving that unrated versions are 90% of the time entirely useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Good Comedy!\\"","review":"Breckin Meyer and more star in this 2000 comedy.A college student travels with his pals to retrievea wrong tape he sent to his girlfriend.

Seann William Scott is a great, funny actor full of energy, but he can't save this garbage. The only bad actor in this movie is Tom Green. Yes, I admit the story looks like fun, but it isn't. There are 2 funny scenes: The scene at the bridge and the scene with the blind woman and that's it. Pure garbage and a waste of time and money.

Sophomoric jokes, disgusting humor, those are my kinds of movies. And while this one had both of those in supply, it also had too much boredom. i sat there waiting for something to happen, wishing that the film wouldn't be so predictable and unfunny.

Definitely not for an intelligent adult."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is for people who like to &#65533;Milk The Prostate&#65533;","review":"I like \\"Road\\" movies. Thus I was looking forward to watching this movie. What I don't like however, are movies that try to be funny, but fail, miserably, in their objective.What I dislike even more are false claims. This movie, by having the audacity to call itself \\"Road Trip\\", is claiming to be the \`Daddy' of all road movies. But, not only doesn't it better the classic road movies, it fails to even equal the most mediocre of road movies.This movie only deserves a review because it stars the legendary Tom Green (star, writer, director of the 5-Star movie \\"Freddy Got Fingered\\"), and because it does have one funny scene it - the \\"Milking The Prostate\\" scene.Get your rubber gloves out."},{"rating":"1","title":"another reason to hate MTV","review":"A ninth-rate attempt at a film about the great college tradition. Cannot compare to PCU, Revenge of the Nerds, Back to School, Real Genius, ANIMAL HOUSE, many others. This movie has nothing original, and Tom Green's role could have been much funnier. MTV films seem so politically correct, and this was no exeption. If you like the Disney/McDonalds-style crap music and brainless shows MTV mass produces these days, you'll probably enjoy this horrible film that drains stupid teen-agers of their allowance money."},{"rating":"2","title":"it's one great trip!","review":"Road Trip is definitly one of the funniest films I have seen in along time. The cast is great and there are a number of jokes and gags to keep you lauging during - and long after the movie has finished. Not to mention the extras on this DVD are great. There's a behind the scens tour and cut scenes from the film which are also great fun to watch. This is a must buy DVD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoy it at Face Value","review":"... The plot of the movie is little more than trying to get an incriminating videotape before it arrives at Brecken Myers' girlfriend's dorm, so the gang heads from Ithaca to Austin to get it. But along the way, a script peppered with some witty dialogue (yes, \\"witty\\"), some memorable visual gags, and likeable characters manages to keep you captivated. The unrated DVD features several scenes of nude women, which don't appear in the theatrical release. The behind the scenes featurette really isn't anything more than a look at the actors and crew goofing off, and the DVD-ROM game is pretty easy, so the special features here are somewhat lacking. But if you're just looking for something to chill out with, and to get a few cheap laughs from, this movie is worth it. If you're looking for the meaning of life, you won't find it here. (Maybe, \\"Dude, Where's My Car?\\")"},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it more than i thought i would","review":"I'd never seen the theatrical version, so I can't speak much for the \\"unrated\\" features, but I liked the movie itself much more than I'd expected I would.

I figured it would tread the same line as the American Pie movies. I found it, however, very disappointing. I've never been a fan of Tom Green. His patent \\"Confused stare\\" is stomach churning. An accidental genious, if you will, and I am glad America has woken up from their hypnotized state that he had over them. All the other characters are unlikeable. The pot head kid is an arrogant, self-serving, character that is too smart for his own good. DJ Qualls is too whiny in the beginning and then is too full of himself at the end. Sean William Scott tries but fails to save this movie by delivering a second-rate Stifler. The ending feels too much like a cop out. Breckin Meyer gets saved because of Tom Green's stupidity. If only Tom Green would have taped over Paris Hilton's tape. A better ending would have been if his girlfriend beat him to a bloody mess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny watch it over and over and over and still crack up","review":"This is a keeper denitly this movie will have you cracking up for days after watching it once, Alough I was dissapointed in the DVD's speaial featursThe Deleted scens are more like behind the scensThe behind the scens with Tom Green was good but MUCH to shortMusic Video LAMEProduction Notes, Much to long and hey whos gonna take the time to read it anyway?????But still this is a movie to show most of the family even my parents cracked up so much when they watched it.But be sure to skip threw the shower scene if your parents are with you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tom green's best.","review":"Road trip was a hilarious movie about four college buds that go on a road trip to intercept a hot video tape before of the guy's girlfriend gets it.

I purchased it with the idea that there would be some new footage in the unrated version that was not shown in the theatres, but I couldn't find anything that I hadn't seen before. Unlike American Pie, which had a very good unrated version, this one fails to be any different than the rated \\"R\\" version shown with its theatrical release.

If you're thinking of buying this in order to find something new and interesting, please save yourself the trouble and money and don't click that button."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely Funny Movie","review":"Road Trip is one of the funniest movies I have seen this year. Breckin Meyer, Tom Green and Sean William Scott are the main characters and are very funny.The DVD has some nice extras such as a video by the Eel's and some deleted scenes that didn't make in the final cut of the film.Overall, its a very funny movie, and will likely appeal to those that loved the American Pie movie.Laugther is the best medicine, and you will get a lot of laughs from Road Trip.Highly Recommended!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shweeeeet","review":"Came almost a week earlier than predicted by the site.

Since I knew I would at least enjoy the location shots in Japan, renting wouldn't be a waste.Well, I was pleasantly surprised! I really enjoyed this movie. It may well have some minor plot flaws, but what movie doesn't? All in all, I found it intriguing and pretty well-paced. To me it was as much a mystery as a horror flick. Having both those elements is what maintained my interest.I've never seen the original Thai movie; however, now I intend to buy both versions. Even my husband and daughter liked it!Maybe this movie isn't one everyone enjoyed, but sometimes it's a good idea to check it out for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain bad","review":"The string of PG-13 rated Japanese horror remakes seem to be dwindling with each passing year, with Shutter (along with The Eye) being one of the more recent. Joshua Jackson (Dawson's Creek) and Rachael Taylor (Transformers) star as a newlywed couple in Tokyo who become haunted by the vengeful spirit of a woman that has been quite wronged. What little that Shutter offers in the way of twists and turns end up being rather predictable instead, as do any attempt to achieve anything that could be possibly considered scary or even remotely creepy. By this time, we've seen it all, and seen it all done much better as well (and as much as I despise many of these remakes, nearly all the originals they are based on are more than worth seeing themselves). Jackson and Taylor do the best they can with what they have, which isn't much in the least either. All in all, Shutter is just plain bad no matter how you look at it, and by all means is to be avoided."},{"rating":"1","title":"On the dull side, and really not scary","review":"Some spoilers ahead.....Okay, the plot is simple enough. A newlywed couple go from the U.S. to Japan for the guy's photography assignment, apparently run over a woman who then cannot be found, start working, get haunted, freak out a lot, and then the wife finally discovers, after they are back home, that the girl haunting her hubby and killing off his friends was actually the victim of sexual attacks and blackmail by said men. The wife wisely leaves him, and the man pretty much lobotomizes himself, still unable to get rid of the vengeful ghost.Yeah, so? How is this any different from the other pale remakes of much scarier and more subtle Japanese originals? I don't remember being scared at all by this one. Not once. I did, however, find my mind wandering several times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shutter = HORRIBLE","review":"When it was in theaters I was considering on seeing it, but didn't get a chance...then I was at my friend's house last night felt like watching a scary movie so we bought it on demand & ended up being a total waste it was barely scary & terrible ending nd the plot wasn't really thought out at all...basically DON'T SEE IT OR BUY IT"},{"rating":"1","title":"I shuddered, but for the wrong reasons.","review":"First off, let me say that I love horror films and remakes as such, but this has to be one of the most horrific movies I have viewed recently (ironic, isn't it). The plot is uninteresting, there's too much of a gap between the \\"scary\\" scenes (which aren't even scary, just laughable), the casting is poor, the acting is below average, and that's just to say a few things. I'm glad that I got this as a free rental because I wouldn't have wanted to waste any money on this. It's bad enough that I wasted an hour and a half of my time watching this garbage. I kept waiting for something to happen and it never did. I wouldn't recommend this under any circumstances. They ought to be ashamed of themselves creating this because The Ring was a fantastic movie and The Grudge was a decent movie. If you want to see a movie of this type that's done well, try The Eye with Jessica Alba. I was interested the entire time and the characters were believable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as bad as it could have been","review":"The original Thai film is one of my favorites in the Asian horror genre, and I admit that I expected the worst when I learned of the remake. However, the director reimagined the story just enough to engage a wider audience and add a big-budget edge, yet he retained much of the original concept. I found the acting to be pretty good, with a great performance from the lead actress. As a horror film, I give it an average rating. There are lots of jump scares, and we get to see the old \\"dead girl with black hair\\" trope that was introduced by Asian horror. I'd say most of the people who call this a piece of trash, or nothing compared to the original, were determined to hate it in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's with the \\"dead girl\\" ghost thing in so many movies lately?","review":"I am catching up on movies sitting in my collection that I bought and haven't watched while I am off for summer and it seems like I have stumbled upon a trend. Last week I finally got to \\"Gothica\\" and in that movie, there is a dark road, a car, and a girl standing in the middle of the road waiting to be hit. This movie, starts out about the same way. The comparisons don't stop there.The cover says to \\"prepare yourself for bone chilling terror\\" packed with shocking scenes not shown in theaters. I didn't see anything remotely shocking or new here. Rated PG teen movie except for maybe the main twist at the end.And how about a little truth in advertising? Bonus selections include \\"a twisted alternate ending you must see to believe.\\" So I had to see it. It wasn't much different than the one used in the final cut.Kinda boring. Just my take."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst horror movie I have seen in a while.","review":"This movie was so pathetic it's beyond pathetic, entering a stage of ultimate patheticness that could be pooled together to annihilate the entire planet.There is nothing, NOTHING, scary about the \\"scary girl\\" in this movie. Compared to The Ring and The Grudge girl she is really a joke. All the \\"scary\\" moments are nothing but cheesy and stupid, and the actors are unlikeable at best. Very VERY formulaic story also.The only scary thing about this movie is the resulting suicidal tendencies that develop as you become willing to do anything to escape the torture of watching it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I am not going to waste any more of my time with this movie as I have wasted 90 minutes of my life already; so, this is going to be short and to the point:Cons:Not scary--at all. Any scene that tries to be scary is so corny, you will actually laugh at it instead of jumping in fear.Poorly acted.CGI graphics are of poorer quality than you would see on your cable tv channels.Predictable story--poor attempt at keeping you guessing as to why this girl is after them.Pros:It ends.One of the worst movies I have seen in years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bloody awful","review":"\\"J Horror\\" as in \\"junk\\" which is what this mess is. Yet another hatchet job on a very intelligent shocker from Thailand but transplanted to Japan for no apparent reason other than to have stupid Americans throw themselves out of high-rise windows. They could have stayed home and done that. I could have stayed home too, except that the movie is what would have gone flying, not me.All the subtlety is gone, replaced by CGI effects that have no clear bearing on the story that, in itself, is confused at best. It's bearable if you have no demands to make on your own intelligence but otherwise stay away.Everything that the original had going for it, which was EVERYTHING, this mess lacks.

It has suspense, thriller and a very excellent plot This is a must see great, scary movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"I adore B horror, but this film doesn't come close to qualifying on that level. Obviously its a comic/horror extension of Zombieland where the zombies are all strippers, and that concept is somewhat fun. The problem is the same problem that plagues every Kauffman film, 90 minutes of purely sophomoric humor that gradually grates on you until you wonder why you're wasting you time on another Kauffman film. The comedy just isn't funny, unless you live for the American Pie type potty/stupid sex humor, and the production values are weak. Its clearly a film haphazardly captured and edited, and you feel this lack of talent, care and diligence throughout.

When I have showed it to friends who have no interest in surfing, they can't help but want to watch the rest once they see the opening.

Billabong goes out of their way with a whole lot of explainations in Odyssey about tow-in surfing, training on watercrafts, and then they get to the surfing. I fell asleep throughout the 2/3 of it.

An attempt is made to match each letter of the alphabet with a flower and create a piece that showcases that flower. The index lists a total of 18 stitches amongst all of the flower names. Unfortunately, you will have to leaf through the book to look at each stitch to see if it is the one you want to learn how to make.

This book also has instructions on how to do many gathered flowers with wider or wired ribbon. In addition to flowers by alphabet (including some unusual choices like caladiums), there are instructions on how to make decorative initials; something I haven't seen before. Each project picture is shown in a wide shot, then a close up, and a drawn diagram the same size as the close up, so you can easily see the details, and what goes where.

Two right off the top of my head are the idea that Westerners need to eat meat and consume alcohol, and that we normally only think with the left side of our brain.Further from it's obsession over the forebrain and brain stem et al to it's comments on the macrobiotic diet, the text is firmly rooted in the late 1970's making it dated at best.Combined with the reptition (how many times is the word \\"coffin\\" used throughout the text?) and the disjointed feel of the question and answer format, it is in my view just not a very good introduction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent peek into the thought processes of a Zen Master","review":"As someone who has had a continuing interest in Zen, reading Master Deshimaru's lively and spirited answers to typical (and not so typical) questions regarding Zen and his take on the subject.

I think the song Tessie is absolutely aweful and has shown how far off this band is now from the olden days of Do or Die. The good news is they didn't write the song, so maybe there is still some hope that future songs won't be as bad as this one. I find it also bad that this horrible song isn't only on this disc once, but there's two versions of it, and each sound equally as bad. I didn't really enjoy any of the other songs on this CD either. I hope for some better things in the future from the Dropkick Murphys, but in the meantime I'll listen to my Flogging Molly and Street Dogs CDs, as those bands have seemed to surpass DKM in terms of quality music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please include","review":"Please include in the explanation that this video specifically tells of the teachings of the Latter Day Saints Church.

The fact that it is told through the modern day personal story of this writer (Lowinger) with owner of Tropicana (Fox) is a nice framing. The rhythm of story made me feel like I was right there. Someone should make this into a movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A page-turning read....","review":"You think you've read everything there is to read about Cuba, but you haven't--until you've picked up Tropicana Nights by Rosa Lowinger. This adeptly-written book chronicles the rise and eventual fall of Havana's most glamorous night club. The book follows the lives of its owners, Martin and Ofelia Fox, as they build their \\"paradise under the stars,\\" with cameos by a veritable who's who of iconic entertainers: Carmen Miranda, Nat King Cole, Josephine Baker and Steve Allen. Woven into the story are sidebars on Cuban music, modernist architecture and regional politics, that, together, come to form a complete picture of Cuban culture in the 1950s. The book also follows Ofelia as she rebuilds her life from scratch in the United States following the Cuban revolution and Martin's death. It's an entertaining, page-turning read with a gripping, personal narrative. And it offers the most striking portrait yet of what it has meant to be Cuban in the twentieth century."},{"rating":"2","title":"SUPERB !","review":"I visited the Tropicana in Havana in October, 1959... only a couple of months before the departure of Batista and Castro's entrance into Havana.

However, there are no memories of my visit to that beautiful country any more vivid that my evening at Tropicana; even though it has been fifty years (this month).

At first hearing, the band sounds like 'Radiohead meets Midlake.' But that's not being really being fair to this band!

A few of the tracks go for an almost goth sound with talk-singing and for me at least, those are the least interesting tracks.

It is by the way a nickelodeon movie, so it aims at younger viewers. Despite it is only 89 mins, 84 mins for the features and 5 minutes for the credit, the movie feels a bit long. Not enough Chevy Chase, so the funny moments are limited as well. The younger actors' give excellent performances.

It combines a simple text with full-color photographs that are rich in fascinating details. The plants covered include mangrove trees, banyan trees, baobab trees, saguaro cactus, mistletoe, and more.My only problem with the book is the title. It seems a bit narrow-minded to arbitrarily designate some plants as \\"strange.\\" I'm sure lichen (which is depicted in the book) is not considered strange by someone who lives in a region with lots of lichen.

The Israelis plan to build a border wall and/or fence separating the country from the East Bank, meaning that the Palestinian village of Budrus will lose many acres of land. On that land are planted olive trees, a major source of income for the villagers. Shown mainly from the Palestinian perspective, it is apparent that the people of Budrus do not oppose the wall; they merely want it to be built not on their land but on Israeli land. Nonviolent protests take place in the hopes of stopping the bulldozers but rock throwing by the Palestinians and shooting by Israeli forces shows how emotions can become inflamed. This is a fascinating look at how people CAN make a difference in their community.

So the headline -- \\"The Code of the Woosters [Unabridged] [Audible Audio Edition]\\" -- is completely misleading. Instead of one person reading you the complete text of the original book, you get several actors acting out a very abridged version of the book (as if it's a play, and given the audience applause, it may well have been a play that they recorded).I have brought this mistake to the attention of Amazon's customer service department and asked for a refund (so I can go buy the real thing).

When is it coming out?"},{"rating":"2","title":"funny as hell..","review":"this is the first review i have every been inclined to write...i read this book in a day. i really couldn't put it down and i was laughing out loud as i read it. it is written in a very sarcastic tone, the same tone you would probably take if you ever had the chance to ask vince or bischoff about any of this stuff. it covers pretty much all of the worst angles i could think of from the 80s and 90s, some i even forgot about(big show/big boss man dead father angle) or wish i could forget about(kane/triple h necrophilia). it also covers all of the gimmicks and special appearances that are long forgotten such as the Shockmaster, Robocop in the WCW, Black Scorpian, etc. well worth the price. true wrestling fans will appreciate it."},{"rating":"2","title":"What? No Golddust?","review":"I loved this book. It brought back so many memories of idiocy in the wrestling world. But how could they omit Dustin Runnels a.k.a. Golddust?! The single most humiliating ring identity of all time? It destroyed Runnels' career. And where was the mention of what Vinny Mac also did to Dustin\\"s father, Dusty? After putting \\"the American Dream\\" in a polka dot outfit and saddled with the worse valet ever, you'd figure these incidents would deserve special mention as it seemed Vince was going out of his way to discredit the Runnels family.I also noticed there was no mention of Rowdy Roddy Piper's unfortunate Wrestlemania VI appearance where he painted half his body black in responce to his facing Bad News Brown. Truly embarrassing."},{"rating":"2","title":"RD Reynolds is funny","review":"I visit the site Wrestlecrap at least once a week to check out whats new. Its a funny site about how many stupid things wrestling companys tried to put out as a good idea. I read the book in less then two days because its so funny and you can tell he enjoys wrestling. He is refreshing and writes the truths about some of the dumbest stuff WWE and WCW ever put out. I highly recommend this book, I laughed alot while reading the book. Also check out his book, Death of WCW. Ive read that book at least ten or more times and it never gets old. I cant wait for the next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"As someone who really liked the website, this has two major problems. One is that it isn't nearly as funny as the website. The other is that if you're going to make fun of something, even when it deserves to be made fun of, you really need to have your facts straight. Almost every chapter has multiple factual errors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worst of Pro Wrestling is actually the best","review":"After reading this book, you will shake your head and ask yourself over and over again: What were they thinking? This book chronicles the most embarrassing, hysterical, and worst moments and gimmicks in pro wrestling. From the Gobbly Gooker to The Goon to Oz to Vince Russo's entire booking in WCW, this book is a must own for wrestling fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy construction, didn't last long at all","review":"I had purchased a lesser expensive Slime pump and when it had broken down after 6 months of use, I wrote an E-mail to Slime explaining my frustration with it's poor quality. God bless Slime's costumer service, they gave me no hassles and sent me an upgraded pump in the mail as a free replacement.It was bigger and looked sturdier. After two months of rare usage, this thing breaks down. The frame starts twisting with each pumping action and eventually one of the spring pins broke out of it's slot. Now it takes about 5-10 minutes to pump a tire.I would not recommend this product, nor any other Slime product for that matter. For a good reason why Slime products break down in such a short period, check the sticker underneath the product: \\"Made In...\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Pice of Pump. Extrelemy dissapointed","review":"Used this pump twice and when I needed to pump up a low tire on our car the plastic nozzle snapped making it useless. It just cracked in half. No real force but just borke. What was angering is that I had used the pump only once before (to pump a wheelbarrow tire) the past summer and this was only the second time I went to use it and it failed basically letting most of the air out of the tire of the car before I could pry the broken valve assemvly off the valve stem. So i had to make a quick trip to the gas station to fill it back up before I ran into trouble. I would SOOOOOO like to get my money back but I bought this at Home Depot over the summer.Its a pice of junk so dont waste your money. Even the rubber feet all fell off as soon as I took it out of the packaging. I had to glue these back on just so I wouldnt loose them.Sad quality pump so much so i was infuriated. Heavy duty pump yeah right?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Hilarious!","review":"A great peace of work from this first time director... Hopefully the Hollywood \`blockbuster' producing machine will stand up and take notice of (not to mention support) great movies like this being produced without multimillion dollar budgets and endless resources... good writing, directing, and acting MATTERS! Well worth your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I want a t-shirt that says \\" Bob and Jiffy Rawk\\"","review":"I happened to see this flick as it was going from Olympia to Portland. I brought along some of my rawkin' mullets crowned cousins but I don't think they found the same vein of humor I did in taking them there. I found it to be a very enjoyable movie. The writer and director has a good time with the culture of archaic man/trailer park mullet folk without getting too cynical; that's a very hard thing to do. There is a theme of redemption that began as revenge in this movie that I find to be a good reversal in any story. There is hope. Somewhere along the way, and especially my travels through Lacey, WA. and high-school I have encountered the very people that are portrayed not as freaks but as folk in this movie. I recommend it to friend who have crossed the threshhold from having sported the perticular proceptive plummage themselves and encourage the writer/director to keep up the good work!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Funny About This","review":"I watched this on PPV based on mixed reviews. Okay, I was in the mood for a comedy and thought I'd take a chance. Mistake. This \\"film\\" would appeal to boys 18-24 when drinking until stupified and then vomiting is considered an entertainment option.I've been through Tacoma--lots of trailers and the Tacoma aroma. OMG that smell. I had always thought of Washington state as pine scented and picturesque and it may be but NOT in Tacoma. Same goes for the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"W Mag: Worth the cost ?","review":"I personally had never read this maginze until a friend sent a subscription to me. I don't understand why she bought it for me. This magnize features three things: clothes, accesories, and stories of the rich and famous. The clothing and accesories are all designer, which is great if you are into super-expensive clothing. Also the outfits shown are ridicius. They look the outfits out of some cheesy B- movie, or possibly a bunch of mops sewn together. I doubt anyone can really tell what they are. The only other thing in this magazines are stories of the super elite celebrities and royalty, which are incredibly boring. Please don't waste your money on this magazine, it's not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Commercialized glossy porn in ads and features","review":"I subscribed hoping for a wide-ranging view of fashion shows and contemporary art. While there was an interesting article on an aging art auctioneer, several ads featured male and female nudes crouching or huddling in homoerotic poses. One feature had garish clothes on models posed in front of small suburban houses...how quaint. Another \\"fashion\\" spread had a young woman being kidnapped, a bag put over her head, handcuffed, and finally posed nude facing a wall. Degrading and violent sexualized images of women. That's not fashion...it's pornography.This magazine might appeal to older people who came of age in the 1960s (plastic surgery article, gaudy jewelry ads) who \\"celebrate\\" the sexual revolution and don't think much of the dignity of the human body.I can't see this magazine staying in existence much longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible. Not a magazine, at all, more like an ad portfolio","review":"If you enjoy looking at pages and pages of nothing but expensive, high fashion editorial pictures then this is the magazine for you. Personally, I thought this was the worst waste of money ever. There was nothing remotely interesting in this so called magazine, it was just filled with pasty anorexic models that I assume looked human at some point in their life time, and it was nearly always impossible to figure out what was even being advertised. There are no articles, no information is being communicated at all. This is literally just for looking at editorial photo shoots of ugly stick figures in ugly make up with ugly hair styles and ugly clothes that no one could afford, anyway. Don't waste your money unless you enjoy looking through portfolios."},{"rating":"1","title":"rip off","review":"I canceled my subscription after receiving my first issue. They started the subscription with an old issue, even though an up to date one was already on the news stands. There were so many adds, they should have been paying me. I refuse to support a magzine that is heavy on adds, slim on content and sends your first issue from their old back stock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugly","review":"There was a time when this was the publication to have in the fashion world. Now it's just sad. There is no acknowledgement of trends or styles, nothing cutting edge. They no longer define fashion, they just destroy it. They are so concerned with contorting art that they ruin it. Everything they produce is ugly and disturbing. What is wrong with pretty? This rag looks like it is produced by people who hate the feminine form and feel they must distort it. It's bad enough that most publications require models to be thin and they alter the photos to lengthen legs, arms, and torsos. But that's not enough for this magazine. No, they must make their models look like little boys in women's clothes with hair and make-up best suited for a freak show. And that's what the pages of W read like, photos of side show freaks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Order it Directly From Conde Nast","review":"The photographs are simply amazing and the articles are great, Conde Nast is just a solid publisher of magazines. I know folks who get W just for the photography alone (much less the excellent fashion and trend-spotting). However, getting the magazine from Amazon proved a lot more trouble than it was worth.I tried ordering this as a gift off of my friend's wishlist. Four months later, my friend had yet to receive her first issue of her subscription. I called Conde Nast, I called Amazon: they insisted it was the other. Amazon offered to refund my money when all I really wanted was just the mere fulfillment of the order. So I went to W's web site and ordered it for a couple dollars less and they even included a gift e-mail with the order.I suggest you save yourself time and trouble and order directly from W's web site."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, but nostalgic","review":"I don't suppose I'll ever quit pining for the old newspaper format, but W is still the most artistic and informative of the fashion magazines. It's worth the price of a subscription for their fabulous advertisements, sort a like the superbowl. I wish they hadn't merged with Vogue, as it was nice having two major and distinct voices in the fashion world, but for my money W is worth all those other fashion magazines combined."},{"rating":"1","title":"not much to read or learn","review":"for ads only pretty much. there is not much to read or learn for the common reader. it seems like it's mailing for the fashion elite not for everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"alas not the great fashion tome it used to be","review":"once upon a time, W magazine was a fantastic fashion mag. it contained beautiful and innovative photography and intelligent articles about the best of fashion's best. something, alas, has changed. now the focus is on celebrities. yes, the photography is better than that found in Star or People, but the writing is just as gossip-focused, and no great insight is offered on the subjects. you won't learn anything new about anyone, but I found they weren't people I was interested in to begin with.and as for the fashion coverage, it's been shunted off to the side, limited to one pictorial spread. the size of the issue is now much smaller than back when I first subscribed.also, when I canceled my subscription early, for lack of wanting to read about yawn-inducing Hollywood flavors-of-the-hour, the publisher refused me any refund. buyer beware!"},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT AND VERY TASTEFUL","review":"W..W is an excellent magazine (excellent + very big)Although i must say to ensure you dont want waste your money..W isnt for everyone!This is such a good magazine though, i've being reading it for such a long time. And in my opinion every issue is worth it.Just to give you an idea of what W is all about..its about:*Amazing High Fashion spreads and fashion updates, etc etc*A Backstage pass into the lives of Americas High Society*Informative articles, offering opinions by the writer and thereaders of the magazine*Amazing and very unique interviews of celebs and other upcomingpeople whos names will be very well-known in a very short time.Overall, if you like reading about High-Fashion, and the lives of the Rich and Famous and indulging in abit of luxury, then W is definetly the magazine for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scandalous","review":"I'm a fashion student at Parsons school of design and have obviously been exposed to a variety of fashion magazines. I've been a reader of W for several years now and have watched it's level of controversy rise from edgy and risque to pornographically obscene. I was going through the current issue's fashion coverage while sitting on a train, and came across the most meretricious, vile and pornographic advertisment for Tom Ford's sunglasses line. I was completely shocked that censors would let such a sexually graphic image pass in a somewhat mainstream fashion mag. It was literally hard-core pornography (i'm not exaggerating)and i was embarressed to have come across this ad while sitting next to other people in a public place.I own hundreds of magazines and have yet to see such stupidity on the editor's part. I am no longer going to purchase W and i hope that the magazine's directors will have more sense and discretion in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"W Mag.","review":"I would love to give some feedback, but I have yet to receive my first copy.

It is very poor quality and certainly not CD quality, probably due to the original recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware","review":"I ordered six of the 24\\" Gladiator cabinets along with one of these 30\\" units. My experience with these has been absolutely horrible. You will not find a more inept packaging engineer than the one employed by this manufacturer. I can only hope they have long since been terminated and the product I received was simply left over inventory. So far I have returned 4 of the smaller cabinets for significant damage in shipping and I nearly returned this 30\\" unit but was convinced to keep it for a discount. Part of me wishes I would have returned it but after receiving 2 replacement small cabinets damaged worse than the originals I guess I'm glad I took the discount.If you can find these at a local store I'd highly recommend you avoid buying them over the internet. Hoping you get Gladiator cabinets shipped to you in one piece is a huge role of the dice. If you don't have time to deal with returns and exchanges, you may want to evaluate your priorities and find a different cabinet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"I purchased this book thinking it was the one for the work I am currently doing.

I love the Davis, Shorter, Hancock, Carter, and Williams quintet, and the music they made was outstanding. This album is no exception.I beleive the cover picture is perfect for this album. The woman seems so mysterous to me. It is an extremely haunting and beautiful picture in my opinion, and the compositions on this album, most of which were written by Wayne Shorter, are hauntingly beautiful.While this album will never be considered a masterpiece, it is a great piece of music and should be included in the collection of those wishing to expand their number of Miles Davis cd's.Add to Shopping Cart."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite of the quintet","review":"This is my favorite miles davis album. I always come back to this one. I like every track on here except for \\"Nothing like you\\". I agree with daniel miles in that it spoils the mood of the album and I cannot stand the singing voice. Regardless, I believe that the rest of the album is wonderful.I love the tone of Mile's horn, the rhythm, the dark melodies that are amazingly colorful and complex. The way the instruments can clash, then come together so beautifully. It is like nothing I have ever heard before and it takes me away to a dark mysterious place. I turn out all the lights, put this on and listen and get swept away.There is just something about the quintet that I love. I love ESP, water babies and Nefertiti, but something about Sorcerer calls to me unlike any of the others and the magic hasn't worn off over the years. With every listen I find something new to make me smile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ron at his best","review":"Even if you end up hating every other song on this album, Masquerelo is still worth the 13 dollars you'll pay for it. Buy it just for Ron Carter's bass playing. Ron shines on this song, especially during Wayne, and Herbie's solos.It took a while for the rest of the songs to grow on me, but once they did I ended up liking this album. Though it's not Miles Smiles or E.S.P., it's still an album worth having."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong Players, Weak Recording","review":"I was a little diappointed with this recording. Parker and Gillespie definely deliver, no question. The sidemen are burnin' it up too but there is no mention of who they are! Who is playing piano on 'Dizzy Atmosphere'? Great ride but no mention of who is who! This sounds like a compilation from several different dates (from different years) but there is almost no info on the jacket. On top of that the recording quality is very weak. It's almost as if someone recorded their 30 year old dusty LPs onto an 8 track only to put it on CD. The balance varies greatly from track to track also. But if you are a die hard bebopper it doesn't matter. The musical product is 5 star. Production gets 1 star for the cool cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock, Pretty Baby","review":"Is there going to be a DVD version anytime soon? VHS is more than dated ... it's a dinosaur.

Jim Bajor seems to be able to capture this feel of jazz so well on this CD. From great old jazz standards like \\"fly me to the Moon\\" to four of his own original compositions this CD sparkles with exquisite piano music. It is very romantic and makes perfect background music. So light the fire pour a glass a wine and put on this CD and I don't think you'll be dissappointed. It is a superb CD.

I would give it five stars.John AllagorSalt Lake City, Utah"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart warming sounds always send me off into another world.","review":"Jim Bajor has no other match in the contemporary world today.

The light quality is much bluer and crisper than the standard bulb.

This product, however, is a movie of the same name directed by Joel M. Reed. It has nothing to do with tropical island zombies, but rather WWII-era Nazi zombies! NOTZ (get it?) is about a CIA special-agent investigating deserters from the U.S. Army Chemical Corps unit. Once in Germany, he uncovers a plot of world domination involving...Nazi zombies! This movie is terrible, but in a good way. I suspect an updated version could be done much better, but if you like cheese you'll appreciate this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid rip off TRASH!!","review":"There is not one good thing to say about this italian schlock-fest about a bunch of dim-bulb swat team members who are called in New Guinea to control the local zombie problem. 40% of the film is stupid stock footage of animals, and the rest is a poorly photographed, directed, and edited jumble of pointless nudity, and really bad gore effects.

As much as I hate to bash any zombie movie, I found myself fast forwarding through it. I have never done that to any movie.

The coolest part of the movie is when the girl gets naked.And that is not all that. I&#65533;m giving this movie two stars.

Sure, it's a slice of Italian cheese featuring the Italian monster of choice: the zombie. But even hordes of the living dead and millions of rounds of ammo being emptied out can't raise the pulse (or laugh quotient) on this sputtering junker of a movie. Vincent Dawn (who's really talentless hack Bruno Mattei) has to have been the most worthless director on the low-budget scene during the 1980's. NOTZ is inept, poorly written, has no likable characters. The CREATURE FEATURES print of this film is incredibly awful and looks like a 2nd-generation bootleg at best. All in all, a movie that will have you hating life long after the end credits have rolled. You've been warned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful interiors","review":"This is a lovely book with beautiful color pictures from what I think is authentic interiors.

This Waterman is mid-range in the line, and it is finished as such. You will find better finished pen on the market for a higher price. The French craftsmanship on this Waterman is right priced.The weight on it shows the quality at the first touch. The length of the body fits most of hands. You can also clip the cap on the back for bigger hands, but that increases the weight again. The fountain is a clear tube with a screw. you screw it down to push the air out, dip the nib into ink, and screw it backup. Every thing is easy and clean. I shake the pen vertically hardly several times, one tinny drop of ink indeed came out. The ink wouldn't be spilled out under normal carrying condition.Even thought this Waterman doesn't really stands out in the pack, you wouldn't regret to take it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best fountain pens I have owned","review":"I had earlier bought the Waterman Phileas when it was being discontinued and discounted.

Smooth writer, good balance between excess and stingy ink flow, a good feeling barrel. Get one if you can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, funny and can't put down","review":"I read this book in one day. I advise to take in consideration that is one person's side of the story, which is funny many times. Poor Randy, Jermaine did him wrong marrying his children's mother. There are many misspelled names but if you are familiar with the entertainment industry you will who Margaret is talking about in the book for example Lela Rochon, not Leela ReShawn. I always wanted to know what happened to Tito's wife. Margaret described and explained how Dee-Dee was murdered. Margaret also adds to Joe Jackson's abuse claims. Tito said to her that Joe would put salt in his wounds.It's just typical in-law perspective dynamics. If I write a book about my in-laws, it would share the similar tone.I hope she received enough profit from this book to help her financially with her sons. I say read it if you ever wanted to know background information about the Jacksons."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Quick Read","review":"A waited quite some time to find a reasonably priced copy to add this to my MJ collection. Margaret comes off as credible and not overly sensationalized. The short book is her attempt at narrating life inside the gates of Havenhurst from her point of view. I also enjoyed the inside information as to the making of \\"The Jacksons: An American Dream\\" movie which she produced.If you are hoping for a good read on inside information specifically about Michael Jackson, this is not the book for you. Although she does mention Michael a few times, he was not her focus then or in the book. For many, insight into the Jackson family will inspire deeper thinking into the affects on all of them individually."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was somewhat dissapointed","review":"Sounds like she was angry and only wanted to tell the bad things and it was not what I think she should have narrated in these tapes, because she lived with the Jackson's. Maybe she was mad because Jermaine moved on to someone eles.

They make a lot of other products that I like (the long-lasting eyeliner is amazing, and I can't live without the Bright Eyes cream shadow), so I wrote to them and told them about the problems I'd had with this one. They asked me to send the mascara back to them, and in return they mailed me a gift certificate so I can buy something else I'd like better! 5 stars for Almay customer service!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I was pleased with this product overall.

But, contrary to Amazon's credits here, Richard Gere is NOT one of the main stars of this film (one of his first, I guess). He has like 5 minutes of screen time as a sleazy pimp. The main stars are Michael Moriarty, Yaphet Kotto, Susan Blakely and Hector Elizondo, amongst others, all of whom do a fine job. I have not seen it on disc yet, so I am not aware of the transfer quality. I recently purchased one of MGM's limited collection, QUEEN OF BLOOD, which looked excellent. However, MGM has had some problems off-and-on with disc quality issues, etc, with this limited edition collection of releases."},{"rating":"2","title":"good summary of Picasso's career","review":"This book was very helpful as I was preparing to present Picasso's art to elementary school children. It takes a long, prolific career, and organizes the different periods of Picasso's art so that it is more succinct. The wording is very understandable yet not condescending for older readers. This is a great series for adults, like myself, trying to help children understand why an artist was so great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Light - Bad Case","review":"The Mag Lite is a fantastic little flashlight. I have been using mine for almost 5 years now. My only complaint is the case that comes with it. The velcro for the top closure is VERY strong which means that you eventually rip all the \\"loop\\" parts so it no longer connects. A good option would be to have a leather case version with a snap instead of velcro for a more industrial use. The lite itself is great and the spare bulb in the handle is a fantastic idea. Just wish they had the purple one available when I got mine originally..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Immortal Poems of the English Language","review":"This book has become one of my favorite poetry books.

This book has \\"tips on the best use of particular designs, the desirable proportions in any room setting, and the quantity of material needed.\\" It is difficult to imagine your own material in the different styles of window treatments because there are only line drawings. Overall, I thought it was a pretty useless book and I feel I wasted my money because I was looking for a book to give directions for making window treatments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly horrible","review":"Wow this book was bad. I am an avid reader--- everything interests me. (from Charles Dickens to Jennifer Crusie) But this book... the plot was rambling and repetitive. The characters unappealing (although the children were more three dimensional than their lackluster parents). I don't know how it made it thru publishing. Tedious, boring, and some of the metaphors... the heat in her womb? Give me a break. I always finish them (so as not to judge hypocritically) but this one was truly painful. The first book I've read by Arnold, and I'm sure, the last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as some people think","review":"I didn't like this book. Maybe I was expecting too much, based on some other reviews. The plot line was OK, the children of the romantic leads added some interest, but here's the thing:the heroine spends the entire book just exhausted by her strenuous position in the admissions office of a private school (!!). Honestly, she is the most tedious woman! Just tired, and defeated, with no clue about her daughter. I lost interest in her right away, and skipped about the middle two hundred pages of the book. If you're looking for something comparable to the humor and engaging heroines of the books by Jennifer Crusie, or Suzan Elizabeth Philips - don't pick this one!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, boring boring","review":"I am very sorry I bought this.The stories were painfully executed and boring.

If you are at all interested in cultivating real faith (regardless of the tradition) PLEASE take the time to read something with some real substance (the work of Father John Main and Eknath Easwaran's excellent book \\"Meditation\\" come to mind) and don't waste your time and money on this nonsense!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jipped","review":"This is a great toy. However, the seller shouldn't be allowed to sell through Amazon. I received this toy from Brians Toys, It was advertised as new in great condition with storage/display case. When I got the item it was \\"technically new\\". That is it was in the original packaging, and had never been opened. There was no storage/display case with it, and the package looked like brian had stored it in a backpack and taken it around the world. I've seen run-over boxes with merchandise in better shape. This ruined the excitement of receiving this toy, especially when paying premium prices for a collectable that was vitually worthless.

The fact that it is fully furnished is so convenient and you know exactly how much you'll be spending up-front. Other doll houses that I'd previously looked at had much more delicate (breakable) pieces that needed to be purchased seperately and were expensive(after adding up the costs of several, it over doubled the costs of the houses). The pieces included in this set are 'chunky' durable and perfectly sized for little hands. The roof lifts for easy 2nd floor access, and the swivel base is a really great feature especially at clean-up time. We 'discovered' this house at friends home. My 3 yr old daughter played with it for a good couple of hours and even then wasn't ready to leave it when it was time to go. I ordered one for her the very next day for Christmas from Santa. I know she will be so excited to see it sitting under the tree when she gets up in the morning!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Signs in our world","review":"My 4 year old grandson really enjoyed this book. He loves asking about the signs as we are driving."},{"rating":"1","title":"good","review":"its something fun to have. When offroading, it bounces around a ton and the numbers/lines stop far before you get close to flipping (at least in my jeep). Also, this whole unit swivels on the stand it comes with, so if you touch it, the fore/aft zero is thrown off. which is fine if you're driving to the mall. But not out in the sticks where you're almost never on level ground. Basically, this is something cool to look at. It doesn't do anything for offroading though, I took mine off after a couple trips to Mt.Ranier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this","review":"the Nero Wolfe stories in this collection do not disappoint the reader, they are a very good read. Very thankful for the entertainment, renewing my love for reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Three more inferior wartime Wolfe stories","review":"Rex Stout had important duties in World War II, so he apparently couldn't devote much effort to the first two of the three stories here, and it shows. (It also shows how much effort he put into his better stories, something his imitators don't seem to manage.) The third, set shortly after the war, is less bad, but still weak. As (minor spoiler) Inspector Cramer notes, the murderer is an idiot, which is how Stout got the plot to work. But it has certain points of interest for completists; the tone is slightly coarser and more real than in most of the other Wolfe stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must see!!!","review":"Great movie!!!

However, so much information is provided that it can almost become confusing, depending on the person's level of expertise.

Like the other British arthouse classic The Servant this is the story of moral decay, and its empty consequences. Made at a time when old rules(homosexuality, abortion,adultery)where under question during the permissive 60's, Schlesinger has created a time capsule of British culture - the Dankworth score is also perfectly of the time and a marvellous melody over the opening titles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't censor the classics","review":"I was about to give this a 5 star review because it is one of two movies that changed my life (La Dolce Vita the other) when I was in my late teens. Frederic Raphael who wrote this along with the great TV series The Glittering Prizes (run don't walk to buy this with Tom Conti) wrote this based on the \\"lovies\\" whom he knew in school and Julie Christie's scenes with Dirk Bogarde (truly one of the most underrated actors of all time.....buy Pinter's The Servant and see what great acting is truly like) and with Laurence Harvey (not a great actor but a good one and a great type) are priceless. But to hear that this movies is not the original cut is depressing and so wait until Criterion comes out with the \\"real/reel\\" versionPatrick Cronin"},{"rating":"2","title":"the best of those english working class films of the era","review":"this one was a shocker to me, especially after my usual ranting against the english movies of this period, and anything with laurence harvey in particular. that said -- i loved this movie, and damn if julie christie didnt DESERVE that oscar over julie andrews! she is great as a vapid self-involved ditz who uses her looks in climbing up the social ladder, finding herself in progressively more vile situations. dirk bogarde is one of her lovers, laurence harvey another, but the movie really is the property of miss christie, who gives a performance as breathtaking as her looks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing Film from 60's England","review":"I have never particularly been a Julie Christie fan. There's no denying that she is beautiful and talented, but there is something about her that has always left me cold. In \\"Dr. Zhivago\\", I never understood why Yuri left Tonya for her Lara. In this film, however, she seems perfectly cast as the social climbing model who will do anything and use anyone to get to the next level. She even engenders some sympathy for her character when she attains her \\"dream\\" and it's not all that it's cracked up to be. The reason she probably won the Oscar for this performance is that she made an essentially unsympathetic character somewhat bearable. Not to be overlooked is Dirk Bogarde's sympathetic portrayal as the writer who Christie's Diana uses on her way to the top but who inevitably gets the last laugh on her. One thing that struck me was how sexually provocative this film was considering it was made in 1965."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE \\"60's\\" film with an Icon at her start . . .","review":"This is The ultimate \\"60's\\" film. A wonderfully witty & intelligent script, superb performances, masterful direction and in glorious B&W. All about a princess named Diana, in search of herself in \\"Swinging London\\". Ms. Christie never makes a false move (rumored to be based on Grace Kelly & offered to Shirley Maclaine) and she is the beautiful orbit that this film revolves around. One of the great under-appreciated films of the 60's. Own it & commit it to memory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cutting out the charm and character...","review":"This MGM Home Video version of Darling (#1005693) is not a full version of the film. It was enjoyable but rings of media puritanism. A number of defining scenes, albe-them mildly risque, are missing. This is cultural and historical bleaching. We must discourage companies from ruining films. Do not buy it. I am now out the money and looking for the full version on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Story of a poor little rich girl","review":"Diana Scott (Julie Christie) has just made the cover of \\"Ideal Woman\\" magazine. In a flashback, she recalls her rise to fame and fortune, beginning as a 20-year old would-be model in swinging-sixties London. She was beautiful, hip, and full of life, gliding easily through love affairs and joining the ranks of the upper class.Christie was so young and beautiful in this movie! Even with the black and white photography, she's luminous, dynamic, and, yes, darling. In her Oscar-winning role, she climbs the social ladder using Dirk Bogarde and Lawrence Harvey as two of her stepping stones; they're both excellent.The movie is such a product of it's time (1965) and puts so much emphasis on her trendy wardrobe that it seemed a bit dated to me. Also, there were a few scenes when I thought she hammed it up too much, but still I enjoyed her and the movie and recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"JULIE BEFORE THE DOCTOR IN RUSSIA","review":"JULIE CHRISTIE became the most famous of the so-called ENGLISH birds of the sixties, and this film made her a star and justifully so.This film is a prime example of how a movie can reflects its time, even if by today's standard we have becomed so accustumed to cynicism in movies that it seems it doesn't reach us anymore.In 1965 ,this tone was something new.JULIE then starred in other movies like DOCTOR ZHIVAGO,FAHRENHEIT 451,FAR FROM THE MADDING CROWD AND PETULIA ,easily one of the strangest movie of the sixties.JULIE was a wonderful romantic heroine."},{"rating":"2","title":"David Iles is clearly miskaken (for an unexperienced listen)","review":"This album is one of the 24 cds i could not LIVE without.

These guys are balls out awesome, and if you can't see that you're missing out, because I won't be surprised when I see these guys opening for Tool one day, or hell: maybe Tool opening for them. These guys clearly won't sink down to being on tour with NOFX or Blink 182 so don't look here if that's what you want: this is Trent Reznor blowing his voice out with inspirational lyrics of Chino Moreno and the guitar riffs of kick you in the face At the Drive In, but as hardcore and energetic as Poison the Well, The Dillinger Escape Plan, or Pantera.

This book offers almost nothing in terms of branding your business in the B2B marketing, which is disappointing considering the title of the book.

Another marketing book that clogs up the shelves, and which ideas could be consensed into a couple pages. No thanks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I had expected more from the title. There are many brief case study illustrations but not really any sort of systematic evaluation and dissecting of the the criteria used in determining the desired brand and the target audiences. As the author states, B2B marketing and branding is often made up of numerous influencers and parties involved in the decision. He missed an opportunity to describe these various parties for the each case, the various parties involved in the decision, the key factors of concern for each party (e.g., warranty, serice follow up, etc.), and how the company went about addressing these in its brand positioning and marketing strategy. Instead, most cases are general overviews with little indepth analysis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best quick guide to branding for B2B marketers","review":"Bob Lamons gives you two books in one -- a succinct summary of branding fundamentals without the mumbo jumbo, plus 21 concise case histories from leading business-to-business companies. In an era where every brand consultancy must have its own \\"model,\\" Lamons distills the essentials, the common ground, that every brand needs to thrive. His cases are to-the-point and insightful, although at times almost too brief, too neat, too self-contained. If your firm's (or your customers')brands need help, read this book first. It will be time well spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Perspective, Practical Advice","review":"Great perspective and sound, practical advice from one of the world's experts. Lovingly written about a topic that is very important - but all too often not understood - business to business branding. We're using this book to explain the concept and importance of Brands to many B-to-B firms, where the culture is often such that the whole concept is seen only very fuzzily. Lammons writes to that audience and knows it well -and explains patiently and with concrete examples why business-to-business branding is important, different, and can have a profound impact on the bottom line.

It's bright allright -- right out of the package. Carry it a few days on your keychain, and the output is dim and flickery. Reseating the tail cap gets rid of the flicker, but you have to do it every time you want to use it. And it stays dim. My advice: Go to the nearest Wal-Mart and get a Dorcy 1-AAA LED. It's slightly larger than the Mag Solitaire, but for $4.99 you'll get a light that's more reliable, brighter and has longer battery life. And you'll never have to change a bulb, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"The color is the best thing...","review":"This flashlight design is more than ten years old. The biggest improvement in that time (as for all maglites) is the range of colors on offer. Otherwise all the torches are pretty much the same. Meanwhile, the rest of the world has moved on with brighter bulbs, shockproof designs, better battery life.So while this was once cool, now it is just another torch in a pretty color.

I purchased this product because it said \\"BULB TYPE\\" was LED. Well, I took it out of the package, and that's when I noticed that it was infact an incadescent bulb, not an LED one. The power output is a fraction of what the same flashlight would offer if it was LED.Before bying this, I wanted to make sure it was the right one on MagLite's website ([...]). It sure seemed that way to me, considering the bulb type is very clearly listed as LED.So, if you want an LED flashlight, get something else - this is not one of them. This is a relatively useless flashlight, and I couldn't be any more disappointed with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well built, but useless","review":"The Solitaire is relatively well built, but the poor beam makes it useless. Its not bright even with fresh batteries, and it QUICKLY dims. There is almost no sidespill, even when adjusted to wide beam. It eats up batteries, and has very poor beam quality.This is the only Maglite model that I rate as below satisfactory. It flat out fails.There are better options out there. Arc flashlights are very bright for their size, reliable, and have a good beam. They use LED bulbs that never burn out. Plus, they are semi-regulated so that they maintain their brightness for longer periods than the Solitaire. Other pocket lights worth looking at are Photon Microlights and the CMG Sonic (both use LED bulbs). Shop around, decide what works best for you and is in your price range.That said, I cannot recommend the Mag Solitaire regardless of price.

It has a traditional incandescent bulb, NOT LED (which I prefer since the light is yellowish-white instead of the harsh white of an LED)2. Because it does not use a LED bulb, the batteries drain very quickly (I noticed the light coming out of it got considerably dim after about an hour of use, but it was still working. I have rechargeable batteries so this was not a big deal.)3. It does NOT produce a lot of light (it is great for applications where you don't need or want too much light)Overall, it is a good flashlight (and you can put it on your key-chain), but it does have its drawback and is not for application which require a lot of light or long battery life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"I bought one of these units many years ago, and there was a problem with it after a couple months (I didn't even use it that much). The problem was with the switch; it doesn't come on right the way, and I had to try it a couple more times before it works. I thought that was just a defected unit, so I bought another one 5 years ago. The same thing happened again. Don't let the name Maglite fool you; this one is a \\"LEMON\\" with a capital L.

The light it gives is truly weak and pathetic, even with a brand new battery; there was not one task I gave it that it did even passably well at.

I keep buying them, thinking they'll get better, but they don't. Like others have said, they aren't very bright and they use power rapidly. And they flicker. I really do want a small flashlight for door locks and the like, but this definitely not it. DO BETTER, MAGLITE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beam very faint - not a quality light","review":"I normally find Amazon ratings on a product useful. I bought this based on the high ratings of these reviewers you see here. Unfortunately these reviews did not at all match my experience. There are a few reviews indicating the weakness of the beam. These are the valid reviews after my testing for the last two moths. I replaced the packaged batteries originally thinking that no flashlight would have such a weak beam. You turn the tip of the light to turn on and off - you can focus the beam by turning it further, but at no time is the beam of sufficient power. I have used smaller flashlights with far stronger luminance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still in the dark?","review":"This is a real you-must-have-one item, I can't remember my life before, I never left my home without my MAGLITE SOLITAIRE and my Leatherman MICRA."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get this -- Buy a little bigger one and you'll happier","review":"I have purchased THREE of these.

Having been impressed by the quality of Maglite's full-sized flashlights, I thought the key-chain lights would be equally well-designed and of similar quality. I was wrong. Twice. The first time I bought one of the key-chain lights it would get turned on while in my pocket due to the normal jostling around and the batteries would be wasted quickly. I'd have to keep changing batteries. It seems this is a minor engineering problem and could be easily fixed (such as by requiring more force to turn it on).

This is NOT an LED light, and does not come close to the performance of an LED light at half the price! Guess we're paying for the name and the lifetime warranty.

Bought it for my medical career wife (she likes purple) but it is clumsy for her to turn on, concentrate the beam, then turn off with one hand. Bought her a 99-cent tear-drop shaped keychain LED light on a whim and its perfect. Brighter and easier to use, replaceable battery, and 1/7 the cost. I really expected more from this company, but both this light and their customer perspective are obsolete. No complaint with the quality of construction. Solid aluminum and O-rings as usual. Just has the minor flaw of casting a weak and scattered beam, way below the performance of modern LED technology. The light is yellow and full of shadow artifacts that prevent a clean illumination.

The book recounts how a group of them trekked 1,600 MILES to get back to their homeland in the northern plains. It is an exciting, intelligent and heart-breaking read.

To read is to absorbthe rhythms and images, to feel an illusion of becomingmore Indian as chapter follows chapter, to understand withan Indian mind the genocidal subjugation and impoverishmentof a tribe that hoped for peace.This is a story of chiefs, warriors, women and children. Itis a story of tragic misunderstandings, murders, fights,flights, and survival. Written in 1953, long beforepolitical correctness, and based on solid research and achildhood spent in the company of Cheyenne who survived thewars, the narrative does not indulge in cheap moraljudgements - the stories of the Indian men and women wholived and struggled and died cut straight into the reader'sheart in a way that is beyond judgement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked great - but only for 12 months","review":"Loved this toaster oven for its versatility and large capacity, until it stopped toasting after 12 months of moderate use.

Muffins in the front right corner of the oven cavity burned on top before others were close to doneness. Toast really doesn't toast well, because it's too far from the heating elements and ends up drying out before it's truly toasted. But the oven did great on a 12-inch frozen pizza.The second oven has had no problems with the temperature knob, but has had odd \\"electronics\\" odors at times and today had a pop and a flame that briefly shot out the right side.

The time you save over warming up a full-size oven is wonderful!Like many other reviews, we also had problems with the temperature knob being stuck. That started when it was about a year old and got progressively worse. Last week, the oven simply quit heating on the top, so now it's in the trash.

I don't see any parts available. I am certainly not going to send it in to get fixed. Looks like I either need to jury rig it, or throw it away.

They are hard to clean, and rust out in my Hawaii climate. I decided to invest in this Rival oven, and couldn't be happier.

It is the perfect appliance for one person. It looks good, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good oven at a great price","review":"I was a bit concerned after reading some of the negative reviews of this toaster oven, but my daughter had recently bought one and seemed quite satisfied. Yes, the outside gets very hot when it is in use, but I have never seen a toaster oven that didn't. It's shape (rounded to hold a 12\\" pizza) is convenient, and it seems to be able to actually reach 450, which my last toaster oven couldn't manage.

At $49, I can recommend it enthusiastically."},{"rating":"1","title":"Usable toaster oven until timer quit.","review":"Got the oven as a house-warming present. Never had a toaster oven before so was quite pleased to receive the gift. Using it as a toaster, it never worked well. Inconsistent. And two years later, I know know why. The timer is the weakest link. A toaster oven in general is great for a one-person household. It reheats pizza incredibly well. I never knew how awful reheating pizza in a microwave was until I got to use a toaster oven.Pros: in general, a toaster oven reheats many foods to a much better state. Large size. Fits 12\\" pizzas and included a pizza pan. Two racks. Crumb tray pulls out the front.Cons: the timer died in about two years. Parts are non-existent. Due to the timer, toast was a challenge. Door does not have a stop other than the handle. It sits on my microwave so it can open too far.Anyone know where I can get a DKJ-Y-60 timer in the States?

One day I noticed the unit did not shut the coils off after set temp was reached. It did get hotter than normal but it did not melt any cords or anything that crazy. I turned it off and tried to test it the next day. The coils do not heat up, and you cannot hear any \\"clicking\\" when the temp dial is turned. It's definitely the thermostat control that died.

The toaster time control is stuck and it very difficult to move. Normally when you move the toaster control to \\"light\\" or \\"dark\\" the toaster oven ticks down a certain timeframe, then dings that it's finished. There's no ticking, no moving of the temperature control button, no ding, and your toast burns every time. This item was very barely used, though I did store it safely and in good packaging for a year.

We have had several toaster ovens and this is hands down the best. The controls are easy to understand,workmanship excellent.Easy to keep clean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best one out there, but not perfect","review":"I bought this oven about a week ago and it works great. It cooks everything perfectly, just follow the directions on the package of the food being cooked, no need to adjust them. The quality is far better than any other brand, I've seen them all, and it can fit a 12\\" pizza, major selling point for me. The pans that come with it are pretty good in quality as well, however, the cookie sheet likes to warp at temperatures over 300 degrees. It's not a bad warp and the pan is still usable, but it shouldn't warp so quickly. The only major complaint I have with this oven is the temperature control knob. It worked fine at first, but now it's really hard to turn. It turns really easily when the oven is hot, but when the oven is cold it is nearly impossible to turn. I'm thinking I just got a defective one since no one else mentions this in their review. This oven would have gotten 5 stars, except for that pesky knob; even with that, the best toaster oven out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"AN EXPENSIVE PIECE OF JUNK","review":"I bought this product over a year ago after reading glowing reviews. Now I see that others are having similar problems that I've had. I cannot rely on the temperature gauge because everything would burn. As it is, if the temp is set higher than 225, WHATEVER is in there will burn. The timer also has a habit of sticking, so if you're not watching, it will continue to cook your food and not cycle off. I've resorted to using a kitchen timer. Although its spacious inside, if you try to toast several pieces of bread, they will toast unevenly, so its best to just do two at a time. The ability to heat a frozen pizza, although seemingly convenient, is not worth the lost counter space and frustration because you made the mistake of \\"walking away thinking a toaster oven could cook your food without being watched.\\" What was I thinking? Even if I could exchange it, it functions so poorly, why would I want another?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Run Away!","review":"This is the worst toaster I have ever owned. The temp. controls are wildly inacurate, the fan rattles the whole time it's on. Sure it's big and big is nice but what is the point of being able to fit a pizza if the thing is going to burn it. There are much better Toasters out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Toaster Oven is Junk","review":"I have had the same problems as other people:The temperature knob sticks and can only move after the machine heats up.The spring in the door broke off and now the door won't stay closed.I have used the thing lightly for less than a year and these problems already make the machine unusable.It is a piece of junk and the warranty is a joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice while it worked","review":"This toaster oven was perfect for a year. Then, as others have mentioned, the temperature dial started sticking. After turning it too hard one day trying to unstick it, it broke. I took apart the unit to look at the thermostat switch. I really don't think I am going to be able to fix it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Temperature Knob Sticks","review":"Overall, I think it is a decent toaster, except for the main problem that is mentioned elsewhere here that the temperature knob sticks. Now, it is impossible to move until it gets hot. This is a manufacturing defect and the unit should be recalled."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't recommend this oven","review":"We are now on our 2nd oven and once again the temperature knob broke. Even after exchanging our first oven for another one the knob never really worked right. However, we got used to preheating the oven before being able to move the temperature knob. Although today it finally bit the dust and now I am going to replace this toaster over with a different brand. If it was not for the temperature knob I would recommend this oven. Although with it being a larger size oven, it does take longer to heat up than the smaller toaster ovens."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZZZING! went the spring...in my toaster oven","review":"I bought this toaster oven just over a year ago from a local store. I am now looking online to see reviews of all kinds of toaster ovens, since i am unhappily in the market for a new one. Although I was once happy with this machine, I no longer am. For many months now it has toasted very unevenly, but the final deal breaker was that pesky little door spring. It failed about 3 weeks ago, and no matter how much we fiddle with it, there is no way to remove the door, bend the spring into place, replace the spring, etc. Imagine my surprise to find that a bunch of others have had the same exact problem! My next toaster oven will not be from Rival. I prefer being able to use it without heating up my kitchen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money on this item!!!","review":"I've had this oven for about 2 years. I was satisfied with it until this morning when the heating element wouldn't come on. The fan did. I thought was toast was cooking until I looked at the oven and it was still cold. It did do a great job on pizza. If you're wanting to cook toast, buy something else. Considering the cost, I expected it to last longer. I don't recommend this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of Sticking Knob!","review":"I bought this getting a very good price but found like others have written the timer knob Sticks most of the time burning up anything you put inside like toast for example which defeats the purpose of a timer! It just burned up 2 corn muffins I Placed in it placing the knob on light toast. I went into the other room to watch TV and smelled something burning! I discovered the timer knob at OFF position but the Oven was still ON with the Light Lit. This is not the first time this has happened. If You just want this for baking and feel safe that this thing won't burn your house down go ahead and purchase it. I live alone with no kids so will continue to use it very carefully. My suggestion is not to purchase this regardless of the price. If It wasn't for the Poorly designed & dangerous knob I would give this 4 or maybe even 5. Beware.."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't they have a ZERO star for this?","review":"This movie was so stupid I had to turn it off about 45 minutes into it.

This book claims to seek to analyze the impact of anarchists on nationalist movements and the transmission of ideas. However, the book never really focuses on anything. Rather, the book is really about nationalist literature, mostly from the Philippines. And the book goes into detail about the literature and authors, so if you haven't read the original books you're out of luck.I realize this book probably wasn't meant for me, but the title seemed to suggest a much more interesting project about anarchist and anti-colonial discourse. Anderson never makes a convincing argument about these linkages. Recommended only for scholars of Southeast Asian literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cracked spine = Not \\"new\\".","review":"Cracked to the point of almost falling apart in two spots top to bottom, to me, anyway, does not a \\"new\\" ranking (or even a \\"good\\" one), make.

The studio albums from this era are easy listening compared to these ripping-funk/fusion-fests!The list of superstar band members is monstrous ... John Scofield, Bob Berg, Daryl Jones (on discs 3-10) ... Kenny Garret, Benny Rietveld ... DAMN!The recording quality is brilliant throughout, and although many song titles repeat several times (even from afternoon to evening concerts on the same date) each performance is a unique adventure all its own.Live Around the World pales in comparison (other than the smoking Kenny Garret solo on Human Nature). The Heavy Metal Prelude/Heavy Metal medley from 1988 (with Foley on lead bass) is so loud and jarring that it is just scary!If you can afford it, you must own this."},{"rating":"2","title":"the final/fantastic years of miles career","review":"Most of the other reviewers have already lucidly described the value of this box. Even if Miles 80s albums did not \\"do much for you\\", you should check this set out. These live recordings contain ample evidence that Miles could still improvise, select brilliant musicians for his bands, and create vital live music. The price for this set may seem high, but you're getting twenty discs of incredible music, and many Amazon partners sell it at a lower price. If you're hesitant to take the plunge on this box, try Miles' single disc \\"Live Around The World\\". If you enjoy that, you can't be without this set. Highest of recommendations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Collection","review":"It is nice to see new Miles Davis material anytime that it finally hits the stores. This collection brings all his late material for everyone to enjoy. I would recommend this to any Miles Davis fan and collector, I have all the Miles Davis boxsets and wish Columbia would of done the packaging for this boxset the same as Previous releases. Great book is included with drawings by Miles. Music sounds great, but a lot of songs are repeated 5 or 6 times, disc only contain 50 minutes of music per disc, could of released the set with 10 discs. But at always, Miles is at his best live, so buy it and enjoy his music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderfull music, complete destroyed package","review":"The music, the songs, the sound, the recording quality - all brillant. But the box is a complete disaster: Cheap and quick done, it broke at several parts, when i opened it the very first time (!). And this for the prize of 200 Euro and almost another 60(!) for duty.

Heck, for the price, that's worth it, but it only lasted my dad a month, and me about the same before the clip became very loose due to the spring being faulty.

Berlin's thoughts are outstanding, but his writing is poor. A former editor of _The_New_Yorker_ said to Berlin, \\"I haven't understood a thing you've said, but if you have something to publish, I'll publish it.\\"It is unfortunate that such a 'great thinker' would put his ideas out of reach of the masses by making his work so difficult to read. If you want to read this book, or any of Sir Isaiah's work, give it a shot. Be warned, though, you'll have to read it very carefully about four times before you understand what he's trying to say.

This being a dark movie, it was slightly surprising that he was very light-hearted, and witty, and good-humored. I thought the movie first rate. It is intelligent and well-written and well-directed. The only flaw I found in it is there is a scene where a bullet is shot through a hanging sheet. The camera pans to the hole in the sheet to show the dead body on the other side. Well, for the hole to accomodate the camera, it had to be as wide as a hole a baseball would go through. A bullet would never make a hole that big! So that marred the movie slightly. But other than that, I liked it a lot. It is dark, and a lot of people in the class didn't like it because of that. But if you like dark, check this out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious and indulgent!","review":"This well-shot first feature from James Gray features good performances from some fine actors, but is sunk by its hopelessly muddled, pretentious screenplay. Gray seems more interested in imitating people like Coppola, Scorsese, Bergman and Visconti (to name a few) than he does in telling an honest story from his heart. The result is a cold, almost clinical study of a Russian Jewish family and their two troubled sons, one of whom is a hit man for the mob. The result is also uninvolving emotionally. Instead of trying to show us how clever and brilliant you are, James, why not just tell an honest story from your heart? The talent is obviously there. A real disappointment, considering the talent of all involved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many unanswered questions...","review":"I don't have a lot to say about this movie except that it is not your typical mob drama and the family tragedy spewed on some major depression.

I just want to assure anyone who stumbles on it here and sees \\"Little Big Man\\" classified as a Western novel: this is not Louis L'Amour territory! This is one of the funniest, most heart-rending stories ever concocted using historical fact and brilliantl imagination; Berger gives the reader some idea of what it must have been like to live in the American West during the submission of the Plains Indian tribes, and doesn't spare our feelings in the process. Not that it's a diatribe. LBM is a novel, first and foremost a wonderful read.

It is a weird journey to be compared only with the eerie and stunning impact of reading Ligotti's own Songs of a Dead Dreamer. I wish Cisco's new fans good hunting as they now go in search, as they must, to find his several short stories, including \\"The Reliquaries,\\" \\"Translation,\\" \\"He Will Be there,\\" \\"For No Eyes,\\" \\"The Water Nymphs,\\" \\"Firebrands of Terror,\\" and others.

The staples are pressed flat, so they are far less likely to catch on something.

It uses standard staples."},{"rating":"1","title":"A stapler is not a stapler...(but doesn't last!)","review":"OK - I thought \\"a stapler is just a stapler.\\" How different could one be than another.Well, for such a simple office tool, this one is much better. Its easy to push the staple through. But more important, the \\"anvil\\"?? (the metal that bends the staple) is a much more intelligent design. It actually has 2 articulated parts that bend the staple completely flat. You won't catch your finger on them. As the product description states, a pile of stapled papers lies flat.One of those small, minor improvements that removes one hassle from your life. My only concern is that the strap that pulls the holder back when you open to refill is apparently a clear Mylar ribbon. Doesn't seem like it will last, but no problems so far.Worth a few bucks more for a better designed product.===Update after 6 months of light use.

It is just as great as the day I first got it. Very easy to use and no jamming. Like someone else said, I believe the number of sheets it will handle is due more to the length of the staple. Standard staples are around 30 sheets. This stapler handles them all easily. I'm in the process of buying two more for people who have fallen in love with mine and threaten my knowing its whereabouts. ;)I'm dropping this to 4 stars. Now that I have received and inspected the newer model I find one disappointing feature. When I opened the top to add staples I noticed the strap that holds the top to the staple tension spring is now made of (what appears to be) nylon and plastic. My older model has metal parts.

This collection showcases his music over the past few years and includes songs that somehow were left off his first greatest hits collection. What I wish Tim would do ...if he is going to do greatest hits albums...is include not only the new songs(which are great on this new collection), but also put some of the songs from his very first cd that flopped.... Welcome to the Club, Memory Lane...just to name a few. Instead of duets where he is the \\"backup\\"...they should have put those 2 that i mentioned as bonus cuts.

The country twang just totally kills the mood of the song. I am a professional audio engineer, and heard him do this song live and it just made me cringe. Skip this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"He's Horrible","review":"McGraw is a pretentious, talentless slimeball who exploits the ignorance and poor taste of his fans. His songs are mediocre at best and generally unlistenable to anyone who appreciates good music. Basically, he is a talentless slob who ranks among all the other bubble-gum pop/country performers as forgettable and pretentious.And if that wasn't enough, he absolutely butchers Ryan Adams' beautiful song \\"When The Stars Go Blue.\\" It's tough to hear McGraw hack such a lovely song, but at least Adams (who is one of the better singer/songwriters around in any genre) is making some money for it.If you like good music or real artists, you should look elsewhere - perhaps check out Ryan Adam's original version of \\"When The Stars Go Blue\\". Regardless, McGraw is a classless act and a mockery to the country music establishment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pimp-daddy McGraw","review":"My boss and I agree on one thing: Tim McGraw looks like a sleazy, back-alley-lurking, bottom-of-the-barrell, slime-ball pimp-daddy, and those are his good points. The fact is, without studio wizardry he wouldn't have any hits. His voice is absolutely colorless, meaning, basically that he has to whine his way through entire songs just to try and convey the simplest emotions. I'm a big fan of country music WHEN IT'S GOOD.

Coming off of the huge commercial success of Glass Houses and 52nd Street, Billy changes gears completely. Instead of releasing a live album that recycles his more recent hits, he dusts off some of his earlier work and presents it to us in a live setting.You can see in these performances the brilliance and passion of an artist who is completely committed to his material. Whether it be the intimacy of \\"You're My Home\\" performed in a small club or the intensity of \\"Captain Jack\\" in a large arena, each performance seems perfectly set in the appropriate venue.Billy Joel is at his absolute best here. I particularly recommend \\"Songs\\" to the fan who has only seen Billy in his more mundane concerts of the last few years, often paired with Elton John. This album shows you a performer at his creative peak."},{"rating":"2","title":"Billy's Best","review":"I'm not much of a billy joel fan, but this is really a remarkable effort. Up there with Joni Mitchell's 'Miles of Aisles' as an endearing document to Joel's uncorrupted talent.Unfortunatley, Joel veered towards schmaltzy commercialism almost immediatley after this album's release (although 'the Nylon Curtain,' which came after this, was pretty good).These songs are personal, almost auto-biographical. There is romantacism to tracks like 'Summer Highland Falls,' with 'You're My Home' being perhaps the best song Joel has written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Time to put on DVD","review":"Come on studio, put it on DVD and make scalpers charging $50 to go broke for being so greedy. The movie is a reasonably good time travel story. William Devane, Lauren Hutton, and the rest the cast turn in good performances. The synopsis says the storyline. A man tries to stop a time traveller that is going back to the past to change history. This story has been seen in a couple others, but this is slightly different and the production values are good. I recommend it once it comes out on DVD for a reasonable price. The outrageous prices being asked here for a used VHS is ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"$100??? $200???

I've seen a lot of martial arts movies, so I'm used to the crazy story lines, but this one was pretty bad. The action was okay, but I got a headache watching the scene where Sonny fights the bull. They tried to make it so you were right there in the action, but the result is just a long segment of very jerky shots, which got annoying after awhile. The transfer was pretty poor, so the picture isn't really that good. If you really want to see Sonny Chiba in action, doing what he does best, get the Streetfighter series. With a title like Champions of Death, I expected to see more action."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sonny Chiba, master of Karate, or master of livestock?","review":"\\"Champion of Death\\" chronicles the life of a hero by the same name. Sonny Chiba brings an inspiring performance of a lifetime in a movie that keeps audiences coming back asking, \\"What just happenned?\\". The depth of his character pulling beyond the cliche roles of karate masters that Sonny is often cast. He now portrays teacher, serogate father, farmer, and evil rapist. The film climaxes as Sonny, in a drunken stupor kills a man only to find that his \\"fists of fury\\" carry consequences and that some people you maliciously kill have families. Families who become quite hungry when there is no father to bring home food. The film answers the questions other martial arts films have neglected. It also helped Sonny Chiba to finally be recognized by the Hollywood Walk of Fame, that is the walk of fame in our hearts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Champion of Death","review":"Champion of Death is one of the best action films you will ever see.It's true.Period.Story is based not only on life of Oyama Masutatsu,few episodes taken from tales about Miyamoto Musashi.Cinematography is good.Stylish and expressive.Fights not to modern taste,but great!You can't go wrong with this movie.Watch it.It's has real kyokushinkai masters after all,do you need something more??!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"Joey W.

Nighthorse is big. Siemanski is small. Size has nothing to do with their relationship. There is spine tingling conflict and resolution.

I don't recommend this for anyone, but if you like something a little more different and a little more spice, I suggest this book.

The camera work and sound are both execellent and combine to produce one of the best concert videos I own. I have followed Pierre's music for years, yet I have never been able to see him live. This video, I think, is probably better than a live performance because you are right there with him, sitting in front of the guitar. What impressed me most after watching the video was seeing the incredible viruosity with which Pierre performs. The guitar is his tool he uses as as he seems to explode with music. This video is a winner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, the Things He Doesn't Need to Share!","review":"This is not Al's best work. It's more rambling than usual and not so pithy.

I can only imagine that she came upon Al Franken (or ALF, as I will forever refer to him from this day forward) pitching his latest offering on an episode of Oprah while flipping through channels, and decided I might enjoy it. Out of respect for mom, I read the book. ALF may bode well on a talk show, but in this case please save a tree. I could not, in good conscience, pass this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Standard Franken","review":"I think fans of Franken's political satire books will find this book a sad change of pace. While certainly not the worst book of the year and even funny in some places, Franken's trademark bite is curiously lacking.Perhaps one of the strangest things Franken tries to do several times throughout the book is to change pace abruptly from comedy to serious advice. It does not work well, and is almost a pardoy of itself in that sense. Although the sections on marriage are often well-written and humorous, Franken partisans should know they aren't getting Al at his best here. True fans won't mind, but the casual reader will want to wait for another book in the political medium Franken seems to save the best of his talent for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for the video","review":"I was disappointed in this book.

But-- This book is like a very prolonged standup routine, or one of his valedictorian addresses. It is mildly amusing, but NOT WORTH $$$--I couldn't help but think of all the trees that were chopped down to make the paper for this fluff-piece he admittedlywrote on airplanes and I suppose while in the can. This isone of those books that is fun to thumb through in a bookstore, but it joins the teeming mountain of fluff booksthat litter every bookstore, books that you wonder how theyever got published. It's mildly amusing, BUT NOT WORTHPAYING FOR, BELIEVE ME! I have learned my lessonand you will thank me, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not his best...but still great","review":"I really enjoyed the Rush book as well as \\"Why not me\\".

Because the book isn't comforting, uplifting or even really that funny for the market.[...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh why did I spend Yen on this \\"book\\"","review":"Horrible.

If not, don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not funny, not helpful","review":"Not worth the 2 hours it takes to read. It's about as important as an Al Franken spot on Letterman, an entertaining enough interview but well, that's free. This is far inferior to the Ben Stiller/Janeane Garafolo book of a similar vein. Methinks the dullest folks from Franken's generation who now also have kids and too-high budgets may like this drivel. Anyone could write this, it's water-cooler chit chat at it's worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, the money you could save!","review":"If you really feel the need to read this rather bland work, I'd suggest just borrowing a copy from the library.

Wow, was that a mistake. Oh the things i know! makes me think Al wrote the book in his sleep. Not only is it not funny, it's not clever either. Al fills his book with bad advice and tries to pass it off as him being humorous. Sure, there's the occasional funny part- the politics chapter- the religion chapter- but overall this Al book is simply dumb and unhumorous. It is a shame Al used his big name to get away with publishing such crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Sad...","review":"When I reviewed Franken's \\"Why Not Me?\\" I explained that I had read it because I loved \\"Rush Limbaugh is a Big...\\" but \\"Why Not Me?\\" had fallen short of my high expectations. THIS book was even MORE disappointing. The subject matter is worn and the material is not that creative, and sadly, just not that funny. Honestly, I WANTED to laugh- I LIKE Al Franken, but this book just feels forced, the kind of thing that's churned out just to meet a publisher's deadline and get Franken's face back to the front of book racks (Pre- \\"Lies...\\" of course). It's worth reading if you are stuck on an airplane, or an elevator, or something. Otherwise, pick something else by Franken. ANYTHING else by Franken."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Collection","review":"This really is a great collection of Billy Joel's 70's and 80'sworks. If you are like me then you like most of Billy Joel's musicbut to buy all of his albums would be very expensive. This is the next best thing. These two CD's contain many of his greatest hits. The only regret I have is that I didn't buy the box set. If I can convince you of anything here it would be to buy the box set. Really two CD's are not enough to cover his music thoroughly (actually neither is 4 but that's the best that we are offered right now). I hope this helped you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Billy Joel is the ultimate musician!","review":"Billy Joel is the ultimate musician!

Songs like \\"Piano Man\\" \\"Movin' Out\\" \\"Scenes\\" \\"You May Be Right\\" and \\"Still Rock 'N Roll\\" you simply can't get enough of. So after enjoying this album, I bought some of Billy's other albums, and I think if you only buy the greatest hits ablbum, you'll still be missing out on some of Joel's best songs. Where's \\"Summer Highland Falls\\"? What about \\"All For Leyna\\" and \\"Sometimes a Fantasy\\"? \\"James\\"? \\"This Night\\"? So I think this is a decent album for a casual fan, but to fully appreciate Joel's stuff, pick up \\"Turnstiles\\" or \\"The Stranger\\"(which is mostly on the Greatest Hits album, but is a lot cheaper). \\"Songs in the Attic\\" is a great intro to his early stuff.

Unlike most Top 40 songs nowadays, the songs actually MEAN something, telling double-edged truths of everyman's life & universal attendent problems.

These were two important hits on Joel's career that should have been included. Otherwise, this is a great collection of hits from Billy Joel throughout his whole career. Highlights include \\"Piano Man\\", \\"Scenes From An Italian Restaurant\\", \\"She's Always A Woman\\" (one of his best), and \\"Goodnight Saigon\\". The whole CD is really a good document of Joel's career and is a good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good collection of a great career","review":"Covering Joel's career from the early 70's to the mid 80's, this collection does a fine job of capturing the different styles of music that Joel was able to incorporate successfully into his diverse albums. From ballads to rockers, to story songs, there was little limit to what Joel was able to accomplish. The basic difficulty with any greatest hits package for an artist of this skill is that his albums often represented a particular sound he was working with at the time, so any collection sounds like a mixture that lacks focus. However if you are a casual fan or someone who is looking for a nice assembly of hits, this should do it for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING: Not the Complete Versions","review":"I don't often get \\"greatest hits\\" collections, preferring instead to buy original albums, but in this case I did, because there are a handful of Billy Joel songs I wanted in my collection, but I didn't want to invest enough to purchase all of his albums. Unfortunately, they don't tell you that what you get here, at least in some instances, are the \\"single\\" versions of these songs, not the full-length versions from the original albums. Case in point: One of my favorite Billy Joel songs is \\"Just the Way You Are,\\" but the version on this set cuts an entire verse. I haven't done comparisons on all of the other songs, but if they'd pull that on this song, they probably did so on others as well. It's incomprehensible to me; if someone wants Billy Joel songs, the odds are that they want the complete songs, not truncated re-edits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware - This is NOT A MUSIC CD","review":"The first CD in this set has something called Sony Music \\"CD Extra\\". This is a multimedia program that includes videos, etc. It will also install AOL software on your PC. In my case, it simply did not work. I am unable to play the music from the first CD on my PC. The second CD is normal and works fine. I followed the instructions and went to the Sony website, and they do have a web page for \\"CD Extra\\".

I was very disappointed and wrote to them about it, and their response was a chastisement for not reading carefully. They didn't have to be so curt.

I heard it on the radio and had to have the tape for my house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly Overrated Sap for the Boomers","review":"Let's be brutally honest for a moment. This music is very cheesy. More specifically, its melodramatic, sentimental, and irritatingly precious. Worse still are Joel's pretensions toward poetry and his tendency to lionize his own artistic talents. As easily as these melodies can lull the listener into a stupified ersatz bliss, they can just as easily dull the ear to much more challenging forms (eg jazz or classical). This is the worst kind of commodified, commercialized cheese, spewed forth not by some faceless record company (that would be forgivable) but by the singer/songwriter himself! Billy Joel succesfully did to rock and roll what twinkie did to foodstuffs, what the A-team did to theater and what Vanila Ice did to hip hop. If Billy Joel is languishing in some \\"Hell\\" of adult soft-rock contemporary music as the official review states, then its a self-imposed exile by one of that bleak wind-blown plane's arch demons himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Billy Joel - What A Guy","review":"From the humble start that he had, I must admit the BILLY JOEL has become one (if not the only one) of the best musical talents to date.Being in the early part of my 30's now, I think back and wonder \\"Has it been that long!!!!\\" since the first time I heard \\"An Innocent Man\\"...

It's especially relevant today and especially for us in the U.S. as we tend to think more in terms of \\"us\\" and \\"them\\" and truly people the world over aren't that different: they all want happiness for themselves and their families. Steven, with no experience traveling outside the U.S., decided to strike out and literally do the unthinkable......Take a long walkAround the worldThat took 4 yearsAnd to do it alone.The writing is excellent, the story is spectacular, and if you haven't read it please do now.

I've never read a novel that has so much creativity and imagination. The writer's perspective of action, emotion drama and romance are mysterious. This story gives twist and turns every page, with normal to abnormal writing. It shows how the writer can think out of the box and then come right back in. L.L. Brunk captures the characters in the story so vivid and on point. The characters express, good and evil as they choose there fait. It is superb how the writer gives personalities to each of the characters. The emotion they portray and action they partake is very well explained. The writer describes the thoughts, actions and emotion of the nameless one. In my conclusion this story is suspenseful every chapter and keeps you on your toes. I hope for another novel very soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle Edition is Better Product For Your Money","review":"The \\"paperback\\" version of this book is full of errors in grammar and even mispelled words.

The Kindle edition (Between Shadow & Light-Expanded & Extended Edition), will save you money, being only a $1.99, and the writing is by far better quality.

He still kills people in prison and prisoners try to kill him. They stab him. Take a piece of his ears. And still he survived. The movie was filmed off-tint and off-color. This film would have been 75% better without the off-tint/off-color stuff. Normal color and studio lighting would have been just fine. I dislike movies that are color-bleached. Brilliant performance by Eric Bana. He looks good with the extra weight.By the way, in regards to the bar scene, that is not a real male \\"member\\" and is not really of Eric Bana. They just wanted to bring across the real spirit of the prisoner this movie portrayed."},{"rating":"1","title":"overated","review":"all of these positive reviews puzzle me..i was expecting this movie to at least be watchable,..it's not..the story is obviously 80% dramatized but he claims it's real. you'd think it wouldn't be as boring as it was..a lot of things are dumb and pointless in this movie. it wasn't even that violent. the movie is kind of a joke if you ask me..it's not even worth the rent..i watched an hour and had enough"},{"rating":"1","title":"Laughable amatuerish dreck","review":"This movie has been compared to masterpieces such as Pulp Fiction and Reservoire Dogs. The question is why? Chopper does contain explicit gore scens such as ear mutilations and shootings. Apart from the violence, Chopper lacks the humor and masterful direction from Tarantino's classic works. In addition, the acting is substandard and the plot quite simple and boring.This movie has been hyped up to be the biggest thing out of Australia for years but Chopper disappoints on all levels except the DVD transfer which is tolerable.If you want to see an Australian classic, watch Roadwarrior; Mad Max 2 and stay away from Chopper, which is one stinking DVD, which reeks of cheap production and lame acting."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing movie","review":"chopper is one of the most brilliant movies to come out of Australia in recent history.

I just happened across this moves years & years ago. It was weird then & it's still weird now. It's about this Aussie who went around killing/Beating drug dealers & other bullies, because he thought he was supposed to. This film is also a chance to see Eric Bana before he came to the U.S. & made it big in films like \\"Black Hawk Down\\", \\"Hulk\\", \\"Troy\\", & \\"the Other Boleyn Girl\\". It's a good black comedy that will leave you wanting more. I even purchased the first of his books after seeing this. Now that was an interesting read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chopper","review":"I just recently discovered this movie after seeing Eric Bana in Black Hawk Down and wanting to see more of his work. Chopper has turned out to be one of the most rewarding movies I have seen and is now in my top 10 all time favorite films. It is an amazing story about a truly fascinating serial criminal and is brilliantly portrayed by Eric Bana in some of the best acting I have had the pleasure of viewing. His performance is truly mesmerizing. The story is violent, but wickedly funny in a dark, warped sort of way. The accents are sometimes hard to understand, but stick with it for a few minutes and you will catch on and be very entertained. I have since shared this movie with several friends who have also become Chopper fans. We find ourselves continually using Chopper quotes from the movie. I highly recommend this movie if you are looking for something out of the ordinary. Sometimes difficult to watch, but absolutelt worth every second."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eric Bana - A Stellar Performance","review":"I absolutely love this movie!Chopper is an enigmatic strikingly honest and tongue in cheek view of a large part of the life of Mark Brandon 'Chopper' Read.Since watching the movie I have visited his website and I encourage everyone reading these reviews to Google Mark Chopper Read and visit his site.I found the link to his \\"Quotes\\" most entertaining!Back onto the topic of Eric Bana and his performance. It is rare that an actor is able to immerse him/herself so completely in a character and be utterly convincing.Bana does this with aplomb and must be given kudo's for this. His mannerisms are undistinguishable from Mark Read's. The way he talks and even ennunciates his words. The weight gained for the later years of Chopper's life lends even more authenticity to Bana's performance.All in all a rather funny and honest look at the effect the press can have in raising someone to glorious heights. Whether deserving or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"The advertising should be changed for this book.

At the most, it is a good book for beginners. I'm mad at Amazon for not only advertising this book the way it did, but for also automatically charging 2 day shipping. It didn't give me a choice.

I bought the Collector's Edition which was remixed by Billy Sherrill himself and immediately wondered what went wrong. I love the idea of having an \\"uncut\\" version of the songs and being able to hear Tammy, Billy, and the studio musicians conversing with one another, but all of the previously unreleased numbers were evidently mastered on a different speed machine. It's like listening to a 33 rpm record played at 45 rpm. Common Epic Records! The First Lady of Country Music deserves much more than she got out of this tribute. I've never heard of a recall on a CD, but Epic needs to remaster this one and recall and replace the entire stock with a carefully crafted tribute to Tammy. Needless to say, I am disappointed in this release. Epic, Tammy gave her all. Now it's your turn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring train ad","review":"I used to enjoy the travel by train series but this video ruined it for me. For me, the focus was on seeing places, not seeing trains. This video has boring places to see, and the focus is on showing the food and accommodations on the train. They say that Australians go for three-day vacations that consist solely of sitting on a train and getting fed. What a boring way to spend three days. It begins promisingly by showing some cute Australian animals, but it turns into a boring ad for the train, which I wouldn't want to be stuck on for three hours, much less three days."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Star Too Many","review":"This book was terrible. The plot was like a soap from TV, completely unbelievable. Why waste your time reading this book when there are so many other great ones out there.

It is not a bad story if it is the first you have ever heard of or read of James Patterson. I have read all the Alex Cross novels and they all are 5 stars but this book was little to do about mystery and more about this woman's sex life,her lovers' sex lives and her past as an abuse victim. Where is the real mystery? Read it if you have nothing else to read but read all the Cross books first!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Impossible to put down.","review":"This is one of James Patterson's best novels.

I felt it jumped around a lot and was slow in some areas. It got lost in too much detail about Will. It sure was like a soap opra (who's child is who's). It was easy to figure out the end.

I am a long-time fan, and this one just fall flat...leaving me to believe that he had a little \\"help\\" in its writing.

Then I thought I'd give Patterson the benefit of the doubt and finish it off, in case he redeemed himself... sadly, I don't think he did.

Throughout the book Maggie is trying to lose the feeling that she is weak and a failure. As life as she knows it changes some of her feelings change. As you read the book you will become more and more into it. The author lets you know only bits and pieces, leaving the rest for you to discover with the characters.

I encourage everyone to read this author's works, they will not regret it. This book was awesome, I have not been disappointed yet. All 30 are great.

Get them and read them, you wont be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"HIDE AND SEEK IS HAUNTINGLY CHILLING","review":"My first James Patterson book is HIDE AND SEEK and I have been engaged by his writing since. His style of narration is personalized and most affecting. No nuances here, but HIDE AND SEEK is extremely gripping and riveting. It tells of a singer Maggie and his 3 dead lovers, and the intense characterization saves the novel from being banal, especially when Will as the devious and debonair paycho takes centrestage. He is a tortured soul and manipulates people including his brother to satisfy his virulent passions. Murders, deception and the first few chapters on Maggie's abused past is hauntingly chilling.James Patterson writes with speed and cuts to the point with precision. He dissects the character's soul with succinct description. For a fast read, he is definitely one of the best writers around. HIDE AND SEEK is definitely at the zenith of suspense - the read will induce a primal fear that you can't hide from."},{"rating":"1","title":"HIDE IT, SEEK ELSEWHERE!!","review":"I read this on the strength of Along Came a Spider -well it just goes to show that you cant' always judge a book by its author. This is so poor it is almost as if it has been written by someone else other than the talented writer of Along Came a Spider. The characters are one dimensional and their motivations pure pop corn. There are too many irrelevant passages such as the (unnecessarily extended) account of Will's World Cup game. The plot's thin, the writing is pedestrian.........etc,etc. What worries me is I've got Kiss The Girls on order from Amazon, so I hope its been written by the real James Patterson"},{"rating":"1","title":"Maggie needs a visit from Mr. Soneji","review":"This is solidly one of the worst Patterson books I've come across. The plot is boring and reads like a romance novel in parts and then turns into a murder/suspense novel. By the end of the book, I didn't even CARE what happened to Maggie.

Too bad Gary Soneji is dead from the Alex Cross books - I had the perfect suggestion for his next victim."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully unrealistic","review":"How this book acquired a mainstream publisher is beyond me. It has the realism of a romance novel and the depth of a shortstory in a women's magazine. While the author can write well-crafted sentences, he does not seem to have a clue about characterization or plot. The story is a string of unlikely coincidences that defy belief."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dubious Honor","review":"This book has the dubious honor of being the WORST BOOK I'VE EVER READ. And with the variety and amount of books I read that's saying a lot.Poorly written, thinly (and that's generous) developed characters, trite dialog, and was there a plot in there somewhere? I never met a more unlikeable protagonist than Maggie, nor did I care what happened to her or her ex-husbands. And WTF was Baraba Streisand doing in this??? Truly a nightmare of a novel.Note to Mr. Patterson: When you go through the process of writing a book, convincing people to publish it, then ask readers to invest time and money into purchasing and reading it, have a point. On behalf of all the readers who suffered through til the end, I demand our time and money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just awful","review":"I don't know how this thing got published.

It reads like it was written by a 16-year old (and perhaps it was). The story line is contrived; the dialogue is just barely passable; the format looks like a TV soap opera script. I keep hoping that I'll run across one of Patterson's books that I can admire - like the Alex Cross series - but mostly I've found that his writing is so sophmoric that it's embarrassing. Like Hide & Seek, sometimes I keep reading just to see if it gets any better or worse - and it never gets any better.

Unfortunately, I never want to be in the same room as one of his books ever again. The first chapter, err, several chapters since the be oh so tiny, try to focus the reader on Maggie's penchant for murdering her husbands. Our fine heroine, Maggie, beaten and hiding under the porch, shoots her husband while he is in the midst of a murderous, drug induced rampage. The police almost charged her with murder since the poor husband obviously left no tell-tail sign of violence other than the house interior smashed and trashed and Maggie having served hospital time due to her injuries. Yes, I can see where the police would initially think \\"Hmm, murder\\". The setup for the second husband is equally poorly conceived.The book was plodding, nonsensical, trite and predictable. It became landfill. The paper deserved to come back as something worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb and Dumber","review":"It seems to me the longer these 'prolific' authors keep pumping out books, the worse they get.

I had read another James Patterson title, \\"Kiss the Girls\\" and although the writing style made me wince, the plot and suspense kept me interested. This one, however, is so bad that you might just read it in disbelief that a publisher could print this nonsense. It is seriously like a high school creative writing assignment. Actually, no, strike that, I don't want to offend any high school students. Middle school? Anyway, it reads really fast and it can be amusing in the way a bad movie is amusing.

This book I was hoping would equal ALONG CAME A SPIDER in quality, but it failed miserably.It was boring; it was uneven and just plain ridiculous.

I now understand the \\"soap opera\\" references in the review section. It was almost like something Harold Robbins or Howard Fast would have written. If that's what I was looking for, I would chosen one of their books. Were it not for my faith in Mr. Patterson and the easy and speedy readability of the book I would have quit it at any number of places. I will look forward to his other books and hope this is just an anomaly. However I will say that at a mystery writers panel I attended it was James Patterson who said, \\"if you want reality, go to K-Mart.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Jaw Dropping Ending That You'll Never Guess","review":"Maggie Bradford killed her first husband Phillip, who was voilent. Years later she meets a famous soccer player named Will Sheperd, who seems nice but turns out to be worse than Maggies first husband. Now Maggie is the main suspect of Wills death. I really enjoyed this book, the suspense is breath taking and will have you at the edge of your seat. I think this has an ending almost if not better than Hitchcocks movie \\"Psycho\\". Every second there is a big twist as to whether or not Maggie killed Will. At the trial Maggie says she didn't kill Will, but the jurors wonder, who could have killed Will, and what was the reason. When you read what Will has done to the people he has met, you will question as to who Killed Will. Through out the story I just kept on changing my guess as to who the killer is. Just when you think you know who the killer is \\"guess again\\". The outcome of this mystery will leave you breathless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two Thumbs down for Patterson!","review":"Very disappointing. I became a big fan of James Patterson suspense novels when I first read Kiss the Girls. I have just finished Hide and Seek and I am very disappointed! Could this be the same Patterson who wrote Along came a Spider and Kiss the Girls? First of all, the language is so un-patterson! The main character, Maggie is portrayed as a total bimbo and the plot was totally predictable. Hasn't the woman learned her lesson?Nevertheless, I managed to finish the book because I wanted to find out whether there were more twists and surprises and there were none. Hide and Seek must have been one of Mr. Patterson's earlier works and it could have been written by any C-Grade writers. It does not have the suspense and personal touches that are characteristic of Patterson. Don't waste your time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A boring and pointless book","review":"Although I read the whole book, for no reason other than loyalty to one of my favourite authors, I have to say that James Patterson lost the plot in this book! I still can't quite work out the point of it. The story was immensely boring and I didn't care about the characters, any of them! Maggie irritated the hell out of me and her daughter was equally as irritating. If you are about to delve into the world of James Patterson don't start with this book - it's not a very good first impression of Mr Patterson's writing talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irritated Eyes","review":"I just bought this eye pencil and to the contrary it irritated my eyes.

Fante not only shows the plight of poor immigrants, but how children deal with growing up... poor or otherwise. I love how he writes from the perspective of a adolescent but makes it art.

I admit I was a little dismayed that the book did not focus exclusively on the pure beagle.

I would say watch it to see one of the many Grindhouse movies that was so bad that for some reason it was entertaining and the transfer I am talking about is from Around The World Film release.

The stranger is a wonderful album, very good. But in my opinion this is a step up from stranger, and glass houses is a step down from 52nd and stranger put together. 1979 was the last year so many good artists could squeeze out their last bit of awesome 70s creativity. By 80 everything seemed to be pretty much run out, or dried up!

What is worth raving about is the superior quality of the SACD format.I find it sad that with the pervasivness of MP3 players (and the MP3 format), we are in a time of degrading quality of music reproduction. People are choosing convenience of delivery over quality of the sound.This record sounds terrific in SACD. I'm now going to purchase as many SACD formatted versions of CDs I want to get as I can find; either pure (SACD only) or Hybrid SACD.

It seemed to me that, as a minor work of art, this CD was destined to go out of print. In addition to Miles In the Sky, I used to worry that Bob Dylan's Street Legal and Van Morrison's Veedon Fleece would go out of print, too. So far these two are still available. Miles in the Sky is edging closer to experiemtal jazz - it's out there, all right, but the instrumentation is still essentially the same as Miles' famous combo groups from the early 60s. He would take out for outer space in the next decade. At the time of this recording he was content just to arc over the jazz world in the sky, like a fireworks display. In that way the music seems idyllic and postmodern."},{"rating":"2","title":"Apotheosis of T. Williams","review":"Anthony Williams'propulsive drumming is the centerpiece of this recording, particularly his work on both versions of \\"Country Son\\", which has resisted induction into the pantheon of Miles compositions, for it being perhaps desultory and a melange of genres. Who cares? Herbie Hancock is particularly funky, auguring his work evidenced in the Warner Bros. collection. And Miles is effective in understated poignancy (again, particularly on \\"Country Son\\"). I've combed the T. Williams archives for evidence of a performance as integrated and polyphonic and powerful as his performance here and in my inexpert opinion his work on MiTS is matchless. He may have played faster, with more technical proficiency or fury subsequently, but he never played better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD by Miles Davis, modern instruments, \\"funky\\" grooves","review":"Miles Davis plays pretty modern music, using mostly electric instruments.

The smell is quite nice, not too strong and you can easily burn multiplies one after another as the smell keeps bringing you back. I recommend Coco Mango, but if it isn't from Auric Blends, that could potentially alter the scent since oils don't always come from the same buyer.

You won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"not what i expected","review":"I found myself somehow really enjoying this album. It's not like Time tells no lies. It is very rhythmic and the song writing is very NICE. l was expecting a harder rocking album although there is some good guitar work on this. All I can say is give it a chance. Listen to it a couple of times and it will grab you like it did me."},{"rating":"1","title":"this was nearly worthless without alterations","review":"i put this thing together, finally, after an hour of struggle. the materials for this included: 2 planks of wood, several long poles. the trick is to lay 1 plank down, push all of the poles into the slots on the plank, and then put the other plank on top. this doesnt work. once this piece of garbage was FINALLY assembled, according to instructions, i loaded it with my dvd collection. after, i dont know, 20 minutes, i hear a massive crash and entered the living room to discover 5 thousand dollars worth of electronic entertainment laying in a heap on the floor, mingled with 2 planks of wood and 16 wooden poles.it works fine now, after my friend and i constructed supports for the dvd rack. without the supports, this miserable thing collapsed. would i buy this again? definitely not. would i suggest it to someone else to purchase? never."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money and buy a real storage","review":"I bought this for my dvds and these are the worst storage rack ever! Do not buy this, stay away from this. The rods are super cheap and they are not all the same length and not even straight. It makes it almost impossible to put this together without being so unstable. Please take my opinion and save your money and buy something better that uses shelves rather than these cheap rods, you'll be sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another disappointing product!","review":"The product comes dis-assembled, and you need a hammer to put it together as it is a \\"friction fit\\" assembly. It is unstable on carpeted floors and needs to be attached to a wall to prevent it from swayinging and falling over. The horizontal CD shelves are made of wood dowels, which sag when filled to capacity. Also, there is no adequate mechanism to hold CDs in place if the shelf is only partially filled.Buying items on line is always a risk---better to look at in the store and pay a little higher price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Of absolutely no value.","review":"At least I only paid ten bucks on clearance. This thing's of no value whatsoever. Assembly is nearly impossible unless you have ten hands, and once assembled it flops around for a while until quite literally falling apart (cascade of DVDs onto the cat) on its own when someone closes a door. I'm going to try reworking its flawed design on the drill press just for fun, but if that doesn't work it's firewood.I have bought one of Atlantic's shelf-based units and I'm very happy with it; it's sturdy, capacious and attractive at a reasonable price. I'm also probably going to give their \\"Elf\\" unit a try because I do like the idea of inclined storage and it has bolts to hold the dowels instead of silly shallow plastic cups.No matter how cheap this is, you'll be saving money by buying something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"A FAMILY'S DREAM","review":"This book is a family's dream.

Maybe I'm listening to a different album or something, but this is nowhere near his best album. MADE was so much more thorough, you could easily listen through that entire CD. That's not the case with this LP. The wit and depth of the lyrics aren't up to what Bleek is capable of, and there aren't any tracks that will really stick in your head all day [i.e., \\"I Get High,\\" \\"Hustlers.\\"]. I find the beat to \\"Oh Baby\\" too annoying to listen to it twice in the same day. Bleek is at his best when he can speak clearly over a beat, and that's what you get with \\"Alright\\" and \\"Straight Path\\" - the best tracks on the CD, along with the \\"534\\" intro. Also, this effort being the first major release from the so-called \\"New Roc\\" should have been more in the ballpark of 20 tracks, even if that means that 3 of those are skits [think Cam'ron's \\"Purple Haze\\"]."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bleek!","review":"I'm not under 13 years old but i love this album!

With Walter Wanger producing, Tay Garnett directing and a sterling supporting cast, the film promises much much more than it delivers. It is tedious and predictable.The print is dreadful.

This book is impossible to read; Hobbes' style of writing is ridiculously long winded and very difficult to understand. While I understand and appreciate that this book is one of the fundamental books of modern society, I can't like it because it is so hard to read. Locke I understand, Machiavelli I understand, but Hobbes is tough. I'm no genius, but I'm no idiot either, and I don't think reading one book should consume months of my life. Unless you have to read this, do yourself a favor and avoid it. For sado-masochists only. Seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it.","review":"Christian rigidity and stodginess and \\"the letter of the law must be obeyed\\" at its finest. An excellent exposition on the logical consequences of deeply distrusting human beings.To be more specific: Hobbes' key assumption, that humans in a state of nature are uncontrolled brutes, is not only contradicted by all sorts of anthropological evidence; it's a projection that we Westerners like to place over aboriginal peoples in order to justify colonizing them.Read Camus' THE PLAGUE instead, where Tarrou refers to a Hobbesian bureaucrat as \\"Public Enemy Number One.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"difficult read","review":"I find the book very challenging to read and comprehend.

To make matters worse, the entire work appears to fall under the logical fallacy of contraposition, that is he bases all of his arguments on the held axioms of religion therefore who cares what he then extrapolated as the foundation of the argument was false."},{"rating":"2","title":"Modernity forseen","review":"Hobbes presents his version of science, politics, and modern state. It is interesting to read along Carole Pateman's \\"God Hath Ordained to Man a Helper\\": Hobbes, Patriarchy and Conjugal Rights [Feminist interpretations and Political Theory] in order to 'see' the \\"conjuring trick\\" in which the paternal right renders unquestionable masculine right. I also recommend to read trying to locate the status (or existence) of women both in the pact to transfer authority to Leviatan and in the State of Nature. Much of the \\"trick\\" prevails nowadays in many laws."},{"rating":"1","title":"Retains antique spelling","review":"Leviathan is, of course, a classic so I won't waste words on its merits. The issue is this edition. This version retains the original spelling. If you are Ok with this then it would probably be OK for you. If not, not. I'd prefer a more scholarly edition with an introduction decent footnotes as, I suspect, would the average reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good work, but a poor copy.","review":"While I enjoyed the text itself very much, I cannot recommend this particular copy of it. I read parts of it for a class, and wanted to read more on my own, but I simply could not make it through 736 small pages of miniscule print without getting frustrated (as well as getting a headache). Further, the margins are practically nonexistent, making it a poor copy to buy for anyone who likes to take notes in the book. Additionally, the binding is quite weak.I would encourage any interested parties to continue pursuing the 'Leviathan,' as it is a very rich text indeed, but I would recommend finding a different copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE CORRECT SPELLING","review":"THIS BOOK MEANS ALOT AND I'D LIKE TO READ THE CLASSIC FOR NOTHING.. BUT THIS COPY HAS MORE GRAMMATICAL ERRORS ISN'T FROM A KINDERGARTNER.COME ON.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great and difficult read","review":"Someone gave this great book and seminal work in political philosophy 2 stars just because it is \\"difficult to read\\". In fact, it is quite difficult to read. Partly because the Leviathan was written almost 400 years ago and partly because well, it is Hobbes. However, just because a book is hard to read does not mean that the content is bad or worthless. I would suggest the opposite, if our very simple thinking and poor intellectual abilities do not allow us to crack it open at the first attempt we should keep trying. That effort is what keep us moving forward.Great book, needless to say. Take your time and enjoy. If it gets difficult just leave it on the table, think about it and read it later. This book is not your quick weekend read. It is a book with complex arguments and structure. Sit, read and ponder. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic","review":"While not written yesterday, this classical treatise on politics and society is still as relevant today as it has always been. Required reading on Political Science degree courses the World over, it is almost unthinkable that any serious (or even casual) student of the field would deprive themselves of its insights. Not always the easiest of reads, it, never the less, rewards the reader more than adequately with its insights and observations."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS CLASSIC IN THIS EDITION!!!!","review":"This is not a review of the work itself.One comment only: surprisingly enough, the editor of this volume, the 'world renowned' Richard Tuck DOES NOT PROVIDE NOTES, please pay attention: the book was originally published in 1651 (or something) but nevertheless the so called Hobbes scholar does not provide scholarly notes... and this is supposed to be a 'student's edition'... ha haShame on you, Mr. Tuck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my cup of tea","review":"I have serious issues getting past the misspellings and the psychotic notions of Hobbes (or the translator's doing as far as spelling is concern).

The binding is so bad that it hardly unfolds. This book can only be used as a text for students."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is thin","review":"It seems a little dishonest to me for Norton not to reveal on the cover of this book that it is an abridged version. In fact, the only way to know that is to read the footnote in the Table of Contents, or the preface.It happens that, in my view, the Leviathan can use the abridging, and it is very possibly that you think so too. But readers should be told that before they buy. So I am telling you.I'm a bit disappointed with the secondary materials, too, but not quite disappointed enough to grouse about it too much. Still, it seems like the editors could have made up for all those lost pages in the main text to get more ambitious in the secondary materials.I still give it four stars because I like the abridged version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazon confuses differing editions","review":"Hobbes's Leviathan is of course a major and essential work of modern Western political philosophy. But it comes in many different editions, which have different strengths and weaknesses (and which omit or include the full text and other relevant works).It is not at all helpful that Amazon lumps the reviews of these different editions together. From this amalgam, you cannot determine which is the best edition for you. I agree with Greg Taylor that the best unabridged paperback editions are published by Cambridge U Press and Hackett. For me, Norton Critical editions contains a good abridged text with excellent supplementary readings. For rich scholars, Oxford U Press has just published the definitive critical edition, edited by Noel Malcolm. There are many other editions -- examine them carefully.

I purchased the \\"natural\\" unfinished wood easel SO that I could OIL IT myself. Oiling the unfinished wood (with pure Tung or Linseed oil) will preserve and protect the wood beautifully from moisture loss/gain (seriously reducing the chance of warping/cracking) while bringing out the woodgrain with light golden or amber hued richness.

Though long, there is less to it than first meets the eye. This is history-lite and as such would probably have found limited favour with Dr Johnson himself. Ms Picard has used some interesting material from medical sources of the day but her reliance on The Gentleman's Magazine as a source shows in the notes at the end of the book. There is little attempt to relate all this detail to the actual events of the times, so the reader is left with a far from balanced picture of what mid-eighteenth century London was really like."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the great Jazz groups of all time!","review":"These guys played together and separately so well, anything they did in the later years was especially interesting. Sometimes it sounds like they are totally ignoring the other members' presence, but it all gells together in a way that only great Jazz artists could do. It is as if they are all supreme artists at the top of their game and they come together and create great art that is an interwoven tapestry of beauty."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Progression Forward in Places, Meandering in Others","review":"At least one track here moves forward into even more adventurous and individualistic territory (even more than \\"Sorcerer\\"). The title track abandons jazz and blues forms in favor of inimitable Tony Williams-fueled crescendos.And most of the rest of the tracks here are pretty good in and of themselves. But the band seems to have reached a peak with each other by this point, and most of the playing here doesn't reach the peaks of the two previous albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"the forgotten country of melody","review":"the missing link. the nature of jazz evolution: deeper, more exploratory, without abandoning the melodic conduit to a listener's imagination. nefertiti will make you question just how linear time really is."},{"rating":"2","title":"COULD WELL BE HIS BEST.CERTAINLY HIS MOST MYSTICAL","review":"This is the first jazz album i bought/together with song for my father from horace silver.definitely not the easiest way to start.definitely not the right place to start if you want to get into miles davis. i fell in love with this album and that's basically how i got into jazz.it's really a great album.

These are great compositions and the alternate takes add so much to the interest of the listener. The comparisons are endless. One note to a potential buyer: Listen to the second alternate take of hand Jive, a take that is mesmerizing and much better than the final cut. Miles has a glaring note mistake at the end and a rhythm error following that which causes him to say \\"Damn!\\" in his raspy voice. If not for his mistake, the world would have heard that great take instead of what they got instead. Another note: One has to listen in awe of Tony Williams on this album. He truly was a master of the drums and shows the whole creative arsenal, especially in Pinnochio and hand jive (alt take 2). Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"a nuther great one","review":"'Nefertiti' is one of the most beautiful melodies ever written (at least in jazz history), and the performance here is amazing - and it has a heavy groove, too.

If you don't have the box set be sure to pick this one up- but you might like to pick up the box instead to hear the whole story."},{"rating":"2","title":"In a Silent Way, it Kind of Blue my mind...","review":"Nefertiti is to Miles Davis as Atom Heart Mother is to Pink Floyd. If you don't dig the Floyd, let me tell you that it is one of their best, yet under-rated albums. On this album, Miles combines all of the things that make him such an unbelievable artist. I think this is an album for anyone, only because of it's very relaxed sound. It's something that you could just throw in the stereo at a party and people would wind up asking you what the music was. Miles Davis is proven to be an addictive artist, I don't know anyone that has purchased one album and never bought another. The reason is that he constantly changes yet he always stays the same. Oxymoron, yes, but an accurate one at that. Hopefully everyone who reads this will by a Miles Davis album, and explore a realm of Jazz that most people didn't know existed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great. Period.","review":"I love this album.I love this quintet.This is an outstanding album. The music is great on so many different levels. Every time I hear this cd I feel differently, it affects me in so many different ways.I really wish I could have seen these guys do their thing live.Great compositions throughout. Inspired playing by all. If you like Tony Williams you will love this album. The alternate takes are quite good as well, some arguably better than the masters (Hand Jive and Madness???)Anyway, if you are trying to decide whether or not to buy this album, you definately should. It really is one of Miles' best.Add to Shopping Cart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Compilation","review":"It's a good compilation of songs I already own (some have different arrangements so it's a plus).

This had some of his most classic songs such as \\"Only the Good Die Young\\" which sound even better on this album than when it was recorded in the studio. It has the personal concert touch so that when you turn it up it sounds the emotions of Goodnight Saigon are better felt. A must have for any Billy Joel fan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great live album but not the best of all-time!","review":"Joel's talent came along way as a major singer, songwriter when he went on tour in the soviet union russia. Kohuept the album showcases his fine performances. Joel sings his greatest hits songs like \\"Honesty\\", \\"Allentown\\", \\"An Innocent Man\\", \\"Uptown Girl\\" and also \\"Big Shot\\". But this CD has it's moments not so much to demonstrate Billy Joel's live concert musical masterpiece work included instead of it right here!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lifeless","review":"It's easy to understand why Billy Joel would want to release a live album at this point in his career. He had just toured the Soviet Union, and his only live album so far had been Songs In The Attic (which highlighed Joel's pre-Stranger days). Plus Billy had developed a reputation as a dazzling live performer over the years. However, the resulting product is a lifeless, synthesized performance that sucks all of the passion and character from the individual songs. The only track work hearing is a terrific cover of Bob Dylan's \\"The Times They Are A-Changin'\\". The rest constitutes for the least essential recording of Billy Joel's career."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joel Fan!!","review":"This CD is great!!..

Many unimaginative writers fall in the trap of using rape as a plot device because they can't imagine anything more dramatic happening in a girl's life. In this case, it's a false rape. I can't think of anything less creative nor less realistic. It's ironic that the cover depicts a healthy, strong, & athletic girl when the book depicts girls as needy, weak, & selfish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely terrible!","review":"This is one of the most poorly written books I have ever read. The language is simply awful! Meaningless similes, a barrage of pointless details, downright lame analogies, and a web of subplots that are never fully (or even partially) developed. One of the first rules of writing is to create a believable character, and I had a hard time believing that Jennifer would do anything but sulk and get in slapping matches with her equally 2-dimensional sister. She seemed incapable of having any emotion deeper than \\"feeling like a rhino.\\" The ending is completely unsupported by the rest of the book, and just comes off as nowhere else to go. I thought the premise was fantastic--a fresh approach to the subject of rape in a generation where one word from a disgruntled kid is enough to wreck someone's life forever, but as a previous reviewer said, it runs out of steam before it even has a chance to take off."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"The concept of this book was interesting, and the beginning of it had potential, but towards the middle and definitely the end were disappointing.

The story is very funny, sad, yet touching. And of course, you're dying to know what's in the potato barn. That revelation is one of the nicest surprises that a book has ever given me and is what really left me with a lasting impression. It's surprising that Vonnegut could write something so heartfelt compared to his other books, but I guess that just shows what a great author he is. For all the fun he pokes at modern society, Vonnegut actually provides some hope for a change in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really awesome","review":"This was my first Vonnegut book ever and it was....geez it was good. I finished the book in almost a day (i would have finished it straight but i had to go to class and eat dinner and such). It's not like something that's so gripping you can't put it down, it's more like it's just something that's so GOOD you don't want to stop.

Yet, oddly enough, I fall into neither category. In general, I count myself as a fan but not one so fanatically devoted as to find no fault in anything the man ever wrote. Aside from the luminous \\"Slughterhouse-5\\" I consider \\"Bluebeard\\" to be his most fully sustained work. There is a weird kind of alchemy in these pages that make the total far greater than the sum of its parts.

Joan Jett did it waaay better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good cover.","review":"While Britney's cover of the Rolling Stones' Can't Get No Satisfaction came off pretty good with her reinterpretation, this song is SPECIFICALLY Rock 'n' Roll. The title sets the parameters in how this song must be performed. The song is about Rock 'n'Roll and therefore should sound like...well...Rock 'n'Roll! Unfortunately, Britney's version misses the mark miserably.Furthermore, I do not think Spears could not have performed this song as Rock 'n' Roll without it sounding cheesy. Perhaps she could have, but I think it would have took a monumental effort because she is pop. As it is, this is a pop song about Rock 'n' Roll but if you - the singer - love Rock 'n' Roll you - the singer - should be singing it. This is not to say that Britney does not love Rock 'n' Roll. It's just that she does not convincingly pay homage to the genre with this cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes a fool out of herself....","review":"Yes, this is the same Britney Spears that recently made a fool of herself at the MTV awards show where she did not dance well, she dubbed the singing when she was not really singing, and actually stopped performing before the number was over.

I have to say I am very unimpressed with these actors, Ribisi, Diesel and Affleck - Affleck especially trying to reprise the role of Alec Baldwin from Glengarry Glenn Ross, frankly he would be scarier reading his lines in a dress. Wall Street is a far superior film - while it is given \\"homage\\", it basically says a lot that the best scene is when the actors are repeating Michael Douglas's lines while watching the movie on TV."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought it would be.","review":"I was really disappointed in this movie.

For the price, you can't really go wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"White Collar Goodfellas","review":"First off, let me start by saying that this movie has one of the worst endings I have seen in a really long time, nothing is resolved. Giovanni Ribisi has a ton of talent but it is wasted on this convoluted script which has no direction and takes the viewer nowhere. Ben Affleck is great as the company's pitchman but his appearances are few and far between, as are Vin Diesel's. Nia Long's part is completely wasted and has no bearing on the plot whatsoever. The relationship between Ribisi and his father is ridiculous. So basically the only thing that makes this movie good is watching these sharks in action. The movie contains some great one-liners and the action on the floor is key. But overall, the narration is taken right from Goodfellas 101 as is the camera work on some of the more violent scenes. I mean seriously any movie whose key quote was penned by the Notorious BIG is trying really hard not to be taken seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"A Sale is Made on EVERY Call You Make!\\"","review":"Giovanni Ribisi is Seth Davis, a 19-year-old who's secretly running a backdoor casino while his parents think he's in college. Desperate for a quick buck, he joins JT Marlin, a brokerage firm that has the look, feel, and energy of a Morgan Stanley or Smith Barney. But underneath the gloss, this is a firm that engages in shady dealings, selling fake stocks and ripping off investors cold. Seth learns the ropes of the trade and over time becomes ruthless and cocky. He alienates his no-nonsense dad, who happens to be a judge and is, to say the least, disappointed that his son is blowing off college.On the surface, this sounds like a re-telling of \\"Wall Street,\\" but don't dismiss this film so easily. \\"Boiler Room\\" soars on the strength of performances of Nicky Katt, Scott Caan (son of James), Nia Long, and the then-unknown Vin Diesel. The film moves at a brisk pace and, for the most part, avoids melodrama and other formulaic touches. Definitely worth a look."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling!","review":"If you have seen Wall Street and Glengarry Glenn Ross (which are both referred to in this movie) then most likely you have already bought the film. But if you haven't, you need to see them all. Boiler Room's story grabs you and doesn't let go, and the acting is done very well. But what gets me is that this is the first movie for the director. Unbelievable! A young man is hired by a firm that promises that he will be paid 1 million dollars within 4 months, but how can the firm afford paying everyone that much? And how does he get out of it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wall Street Lite - 3 1/2 Stars","review":"Right off - this is one of Giovanni Ribisi's best performances. It's compelling but we never really feel the heat of the Boiler Room. The Danger. The Action. Ben Affleck is extremely good but brief in this - one of his forgotten performances. Everything else about the movie has been said here. More sex, scandal and intrigue would've elevated this way above. EXTRAS: The \\"original ending\\" is actually a lot more artful and smarter than the one we get in the final cut. Overall, worth comparing to Wall Street? No. Worth watching? Yes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Boiler Plate","review":"A great look into how some small brokerages mold their brokers. Not all of course are shady as portrayed in this movie. Fans of movies about Wallstreet should enjoy it. Great cast like Giovanni Ribisi and includes good support from Vin Diesel and many others. This and \\"Wallstreet\\" are two of the best you will see about the area of New York that creates or ruins fortunes everyday.When a young man is not satisfied with college he strikes out on his own by running a gambling casino in his apartment. He is eventually approached by a man running a small stock brokerage and he decides he will go legit to please his dad, a judge. At first all seems well but then he begins to find out the brokerage firm is not as legit as he first thought."},{"rating":"1","title":"wall street for dummies","review":"As a trader myself this movie is an insult to the finance industry if its objective was to portray it.This movie borrows its concepts from the false impression that trading is all about extremely ruthless hungry young college drop outs who are going to be \\"millionaires in 3 years exactly after the day they start\\" yeah right....Furthurmore, it is full of unidimensional characters who are portrayed as greedy, ruthless and violent.This dvd maybe mildly amusing to those whose knowledge of the industry is minimal...but please, making those silly references to Wall St by means of taking off lines from Gordon Gekko is cheesy and outdated....The whole idea of how the brokers make money in this movie is a joke...it involves cold calling small investors and selling them shares that arent listed yet....(would anyone actually fall for that? paleez)whats more? hows this for dialogue..\\"sell 20 shares\\" (customer)\\"your done\\" (broker)hello, dosent the customer want to know the price???"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Gift Finace Grads","review":"I bought this as a gift for a friend starting out in the financial sector.

That being said, most of what goes on in this film, is basically an entertaining story line that has a little bit of drama and mystery. I love the Ben Affleck pep talk scenes. I love the \\"Recko\\" scene (classic comedy). I love the Wall Street scene. Maybe this film is what lead up to some of the anticipation for \\"Money Never Sleeps\\"...who knows?

While the industry has been portrayed correctly, at least to some degree and New Jersey is full with such Boiler rooms, the language is sickening. Every other word is profanity, especially Ben Affleck's role is limited by a sparse vocabulary. In short, the script is mediocre at best, and there's plenty of foul language, and don't expect a high-profile lifestyle or exotic cars in this flick as there are only a few scenes where you can see a Ferrari. It's a boring and depressing movie and I don't recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hidden Gem","review":"At first glance, this morally complex film seems to be merely uninteresting, but by looking at the cast alone, it warrants a second glance. Ben Affleck, Vin Diesel and other familiar faces appear in this film.Somewhere between the lines of right and wrong lies reality.

This movie is so good in so many ways but so bad in so many others. I think the recent stock market mania is a topic that should be depicted in a movie but maybe Stone's \\"Wall Street\\" and Mamet's \\"Glengarry Glen Ross\\" have made any future movies about greed derivative and trite.

Each and every piece is a classic, amazing that IVY haven't received more airplay over here (Ireland)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sublime Pop","review":"Apartment Life is their best CD, covering lovely pop tunes like 'Ive got a Feeling,' 'This is the Day' [From There's Something About Mary,' Move to the City etc. In addition to floaty calming tracks like 'Back in our Town' and 'Baker.' This is the ideal CD for a summer's morning, utterly superb! Get it now. One of my favorite CD's ever. If you want a change from heavy metal etc [I know I sometimes do] you won't go far wrong with this. The lead singer's also got a silky French voice - can't be bad now can it? Classic Pop."},{"rating":"2","title":"EVERYONE IS IN AWE","review":"I have followed Ivy for years and love turning people on to this group! I play it in my place of business and everyone is in awe of it; they are mesmerized!! But what is really amazing is that it keeps getting deeper and richer each time we play the album!! The classy Euro-voice of Dominique Durand is magnetic and the music is magical! BRAVO!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds like a hundred other bands out there","review":"I had heard an early Ivy song called \\"Wish it all away\\" on a local college radio station, and found it to be a pretty, minimalist tune. The singer had a lovely voice and the song really was bare-boned and charming. Sadly, this record is over produced and their simplistic sound is lost. With the exception of the lovely voice, there is nothing special about this record. They really had potential."},{"rating":"1","title":"These reviews have me puzzled...","review":"I was a big fand of Schlesinger/Fountains of Wayne, so when this CD first came out (on Atlantic Records, at the time) I was really eager to hear this CD.

Not recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just read some lyrics before you buy it ..............","review":"Their sound is good, but the lyrics alternate between very vacuous and very dark. And unfortunately Dominique's voice makes the dark ones sound vacuous. For a taste of vacuous lyrics, from \\"You Don't Know Anything\\" comes this, \\"I know you're barely human but I can get something better\\". Or if you want to descend to the inane, try \\"Ba Ba Ba\\".I've heard some good songs from them, but not on this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a let down","review":"the title of this film really caught my eye. i was thinking of two styles of kung-fu (dragon vs vampire) going head to head in a mythic battle. i was instead treated to NO kung-fu.....did i say NO kung-fu. the fighting that was there was weak and under-choreographed and the acting and plot were horrible(which is usually ok if the fighting is good).the film is really about one bad guy who wants this guys Shaolin secret magic, so the magic-guy promises to teach a theif (the main character) his secret. but this ends up being a dead-end beacause the bad guy kills the magic master....oh and there is a vampire lurking around for no reason as well....i dont want to give it all away so go ahead and buy it and see this disappointing film for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just could not get it to work at all","review":"I wanted to replace my old and rather flaky foot pump and as my rear drivers side tire had developed an annoyingly slow slow leak I went looking for a more powerful foot pump. The Slime looked like the business and was one of the few twin cylinder pumps available in the US. I read the previous review about the connector, I use foot pumps a lot and I was sure I could get it to work.Sadly I was wrong, I had to pump up a flat last week and despite trying many many times, attaching , unattaching and re-attaching the connector I just could not get any air to go into the tire.Also the connector fits so tightly it is extremely difficult to get on and off, this makes me worry about damaging the tire valve. I hate to give such a bad review to any product and I was very hopefiul about the product and perhaps I just had a bad sample but I would not reccomend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad connector for a car tire","review":"As the other two posters have mentioned, the connector is really badly designed. Basically the stem is too short so that you have to fight to get the connector onto the valve. For some reason you also have to fight to get the wretched thing off. Having managed to connect it, then you need to apply your full weight (in my case 155 pounds) to inflate the tire - which happens at a snail's pace. All in all I'm not impressed. I've used foot pumps for over 15 years and I've never had so much trouble- even from the cheap $6 pumps. True they only last a year, but I'd expect something much better for a $30 pump."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"Bought this for my Kindergarten classroom and was sorely disappointed.

They look nice, have big screens, and several lenses with which to magnify, but the light source is awful. I had to turn all the lights in the room off and close the blinds in the windows just to see a shadowy image on the screen. Yes, it does magnify and do the job as a microscope, but it would be nice to see the image on the screen more clearly. I also purchased the ac adapters to power the microscope, but now wish I had saved my money and not purchased any of it. My students were so excited to use the microscopes, but we were all disappointed with the quality of the images on the screen. This may be great to play with at home, but as a classroom tool, it was terrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid results for Krylon Fusion paints","review":"This is a great product. Anyone who thinks this isn't doing its job hasn't spent their time prepping.I've been testing primer/aerosol paint combinations in preparation for fixes to some motorcycle ABS. This promoter is the clear winner. Every test that's been run over fairing ABS plastic has illustrated that the Fusion colors go on smoother and cleaner using this as a primer than directly over sanded and prepped plastic (which Fusion is chemically designed to do) or over standard flexible primers. Now that I'm seeing these results I'm considering painting my whole fairing and tank using this and Fusion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing adhesion promoter!","review":"This adhesion promoter is extremely effective.

All in all, the flipside is the kind of quality these actually have. Still, Memorex does absolutely make it very easy to format which kinds can be used for what devices. The 3 Pack of DVD-RW discs work only with the home DVD recorders and can be played back on the computers. It really does showcase a great deal to record on. These are very good to record with and very simple to save. I just can't think of any other brand of DVD media to buy than this.

Turns out he is part of the New Jersey lifestyle as typified by HOUSEWIVES OF NEW JERSEY which is why he is called a Guido. Boones and Booth must enter this unique subculture so as to solve the crime. The subculture is downright hilarious.Back on the slab, the corpse is one of their very worst. Turns out that bodies filled with steroids cause maggots to go nuts and to literally start flipping into the air all \\"juiced up\\". Within two days, the corpse is reduced to a skeleton. This is incredibly gross but this kind of \\"gross out\\" is one of the reasons viewers watch this show.As for the romance, Booth is busy with his new girlfriend and I frankly hope he stays that way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pregancy and \\"luv\\" take over a good police drama","review":"I have enjoyed Bones from the git-go, for its sometimes-gritty subject matter, interesting police procedural depictions, and the byplay between the main characters.

I'm outta here!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Give Upl Husband Gave Up the Week Before","review":"After seeing the first episode of this season, my husband said he was giving up on the show. He absolutely loved the first four seasons but he couldn't take any more of this touchy feely unrequited love stuff for another season, like he did with season five. I gave it till to the second episode to improve but it got worse. What was once a very funny show with Bones and Booth has become as funny as the proverbial heart attack. Even the serious aspects to this CSI but anthropology drama show are now taking a back seat to their love lives. Angela and Hodgkins are so sappy about being in love and expecting that every moment they are onscreen verges on embarrassing. Bones and Booth are now dealing with his new girlfriend but it is plain to see that they are both still in the throes of unrequited love. Again. There is barely any screen time to handle the case by the time we endlessly view this tripe. This show has jumped the shark."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD skips","review":"The DVD was listed as \\"like new\\" but the DVD skips and it came in a strange case. The first disc in the case skipped terribly. The first episode played with a few skips, but the second and third episodes were not worth trying to watch. It skipped every 10 seconds. As for the case, it wasn't the orgiinal - it is made of cheaper material, the front cover was taped on, and it holds 8 DVDs, not 6. None of the DVDs fit neatly into the case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Addicted To Bones!!","review":"I love all seasons of Bones, but Season 6 is really great because it is when Bones and Booth actually get together which if you are a fan, you have been waiting for!!

As I think this show is worth watching more than once. I am currently re-watching the seasons 1 - 6 as we wait for season 7.I would like to see Zack come back since he really didn't kill anyone.

Compare this with the Pink Floyd Dark Side of the Moon or Herbie Hancock Head Hunters albums on SACD, both of which have separated tracks (eg; instruments, vocals on the former) which play across 5.1 channels which is a surreal, wonderful, SURROUND sound audio experience - as if different band members were sitting in different spots around you on a stage.

The author obviously went in with the pinion that women were being mistreated in the Islamic world, a perception she \\"supports\\" with various unrelated examples. The book is obviously biased toward the author's western viewpoint of the status of women, and she applies her cultural standards to other cultures--something no self-respecting anthropologist (or journalist, in her case) should do.I will say one thing in the book's defense, and it is that through it all, she tries to remind readers that what goes on is some countries is in direct opposition to the example set by the prophet Muhammad. She makes an effort to separate what Islam requires/suggests regarding women, and what certain countries and people do to women in the name of Islam, and for that I thank her. Beyond that, I think this book is the story of an author who went out looking for information to support a theory she had already formed.

Combined with the book, The Book Seller of Kabul, it exposes Islam, and it's prophet (I hesitate to give him that title) as a mind destroying theology, whose sole purpose is to crush human nature. Both books show the intolerance of Islam and the fractured thinking it produces. The author tells of one educated woman who speaks of kindness and peace one moment and hatred for the Jews in the next, without missing a beat. This line of thinking has its origins in the koran and the hadiths. One can read it in the directives given to mohammad to a group of his warriors who wished to have sex with a few captive women (the men were married), mohammad ok'd the assualt as long as they practiced coitus interruptus. Thus one can do wrong as long as you didn't intend to do a greater wrong!!!

The stories are vividly told, and always interesting, and she has a nice ey for detail. Refreshingly, the author is unwilling to let the abuses slide with a some platitude about multi-culturalism.There are some annoyances. She tries too hard at times to argue that \\"real\\" Islam would not be like this, and her discussions of Islamic history are unskeptical. She takes a couple cheap shots at some westernm politicians she doesn't like.

Ms. Brooks combines research, anecdote, and experience to explain the complicated story. It was fascinating to read actual parts of the Koran which held that women were to be treated fairly and kindly; in fact the Koran deemed that women were to be allowed to run businesses, own land etc. To see how that has been thwarted in much of the world was just heart-wrenching. But Ms. Brooks goes way beyond the \\"to veil or not to veil\\" question; she gives a dramatic glimpse into health care, athletics, marriage, and war from a woman's perspective.

All of her views are based on hatred against islam. The author entirely ignores the fact how pre-islamic societies treated women. In Arab girls used to be burried upon their birth, because they were believed to bring shame to the family. Christians and Jews were not much better in treating women and still exploit women. Islam gave women the respect and encourged them to be educated and be prominent parts of the society. There have been numerous women leaders in Islamic society. The western people are the hypocrite, they believe they have given freedom to women, but they are abused by men."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another misguided view of Arab and Muslim women, BAD BOOK","review":"I do not recomend this book to any one, its too biast and narow minded and lacking the fundamental truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disregard this book","review":"I believe that some of the information is accurate, however, I suggest reading about women in Islam from a Muslim woman.

What the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) was teaching was to break ties with burying daughters alive, fornication, adultry and other degrading actions for both males and females.

Brooks does not even go into the REST of Islam, she doesn't provide the hadiths (sayings of the Prophet Muhammad (SAWS), who in Islam is our up-most example of the perfect Muslim), or the ENTIRE CONTEXT of the Qur'anic verses; she simply quotes [out of context] the parts that help her cause (bashing Islam and the way women are treated). If you want a real book that explains how women are treated in Islam pick up a translation of the Noble Qur'an, or The Complete Idiot's Guide to Islam (no, I'm not joking, it's a real book).

Ten years ago, during my own tumultuous \\"return,\\" I'd have sneered at her willingness to entertain thoughts of mixed seating, uncovered hair and egalitarian prayer.It's only now, I think, that I'm ready to hear the honest questions Ner-David and others like her are asking and to understand that the Judaism we share is resilient enough to answer to -- and thrive from -- challenge and diversity.Ner-David's narrative, interwoven with threads dealing with her own physical frailty, tells a story not of a senseless rebellion against Orthodoxy but of a young woman's awakening to a deeper, more genuine love of her tradition.I wish Ms Ner-David a Yasher Kocheich -- may she never stop asking."},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC!","review":"I could not put this book down, a rare feat for a mother of a 2-year old.

It had a slight taste of oregano, but certainly no more than your cooking after you put a dash of the spice into your food.

Joel himself dislikes it. It is indeed a transitional album. The two later ones (Storm Front and River of Dreams) are much more assured. The production IS a bit limp in true mid-80s style. Songs that should soar just kind of lay there(This is the Time, Modern Woman). Even a good rocker like 'A Matter of Trust' is hindered by then-trendy production. Still, there's no denying the sheer musicality of these compositions. Even at his worst, Billy Joel always has his craftsmanship to fall back on. It carries the day here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the Later Years","review":"I'm not sure why this album has been put down so much. This is easily his best post Glass Houses album. Really, the only week tune on the album is Temptation. His previous three albums had more or less been homages to the Beatles (Glass Houses and the Nylon Curtain) or Doo Wop (An Innocent Man). On the Bridge, he finally starts to develop his own style again, which is honed and well-crafted. As is typical, Joel front loads his album with hits, but outside of the hits there are a couple of gems that you won't want to miss. Running On Ice, Big Man On Mulberry Street, and Getting Close are all great tunes, the latter of which features outstanding hammond organ work by Steve Winwood. Naturally, The Bridge doesn't really rank up there with Joel's 70's work, but if you like albums like An Innocent Man and River of Dreams, you should definitely have this album as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best, but worthwhile","review":"I used to blast \\"Running on Ice\\" on my car stereo since I felt that it was a song about trying to fight and getting nowhere which was where I thought I was at the time.

I enjoy listening to Billy Joel every so often and this CD reminds me why I used to listen to him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated album","review":"This is an exceptional Billy Joel album that has not gotten its due. \\"A Matter of Trust\\" just rocks and is one of my favorite songs, \\"Baby Grand\\" with Ray Charles is a mellow classic, and \\"Code of Silence\\" balances harsh accusatory lyrics with a great beat. \\"Big Man on Mulberry Street\\" is the only track that didn't impress me. In fact, it's one of my least favorite of his songs. However, it is an overall very strong album that's worth the $$$."},{"rating":"2","title":"An ass-kicking album!","review":"Following the success of GREATEST HITS VOL.1 & VOL. 2 in 1985,the following year saw Billy's next all-original album THE BRIDGE. A MATTER OF TRUST kicks ass big-time! The music video shows Billy and his band performing the song for a crowd surrounding the building in which the performance is taking place. Inside the same building several floors below is a cranky,crabby woman repeatedly yelling \\"SHUT UP!\\" THIS IS THE TIME tells about memories to look back on in the future. MODERN WOMAN is from the movie \\"Ruthless People\\" released in 1986 as was this album. BABY GRAND is a duet between Billy and Ray Charles. Guest artists on this album include Cyndi Lauper on CODE OF SILENCE and Steve Winwood playing his Hammond organ on GETTING CLOSER. A MATTER OF TRUST,BABY GRAND and BIG MAN ON MULBERRY STREET are recycled for 1987's KOHUEPT,a live album recorded in Russia when Billy promotes THE BRIDGE.

Certainly there are more great tunes on those albums than \\"The Bridge\\"; only \\"Baby Grand\\", his duet with Ray Charles, deserves recognition as one of Joel's finest. However, I love his lush, romantic melodies on many of his songs, most notably the title track \\"The Bridge\\". And unlike his previous albums, which were devoted to one musical style, here Joel ranges from rock and roll to blues and jazz. While this is not by no means an essential Billy Joel recording, it is certainly still worth owning."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRID!","review":"Call me crazy, but this one really sucked! I have listen to my dad's record version, and only Running On Ice, Matter Of Trust, and This Is The Time are good. This is his worst!

I was sorely disappointed. When I tried to dice onions, the blades seemed incapable of cutting through soft foods, such as onions. When I tried to cut potatoes into fries, the amount of force necessary to get the potato through made me afraid I would slip and cut my hand on the inadequate guards. Additionally, hard foods such as potatoes or carrots inevitably had the tail end break off rather then being sliced. Finally, the blades cut to inconsistent thickness resulting in non-uniform thickness slices and waffle cuts that didn't waffle evenly. Construction seemed adequate and I did not have any problem getting the blades in and out, but the overall performance was poor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I used one of the cheaper plastic mandolines for years and while it worked well, I thought this more expensive one would be superior.

Time for a few quick glimpses of the depot, the train itself, some passengers, and a few scenic views; then on to the next country. Excellent video and audio quality, including many overhead helicopter shots. Starts in Ecuador, then to Brazil and south, including Macchu Picchu. Ends with the \\"Patagonia Express,\\" a steam train publicized by Paul Theroux; typically, the DVD shows this train arriving at its destination at night missing all the scenery in the area. Really a \\"sampler\\" of the subjects covered, providing only tantalizing glimpses of several potentially fascinating rail trips."},{"rating":"2","title":"travel the world by train: South America","review":"It was received within a week of placing my order.

It deals with surviving as a nubile female in a large office in a very large city (New York or Los Angeles). And in the 1960ies or even '50ies. Like the original, saucy sex features heavily in the title and the promise, but little in the book. Instead there are mostly anecdotes and some very jumbled advice. One example is to ignore it if your employer forces a kiss on your mouth after the job interview because he's just a weirdo who will do this to anyone. It's all a bit musty and unenlightened and unwitty. A typical follow-up, in a bad way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go Cowboys!","review":"I guess we all have our own taste when it comes to books - and Elmer Kelton is at the top of my list!

I eventually got around to buying it -- and could not put the thing down. When I finished it, it didn't take long before I started it again; and ordered another book on POWs in Germany. Since then I've read about every book on this subject I can get my hands on; Brickhill did /that/ good of a job.Admittedly, the men lack some characterization, but the story is so vibrant that can be passed over. (TryA Gallant Company: The True Story of the Man of \\"The Great Escape\\"for characters). Brickhill relays some of the other escapes that were pulled in the camp -- several unsuccessful and a couple \\"home runs\\". The story flows with the feel almost of fiction, it's so well-paced. You'll be drawn in by the story; it is at times funny, others tragic, but you won't let go. It's too Great."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Great Escape: By: Jack Miller","review":"Hello, my name is Jack Miller, and in reading The Great Escape, I really began to understand how terrible the war really was. I could not imagine being held hostage, let alone having the courage to escape. The escape the men in The Great Escape took great courage, strength, and strategy. They all worked together, selflessly, knowing that their lives were on the line. I enjoyed reading The Great Escape very much, because of way Paul Brickhill explained and described the tension and the situations going on. Although the book's ending was not a very happy one, it would have been very hard to make it have that much of a twist. I liked the ending and i don't think it could have been done any other way.The Great Escape is a very inspiring book, it is a story of hope and courage, and it showed me that if you work hard at something, you can accomplish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"When I was in school, a teacher assigned us this book.I was fascinated.

Prisoners from any background other than capitalistic democracies such as the UK and the USA would not have had the will, the initiative, the creativity and the sheer gall to achieve what these men did (and it compares in no way to a bunch of fanatic brutes who simply hijack some planes and crash them). (And, we certainly don't see any of those Al-Queda thugs escaping from the US Army's prison compound in Cuba!)The conception, the planning, the attention to detail, the manufacture of materials (including coercion of foolish German louts who fell into blackmail traps) and the execution make this one of the most riveting stories, war or otherwise, ever told. Everyone should read this incredible, true, adventurous, suspenseful tale of an elegant plot and the genuine men who carried it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the film","review":"If that's possible! The movie of the Great Escape is one of my favorite all-time movies. So I was excited to read the book, and it did not disappoint.

Money is the only guide to actors, screenwriters and producers to decided where to lend their services.Take, for example, the bad guy in this obnoxious movie, played by Jonathan Schaech. Judging by his very convincing performance in Tom Hanks's directed THAT THING YOU DO, you could never tell he would be in such a throwaway movie like this.See, I like road movies.

Suprisingly well done the movie is about a guy who picks up a hitchiker who happens to be bounty hunter looking for vampires known as The Forsaken. Along the wya they encounter them so the whole movie is filled with their attempts to get away from them. The acting is actually good and the plot is exciting and it keeps you on the edge of your seat. Lots of gore, blood, feasting on humans, human hearts, and a schocking scene of a head of a vamp being blown off. Jonathan Scheach is perfectly evil as the head of The Forsaken . The only problem is that the vamps used guns to kill and I would have rathered they killed like regular vampires with their fangs, and too many chase scenes, but overall a disgusting, excting ride that all fans of horror will love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forsake this Film!","review":"What a load of rot!

They try and hook the 18-35 male audience in the first 2 minutes by showing a (typical) naked blond in the shower, and the cliches only get worse from there. The dialogue is atrocious, the cinematography lacklustre, the premise full of holes and the suspense never builds. The director/screenwriter are obviously trying to demonstrate just how sexy and primal these bloodsuckers are, but have no real understanding of the fact that vamping for the camera in skimpy outfits and pouting have nothing to do with what makes vampires (yes, it's true), alluring and dangrously appealing.

Ok, the way vampires came to exist was pretty inventive, I'll give 'em that much. And who doesn't love Brendan Fehr? Beyond that, in my view there wasn't much to enjoy. See, I'm the type who roots for the vamps. I loved 'em in The Lost Boys, Near Dark, Blade, Fright Night, Modern Vampires, etc. I love 'em in Buffy (but who doesn't love Angelus, Dru, or Spike).

But I am always open minded to all sorts of films, so I thought I would give this one a whirl. It started out with some potential, but within the first 20 minutes I knew it was going to be hopeless. I should have just turned the darned thing off. It was so unrealistic (ok, I know it's a vampire movie, so what did I expect) but I just didn't believe that the main character (Kerr) would have done the things he ended up doing thru out the movie. And then the girl (Izabella Miko) who had about 8 lines in the movie; that was just lame and pointless. She must have felt like such a loser telling people, yeah, I'm in this movie \\"The Forsaken\\", and I'm in it almost the entire time...but....ahhh....well just call me zombie girl.

It sounds like it's supposed to be a Billy Joel album rather than giving any new definitions to what a Joel album can be. Nevertheless, fans will find it a good play with some songs that get better the more you hear them; but it is a little too produced, sometimes forced, to really be enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sinking In The River","review":"River Of Dreams is the last studio album Billy Joel has released and by the sound of it, maybe that's not such a bad thing. Mr. Joel has always made highly listenable, superb pop-rock records, but on River Of Dreams, he tries to go down the Paul Simon, world beat route. The title track is plainly just a horrible song and the worst thing he has ever done. \\"Lullabye\\" is a nice idea, a song for his daughter, but it comes across as contrived. The album is saved a one-star rating by the excellent \\"Blonde Over Blue\\" and the pulsating \\"All About Soul\\", but other than those two thealbum fails to live up to his previous works."},{"rating":"2","title":"His Best","review":"I can't believe someone said this is too pop-ish!

Though his performing ability was strong, his songwriting became little more than rewriting old 60's tunes. This decay had been building through AN INNOCENT MAN, THE BRIDGE, STORM FRONT, and now THE RIVER OF DREAMS.Only 5 songs are worthwhile to listen to, \\"No Man's Land\\", \\"River of Dreams\\", \\"All About Soul\\", \\"2000 Years\\", and \\"Lullabye\\".

Get the wuss out and get back to rocking.I would expect some light-weights like Nsync or 98 Degrees to do this stuff. THIS IS NOT A DISS TO THOSE BANDS OR ANY YOUTH POP BANDS, I like those two bands and this song would fit better coming from them - althought I cannot stand this song anyway. I don't go in much for poetry and if I cannot understand what the heck the singer is singin' about the song better have some good vibes and beats to offset it.Such is not the case here! I am especially annoyed by \\"searching for something so deep that it can only be seen by the eyes of the blind\\" GIVE ME A BREAK. Like I said to one of my co-workers.

One of the absolute worst, pieces of trash and, oddly, not with one once of soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Famous Last Words is the Best","review":"I really think that the title song should be \\"Famous Last Words\\" and not \\"River of Dreams\\". \\"River of Dreams\\" might be more of an overview of all the songs, but \\"Famous Last Words\\" is a better song about Billy wrapping it all up and should have been title song so it would get more exposure. It is an absolutely great song about wanting to go back to the old days and not being able to. This song MUST be repeatedly listened to for full understanding and enjoyment. At a time when I was convinced \\"It's All About Soul\\" was the best song on this CD, but repeated listenings of this song changed my mind, yours too, perhaps."},{"rating":"2","title":"He never gets old","review":"[...] That still doesn't mean that he can't produce something really cool. I really don't see much, if any, slacking off of his powers in this album. \\"Goodnight my Angel\\" is so touching--no matter that the idea isn't exactly new. \\"All about Soul\\" is almost as good as \\"Just the Way You Are\\", and it's really powerful music that gets into your nervous system and just lifts you up. \\"Shades of Gray\\" is in my opinion the best song in the album. It really brings home the idea that a total lack of doubt in what you believe is evidence of cowardice, and maybe even (ironically) of a lack of real faith. In fact, most of these songs are pretty good stuff (though I don't care for \\"Blonde over Blue\\" and \\"Minor Variation)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rekindling The Flame","review":"Billy's last studio album to date is also one of his finest. After the mediocrity of The Bridge, Kohu'ept, and Storm Front, this effort proved that Billy was still capable of recording first-rate pop music. The album moves gracefully in all musical directions, veering from Cream-inspired hard rock (\\"No Man's Land\\",\\"Shades Of Grey\\") to white-man's blues (\\"A Minor Variation\\") to casual pop (\\"Famous Last Words\\"), not to mention the title track (which sounds much better within the context of the album than on AOR radio). But the two standout tracks are \\"The Great Wall Of China\\" and \\"Two Thousand Years\\", songs that rank with any of Billy's 70s classics. He has even rekindled his lyrical genius, an element missing from his mid-to-late 80s work. It may sound radically different from The Stranger, but it is as tuneful and insightful an album as Billy has ever put out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing figures","review":"I am very disappointed that all the figures/illustrations are missing. If the publisher wishes to sell an ebook, then the ebook should contain all that is in the printed book. If for some technical or other reasons that it is not able to do so, then this should be stated in the original book review. Otherwise it is plainly deceptive selling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are the illustrations","review":"Am re-reading this book on the Kindle (having lost my paper-back).Beautifully written book, but have to score it a 2 because all of the illustrations are missing. In addition, it seems to have been scanned, converted to text and then not entirely successfully proof-read. Surely there must be the original text-file somewhere.The occasional typo, no problem, but the lack of figures?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book on Cryptography I Have Read","review":"I recommend this book if you are interested in cryptography. I recommended even more strongly if you are not very interested in cryptography. Why? Because it is the first book I have read to make the subject really open to someone not eager to work at the subject. The author's explanations of the development of cryptography over the centuries was strong, and his technical explanations of subjects like the German WWII Enigma machine, the decipherment of Linear B, and public key cryptography are absolutely outstanding. Everything that the author tried to explain, he did explain, in terms that almost anyone can understand. In fact, he made the difficulty and the work involved in good cryptography apparent, while at the same time making it relatively easy to understand the technology and thinking behind some of the great achievements in that field."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simon does it again!","review":"As with other books by Simon, a wonderfully written and informative narrative on the subject chosen.( cf Fermat's Last Theorem, another good example).My only complaint is that I was half-way through cracking the ten problems set , when I discovered that a team of 100's from Sweden had already claimed the prize money !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"And easily read, informative history.","review":"Singh has put together a wonderful history of cryptography in this book. It includes examples and stories of the earliest, most primitive cryptography, to a discussion on what the future holds (e.g., the effect of quantam computers on code-making and -breaking).Most importantly, however, Singh has made this book very easy to read. Singh is a very effective teacher, breaking down the complicated aspects of cryptography into step by step processes, requiring a very limited background in mathematics to be understandable.Anyone curious about cryptography or espionage, or any other subject of that sort should make this book their starting point, from which they will develop a very good background for cryptography and cryptanalysis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"This is an incredible book that speaks on all major subjects concerting cryptography. Buy it today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasant read, though a bit dated","review":"I bought this book because I'm interested in cryptology but do not have the time to dig deep into specialist books. The book did not dissapoint me - it is well written, not too technical but doesn't 'dumb down' the essence of cryptology too much. The only reason why I wouldn't want to give it 5 stars is that it is a bit dated. Written quite obviously before 9/11, it is a bit too optimistic on the outcome of the battle between code makers and code breakers.A good book, fun to read, and relatively easy to grasp."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Science Writing","review":"Mr. Singh has written a masterpiece of science non-fiction. His writing is terrific - clear, non-technical, entertaining. No doubt some of the ideas he discusses in the book are weighty, like the workings of the Enigma machine and asymetric encryption. But Mr. Singh explains them in a way that anyone can understand and enjoy. He uses nice analogies where appropriate, but doesn't dumb down the science or the math. Even if you have little or no interest in cryptology (but you will!), you will enjoy this book as a great example of fine science writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book on history of encryption","review":"My take-aways from this book:* simple language* effectively explains even the most complex of technologies* enjoyable read and never bored"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable and informative!","review":"This book is a good primer for anyone interested in an introduction to the history, personalities and methods in cryptography. I'm not very adept at math but that didn't hamper me in reading this book. Simon Singh, as he did with his book on Fermat, takes us 'innumerates' into mind when writing his books and gives clear and concise explanations that don't get lost in jargon or presume his readers are math heads.A fun and informative book on an important and facinating subject!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific History of Cryptography!","review":"I found The Code Book an extremely interesting and informative read. I think Singh did a phenomenal job at bringing together the numerous length of history and presenting it to the common reader in a easy, readable fashion. I am impressed once again at Singhs' ability to create such a organized and clear work like he accomplished in Fermats' Enigma. I knew nothing of cryptography before reading The Code Book, but now I know not only the history, but many techniques of encoding and decrypting as well. The figures behind the process were equally fascinating and I found out about many people that I previously knew nothing about. I found the explanations behind Mary Queen of Scots, the Enigma, the Navajo code, Bletchly Park, RSA, and quantum cryptography to be both intriguing and educational. I would highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy the Kindle Version","review":"HelloI had some time ago borrowed and read the book, and it was witty and informative. Read the other reviews about the content of the book.However, now I bought the Kindle Version, and found out that none of the various figures that are crucial to explain certain ciphers have made it into the Kindle Version.Another example: When Singh explains that he has 'hidden' a text by marking some letters on this very page with a little inconspicuous dot below, it defeats the purpose if the Kindle doesn't display those dots.Seriously, get the book, but the real book, not the Kindle Version.Cheers"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read.","review":"This is a well written book from an author with great knowledge on the topic. Don't be put off by all the talk about 'Where is the American side of the story' because in all honesty it's nice to read a book which is not so pro American for a change!

The only way to truly understand anything is c the history of it's introduction"},{"rating":"2","title":"I didn't know what I didn't know","review":"Very interesting reading. I expected a book that would end with a basic lesson modern in cryptography, and instead got a wonderful history of all forms of secrecy and information hiding. The best part is that it was fun too! This book will interest amateur linguists, computer programmers, mathematicials, historians, and policitians. There's just so much perspective and insight here. The book gets a little slow at times, but if you make it all the way to the end you'll find your self equipped to talk about a whole range of topics you never knew existed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellently Written Book","review":"Kudos to Singh-he wrote an excellent, relatively short book on what could be an incredibly confusing topic. There isn't too much math here, which can make the topic more difficult to understand. I'll admit, the last chapter is confusing (hey, it's on quantum theory, give the guy a break), but the writing style is superior to anything else that I've read on the subject (far better written, shorter, and more modern than David Kahn's 1100 page monolith). Definitely read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read","review":"Singh does a great job of keeping the reader involved in a storyline as well as presenting some fairly intense logic and math theories. If you're looking to get your head around the ideas of crypto, this book rocks."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Illustrations on Kindle","review":"This is about the Kindle version.I read the book as paperback a while ago, but I lost it when I moved around during the last few years. It's a great book and I would give it five stars, but the Kindle version is missing all illustrations. If I could give zero stars, I would - it really ruins it. Should the publisher put in the effort to include the illustrations in the Kindle version this would be a five star review for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"out of a rating system of 10,","review":"I would give this book an 8.5 . This book is very interesting, taking you through the history of code making and breaking in an unparrellelled manner. Even though the author has some strange ideas about some things, I think this book is one of the best I have seen for an introduction to cryptography."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"A very well written book on a fascinating subject. I've read a lot of books on cryptography, particularly the historical aspects of the subject. This is by far the best one.All the others either skim over the details of how each cypher works, or ignore it all together. Not Singh! Wonderful details very well explained. Whether you have a good math background or not, you'll find it interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a disappointing book; one would have hoped for more","review":"The cover of the book is obviously designed to resemble \\"The Bible Code,\\" and I suspect that people who like it are impressionable folk like the ones who bought \\"The Bible Code.\\" Much more could have been done in a book about such an important and interesting topic. Perhaps in the U.K there is much interest in Mary, Queen of Scots. I would have liked to see deeper explanations of the theory of coding. The material on quantum cryptology was especially weak, I thought. Perhaps someone else will write something on this fascinating topic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do You Want To Play 'The B...eale Game'... Ask ME How?","review":"For the most part... it was a very interesting book. It's biggest FAILURE was not having a better understanding of 'WHAT' the mystery is really about... 'WHO' created the mystery and 'Why' it was created... 'Where' the mystery will ultimately take you to. Mr. Singh and others like him have no idea that the one 'allegedly' deciphered message STILL HAS parts that have as yet not been divulged to any one other than myself. IF he were truly serious about an accurate understanding of the B...eale mystery... he should have spoken to me first."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun book on cryptography","review":"This is a great book and was a lot of fun to read. I highly recommend it to someone interested in the history of cryptography. The book serves to spark further interest in the subject and brings this often mathematically inaccessible subject out with all the human drama which surrounds it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A series of true stories with a common theme","review":"This is a great read, more of a series of short interesting stories about codemakers and codebreakers. It goes into some technical detail of methods used in cryptoanalysis for the more technically minded, extremely well researched with all the historical facts. One of the few books I read a second time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely fascinating read","review":"I work in the network security field, and this book has renewed my interest in what I do. Simon Singh has written a great narrative on the history of cryptography, and it was able to captivate my interest from start to end. I feel like I have a better understanding and appreciation for the security mechanisms we use day to day. I imagine this would also be a very good read for anyone doing a security certification (Security+, CCNA Security, CISSP) because it transforms a bunch of charts on a set of notes into a story that better explains the evolution of security."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-read for anyone interested in cryptography","review":"I heard great things about this book before I bought it, and I wasn't disappointed.The book is extremely readable, interesting and informational. I have re-read it a secondtime just to pickup all the information presented.if you are a novice cryptoanalyst, I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A brief history of secrets...","review":"An excellent introduction to the world of cryptography. It shows not only the methods cryptography but also the reasons why they were so important. Singh brings out the hidden history of cryptographers and the politics that have surrounded them. The first chapter with Mary, Queen of Scots demonstrates the power of cryptography to save or take lives. The book demonstrates the power of secrets and how cyphers have kept secrets beyond the lifetime of the cryptographers.The book is an easy to read history of cryptography from monoalphabetic cyphers to modern cyphers like PGP. It's an written in a style that accessible to people with little to background in cryptography. _The Code Book_ is an excellent tribute to the men and women who have contributed to the art of cryptography over the centuries, and the genius it has taken to make and break their cyphers."},{"rating":"2","title":"terrific book","review":"The book is absolutely brilliantly written. It has lots of real-life stories starting with a story of the Mary Queen of Scots who was beheaded for using too a weak cipher. Between those stories author explains actual ciphers starting from Julius Caesar's and methods to crack them in the terms understandable by a pedestrian. I tried to explain the simplest ones to my 7-year old and he's got them. Meantime, the appendix J contains concise and clear enough description of the strongest existing RSA algorithm, clear enough to reproduce it. Highly recommend for those interested in history, history of science, math, spy stories, history of computers - this book combines it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"you will like it","review":"Simon Singh does a very clever thing. He takes comlex topics and makes them understandable without dumming down the science or math."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating, you won't put it down till you finish it","review":"I read the book from cover to cover in one sitting and then eagerly dashed to the website to learn more about the cipher challenge that author Singh poses to those of us who think, gee this seems easy, I could take a crack at it. From Egyptian hieroglyphics to Elizabethan intrigue to modern-day Internet encryption, the book eloquently covers the ways in which humans have used codes and ciphers to conquer and cover up their activities. While I was vaguely aware of the Rosetta Stone and the role of Navajo codetalkers during the War, the book made me realize how complex the field is and how slow the progress has been over centuries to refine and evolve these secretive methods of communication. Singh's style is never stuffy or dry. I will be sure to read Fermat's Last Theorem."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST crypto book so far","review":"I tried reading Cryptonomicon. Hated it.

Many of the songs are sung in the first person and it gives them a certain intimacy. \\"Streetlife Serenader\\" starts the album on a soft note and \\"Los Angeleanos\\" wryly mocks the denizens of L.A. \\"The Great Suburban Showdown\\" is a humorous tale of man heading back to his hometown to spend time with his parents and \\"Root Beer Rag\\" is an instrumental where Mr. Joel shows off his piano chops. \\"Roberta\\" is a good song about a lady of the night while album's hit single \\"The Entertainer\\" is a sarcastic look at show business. \\"The Last Of The Big Time Spenders\\" and \\"Weekend Song\\" are good songs while \\"Souvenir\\" is a poignant look at how life can pass you by and all you have left are the memories. \\"The Mexican Connection\\" is another instrumental that closes out the album.

Lead singer, theremin player and organist Roman has a maniacal presence on stage, and his anxious vocals are faithfully represented here on Welcome Aboard... Burn In Hell is a blisteringly intense psychedelic tune, with soaring guitar solo. Copycat \\"borrows\\" Hendrix's Foxy Lady riff, which helps turn it into a damn funky tune. Song driven by Roman's organ, Rocket Science have a unique sound happening.

The author did nothing to develop the characters and portrayed them as shallow, petty, stupid, jealous people who were, for the most part, unlikeable.The story line was imbued with inaccuracies where both computer technology and the travel industry were concerned, and these inaccuracies highlight the authors obvious lack of research. I almost begged for Diane and Jeff to simply \\"get on with it\\" as the supposed romantic portion of this lame storyline dragged on and on.

I got it with the expectation of being able to more easily maintain optimum pressure in my vehicle tires by filling them at home rather than relying on using the gas station air pump. It takes about one minute per PSI to add air to my tires with this compressor. I have never attempted to inflate from total flat but I don't think that would be a likely scenario since if a tire was totally flat it would need a change. I have used this to add air when my tires are at 27 or 28 PSI to bring them up to spec'd 32 PSI. It takes one full minute to add one PSI of pressure to a tire. Versus about 5 seconds using a large compressor at a filling station.After adding 3 PSI each to all 4 tires (about 15 total minutes) this thing was so hot I could not even pick it up. I don't think it will survive prolonged use.I will not be using this for routine maintenance any more.

There Goes A Tractor should be viewed first. It shows how crops on a farm are planted. There Goes A Farm Truck goes into what happens to crops and trees when the fruit, vegetables, and grains need to be harvested and what happens to the produce after it leaves the farm. It shows how cows are milked and the inside of a ice cream plant. Most of this is well explained and easy for kids to understand (my child is 2 1/2 and loves these videos). Of course, the narrator Dave does act goofy sometimes, which can be annoying since these videos could stand alone without all the play acting. However with this Dave its easier to watch, maybe because he's younger than the original Dave (Hood)."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderfully informative","review":"This summer we are studing Farms amongst other things.

The acting is lame & second-rate. I seen better acting from the robot in Rocky 4. The Villain is laughable and dresses like a Chuck Norris reject. The Sub-plots are just filler. The Sal Bandini guy is weird but still better actor then the rest of the cast. The epilogue is unreal & dumb.

Light weight makes it easy to hold for my scrawny forearms, but the spatula is sturdy enough to flatten too-thick hamburgers and hold chicken breasts without bending to the forces.

However, the end of the utensil sears just like every other teflon type utensil. And, this is without any abuse, such as leaving the end of it in a pan. Each time that I wash it, I end up taking my fingernail along the edge to scrape off the frayed material.I would have rated this higher because of the handy shape.

I didn't even leave it leaning against a hot pan, or use it with \\"extra-high heat,\\" as far as I can tell. I was simply using it to flip salmon fillets in a hot skillet, and the mere act of making contact with the skillet for a few split seconds to scoop the spatula under the fillets caused the front edge of the spatula to melt.

The biggest mistake Billy makes here is hiring Mick Jones of Foreigner to produce the album. His vast, atmospheric production hinders most of Billy's gifts as both a performer and songwriter (wit, irony, SUBTLETY!) and transforms him into a Eddie Money, Bryan Adams wannabe. Even Billy's most insigtful material (\\"The Downeaster 'Alexa') is dragged down by the production. But even a first-rate producer couldn't help the second side of the album, his worst songs since Cold Spring Harbor. Thankfully, he recorved in four years with River Of Dreams."},{"rating":"1","title":"Billy continues to fall apart creatively","review":"Billy Joel, though he was losing his songwriting ability, had somewhat rebounded from THE BRIDGE with a better album, STORM FRONT. It is a history lesson and largely reflects on the cold war and the struggles of the baby boom generation. \\"We Didn't Start the Fire\\" is the obvious single. \\"I Go to extremes\\" lacks the guitar depth of \\"You may be right\\". It is pointless to go into specifics. Summed up, the album can not hold its own in comparision to GLASS HOUSES or THE STRANGER,. It is probably on a par with PIANO MAN.

From the technical aspects-cinematography, editing, sound, ect.-to the writing and overall acting, it makes you want to pop the first film in the DVD player and watch it yet again.One of the criteria for judging a movie such as this is how easily and naturally it causes the tears to flow. With part 1, I was in tears with no difficulty at all. The drama was so real and spontaneous. But with the second film you get the feeling they are trying to grab your eyeballs to squeeze every little tear out of them. This makes for very strained proceedings indeed.Everything considered, Wilford Brimley and Doug McKeon DO manage to rise slightly above the material and keep this film from getting a one-star rating but I still think you're better off sticking with the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"Part 2 seemed to be an attempt to capitalize on the success of the original and, like so many sequels, fell far short of the mark. The integrity of the filmmaker is called into question with an inappropriate romance between Billy's sister and his childhood nemesis in addition to the repeated loss of his dog (only one of the new pair died this time).

This will be donated to the library.I also noticed that it got the Dove Family entertainment award (said so at the beginning of the movie), but I wasn't too thrilled about the inappropriate kissing between the sister and the friend. In a kids' movie? Really? Totally unnecessary. And I'd like to know what the sister's romance has to do with the story about the dogs?

Slow songs I just couldn't stomach, they sounded like cheesy boy band ballads. If you are a trance fan or electronic music fan stay away, but give it a shot and listen to some samples if you are into pop.

A mistake! It starts out well, but by track 5 it's starting to go downhill, and from track 7 on it's just something unexplainable. I buy BT albums for their beat and this album doesn't have one. Well, the first few songs do, but even then the music is so stop-and-start that I can't imagine playing it at a party for people to dance to. Also, I think BT had a secret dream to be an 80's rocker and this album is the result. Don't believe me? Listen to \\"Circles\\".(As a follow up, I don't regret buying this disc, mostly because of \\"Knowledge of Self\\", an unbelievably great song.

BT branches out in this venture... with tracks like Simply Being Loved demonstrating his talent at Dance to tracks like Dark Heart Dawning, a soulful and personal track he demonstrates his versatility and overwhelming talent. His roots as a classical musician shine through adding a new dimension that weaves and dances through the music as surely as you will want to dance to this latest opus from BT.

So he's not making trance anymore, not true to his genre. That's all ok, but this cd is just hard to listen to. Is there originality to this work? Oh yes, it is unlike anything I have ever heard. The man can't sing, thats fine. Are the concepts and the overall sound of the songs he's writing soothing to the ear? Hardly. I miss the old BT, it's alright, he's gone. Does it matter to me if this review is helpful? No. Is it informative? Yes. Some people might dig this cd but I don't. Five years later and I still don't like it. Don't buy this cd unless your hair looks like his and you should be fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bt has done it again","review":"Just when you think this man has reached the peak, he goes on to climb even higher. This has to be up there with ESCM and of course my favorite, Movement in Still Life. He should be put in a category all his own. BT delivers a flawless CD full of phat beats and an awesome get down vibe. Forever a fan, keep on rockin'...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entirely Excellent","review":"Since discovering BT, I have rarely been disappointed and Emotional Technology is an instant hit. Upbeat and fast paced and then slower and more poignant, this CD won't disappoint. Highly recommened because you can listen from start to finish and enjoy every selection. Won't disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"more of the best BT","review":"At first skim I was a little disappointed at the increase of new age/electronica and decrease of hiphop and industrial flavor to this album (as compared to Movement). But after a real listen to it, I got hooked. So hooked that it's been in my CD player for days. This album is every bit as good as Movement, yet it is distinct. The style is the same but the songs are distiguishable and varied. If you were looking for more of the BT from Movement, this one is a MUST."},{"rating":"1","title":"Respect the Artist but Disappointed","review":"I have bought several of BT's creations and this one is lacking heart. The one pop song is kinda catchy but still a pop song. I like Force of Gravity. I bought the cd too quickly without looking into the other songs. There is 1 or 2 more I could listen to but there are now a few that make me cringe. This is not BT. I enjoyed the BT CD, Movement that has a vitality and groove that is not reflected in this CD. I hope he finds his muse again. BT is extremely talented. He seems unhappy in this CD and this quiet sadness bleeds through the music."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Overproduced Mess","review":"As a huge fan of \\"Movement in Still Life\\" I was eagerly awaiting this album. I think BT is a excellent songwriter/creator/musician.However, this album seems like a collection of overproduced outtakes. Take the second track, \\"Knowledge of Self\\" with Gang Starr's Guru. BT's layers on every electronic effect imaginable; fizzles, bubbles, cuts, etc. Instead of releying on BT sence of harmony and beat, the song throws too much at the listener; the song is a chore to listen to. By the third song I'm exhausted.Songs like Circles are downright embarrassing. It's BT's take on Power Ballads, and Alice-In Chains style rock. I lloved \\"Movement\\"s jump in genres, but please BT stay away from cheesy ones. I'm still trying to forget butt-rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smashing expectations...","review":"To tell you the truth I had some reservations on how this album was going to preform. Hearing that the cd had some more of a vocal and slight pop sound put me off untill I acually gave it a runthrough. BT of course a genius at what he does practically reinventing himself with each album release steps into a mold that can only be filled by his shoes. BT's ET is a varied cd with emphisis on well...emotional technology. It sways back and forth beween rock and trance ( I hate subgenres) but keeps it closely tied together with a production style, element if you will, that nobody can quite match. Basically the BT fans should love it unless they can't get over the slight popish tenensies. In the end, give it a try at least, because this man has this music down, and nobody can touch him. 5 stars to smashing negative vibes."},{"rating":"2","title":"bt is phenomenal, once again.","review":"You got to handed to bt, he knows his stuff. One of the most talented artist, I have heard. ET, takes a different route, then his earlier more underground albums. Et sounds more pop and commercial. Still, this album rocks and bt fans will love it. Bt sings alot more in this album. I personally enjoyed hearing him sing. My only complaint is the cover photo. I would of chosen to make the polaroid of bt, represent the cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"BT is all grown up!","review":"BT is growing up and it shows in every single song in this production. He continues to merge sounds to create beautiful listening experiences and this CD is a great example of his background. Kudos to BT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BT gone Pop??","review":"OK,Over the years BT has produced some pretty good tracks, all with his own style and signature sound. Here we have an album with a different sound that I like to describe as \\"everything pop music has tried on their own, with BT doing 10 times better!\\"This album, on a production level, is extremely clean. It definitely shows how BT is on another level in terms of production quality and mixing. I can understand if some of his normal fans might not like this album. It is rather 'pop' like and has vocals on pretty much every track. But, it still has the good characteristics of BT's music. Great drum fills, excellent manipulations of tempo and overall mood, and the collaborations of many talented and successful artists that were integrated into most of the tracks. As a whole, I'd say that where this might not be my favorite BT production album, it absolutely shows his professional expertise and musical talent more so than ever.~D_L_O"},{"rating":"2","title":"BT = GOOD RAVE","review":"i went to a huge rave called nocturnal wonderland in 2003 and saw a 3 hour live BT set, i was amazed, he is truely a world class DJ he had 20,000 people dancing to the same beat and it sounded so good. He did an incredible remix for Somnambulist and it was all live. BUY THIS CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great F*cking album","review":"I've been listening to BT for 3 years now. I think this is his best album. This album has great beats and good lyric. BT gets better and better by the album"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not your father's BT","review":"As a big fan of BT's early work (I think I am one of the few people that think Ima is his best), I must say Emotional Technology comes up short. Too much effort is made to create hit songs instead of great music. The songs are pretty good, but overproduced- especially with the vocals. The album would be better if all the vocal tracks were cut. Note: I'm not saying that cutting all the vocal tracks would be best.I guess BT has got to pay the bills though- those Kyma setups are pretty expensive. More power to him."},{"rating":"2","title":"I give it 6-1/2 stars!","review":"I have a decent CD collection (about 500), and this recording is my NUMBER ONE favorite, hands down.What most people don't understand is that BT is a classically trained musician--he's not necessarily tied down to \\"electronic\\" or any other one specific genre. So if you are looking for straight-up techno or trance or whatever then this isn't going to neatly fit a category. If that will annoy you, then don't buy it. This is plain GREAT MUSIC regardless of what slot you want to put it in.If you wait one more day without buying it, it's one more day of happiness you're missing out on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Great","review":"I bought a this album hoping it would be a masterpiece just like Brian's previous albums and the result was not dissapointing at all! Just like ESCM, his second album, \\"Emotional Technology\\" presents a collection of breaky smooth progressive house, which leads you into a great trip. His track Sommnabullist is an increibly gentle house building emotional work... BT shows he still sticks to his previous style, but this time, he takes it to the next level."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Man Does It Again","review":"BT has always been on the cutting edge, recreating himself with every release, and he has done it again. This release is a bit more lyrical than before with songs like \\"Dark Heart Dawning\\" and \\"Circles\\" that have somewhat of a ballad feel. If you're looking to rock out and jam then BT still has the high energy with the breaks of \\"Superfabulous\\" and \\"Last Moment of Clarity\\" which happens to be my favorite. There is nothing better than a female vocal and some awesome beats! Each and every track on this album has its own feel and really gives you a sense of what BT is all about, I can only hope he keeps doing his thing and we all get the wonder of being along for the ride."},{"rating":"1","title":"BT - Where ya goin?","review":"I am, and continue to be, a big BT fan. I appreciate his dedication to detail and his desire to do things a little different. That being said, I think that ET let me down. It is too big a deviation from where I think he was going with MISL.Instead of the usual avant-garde approach to digital music making, I found a lot of these tracks to be controlled and too \\"popcorn-esque.\\" I almost get the feeling that this album is more of a resume for BT's production capabilities. If that is the case, then so be it. But I feel like some of the art might be compromised.Of course everyone should BUY this album and support this musician. I especially look forward to some of the upcoming remixes, especially of \\"Force of Gravity\\" and \\"Paris.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"how the mighty have fallen","review":"short review hereive been a fan of bt since i was a teenager and the first album he made Ima - it was such a revelation and an absolute pleasure to listen toESCM came with a further dance and electronica force that i loved, but sadly after that, BT seemed to lose his wayemotional technology is the epitomy of a once talented breaks, progressive house musician losing his way in order to try to appeal to the mainstream to sell more recordswhat a dissapointmentBT mate - you need to go back to stuff like Ima - please"},{"rating":"1","title":"An experiment that doesn't work","review":"I bought this album when it came out and didn't like it after the first fews listens. Now I've come back to it after a few months and I still can't like it. BT eschews electronica in favor of a more rock/pop sound and the results are less than impressive. The sounds of this album may be new for BT, but they are not new for music in general. Nothing here stands out. Not one song has a catchy hook (a killer when it comes to pop music). The best track on here is Circles. Somnambulist is not for the hetero crowd and Communicate is by far the worst Jan Johnston song (and I've heard them all except for a couple of remixes).As great as ESCM and Movement were, I do want to see BT evolve, but I would like him to avoid writing BORING songs. And that's really the problem with this album - there is nothing remotely interesting on it.Unless you are a die-hard BT fan, avoid this one like the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this crap?","review":"I loved Movement in Still Life, and I have enjoyed many of BT's other works. He is a very talented artist - but this CD is crap.Everything blends together - it sounds like he put all of his other work in a blender and spewed this horrible piece from it."},{"rating":"2","title":"seriously people","review":"yes this is a great album..but as for the people saying its all about love and whatnot..

An attempt to draw in Hip Hop and Rap audiences, a big departure like Oakenfold did with Bunkka, both leaving the dance genre (and fans) behind. Like Bunkka, A miserable failure. Mine will be online cheap!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Backstreet Boys rubbed off on BT.... Sad really.","review":"This album, at best, loosely resembles electronic music. If you are a fan of IMA and ESCM, as I am, You will not enjoy this album at all. While the production on the album is incredible, the music sounds like it's 2 years old, and NOTHING like the classic BT sound.Reinventing yourself is one thing. Selling out your audience that got you fame and noteriaty so you can be the next pop poster boy is quite another.Very dissapointing espically seeing how long i have been waiting for this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing!","review":"I have been a fan of BTs for years and have all his CDs. I bought this album when it was first released in 2003. After much anticipation I was greatly disappointed with what I heard. His previous works I love and can play again and again but this abortion of pop rock is just not the BT that I and other fans were expecting. I will now not blindly purchase one of BTs works until I have fully listened to it incase of further disappointment.If you want to listen to Drum and Base with a mixture if techno/trance done just right I recommend Pendulums \\"Hold Your Colour\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome...I love you BT!","review":"Just wanted to say that after getting my album it hasn't left my cd player in my car.

Can't wait for the next one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"This cd flows so well from the opening tracks that are poppin to the the more somber songs like Animals, and change is only constant. I was suprise on how quickly the tracks stuck in my head..needless to say the album is always in my cd player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well......nice effects.","review":"Very disappointing......after his previous album I expected more growth in the writing department....he got hung up on the production side of the biz and forgot that you have to have a good song before you start producing it...anyway...every song on this record is mediocre....Mr. BT's singing is flat out boring...he should stick to producing boy bands who already have their songs written and can sing..At least you won't get stuck with a song in which you HAVE to look for a hook instead of it jumping at you and not letting you forget it....i've listened to the record numerous times TRYING to like it...but i have to tell you i cannot remember a single melody off it...The production is good and his signature machine-gun stutters are present on every song...there should be more to songs than his \\"amazing\\" stutter effects which get predictable and bore you to death....To sum it up ...this record SUCKETH."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album is \\"Simply Being Loved\\"!","review":"I have been waiting a long time for this album to finally be released and trust me, the wait and the hype have all been worth it! BT's feel for sound & texture is an amazing gift which he uses to full effect on this album, especially on tracks like 'Somnambulist', 'Superfabulous' and 'Last Moment of Clarity' - featuring his new Jedi Apprentice Bill Hamel.Rock, 80s, House, Breakbeat, it's all there showing Transeau to be infinitely beyond the 'run of the mill' Dance artist, Buy it! Buy it Now!!!!Emotional Technology is appropriately named."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Soundscapes","review":"BT has hit us again with an amzing release. As always before, his newest release leaves you stunned, and thirsty for his next piece of work. Always vesitile, BT has proven that he can be as unpredicable as he is good, showing the true mark of an artist. Some DJ/producers simply stick to the same methods, the same beats and overtones throughout their work. At times, these artists even manage to put out a good remix. However, it takes someone like BT to create a new work of music, layered in ways we have not heard before, with a touch of stutter beats to really be a jewel. \\"Emotional Technology\\" is a landmark in BT's career, and sets new standards for the genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOOOOOOOO What a huge mistake ET was!","review":"OMG ....how the hech can I even give it one star?Wtf is this pop stuff,and wheres all the good dance music we're used to hearing from him.Whats up with all the experimentation ? ...Dont waste your time and money on this CRAP!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre!","review":"I was all excited to see what new stuff BT had come up with,and I must say I was not very impressed.Why the hell did he mix rock with techno?.BIG no no in my book!.that messes alotta peoples heads up for sure.Imagine if you heard hard guitars when u were rollin,boy that would sure ruin it for ya!...\\"Movement in still life\\" was so much better,and less poppy sounding.His music is always changing and he's always trying new elements in his music ... if he'd stick with a particular style,he'd do alright.I dont recommend this one,at least he didnt sell out like Oakenfold did...\\"cry me a river\\"wtf?..now thats pop for ya"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ick","review":"This was disappointingly bad; The new haircut should have been a tip-off; \\"The Great Escape\\" was the only track I could listen to more than once. It's fine if he wants to appeal to a different audience, but if your idea of good BT is \\"Mercury and Solace,\\" then you need not go here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Emotional Technology/ Sad Creation","review":"Emotional Technology is anything but emotional. It is not a question of genre, yet musicality, and there is none to be had here. He fails to capture any sense of direction or sound here, and touting that one song had over 6000 edits, is like touting how laborious Liberache's clothings was to tailor, yet was it tasteful....hardly. This is a horrid album by any measure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubbish","review":"Absolute rubbish. Over produced and melodramtic lyrics make this one of the more disappointing CDs this year. Stick with Movement in Still Life, forget this trash.I would give it negative stars if I could."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this CD","review":"This is an amazing CD. This CD has been in my car CD player since it came out. Everytime I listen to it, I find a new part of a song that I love. Amazing detail and very innovative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always gettnig better and better","review":"It seems with BT there's no limit on what he can produce. Each and every album seems to break the threshold and comes up with something new and surreal. From the almost rock track of \\"Superfabulous\\" to darker anthems like \\"Dark Heart Dawning\\", BT shows once again that he is very verstile when it comes to writing music. Always collaborating with other great and interesting artists and people who you'd least expect, BT has the knack for suprising listeners. With lyrics that once again seem like poetry from \\"The Force of Gravity\\" BT also shows that he's a very creative, not just in music but painting a mental picture. This cd has been in my changer for over a week straight now and I don't think it will be removed anytime soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Evolution.","review":"On first listen I was not taken with ET. I was hoping that Brian would have stepped back to a more dance sound.BUT on further listens, the album is a cracker, different styles, some amazing editing and production. All said lots of great music.It'll get listened to but maybe not as much as earlier works, it was dance music that got me into BT and its dance music that I love.Buy it you won't be disappointed, maybe not what you expect and possibly geared more towards US listeners. Its definitely BT and its definitely his evolution in music. Just buy all the CD singles too when they get released (if ever here in the UK!) for all the dance remixes.BT - Still on form."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Evolution of BT Continues!","review":"When I first picked up this album I was psyched! I was in a BT groove having just bought 10 Years in the Life, an amazing 2-CD set of some of BT's finest work. I was pleasantly surprised when I listened to this CD however, because he begins to take a more emotional route in his music. They seem injected with more feeling and more human emotion. Whereas before BT would evoke emotion through his masterful composing, he sings a lot more on this album than he ever has. It gives the songs more feeling and depth...kind of like a continuation in the direction of Satellite. With that said, \\"The Knowledge of Self\\" has to be my favorite BT track on this album, and while I was wary at first of having so many odd guest vocalists (Rose McGowan, JC Chasez), they do a good job of adding to the sound and not overpowering it. All in all, a very good album that comes highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"BT Delivers Again!","review":"BT once again displays his true musical talent with his latest release \\"Emotional Technology\\". His latest album delivers an excellent mix of electronic style and superior vocals. This is definately a CD worth investing in for anyone who is in any way interested in general electronic music."},{"rating":"2","title":"He has done it again","review":"What more can I say but \\"he has done it again,\\"This CD is simply amazing. At this point I dont think BT can be stoped his his mixing is great and the track selection is perfect as always. Everyone shold have this in their collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"emotional therapy","review":"BT's latest creation \\"Emotional Technology\\" is some of his best work yet. Tracks live their own life and create an expierience you want to live over and over again. With collaborations with Rose Mcgowen and JC Chasez, the album is packed with interesting beats, chorus' and the life only BT knows how to bring with computer bits and sound cues, that make you ask how, this is a must have in your electronica library."},{"rating":"2","title":"well done","review":"this time round this album sounds more complete. 'superfabolous' is absoloutey amazing, elements of pop,rock and electro trash going on. Didnt get past track 6 until today, kept skipping back. Somnambulist is a great for a lead single.

BT has incredible talent & I think if you liked \\"movement in still life\\" you will like this Cd too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"New fan here to Stay!","review":"I was more than pleasantly delighted when I went through my first listen of ET on my dolby stereo system. BT's music has so much depth and complexity and uniqueness I was able to appreciate on my stereo. It was awesome! As a newcomer to his music and and after getting hooked on his new single Sonambulist(Simpy Being Loved), I have gotten immersed in the music BT is known to pioneer and innovate. His sounds are full and not flat and dull. HIs vocals resonate throughout the album with dabs of varied artists such as Rose McGowan, JC from Nsync, Jan Johnson and others. The standout tracks and my favs off this album are: Sonambulist, Great Escape, KNowledge of self & Communicate. ET was at first a lot of sound to take in, but the riffs quickly grew on me and now I'am tempted to dive into his older albums and check out Brian's history.Great album! it didn't hurt to try, moreover I'm a newly converted fan. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Letdown","review":"After being a big fan of BT since his first album Ima, this is easily his only album that has fallen completely flat on it's face. It has the feel of being thrown together to fullfill a minimum number cd contract with a record label. While his earlier works were epic and classical in composition, this is simply rehashed sound effects and clumsy pop composure with angsty annoying vocals on every single track. A far cry from his beautiful Ima, and fun Movement in a Still Life. I don't normally write reviews, but was let down enough by this album to feel compelled to warn others: try before you buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"TECHNOLOGY WITH A BUG !","review":"This CD is not the best of this genre.I was waiting for this release to come out, unfortunately, the material on this collection floats all over the musical map without ever really landing somewhere.A better alternative in this musical genre would be anything from PAUL VAN DYK or \\"Chimera\\" by DELERIUM. I'm sad to say that this CD may dissapoint many and only please but a few!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nope he's through....","review":"I would not recommend spending your money if your expecting something new.

As a whole the album flows very nicely and pretty much every song is a winner. Now, if your the kind of person with a full range sound system, you are in for an extra boost of BT goodness. The electric sound effects dramatic dynamics is very cool. This album has a great blend of BT tablism, bumpin build-ups, inspiring melodies, and fantastic vocal balads. I am a big music fan and really this album covers alot of ground in 13 tracks. Lets just say that its one of my top 10 CD's in my large collection. Highly recomended."},{"rating":"2","title":"genius","review":"Once again, Bt proves his genius with \\"Emotional Technology\\". There is a wide range of talent and styles, all with electronic music as a basis, definetely NOT pop. Fans of Bt will not be disappointed!

You not only hear, but feel the \\"Emotional Technology\\" of Bt's creative mind at work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad","review":"The CD is not what i am used to hearing from BT.

I urge people to check out this movie just to see Eric in a major role, were he deserves to be. There is a lot of drug use and violence in this movie, so if you don't want to see either I suggest you don't rent this movie. You probably won't like it.

I've only seen this one on late night tv, but I must say it is far from a quality film. It is an unbelievable farce.

However to complain that there is too much metal on the soundtrack and not enough Goth is ridiculous because thats the main point of the movie, to make a Metal Band, so if you're only wanting Goth don't rent/buy this movie.

The 100% pure oil here (you just have to trust them) is, not surprisingly, slightly oily, with a sort of oily, eucalyptus-like scent. I suggest using it sparingly, or else rinsing thoroughly if you've added it to shampoo. Because you don't need a lot, the one ounce lasts several months or more, and the per annum price is a lot more palatable."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't wait for the sequel","review":"This book was so enjoyable.

In what seems like a Kaufman-esque joke on his audience Carrey reverts back to his Ace Ventura form as a split personality, so misrepresented, so misdiagnosed that I wonder if the writers bothered to pick up a medical book in researching this. The physical comedy begins as passive state trooper Charlie transforms into an agressive ultra-ego, Hank. Don't get me wrong, this leads to a few good laughs but the movie gets bogged down about a half hour in as Charlie sets out to return a pretty young thing (Zellweger) to face trumped up hit-and-run charges made by her ex-boyfriend to get her back. Think There's Something About Mary minus it's eduring characters and you've got a farce barely worth your time on cable television."},{"rating":"1","title":"another Carrey movie","review":"Though rather charming, this is certainly not the best of Jim Carrey's movies ; however the story in it is very original and there is some action near the end, so the result is still somewhat enjoyable.

The Mask was brilliant, and so was Cable Guy for dark comedy. If it were not for Jim and Rene Zelweger, I couldn't have lasted through it. For story line, it sinks, but it is a perfect set up for Jim Carrey. Too bad he couldn't have made it work better. Rene is an excellent actress who is hugely underused in this film.

First, the film tries to be a police story with a comedy shell, when it might be better as a romantic comedy. It's already obvious that Charlie/Hank (Jim Carrey) and Irene (Renee Zellweger) are going to fall for each other. Why have a pointless chase story in the mix? But for what it's worth, it did have a few laughs. There is a scene with a dying cow that raises a few eyebrows, and I liked Charlie's three children, who grew up watching Richard Pryor and still live with their father. The ending was a little uninspired, but had a particularly funny moment that I won't spoil. Mostly, it's by-the-numbers Farrelly.

There were many parts in this movie where things could have been changed to be a little cleaner, such as his three sons. I thought the concept of the three boys growing up to be geniuses was great, but then the directors had to make them cuss every few seconds. I don't shy away from cussing (I do it myself quite a bit sometimes), but it IS possible to carry on a conversation without using every single cuss word in the English language.

But 12-year olds, in theory, were not permitted to see it because of the R rating. So where does that leave the movie?The supposed humor is bathroom, racist, stupid and repetitive. The plot is simply a long chase for reasons that are murky. The movie insults blacks, albinos, police, and Renee Zellweger. And all those who watch the movie, I might add.Jim Carrey has made some fine movies, \\"The Truman Show,\\" for example, and Zellweger has done likewise, \\"Chicago,\\" for example.

It was terrible, disgusting, and after the film, I had a headache, because I was so confused about the plot. Jim Carrey's performance in The Truman Show had impressed me, but I cannot believe how he could actually participate in this movie. His skill is far superior from this. I found it offensive, boring, and not at all funny. There is no content in this movie, except for a few lame, dirty jokes. Some of the scripting was witty, but the directing, the plot, the organisation... was completely underdeveloped. This is not a film produced by some mature, experienced director revealing his skill. It is instead produces by one who has no real experience at all.

From dunking a little girl's head in water to deficating on a man's lawn, to calling people \\"giant, walking Q-tips,\\" Hank is a rude but smart man who usually gets himself out of trouble.

Meanwhile, look at all the criminal acts that Carey participated in.The roles of the three African American sons at first is a bit comical.

I'd be totally turned off by seeing this movie and would quit seeing it halfway through.Too bad I'm more like Charlie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soooo funny.","review":"I just love this movie. Besides the fact that it's so ironic, it's got a lot of silly humor that is just classic Jim Carrey. He's a genius, and proves it in this movie. It's got some parts that shouldn't be seen by children, but all in all, it's a fun movie that holds your interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Could Have Been Better!!!!!!!!!!","review":"\\"Me, Myself, and Irene\\" actually started out funny but, somewhere from the middle towards the end it went downhill. I guess because it went from funny to ridiculous in one fail swoop. Jim Carey can be funny but, I guess he took it too far in this movie because I was highly disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Language is rotten","review":"The language was so bad, we threw our dvd in the trash! It might have been good except for the rotten language."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deserves 0 stars","review":"I watched this movie hoping it would eventually climax into something funny. I am disappointed with Jim Carrey with this one. I found myself walking out of the tv room and opting to study my Algebra work instead of watching the rest of this movie. The movie was even gross in some parts-especiallly when Jim Carrey and Renee Z \\"pair\\" up-and it ended up having no point to it but to be vulgar and obscene-not to mention his bright but horrendously obscene kids. If you buy this movie, you will only watch it once-probably, and won't be interested in it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another classic from the Farrelly geniuses....","review":"By now you've probably read reviews of this movie saying it wasn't as funny as Theres Somethng about Mary. This to me was completely untrue. From beginning to finish, this movie was filled with comic genius. Renee Zellweger really put up a great performance, but by far his three sons were the most enjoyable. Jim Carrey put on a good performace, but I will say this was not his best. The Farrelly brothers have done it again I say. But since this is a Farrelly brothers movie, all those lovable disgusting parts are in. I'm glad this comedy came out because i havn't seen an intelligent yet stupid comedy since Theres Momething about Mary"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting","review":"This movie was totally un-funny and very vulgar. How many times does one have to hear the \\"mother-f---er\\" word. We kept watching it hoping that it would get better. Never happened. We tossed it into our trash compactor where it belongs. Good riddance to bad rubbish!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money","review":"You would better spend your resources stoping cat jugglers or donating your organs to science (before you die). Synonyms for this movie are INSIPID, VAPID, JEJUNE, and BANAL. Jim Cary has outdone himself in his ability to insult and abuse common decency. The entire story line is shallow and as imature as the humor. If a list of morally offensive movies were made, this would be in the top ten."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boo!","review":"what a pile of garbage! after the excellent Dumb& Dumber (greatest movie ever) and theres something about mary its a mystery how the farrelly brothers can make something this bad. one star for one laugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"eewwwww gross!","review":"What was Jim thinking when he agreed to do this movie?? I have been a BIG fan of Jim. I loved his comedy in Ace Ventura, dumb and dumber, Liar liar, and so forth, but this movie really was terrible. It did have some funny one liners, but there were way too many gross scenes. Not for young viewers, your parents, grandparents, or any date that you might want to impress. Over all, you wouldn't miss much if you never watched this movie. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"The phrase LOSER comes to mind.","review":"What a piece of crap movie. Stupid beyond stupid, no real plot and so called comedy bits tossed in here and there that had no real attachment to the story line. I don't mind rude langauge in a movie, this movie has gone to far. Cussing for the mear sack of cussing. MF this and MF that with no real point and to why it was needed. Lame with no story ... don't waste your money. Jim Carrey seems to have lost his edge, no bad movie after another. Maybe I'm getting old or more likely Jim carrey's gag are old and worn out. Loser film, loser."},{"rating":"1","title":"so silly it's not funny","review":"you watch a Jim Carrey movie with the expectation that it's going to be silly, stupid and funny. If that's your type of humour. But I found this movie so dumb. I found it really boring and not funny at all. Infact it bordered on disgusting. There was too much swearing for my liking. And Jim Carrey's role was one of his worst I've seen. Even dumb and dumber was more funny.I was so disappointment. alot of people have asked me - what did I expect. well I expected something better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD Exrtas?","review":"Thanks to the previous reviewer I will not buy any Blu-Ray DVD's that do Not Include extras that Standard DVD's include. All the talk about being able to hold so much space on Blu-Ray and they do not include extras............what a joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laugh? I nearly did.","review":"At last I have found it. The worst movie of all time! Jim Carrey ably demonstrates that even a great comic actor can't redeem a miserable, boring, formulaic, hackneyed, unfunny script. This film is a kind of undead 'Kingpin'. I like puerile humour as much as the next jock, but whereas 'Kingpin' had some funny moments and some fine acting, 'Me, Myself and Irene' should never have been allowed to see the light of day.On the other hand, I notice that some reviewers have given it four stars. So I guess I have to leave you to judge for yourself. If you find swearing and pulling faces funny, and are prepared to sit through more than two hours of it, then this might just be for you. Enjoy, although you might have more fun if you pulled the faces yourself in front of a mirror."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst","review":"If I could, I'd give this film negative five stars. Everyone associated with this film should be ashamed. The idea that three African-American children from Mensa parents would use the kind of language they use in this film is ridiculous. Maybe that was the point, but it didn't work. The narration is layered onto already long and drawn out gags that aren't funny. The only credible performance is from Renée Zellweger. She has to put up with Carry overacting. I'm not using my name because I don't want anyone to know that I actually sat through this mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Me, Myself & Irene is really a bad movie.","review":"I love Jim Carrey. I love everything that he does. I was so disappointed in this movie. I hope that he never works with the Farrellys again. I wish that I could rate this movie with an L for \\"La-hoo-za-her\\" because that's what it was - a big loser."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny...but unbalanced","review":"3.5 stars. This was a stronger movie than I expected. The first hour, I literally had tears in my eyes I was laughing so hard. The cow scene, to me, was just priceless. But honestly, I didn't quite understand what Irene was supposed to know and how it involved the characters chasing them and frankly I don't care. This is by no means Carrey's best work, since he was obviously trying to channel Dirty Harry for his Hank character, but he successfully gets me to care about Charlie. His three 'sons' in my opinion were waaay over the top and could have been toned down quite a bit. Zwellger obviously did this film because she was dating Carrey at the time. The results was that she came across more as a prop than a real character and that's remarkable for someone with her talent. The Farrelly brothers' oddball comedy is a hit in most areas which makes it easy to recommend this comedy if you're truely in a goofy mood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Schizophrenia Does Not Mean Having A Split Personality","review":"I have not yet watched this film, but I saw the preview. As a schizophrenic person I am highly offended because I am tired of people getting the wrong idea of this illness. As I stated in my title, schizophrenia does not mean having a split personality (like smeegol in the Lord of the Rings). There are different types and levels of schizophrenia, but it doesn't involve having a split personality. Based on what I saw in the preview, it's also not a funny film. I will definitely skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sophmoric humor that can't deliver","review":"This movie is, in a word, pathetic. It is not funny. The acting is bad and there is absolutely no plot. While the premise of over-the-top humor seems right up Jim Carrey's alley, he couldn't even pull this one off. Carrey has been in some stupid movies (like Ace Ventura) but managed to invoke humor with his physical style of comedy, which made the movie entertaining at least. Renee Zellwiger is NOT a comedic actress and her performance is downright annoying. Although frankly, I can't think of anyone who could make this movie better. The Farrelly brothers have obviously got some issues if they think this movie would appeal to anyone over the age of 12. Beavis and Butt-head are more entertainment than this. This movie relies on gross-out humor to compensate for its ridiculously non-existant plot. Dont buy...in fact, I wouldn't even recommend that you rent it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best comedy I've seen in years!","review":"Jim Carrey is probably on of the funniest actors available today, and in \\"Me, Myself & Irene\\" he steals the show..."},{"rating":"1","title":"What were you thinking, Jim???","review":"This movie is horrible. It is nothing but filth, which has nothing to do with the storyline. All of the funny parts occur in the first 5 minutes of the movie and are the scenes that were played as previews in theaters before this movie came out. I was really looking forward to a good laugh and all I got was a stomach ache."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The movie's only saving grace was the 3 sons, they were hilarious. I rented it for free from the library. Don't pay to see this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"You have got to be kidding","review":"This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I can't believe people thought this movie was funny. The script was total garbage and it was the usual Jim Carrey one man show routine. The only funny part of the movie was the cow scene - and as far as I'm concerned - the cow stole the show. The movie just dragged and enough was enough. I kept thinking that it would eventually become funny - but it never did. I always wondered why there were so many copies on the Best Buy shelves - now I know."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a film","review":"This is not even a film. It's a very bad excuse for Jim Carrey to make faces. No story. No plot. Just very embarrassing. I wish Carrey soon would do a serious movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than one star","review":"If i could give this movie less than one star i would. This movie, which starts off a comedy, loses direction early on and wanders about and eventually evolves into an action shoot-em-up gangster film. It is not funny, not entertaining, and not even remotely interesting. The gags are sexist and racist and the movie seems to rely on profanity to try to get its chuckles, but falls flat on all counts. If your looking for a comedy/Jim Carrey movie, look elswhere. This one is a dog."},{"rating":"1","title":"Me Myself And Irene","review":"The main problem with this product was that it was horrible quality. The DVD was apperently scratched in many places, something that was not mentioned in the description, and while watching it would skip around throughout the whole movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"MORALLY AND ETHICALLY DISGUSTING COMEDY IN THE ABSURD","review":"Jim Carrey has really lowered his standards to appear in a movie with total disgusting immorality, vulgar language, and comedytotally in the absurd. The M*****F*****G word is used constantly throughout the movie, and the constant vulgar immoralityattempts at cheap jokes is just plain degrading. Mr. Carrey has demonstrated that he will do anything for a cheap laugh, money,and publicity. The man is a narcissist totally. This movie is going in the Garbage where it belongs. I have lost all respect for Jim Carrey. Just another overpaid moron actor who think of themselves as gods rather than appease and take the time to ponder the only true God. Would give it minus 5 stars if I could. This movie will appeal to people with low I.Q.s, no morals, and atheist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The movie relies too heavily on Jim Carrey to carry it off, rather than have a real plot. The gags are lame. The cotton mouth scene was not funny, nor was shooting a cow 6 times in the head, strangling it, shoving his fingers in its nostrils and having Irene kick it, funny.Although the movie had a good end, it was an overall disappoinment for me.The 1 star is for Jim, of whom I am a fan, and the other is for the makers, for effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carrey is back! So are the Farrely Brothers.","review":"Me Myself and Irene will definitely make you laugh some, but probably not as much as you'd think for a Jim Carrey movie.

I didn't expect perfection, but I did expect something better than this. For starters it's not 3D...more like 2D.5 because the images don't pop out of the screen as you would expect. If you're watch a 3D movie, yes it gives the movie more deminsion, and a somewhat 3D effect, but nothing comes out of the screen. As far as regular non-3D movies, which it promises to convert into 3D...what a waste! It adds almost nothing. I hoped it would work on the 3D versions of Shrek and Spy Kids, but it did not. And if you want this thing to have the ultimate home theater experience wouldn't you want it to work on a big screen TV? It doesn't. I give it 2 stars for a nice try, but the technology isn't there yet...maybe one day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its OK for the price","review":"First of all you need to play with buttons to get is right. As lot of people says, it doesn't convert 2D to 3D as it should, and you can't see 3D effects out of 2D movies or TV shows, it kind of take you in a view where it looks like you are watching it from a window without little 3D effects. For the Price I am happy because I got lot of 3D movies with it and it works on 3D movies, please note that not all 3D movies will work with these, only 3D movies that work with shutter glasses will work with those.

Two adults - Dr. Pat Blake (Helena Carter) and Dr. Stuart Kelston (Arthur Franz) - take David at his word, which sets off a perilous race against time to solve the mystery before more humans are \\"controlled\\" by the stranded aliens.Nominated for a 1953 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, it is a swerve on \\"The Boy Who Cried Wolf,\\" because this young person is telling the truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Poor Quality Print","review":"Really a shame.

But, the last 15 minutes or so as we watch the soldiers and \\"Martians\\" endlessly run through the web of tunnels around the alien ship is mind-boggingly dull. The set up of the plot is really well down, as has been described here in other reviews, the boy unearths a plot by aliens to take over and control humans, but once we start seeing the seemingly endless montage of military vehicles being brought into place around where the alien ship supposedly is, the film just loses it. From that point, there is no plot. Just because this was one of the first sci-fi films in color doesn't mean it can hold a distinquished place in film history."},{"rating":"1","title":"hmm, i've seen better","review":"well this seems to be one of the first bodysnatcher type movies, so it has its originality. the paranoia and fear of the kid when no one will listen is relatable too. for those points i gave it a 2. however the ending makes no sense, and i particularly don't like it when a movie ends with someone waking up, because either way it wasn't real to me anyway. the remake of this was awful. i wouldn't dare call this scary though, however, it has its originality in that it was one the very first and has since been copied in hundreds of ways. I wouldn't recommend it though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfunny, Uncampy Garbage","review":"Don't mention this waste of celluloid in the same breath as The Day The Earth Stood Still or even Creature From The Black Lagoon. This is almost what Ed Wood might have made with a bigger budget, but the hammy, campy flourishes that are so endearing in Plan 9 or Bride of the Monstor aren't there. The acting is wooden, the dialogue is straight out of classroom films, and the special effects worse than Wood's. Only Robot Monster comes close to this bottom-rung effort and at least Robot Monster had some interesting beefcake. IFM should also get the Stock Footage award for its use of WW II army footage as the film plods along. Yeesh, this film is pure crap! Makes me want to wash my eyes out with Gilligan's Island reruns!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Invaders from Mars","review":"Invaders from Mars is a favorite of mine form when I was a child. Although the movie brought back fond memories, the copy is not in great condition. It appears that the transfer to DVD is fine, but the master has many flaws. I recommend the edition if for nothing else then the movie is fun and a classic example of 1950's science fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic 50's Sci Fi","review":"Classic movie from the 50's. I remember watching it as a kid on TV in black and white which may be better than color. The Martian leader carried around in a fishbowl always reminded me of the head of Edward G. Robinson surrounded by octopus-like tentacles. See for yourself!"},{"rating":"1","title":"blah movie, even worse quality dvd","review":"The movie itself starts off okay with all this spaceship business and the mysteriousness of what happened to the kid's parents. But things go downhill when they introduce the army and fill the movie with tons of stock footage of tanks moving here and there. Too much time watching tanks move, or army people scuttling about.Anyway, the biggest complaint is the DVD itself. I have hundreds of DVDs, and this one is by far the worst quality DVD I've ever seen. The video quality is full of grain and spots and lines - just plain horrible. Buyer beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is that you dad?","review":"Pretty good sci-fi from the golden age but not as good as some would want it to be. The print was ok considering the age of the negatives and the sound was average. Good color and all in all a pretty good slice of american cheese under the shadow of the cold war."},{"rating":"1","title":"The movie is as I remembered it","review":"from watching on TV in the 60s. No surprises there and I'd rate it a 4 on that. The quality of the DVD is abysmal though. I'm going to assume that the production values of the original movie were at least adequate and that no care at all was taken in transferring it to DVD. Zero for the disc itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"great 50s sci-fi","review":"Remember when you were little and tried to convince adults of something but were dismissed as just a silly kid with a wild imagination? That's what the 12-year-old hero is up against as he tries to warn of aliens putting implants into humans to control them. Weird camera angles and distorted sets add to the paranoia. Only 78 minutes long because it was made in 1953 when double features were the norm."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD DISC - BAD AMAZON FOR NO RETURNS","review":"This was another movie I remember watching and even being a little scared as a youngster. I was delighted to finally find it on Amazon if for no other reason than sentimentality. However, After trying to play the disk in several different players with no success I discovered the reason: the disk itself had a crack all through one side. It is for this reason only I gave it one star and if I could give the packaging any lower rating I would"},{"rating":"2","title":"The original...","review":"... and while a Grade C sci fi film, if you think like a child of the 1950s and all the innocence of the time, this film becomes something quite more than it appears. And I also enjoyed the remake in the 1980s, which is difficult to find."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mislabeled and Misleading","review":"On late night black and white tv, this movie scared me to blackout my bedroom windows (which didn't please my parents). William Cameron Menzies was a visionary. His stark style of design and tight storytelling still affects me as a designer and a writer. This past year I saw IFM on TCM and my imagination must have been at work because it wasn't the same movie. But then TCM's savvy host wised me up. The copyright was up for sale and some bozo bought it. He thought it needed more military action and inserted stock footage of tanks loading (to the tune of \\"Caissons\\" no less), and other footage of tanks coming to the rescue. In other words he reedited a classic. So if you buy the DVD and it says Original U.S. release. It's a lie. Send that warning to the FBI."},{"rating":"1","title":"Invaders A Let Down","review":"Having watched this classic probably over 30 years ago as a teenage boy with my parents, I was looking forward to sharing the experience with my own teenage son. What a disappointment! We started the evening with the marvellous The Day The Earth Stood Still and settled back for the much anticipated next feature special. We both agreed it was unwatchable. Picture quality was an insult to this classic and certainly a slap in the face to the large number of buyers out there who are dedicated sci-fans and collectors.If you are intending to add to your collection, don't. Perhaps there will be a re-mastered version some day to do justice to this undeniable gem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality DVD","review":"I truly wanted to add this DVD to my collection of classic Sci-fi movies.

Likeable characters and a sweet story line make it a quick and pleasurable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"heartwarming","review":"I am actually going to give this book to my granddaughter. I did read it and it is very touching to go into the life of a young lady that is on her own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I was extremely disappointed with this book. It is definitely for teenagers (especially the romantic type). An assumption that it was the same as the William Peterson film, The Staircase, was incorrect. The only similarity was the staircase being built by a \\"mysterious stranger\\". Oh, well, as an adult, perhaps I should be a bit more careful in book choice and look inside before purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Catholics Beware","review":"I bought this book excited by the premise and found it to be a sad disappointment. Populated with gross stereotypes, misrepresentative of the Faith, and full of poorly-constructed two-dimensional characters made colorful by circumstance rather than spirit, Rinaldi takes a beautiful piece of Church Lore and turns it into a relativistic anti-Catholic romp. Propaganda at its worst. Irredeemably convoluted if not downright hateful."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Staircase\`","review":"I liked this book. It was pretty good with all the important things. One thing bad about it though, is that it stayed on the same \\"level\\". I don't really think there was a \\"climax\\". But I did like the story.I'd say that the best part of the book is when the bishops arrives. His so nice, and he knows what Elinora is really like, because she fool alot of people. The worst part, well its not really the book, but more what happens in the story. I hate it when Elinora stabs Cleo the kitten in the eyes with a needle then throws her out the window. She doesn't need to hurt Cleo to show Lizzy how much she hates her.The author did a really good job on characters, I really felt I knew them all like I had really known them for years. The other thing is the conflict, she had like five conflicts going on at the same time. So those were all pretty good."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Mesmerising Tale","review":"This book is a wonderful tale of the actual mysterious carpenter of the Sisters of Loretto and his masterful staircase. I thought it was wonderful how the staricase was a way to test the users faith in the end, with no railings on either side and built of strong and sturfy mysterious wood and wooden pegs instead of nails. The fact that the actual staricase has withstood all these years is amazing as well. I give this novl 5 stars because it covers everything that is needed and only leaves you hanging in one aspect, whisch is exactly as it should have been. Perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Conceals, provides full coverage","review":"I have used Face Magic Peach Beige concealer off and on for several years now. It works well as a concealer and does cover broken capillaries around the nose, dark circles under the eyes, and blotcy areas. I use it only on target areas in addition to my foundation. I have tried more expensive concealers and always go back to Face Magic. It is more opague and provides better coverage of target problem areas than any pricier concealer. It covers better, goes on nice and smooth and lasts."},{"rating":"2","title":"classic Billy Joel","review":"I originally bought this album in 1978 on 8-track so I could listen to it in my Pinto, let me tell you, CD makes it sound so much better. This is Billy Joel at his best. The songs are captivating, not too short, not too long. I like it a little more every time I listen to it, I highly reccomend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"billy joel stranger","review":"I loved this cd. It is pretty short, but the songs it has on it are great. I bought it beacause there were a couple of songs on it that I knew I loved, and I ended up hearing more that I loved. I didn't even realize untill I herad them that I had heard and enjoyed most of the songs on the cd before I got the cd. Before I got the cd my favorite song by him was \\"Vienna\\". I still love that song, but there are some other great ones, like the title track \\"stranger\\", that are also alot of fun. If you like Billy Joel you should get this, and if you aren't familiar with him, you might want to check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ah, what a classic album","review":"This is one of Joel's best albums containing some of his best songs. 'Moving Out', 'Vienna' and 'Scenes from an Italian Resturant' are amazing. Billy Joel's songs are always fun to listen to and contain some of the most interesting, juxtoposed lyrics. He has created some of the most romantic songs of all time. Here we have one of his best, 'She's Always A Woman'. Billy Joel is the epitome of all things New York, just like Woody Allen. It's just something he is known for. I can just picture strolling down Central Park listening to these glorious songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfection","review":"I own every Billy Joel album except for 'River of Dreams'. 'The Stranger' is easily his best with many singles lifted from it including 'Just the Way You Are', and 'Moving Out'. My favourite is the track 'Scenes from an Italian Restaurant' as it is a beautiful epic. This is a great starting point for anyone wanting to own a Joel album, and acquire a masterpiece at the same time. Other great Joel albums include '52nd Street' and 'Glass Houses'."},{"rating":"2","title":"At the Top of His Game","review":"This was my first Billy Joel CD. When I got in the car, I shoved it in the CD player to listen to Movin' Out (Anthony's Song). As I grew in taste I checked out other songs on the CD. It turned out that he had many differences in songs on the same album. I was dumbfounded. I knew that he would become one of my favorite artists. His versitility was amazing. His classical backgrounds started to come through on Scenes From An Italian Restaraunt. He added in his rock 'n' roll sense to create a wonderful CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good, Solid CD","review":"Ahhh. Old time Billy Joel. Really good stuff. Of the nine tracks on the CD, I've rated all but one as Very Good. That one remaining track I've rated as \\"merely\\" Good (I use Media Player's five star rating system where two stars (not three stars) rates as OK). My individual track ratings are:1. Movin' Out (Anthony's Song) -- 4 Stars2. Stranger -- 4 Stars3. Just the Way You Are -- 4 Stars4. Scenes from an Italian Restaurant -- 4 Stars5. Vienna -- 4 Stars6.

First, it says that it includes a free digital download and even has a card inside the sleeve. In the fine print, though: Offer Valid Until July 8, 2009. Second, the vinyl was cut pretty badly. Most of the edges are cut to a point, but there's about a 3-inch section of the outer circumference that doesn't wither down like the rest (instead it's like many other 180g vinyls, with the wide edge). Lastly, the first half of the B side cracked quite a bit in the right channel. It wasn't audible during loud portions of the songs, but through most of Vienna it was loud enough to be annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Mobile Fidelity SACD Sounds Dreadful! !","review":"I recently purchased this brand new Original Remaster from Mobile Fidelity to replace the decade old Sony/Columbia SACD version that I sold for a large chunk of change and I'm sorry to report that it was a big mistake.The New SACD sounds dull and lifeless like the engineer forgot to add treble to the mix. I'm finding that a lot of mofi's recordings are hit or miss these days. When they hit they're amazing sounding but otherwise they sound flat and compressed and it's a damn shame. $29.00 down the drain.

The pictures did not look \\"natural\\" at all. Yesss, they looked posed, and dressed up for exactly that fact: posing for pictures in a studio. They have the repetitive same theme ie... atleast 1 or 2 military clad guys, someone sittin' in a chair, someone on a table. It looked like scenes were thrown together without much thought at all. The underwear w/ holes in them; made me think of uncleanliness, also the same \\"spreading the cheeks\\" pose...sigh...come on! I do agree; however, with the sepia tones...nice indeed. The pictures didn't even fill up a whole page. You could of saved $$$ condensing it into a smaller book. Small pictures do not give the effect of life-like. You wanna feel entrapped or look at every detail in a photograph. I'd have to say the best picture to me is of the uncircumsized falace.

Colson once again addresses several relevant issues facing our culture today.The book is a compilation of addresses by Colson at various meetings (college commencements, Bible conferences, etc.) and covers a wide range of topics: conscience, personal integrity, the choice between right and wrong, leadership (this address alone is a gem and my personal favorite!), and other subjects.Consistent with his other books, Colson challenges the reader to know what you believe and why you believe, especially from a Christian worldview. Colson encourages us to think through our beliefs and not just live on emotion alone.Buy the book and be challenged and inspired by one of the great Christian apologists of today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An old- time favorite","review":"This was a childhood favorite of mine which I frequently read in the Library of the Troy Jewish Community Center 87 First Street.I can remember sitting there and reading about such questionable greats as Harry Danning, Sid Gordon and Moe Berg. Of course there were undoubted greats like Hank Greenberg and Sid Luckman. And there was in boxing too Barney Ross and Benny Leonard.Perhaps there are more up- to- date books about Jews in sports but I doubt there are any which tell a story as well, and give the young person such a warm feeling about the Jewish contribution to what seemed at that time of life, the most important form of human activity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Realism","review":"So much in reading Ibsen depends upon the translation of these great works. These four plays of Ibsen's so-called \\"realistic period\\" revolve around social issues of his day which plague us 100 years later. Do we ever learn from such literary wake-up calls? Although the dramatic tensions here, which could have easily have been 20th Century tensions, rumble through these plays, the translations here are wordy and dated, thus making the plays sound overly melodramatic and at times downright silly. Still, everyone should read -- and discuss -- Ibsen's plays for their uneasy questions regarding universal social problems: money, privacy, freedom to act, government corruption, unchecked journalism, and the moral and physical diseases which only seem to wear a new face each year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoughtful and thought provoking","review":"While tame in today's society, A Doll's House was one of the first plays to address feminist issues. Ibsen masterfully sets up a plot that allows the reader/viewer of the play to begin to understand what it was like for women in the 1800's and see how difficult it was for them to become independent. This is a great read with characters that are likable are well developed. It is much better than other feminist books I have read from the same or later time frames such as Madame Bovary and The Heidi Chronicles."},{"rating":"2","title":"latest pop princess.","review":"simply put, joy enriquez has a voice perfectly suited to the funk-infused pop that populates her debut album. at times strong and vibrant, at others sweet and playful, enriquez traverses the straightfoward terrain of her eponymous foray into the pop landscape with suitable acumen. the albums music does not stray far enough from that of j.lo, destiny's child and 3LW to earn the accolade \\"groundbreaking\\", but if you favour that style and are looking for something new, look no further. it doesn't hurt, of course, that the album was released in the wake of jennifer lopez' multi-platinum debut, which triggered the latest latin explosion in the market. if enriquez had more support from her label, she definitely would have garnered more recognition for such a strong debut."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHERE ARE YOU JOY WITH A SECOND ALBUM???????","review":"JOI HAS A GREAT VOICE, SHE MAKES J.LO SOUND REALLY BAD.

First, the official (whistling)opening music is omitted for whatever reason. Second, the quality of episodes is suspect. Third, considering what they are charging for this set, one would expect more episodes. I highly recommend not buying this item.

Doing conventional wiring in this particular place in my old house would be extremely messy, costly and time consuming. Installation of this receiver took 10 minutes total. Anybody can do it.Now, the \\"but\\" parts.The switches available for this receiver do not look like most conventional switches, which may present an interior decoration challenge.I also discovered a design quirk. If you start switching \\"on\\" and \\"off\\" relatively quickly, several times with less then 60 seconds intervals, the receiver or switch (cannot tell) stops working for a while. It just refuses to turn on the light. Not that one would really need to do it in real life, but it indicates a potential design limitation or even a flaw.Anyway, I saved tons of time and money with this combo and overall am very happy.

It's a bit smaller, fitting my wrist much better, and has a more feminine look.

There are a couple of mildly risque scenes, but the majority of it is actually tame enough for family viewing. I would say this movie is more of a collector's item, than a great story. What I liked best about this movie is the surprising sense of nostalgia it evokes...much like a vintage comic book put on film. The extra features that come with this dvd are interesting, & help to make this purchase a worthwhile one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Three Nuts in Search of a Bolt","review":"The previous writer is in error. \\"Three Nuts in Search of a Bolt\\" is definitely the Mamie VanDoren movie. He has this movie confused with \\"Promises! Promises!\\" which starred Jayne Mansfield and Tommy Noonan. The confusion probably arose because both films had Playboy spreads, and both co-starred Tommy Noonan.\\"Three Nuts\\" is a funny film and for the writer to give it one star just because he had to give it something does a disservice to the movie and Amazon customers."},{"rating":"1","title":"The unfunniest comedy record I've ever heard.","review":"Don't get me wrong.

Pesci repeatedly pokes fun at the rappers who consider themselves to be \\"Gangstas\\" and reminds them who the original \\"Gangsters\\" are: The Italians. \\"If it doesn't snow for Christmas\\" is rather idiotic. It is also obvious that Pesci was having problems with somebody that he was involved with due to a number of his songs lashing out at his partner. Other than 2 or 3 songs, this album is pure gold.

Bad news is that that jewel case was broken and cracked. I wrote to the seller, and received no reply, however, 2 days later, an empty jewel case arrived in the mail. It was scratched and dirty with adhesive still on it from whatever was in it before. By this time it was too late to order a new CD.

The rest of the book is just sample tests which look unprofessionally made and some questions are ambiguous. I was so frustrated with this book because the many misprints that it contained, I seriously do not recommend anyone who is taking the AP Biology exam to buy this book, instead, buy the Cliff's Notes for AP Biology, that is the best book ever for the exam, after reading that, I completely understood every aspect of Biology."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another OK prep book","review":"I bought this book by winter and read it on the plane in winter break.

Some really important issues - like dealing with illness while pregnant - were dealt with in a very superficial way. I am pregnant for the first time, and I have a ton of really specific questions. This book does not go very far in answering those questions. For a first-time mom, I would suggest \\"What to Expect When You Are Expecting,\\" instead.

So the book spends a bit of time going over UK health care, welfare and medical benefits of UK citizens. Since I am American none of this pertained to me. Also some of the vernacular is different, understandable but different (mum = mom, labor = Labour). Some words were confusing if you didn't spend a minute to look them up such as Paracetamol (thats actually tylenol). Also things such as the food guide pyramid are different because each country has its own pyramid. If you are not from the UK, keep looking until you find the US version.

With songs that keep Christmas alive in the big kids, to remberances of those loved ones we've lost who will not be home for the holidays but keeps in a strong mind the most important thing of all: Jesus Christ. I have owned this album for a year now and I have to say I listen to it constantly! On road trips, in the shower, when I drift off to sleep and when I want to hear some great music by a talented singer.

This has the episodes of Johnny Bravo and I Am Weasel I have predicted earlier in the volume one review; as does the Eds' \\"Jingle Jingle Jangle\\" holiday special.And since this DVD is called \\"Christmas ROCKS\\", the bonus episodes have something to do with music. For example, there's the Billy and Mandy episode where Grim plays some goth metal of sorts(he almost sings like Marylin Manson if you know what I mean).I'm not sure if they'll make a volume three, which might also have the other Snowman-themed episode of Courage, but I hear they're making a Kids Next Door holiday special called \\"Operation N.A.U.G.H.T.Y.\\" and also a Billy and Mandy holiday episode, I think.

It has a lot of great songs, but the recordings seem rather tired. Miami 2017 is too slow, Angry Young Man is also, and James is a sleeper.However, All You Wanna Do Is Dance is a fun song, I do like this version of Say Goodbye to Hollywood, and New York State of Mind is very relaxing.If you like a lot of the songs on this album (Miami 2017, Say Goodbye to Hollywood, Summer Highland Falls), and if you have not already done so, I'd strongly reccomend \\"Songs in the Attic\\". Many of the songs on this album are on that one, and the live versions have something that the album versions do not.

But there are other gems on this CD that make it worth checking out. The song \\"Summer Highland Falls\\", which is performed on Billy's Millennium CD is in its original, unhampered state here. \\"Angry Young Man\\" is a great tune - it's one of those great melodic human nature tunes Joel is so wonderful at and also worth having in its studio form.Some of the other songs are throwaways. \\"All you wanna do is dance\\" may have sounded good during its time, but feels very dated now and \\"James\\" is too actually too soft a ballad.

They fit in the top rack of most dishwashers and are very durable. (I've used them for the past 5 years.) Plus, when you are drinking that special bottle from your special glasses, it makes a very nice water glass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these glasses","review":"I can't say enough good things about these glasses. The shape is ideal for red wine and/or any other beverage. The short stems make them ideal for the dishwasher and less susceptible to be knocked over by those who move their hands when they talk. My first set was purchased over 10 years ago. Because I used them \\"everyday\\" (the name is appropriate), it took over 10 years to break them all. Actually, I think a 6.7 earthquake finished off the last three(out of six). I have spent one year experimenting with other glassware, but nothing is a substitute for Riedel's Everyday Glass. If you want to feel elegant everytime you have a beverage, buy these. NOTE: The Everyday Glass (13 oz) is slightly larger than the Water Glass."},{"rating":"1","title":"glass from France, not crystal from Austria","review":"Riedel's water glass and gourmet glass are both made in France of glass (not crystal). The stem's too short for wine in my opinion, but you could always use them for water. The water glasses are more suitable, though, as they have a wider mouth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slimy Scare Tactics","review":"Articles are way too scare mongering for my taste. Suggesting a link between Diabetes and every other disease is too easy but correlation doesn't necessary imply causation. Nor does a single scientific journal of which none of Diabetes Forecast's readers have access to without a large cash layout deserve such credence and should be met with a skeptical eye not seen in this magazines writing.Also seems to shill for pharmaceuticals unabashedly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't purchase this version","review":"This book contains numerous typographical errors that make it difficult to read. A statement from the publisher in the front of the book claims that because the book was scanned by a \\"robot\\" it contains textual errors (and no images) but that the buyer can access the correct version on-line. Amazon.com should acknowledge these errors in the book in advertising it. In any case, it strikes me that the publisher of this book has scanned it and put it up for sale simply to profit from the opportunity (since this book is now out of copyright), and for no other reason."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good!","review":"While it has seen limited use so far it has met my expectations.Attaching the wheels was straight forward and not a problem.The only reason for the 4 out of 5 stars is that one of the swivel casters doesn't quite swivel as freely as it should but I don't think it will hinder the overall performance.The folding handle seems a little shaky but I will wait until I've used the cart a few times with a heavy load before I judge that.So far I am very happy with it and would recommend it to anyone looking for a heavy duty hand truck that folds for compact storage at a reasonable price."},{"rating":"1","title":"I received My Package Broken and the Item scratched Up.","review":"I received my product is somewhat of a mess. I haven't written or said anything. I was dissappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy with nice finish","review":"This was the perfect shelf for our dining room display wall. We bought 4 of them for displaying ceramics and bottles, so they needed to be well braced. The \\"wings\\" give them a lot of stability, they can be mounted with the wings up or down, and the dark cherry finish is very nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Episode!","review":"Great Episode, typically not shown on Discovery due to the two hour format. Absolute Sillyniess on the cast's part on the whole pirate thing, but great show otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Reencode Season 5 episode 24","review":"Hope this review attaches only to the single episode - something went wrong with the encoding for Season 5 Episode 24 and the video portion is solid green."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, from a great series!","review":"I loved Secret of the Unicorn Queen as a kid, and I still love the books as an adult. Fantasy, adventure, romance: what more could a girl ask for?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unicorn Queen","review":"This is a wonderful series- I was in love with the books in 3rd and 4th grade, and even dressed up as Illyria(The Unicorn Queen) for Halloween one year. It's too bad they're now out of print- I never read past Book 5, and I'm still curious about what happens in the end. The whole idea of a girl escaping into a world full of unicorns and men who turn into eagles and beautiful women warriors captived me when I was younger,and although they're not exactly Lord of the Rings, the series deserves to be in print."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic literary journey.","review":"I fell in love with it from the first pages and proceded to buy the rest of the series as they reached an [local] bookshop on an airbase in Germany..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Magnificent Book!","review":"This series is the magnificent books that everyone MUST SEE! I am now currently working but I still miss this series a lot since I read them when I am 10 years old. I'm glad I can finally buy the series. Miss them a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kirsten book","review":"My great granddaughter loves the Kirsten book, which goes with her Kirsten doll. The book was in excellent condition, and delivery was prompt, The price was very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"unhappy","review":"It was advertised as a hardcover book... however it was not a hardcover. I was very unhappy with false advertising."},{"rating":"2","title":"Free +10","review":"Great album from start to finish! Plus you get mono mixes, b-sides and alternate takes of all the songs. And only 2 of them appear on the box set Songs of Yesterday!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of their best","review":"One of the group's best ever. Andy Fraser is doing his usual highly creative job on bass. Every song is listenable and memorable. Not quite as bluesy as \\"Tons of Sobs,\\" nor as mainstream as \\"Fire and Water,\\" but just right."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"The product I received was not what I ordered. It was a different type of Pantene. I returned the package the same day, (at my expense) because it was not what I ordered. I was a 25.4 oz bottle, but not the Pro V, Daily Moisture Renewal Moisturizing Shampoo for Dry or Damaged hair. I was very disappointed that it was not the right kind because I had searched quite a while for it."}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:B,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},C={class:"card-container"},N=["disabled"],M={key:0},H={key:1};function R(i,e,s,u,r,n){const c=y("PoemCard");return o(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",C,[(o(!0),a(w,null,f(n.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(o(),p(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),n.hasMorePoems?(o(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>n.loadMore&&n.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(o(),a("span",H,"Loading...")):(o(),a("span",M,"See more"))],8,N)):b("",!0)])}const L=d(O,[["render",R],["__scopeId","data-v-3dc12acd"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/51.md","filePath":"drive/51.md"}'),x={name:"drive/51.md"},G=Object.assign(x,{setup(i){return(e,s)=>(o(),a("div",null,[v(L)]))}});export{j as __pageData,G as default};
