Unfortunately, he continues to pass off fragments of data along with many embellished anecdotes as if they were credible science.It is sad that he has squandered such rich opportunities. This superficial and unenlightening book--apparently published with the goal of cashing in on the recent popularity of one of his (former) research mediums--unfortunately confirms the downward spiral of a once promising field of study.The sloppy data collection and poor scientific methodology evident in \\"The Truth About Mediums\\" continue to spread misinformation and do more harm than good to the study of mediumship, since the results are so easily discredited. Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Going beyond conjecture and speculation to present the author's own scientific probe","review":"Gary E. Schwartz, Ph.D. works with William L.

How sketchy of Schwartz who operates under the guise of the TRUTH.....and isn't interesting how he keeps harping on DuBois' having not endorsed him, when in fact he is mispresenting her as well.....I find it disgraceful and sad.

Schwartz continues to espouse that he had permission to write about Allison DuBois and the other mediums, but that is not the impression given on DuBois' site. I also note that he said he had written the forward for her book, but that is not the case with my copy(paperback), it was written by a Dr. Russek, and I found very few mentions of Schwartz. So, clearly there are discrepencies.... Schwartz should prove he had permission to write about the mediums, by producing a signed consent form, proving that they indeed signed their rights away to Schwartz. Why is he so attached to using their names? Why does he only have 2 mediums left on his website? Why does he not move on and use someone else? Maybe it is because very few mediums actually have the talent and ability of Ms. DuBois.I smell a rat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but ideologically wrong-headed","review":"Halperin's work is essentially ideological, as I suspect he would admit. He believes first and then argues. His reading of the primary sources reflects his biases, and his arguments based on Greek vocabulary are weak and based on a lot of semantic trickery. If you are interested in sexuality in the ancient world, you have to read Halperin, but only those that start from his own ideological assumptions will be convinced he has said anything important."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic gay studies text! You must buy it.","review":"This book is a canonical gay studies text. Halperin is a respected academic in both the classics and gay studies. The term \\"homosexuality\\" was invented a little over a century ago. Thus, anything before that time has to be analyzed in perspective. Halperin looks at the classic writings of ancient Greek \\"homosexuals\\" and puts them into deep analysis. Halperin avoids a lot of the \\"essentialist\\" mistakes that John Boswell fell into with his Social Tolerance book. Dover's book has more cool photos in it, but Halperin's book is very worthwhile. It's a must-have for classics and gay readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is a dark side","review":"She gives lots of warnings and teaches a Russian kind of shamanism.

She just doesn't teach about it. And to me that is like handing someone a gun and bullets and not telling them how to load the gun. They will end up with a loaded gun eventually. so yes it is scary and I am sorry to see it published.

Its basic pretense is that there is no such thing as luck or coincidence. The good things that happen to you happen because you deserve it or were thinking good thoughts or some other such nonsense.The book, like all the other Secret mallarkey, completely skips the necessary flipside of the equation. That the bad things that happen thoughout the world - Somalia, Darfur, Iraq, New Orleans, Indonesia, etc. - must therefore be due to the bad thoughts and bad thinking and bad karma of the poor folks hit by those disasters. They deserved to die.It is just more of the same effort to rationalize and justify social excess in a world where there are needy people. Keep the poor out of your mind. Avoid the sick.

He has a website that has worksheets to print and use. One of my main concerns is wording my affirmations in the correct way so that they are effective. He goes into detail on this! It's definitely worth the money and time and it's an easy read. It's not a huge overwhelming book that you start and never finish. You could finish in 1-2 days easy.

Man was I wrong. This book seems to have been written for a middle school student.

The Law of Attraction gives you step-by-step instructions on how to use and apply the Law of Attraction. The steps (3 of them along with some additional exercises)were incredibly simple to imply and they were easy to remember so that you don't have to carry the book around with you.

All of these books have a common theme--a focus upon oneself as the source of fulfillment. Guess what? It's not about you! If you want to change what you attract, you will never succeed by looking to yourself. You must first make God the center of your universe. This is not a message that many of us want to hear or accept because our Western culture is based upon self-gratification. When you seek God and make Him the focus of your life, guess what happens? All of your needs (and more) are fulfilled. That is His promise and God never breaks His promises.

My one problem with htis book is that it makes for difficult reading. Please don't let that sway your opinion, instead, take it as a challenge to read and comprehend the vitally important laws of the universe. Laws such as the Law of Magnetism, Law of Attraction, and Law of Pure Desire have achieved a wide popularity recently,which seems to reflect our current rage for advice on how to succeed and achieve our goals. In my opinion, Losier does a good job in this area, delivering a piece similar to the popular book \\"Shortcut to a Miracle,\\" by Michael and Elizabeth Rann.If you are interested in something more specifically geared towards financial success, you may want to try the classic \\"Richest Man in Babylon,\\" by George Clason, or \\"The 17 Principles of Creating Wealth,\\" by Phillip Collinsworth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"Very easy to read, very clear, and also interesting.

It is a rehash of other books, for instance, \\"The power of Positive thinking\\" but is unoriginal, naive and childish in its approach.On the subject of abundance, it tells you to accept gladly when a friend invites you to lunch, and take it as a token of abundance; what it does not say is that when you accept such an invitation, you are to reciprocate later on, so your so-called abundance then gets neutralized.Or celebrate because you got a second cup of coffee for free at the cafeteria!

I counted 17 items in mercilessly detailed list of how to train your mind to think about the LOA when he could have made the same point in a single, well-worded sentence.

I find it hard to believe that someone would pass off something as poorly written as this book as being worthwhile in learning/understanding the concept of the law of attraction. Needless to say, the book found itself in the garbage! An absolute waste of time and money - a great dissapointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"The audio version - don't get it - get the book instead","review":"I saw the reviews of the book and eagerly anticipated the audio version. I received it and was dissapointed. I have heard Michael Losier speak, and he is a wonderful speaker. The reader is boring, has no intonation, basically is monotone.

It is not a law. You do not attract what you think about, which is the basic premise. Starving kids are not attracting starvation. It is an immature concept. You may get what you work towards. The LOA crowd who were supposedly influenced by the Science of Getting Rich missed this great books message. The SOGR is about visualization, gratitude and above all personal action. The SOGR is not about attracting at all. Read the SOGR which is free all over the net and when you are ready to take action check out Desired Outcomes Implementation Technology a great ebook which really reasonable and gives an action road map. It is at desiredoutcomes.info I wish these LOA teachers would be more honest about how things come to be in the real world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Michael is very incongruent with the message of his book","review":"I went and saw Michael Losier speak years ago.

I have used the basics of the theory of the law of attraction in my meditation practice and know that the principles helped me to attract my perfect mate.

I wanted something that would practically give instruction as to how to achieve results with the law of attraction and this book is it.

However, once he \\"transformed\\" the car into the robot, it was quite difficult to turn it back into the car again; he couldn't do it, his older brother and his mother couldn't figure it out. Typically I end up helping others figure things out, but felt quite helpless turning the robot back into the car. Yes, I finally did it after 5 hours of trial and error. The pieces don't fit together well and it is very easy to turn the wrong way and break small pieces. In any case I will be in quite an agony once my son transforms it back into robot and asks me to turn it back into the car again :-("},{"rating":"2","title":"IT'S AWESOME.

I remembered reading this book as a child and when I was looking for something to read to my father, who has Alzheimer's, I searched once again for this title. The story of Nell is just right to keep his attention, it brings back his memories of the woodlands where he grew up and the indians he grew up with in Oklahoma. If you are interested in the frontier and an exciting adventure to boot this is the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run Away!!","review":"Ick Ick Ick...mate tastes like boiled straw.

Mate is an acquired taste, but this is definately not way to acquire it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic","review":"Well written, consistently interesting and structured around the challenges of topography and the urban form demands invoked by market needs, political architectures and cultural expectations through history, this beautifully illustrated book delivers the promise of its title and a lot more.Because the author, Spiro Kostof, organized his book by patterns and topological relationships, the text compresses history and geographies into a comparative perspective. This presents a disadvantage to the reader if he/she is interested in only one time, one culture or even just one architectural movement.On the other hand, the comparative perspective lends authority to Kostof's overarching theoretical approach of connecting urban forms to content and how those relationships persist across the spectrum of the human experience. A must for any architect's or planner's library."},{"rating":"2","title":"A well-written foray into urban formation","review":"Spiro Kostof's book is a fantastic and intelligent foray into urban form. What I found most appealing about the book was his approach in grappling with the WHY of things; in describing how certain urban forms have come to pass, he offers the requisite determined factors as any architect of the City ought to do and then manages the neat trick of gracefully acknowledging that these factors do not necessarily lead to a single outcome. But he is intrepid in his analysis and his approach. Beginners may find this book difficult because it does assume a basic understanding of cities and city planning; however, ambitious readers should give it a try. Mr. Kostof's cultural and historical references and his non-linear style are extremely appealing and intriguing, so much so that I will continue on to \\"The City Assembled\\", the companion piece, with great eagerness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for architects","review":"The book is very illustrative, the author is clear and uses many examples. He foccuses on the physical shape of cities and how they have been altered throughout hostory. This is not a history book, this book is very architectural, if that is not your goal, you might reconsider it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible in the beginning but gets a little better later","review":"This book is definitely not a casual read. Unfortunately, our professor chose this book for our History in Urban Planning course. Kostof wrote this book using big words, it seems, trying to prove his mastery and great command of the English language. Making it worst is his inference from numerous examples that baffles the beginning learner with no previous historical knowledge of urban forms. It takes three hours to read something that should only take one and you will only understand 35% of what was read. If you have the patience and commitment to learn history...in urban planning, the book gets better later on. Therefore, I changed my 1 star to 2 stars. Nevertheless, I still hate this book but for a good laugh, I might keep it on the coffee table and refer people to this book when they ask what Urban Planning is all about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good deal!","review":"The plates are just what I expected and arrived promptly.

Pema Chodron's work is a truly radical teaching of how we contribute to war and peace and the importance of our individual contributions to the state of the \\"world\\" we live in and the world the next generation will inherit. Even if you don't agree with the positions she offers (some of the aspects of the teaching aren't \\"easy\\"), this work is thought provoking.

We do make a difference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Professional Video Editing for the Masses!","review":"I have been a Final Cut user for about six years now. I started with an education copy of FCP 2. I then purchased FCP 3, but because of cost considerations, I chose to buy FCE HD rather than upgrade to FCP HD.I am impressed with the feature set of this version of FCE. I had FCE 1, but I didn't use it very often because it was so limited. The keyframe element of FCE HD makes it well worth the upgrade!It runs very well on my G5 dual 2 gig, and the render-on-the-fly feature is fantastic. I'm not sure how I got along without it. I have created several movies already without any glitches or crashes.Nice job Apple!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Final Cut Express HD ver. 3.5","review":"By far the most intuitive and powerful video editing software I have ever worked with.

This upgrade works perfectly."},{"rating":"2","title":"A welcome update to FCE Express HD 3.0","review":"I have not had a great deal of time to delve into this application, but I can already tell that it has some major advantages over the earlier version. Most notably, the ability to keyframe effects is a huge advancement and helps propel this software well into the realm of professional video production. I'd also like to mention that the product came with a very interesting and helpful video tutorial of the typical FCE workflow - nice!All in all, I would recommend this product to anyone who currently uses the 3.0 release and wants to get additional bang for their buck. If you can find a good deal - like I did - on this update, then grab it up quick! It's not Final Cut Pro, of course, but it's a big step in that direction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I should have read other reviews before I purchased this item.

At all. I love this brand of stretched art canvas, as it's perfect for oil paints, but I've had much more success with the buyer FineArtStore. It's a little pricier, but take a look at some of their marked down items, and it's worth it to have the product you paid for in the ad.

After the first use I had hand-washed the platter and it was air drying in the rack. It was free-standing and no other item was touching it. Several hours later, while I was watching TV in the next room I heard a loud cracking sound and went into the kitchen to investigate. The 'platter' had split into two separate pieces. Knowing it was made of a glass material I had been handling it with kid gloves and keeping it separate from other items to avoid any type of offensive contact. This is very disappointing since I had received it Thursday (in the most extensive bubble wrap cocoon I have ever seen) and this was a Friday evening.

Even if you are already an entrepreneur this book contains many lessons and viewpoints that you could certainly put to good use in your own business operations.One of the best sources of information is someone who has already walked down the path you are embarking on.

That doesn't mean they are wrong, or flawed, though reasonable people would disagree about some of them. Instead, most suffer from being obvious. This would be acceptable, in my opinion, if this were a narrative of how he and his family and team built the company, which leads me to the second flaw: its structure. The book is structured as 80 \\"helpful hints,\\" each roughly 3 to 5 pages long, making it extremely disjointed.If you're a college student studying business, or somebody embarking on an entrepreneurial venture without any experience, this book could prove useful.

Then when one shifts finger positions with the same diminished chord shape, they can come to yet another group of chords based on the same idea. By just raising or lowering a 3rd, 5th or 7th note in each diminished shape, you derive at a M7, m7, Dom7 etc etc. I thought the way he laid out this idea was very useful to any guitarist from beginner to advanced. I would highly recommend this video to anyone especially a Pat Martino fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Information","review":"This video is a great insight into how a master of jazz guitar operates.

It also reclines in 3 positions which most strollers of this price do not. The only drawback is the small basket, but since I usually throw bags ove rthe handles, it is not a big problem for me. I have used many brands of strollers (Maclaren, Graco and Peg Prego) at various times in my kids lives and I think this Inglesia Swift is the best one around for a lightweight stroller.Alison from Connecticut"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not wheel properly","review":"I was surprised to see such high reviews. My stroller does not wheel properly, the front wheel constantly turns. It might be a factory defect.

Mine also arrived only wrapped in bubble wrap - NOT in a box --- which made me wonder if Amazon sent me the right item. I love Lenox but this is NOT a serving bowl and too expensive for cereal bowls.

It's mildly enlightening for charting a history of trucking, the development of the West, and the chronology of Kenworth models. The book is seriously lacking in depth, and comes across as advertisement frequently. A perfect \\"driver's lounge\\" book for dealers, and, of course, for display in the Kenworth lobby."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enjoyable start to a great trilogy","review":"While I enjoyed the Finder's Stone Trilogy very much, Azure Bonds did not immeadiately grab my enthusiasm.

At the very least you won't be disappointed you read the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old Friends","review":"This isn't a novel of cheesy stereotypes and weak spirited characters. I read this book in middle school and loved rereading it as an adult. It's a great escape. Azure Bonds can be read as a stand alone story, but it is the first of a trilogy. Kate Novak does a great job setting up story lines that she picks up throughout the trilogy and ties together fluently. This is the kind of book I like to give myself time to read vs interrupting repeatedly. The whole Forgotten Realms series is worth checking out. Characters in this story show up in books by other authors in the Realms sagas and vice versa. I highly recommend this story for anyone that enjoys adventure and has a healthy sense of humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Forgotten Realms","review":"I first read this back in 1989 when I was 10 and it still holds up surprisingly well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected.","review":"This tape isn't about bloopers, it's more of a highlight film.

They invite comparisons to Mickey Hart's recent music, early Santana and Rusted Root. \\"Arm Yourself With Love\\", complete with sitar, is one of the most vibrant and infectuous tunes of the year. The band will be doing the folk festival circuit this summer (we in the Philadelphia area get to see them twice, at Appel Farm and Bridgeton)--if they come to your hometown, try not to miss them. Their live show is more exciting than the discs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninvolving plot with little character development","review":"This book is a departure from the usual Main Line, PA setting, and it definitely loses something. You'd have to really like football to enjoy this book, and even then, there isn't much of a plot. The characters aren't developed enough to get a sense of who they are, so you really don't care about them. The plot is very weak and thin, and the ending just makes the reader glad that the book is over."},{"rating":"2","title":"My new kozy 122 heater","review":"I would recomend this heater to anyone looking for this type of heater.

I used to think it was me being the bad photographer or I chose the wrong type of film, but after reading the other reviews- it's the camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy!!!","review":"This camera seemed great at first. But a few months after I received this thing, it seemed like the very loud noises it makes were getting slower. I changed the batteries, thinking this would help, but this did no good. The mechanism covering the lens that you slide open and closed IS very breakable, as my lens rarely works. I took very good care of this camera, but the lens has a mind of its own. It zooms out only occasionally..., do not waste your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great.","review":"I recently bought this camera from Amazon and I've had nothing but disapointment. It's relatively easy to use, until you get your pictures back, the colors are all wrong, nothing is in focus, a lot of my pictures have come back blury. I've taken family trips and taken many photos of which never develop correctly, you can't take those kind of things back, so I'm left with nothing. It could be the film, it could be the processing but I've never had any trouble with those two factors until I've used this camera. I would not reccommend buying this camera and if anyone has any suggestions as to what type of camera I should try, I would greatly appreciate it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unhappy with this camera","review":".... It does take okay photos, but the flash mechanism functions very strangely. Even when fully charged, it sometimes does not go off - even when it should. This meant I had to take two of the same shot in order to guarantee I got it. It seems like if you don't press the button down hard enough, it takes the photo w/o the flash. The flash takes a few seconds to recharge, so you can't take a lot of photos close together. It also takes double A batteries, not a photo battery, and does not have an auto-rewind feature. The lens closing is also strange. In order to turn the camera off, you push the plastic lens cover against the side of the lens, which triggers the lens to retract fully. It seems to me that this is a very \\"breakable\\" way for it to work. I ended up returning this and buying a Canon Sure Shot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clunky, noisy but still okay","review":"This camera is really a mixed bag. I hate absolutely everything about it: too noisy, zoom too slow, unimpressive viewfinder, etc. But even as bad as this camera is, I took some really amazing pictures with it. You know the saying: It is a poor workman who blames his tools...I'm not saying that those who got bad pictures with it don't know how to take photos but I have to admit that out of the several hundreds of photos I took with it, only a few were really bad, and it's mostly because the setting was too dark (I mostly take outdoor photography and sunsets).I'm definitely looking for a new camera because this one is just too clunky, noisy, slow and [...] ugly. But it has served me well for a couple of years now and I'm happy with my photos, so in the end, that's what counts.3 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed shutterbug","review":"I enjoy taking lots of pictures, but I have had nothing but frustration after buying this camera. I kept thinking the batteries were dead, and the camera would freeze up and not perform any longer. I cannot tell you how many missed birthday, anniversary, and Christmas pictures since this camera came into my life. What a dog!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Like the other reviewers, I don't recommend this camera","review":"This camera is a pain in the butt to use. Like the other reviewers, I also have problems with the lens. With brand new batteries the thing will behave strangely to the point of wanting to throw it away. Then right when I am ready to do just that, it will work again. There is a sliding cover over the lens to protect it, which is great, except when you go to close it again because you have to push it into the lens barrel. Overall this camera feels very cheaply constructed. The image quality is average for a point and shoot, ranging from decent color and sharpness in perfect lighting, to washed out and blurring in every other situation. I recommend looking elsewhere. Even the Nikon FM10 which is an SLR with interchangable Nikkor lenses can be found used for $150."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good","review":"I have taken four or five rolls of photos and the colors are bad.

It had a much more engrossing storyline than the 2nd of the three as things went from bad to worse. There is death (which is sorely needed in the X-books) and some great and thoughtful team-ups.The characters are well developed. The only thing that holds this book back is it's cliche ending. Not that the good guys evetually win (that was a given) but the fact that the \\"battle continues,\\" I was hoping this would turn into Golden's version of the Fatal Attractions storyline of the comic books.For pure action and high stakes adventure; Santuary is by far the best of the bunch."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Ocean Apart.","review":"One of the best books in the Dear Canada series. I have read many Dear Canada books, and though not my favorite (quite close, though) this is just a wonderful book to read. It's realistic and easy to read and enjoy. It gives you a look at what it was actually like to live at that place and time, and it almost seemed as if you were there, as if you could picture those places in your mind. A must read Dear Canada book. I never expected it to be so good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenominal! Swell!!! A real family book!!!","review":"A perfect resource for millions of families! Long, long, overdue! Naturally the religious right will hate this book, so too bad. Single mothers have existed since the dawn of civilization and it's high time humanity got civilized enough to acknowledge them and pay tribute to the difficult jobs they do. This book is not afraid to talk back to books like \\"Fatherless America.\\" The only way to cut poverty among single moms is to provide women with the same opportunities as men in their career and to raise our girls to prepare to be self-supporting. The sixties and seventies brought on so many welcome, blessed changes for the better and may the 21st century continue in that direction! This book is a homing beacon to a better tomorrow!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The world's worst parenting book","review":"If you're a single mother who cares even one iota about raising your child into a competent, stable adult, avoid this book! Instead of focusing on how to face the challenges of single motherhood with compassion and wit, this book says your problems are just everyone else's fault. Worried about all the government studies that show the detrimental effects of bad single parenting? Engber says they're all myths and retorts ineffectually with nebulous feel-good quotes from a questionable \\"living under the patriarchy\\" study. Your baby's daddy wants custody? According to Engber, it's only be an evil ploy to avoid paying child support! If you want to be coddled into believing you're a (late) pioneer in creating a new (dysfunctional) social order, you'll love this book. If you actually want to be a good parent, you'll do far better with the American Academy of Pediatrics' books, and more importantly, real-life support from functional families and friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO USEFUL info, all oipinionated fulff!","review":"someone bought this for me, and as a single mom, when i needed encouragement, this book just sounded like a political fiction tooting its own platform's horn. tiny advise columns with no real life advice, no real sources for help or information either!! thats why i resold my copy. as a single mom, you face troubles that need solutions, not fluffy comments and skewed statistics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous - encouraging women to get themselves in financial trouble","review":"This book is giving out ideas that put women in financial jeopardy and have to rely on family and friends and the government to support them and bail them out.If a woman reads this book and decides to have a child they should sue the authors for a piece of the royalties to bail them out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Large and pretty","review":"I purchased this teakettle for my wife and she absolutely loved the scene and the relative weight of the appliance.

But I was very dissapointed that all the songs were remixes ( except for \\"War\\"). The songs rocked as originals. The remixes are okay, but \\"Another one bites the dust\\" was not intended to be a hip hop song, and it should remain a rock song. At least the unbutchered version of \\"War\\" was included or I would of lost all faith in our society."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for someone with a taste for music","review":"Even though the cover and the headings of the songs are a reminder of past hits, they are just the opposite. For example, the second song, \\"Another one bites the dust\\", says it WAS at one time performed by Queen, however, it has been REMIXED. This means that the uncreative people of the world can't think of any origional music themselves, so they take good songs and butcher them enough to make them sound like their own music, but there is still that HINT of the origionl. This is not what i would suggest is the \\"Music from the motion picture\\". It has the slightest twinge of the songs the titles suggest, but is covered over by fairly abrasive rap. It was not what i was expecting to get. This is the grossest rip-off and misrepresentation of music I have seen for a long time. BUYER BEWARE!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"long jams, spontaneity of youth","review":"I like this set, which is THE FIRST TWO CD's better than the following set of 3rd and 4th CD's. Sound quality has been well mastered, though its ancient source is apparent. Very loose, informal jam sessions-so if your a person who wants singles go elsewhere. Jazz fans may appreciate. Both releases sound like Jack Casady on bass.

The desert and candy sections are very good. I didn't like the breads very much, but the main course dishes have been great. I really like that the carbs are listed for each ingredient in the recipe. That is so useful when I change the amount of an ingredient in a recipe to lower the carb count or adjust the recipe to our tastes. I bought it for the baking ideas, but really like it for the other recipes.

As far I as know, these concerns aren't widely shared, and the resulting underuse of soy makes many of the recipes far less satisfactory than they would otherwise be, since soy flour is by far the best low carb substitute for wheat flour. To avoid soy, they use ingredients such as bran that really change the character of recipes like pizza dough,. I did learn a few tricks. such as using almond flour, but overall the recipes were diappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money","review":"I spent fourty-eight dollars buying all the odd ingredients for all the breads and desserts in this book (vital wheat gluten, whey soy powder, almond meal, etc.) and not a one of them were any good.

BOY, does Green's book drive that point home! But, where a better story teller might have turned an account like this into a character study of some doubtlessly fascinatinating individuals (the band and its hangers-on), Green provides a series of dull anecdotes that don't seem to go anywhere or offer any real insight into the main characters.

It doesn't dress up the rather US originated \\"stylised\\" view of the Clash from 1980-83 as almost the new wave successors to the Stones which may have resulted in gaining them many fans world wide but lost much of their original UK fan base. Instead it covers the essential 1977 to 1979 period and paints the band as human beings - Mick with his rock star aspirations and pretensions, Paul and Topper as jack the lads chasing women and wanting a laugh and Joe as the humanist who cares about the fans and who wants to know about what's going on in the world.RIP Joe - you died way too young.Johnny Green - you wrote a terrific book, thank youMartin..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciiiiiiiting","review":"Good read!

For what ever reason, these disks did not want to operate right in my player. I'm not sure if the copies were defective, or if it was just the DVR format, but the product was junk.

But if you are a fan, you will probably enjoy it very much. You also have to take it for what it is: a low budget 80's movie with some bad acting (particularly among the bit parts) and a lot of Penn & Teller specific jokes. If you can get past that, it is a fun movie. The film follows P&T through a series of practical jokes they play on each other, with the pranks becoming more and more serious until things get out of hand with an ending that is actually quite poignant and surprising. Along the way there are some stand out comic scenes, particularly P&T in the airport, a parody noir scene with Teller using nun-chucks and the bizarre ending. It is certainly an unusual movie. I would recommend it to any P&T fan, or anyone with a dark sense of humor and an appreciation for camp."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Bond Calendars","review":"The \\"Bond Girls 2006 Calendar: The Women of 007\\" is one of the better ones.

There is also a great color photograph of George Lazenby from ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE."},{"rating":"1","title":"What can you do?","review":"All I can say is that this is an infuriating DVD because I think it was produced incompetently, with no regard for true fans of Clash music but at the same time has some rare footage and complete songs that are hard to turn down. Arrrgghh! Somebody please re-release this collection properly!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another incomplete cash-grab...","review":"There's some great stuff here, to be sure, but VERY few complete performances. Songs get thru two verses, then get jammed into some lousy graphics or a voice-over that gives no real input into what we're seeing. Why cut off \\"White Man In Hammersmith\\" two lines from the end? Why not have the full performances from The Tomorrow Show instead of chopping them off right before the climax? There's already a perfectly good Clash documentary out there (\\"Westway To The World\\", highly recommended if you've not seen it), so the only real reason to pick this up is to see some new footage and hear how powerful the group's live performances were. And this doesn't achieve that. Hang on to your bootleg DVDs, your VHSs taped off late night TV, the clips downloaded from wherever... That's still (sadly) the only way to get the best of \\"the only band that matter\\".So in short, the tracklist looks good, but the product falls very flat. Only for the true completist. Sad, but true."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much new on this disc","review":"I also saw clips from this on PBS recently. And from what I saw there and in the tracklisting, most of these performances were already seen in \\"Rude Boy\\" and \\"The Essential Clash.\\"Where's the brilliant Saturday Night Live performances?? Why only one song from the \\"Fridays\\" show? They performed four. Same with the Elizabethan Suite. Only two of the four songs performed there are included. And \\"Tommy Gun\\" isn't even a live clip.Of course, any live footage from The Clash is going to be impressive, but I wish more new stuff was on tap here."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointing -- A missed opportunity","review":"Every time I see this DVD in my collection I get angry! What a missed opportunity. There is so much great footage available out there but this eagerly awaited live DVD under-delivers in three ways:1 - Almost all of the clips are available elsewhere (there's nothing really new)2 - Don Letts has the cheek to include his own Tommy Gun clip which is lip-sync video not a live track3 - The voice-over is patronizing, dumb and annoying.What would have been great would've been a DVD which took \\"Clash on Broadway\\" as an inspiration and delivered a compilation with the same depth and integrity as that CD boxed set.Instead we get this very lazy cash-in.A real missed opportunity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aw Man!","review":"I was excited about this and looked forward to it.But, why cut off songs?Anyone who is into this wants to see complete songs.If you are patient and want to start somewhere great, track down the trading community DVD \\"The Clash On TV Vol. 1\\", before you pick this up.Don, I know you don't want to hear this - why did you not follow the track flow of \\"The Clash On TV Vol. 1\\" and release it official?The whole thing works so great.Thanks for your hard work on this - I really wanted to recommend it.Look forward to your next project."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Bad...","review":"...the LIVE footage is great.

I was trying to talk myself out of Gen Surg... Ultimately, a book is not going to make the decision for you, but it is good to be informed and it helps to either reinforce what your gut instinct is telling you.

It's a bit american-centric but then again the book was written by americans. However, she still found the book extremely relevant in answering most, if not all, of her queries. The book is divided into all the varying specializations offered and each is specialization is written by a specialist in the particular field being discussed. All in all, a great deal for doctors-to-be and makes for an interesting read on a lazy sunday afternoon for the casual reader like me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, it is THE ultimate guide","review":"Actually, as its name implies.. This book is the ultimate guide in the process of choosing a specialty.Other books that come after it are anita tylor's \\"how choose a medical specialty\\", which is more to the point but gives little detail about each specialty.

The first was destroyed by fire. This was also the first book I bought to replace my previous library. Bullinger does such a fine job at defining every word of the New Testament. The definitions presented will often provide the serious student with glimpses of insight that they could not get with any other work I have seen. The only thing better, other than talking to the Lord himself, would be talking one-on-one to Bullinger himself. This is definitely a 5 star book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much about C programming, not enough about compression","review":"This book's target audience is the novice C programmer who needs to implement data compression of some kind. The authors go to great pains to explain exactly how the code works, but they don't do as good a job on the algorithms themselves. If you are a competent C programmer and/or have any formal training in algorithms, this is probably not the book for you, though it may be a good jumping-off point if it's the only book you can get your hands on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading ...","review":"The data compression topics are covered in the most light-handed way possible. The promos for the book advertise that the JPEG compression standard is \\"discussed\\", and that source code is provided ... but the source code provided is NOT a JPEG encoder/decoder, but rather an abstract Huffman Table/Quantization program that is ONE HUNDRED FRICKIN' PERCENT USELESS."},{"rating":"1","title":"give us more information","review":"searshing for books is very amazing in Amazone.com but i wish if we (customers )have more information about authers where do they teach; thier email andsome things like that so we could make our desecion"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"This video looks like a home video made by some proud mom who watched the ceremony!I was extremely disappointed in it (after having purchased The Silent Drill), and returned it to Amazon.com for a piddling $5.49 refund of the original $19.99 I paid!

My hope was to obtain a video which would be a good demonstration of techniques which were new to me or for new variations of standard physioball(swiss ball) activities. For this, I should have stayed with the first part of the video with the same title. No significantly new activities were shown in Part 2 which were not in Part 1. This being said, my bias is that I do have some familiarity with Mr. Chek and his teachings. Those unfamiliar with him and his methods should be pleasantly suprised at the variation of effective training possible. Finally, I enjoyed the backgrounds and the ability of the demonstrators, but the camera crew should have been more cognizant and remained out of view of each other. An otherwise professionally created video appears of lower quality from that alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saving Private Ryan CD","review":"For the price I paid and the quality of the product, there is no way you would go wrong. Love it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazon ,Go!","review":"Saving Private Ryan is a wonderful film, but the music from it is really something that comes along only once in a long while. It is superb music, and so perfectly suits the subject. It is brilliant music worthy of belonging to the classical era."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poignant and Powerful Williams' score","review":"John Williams' score for Saving Private Ryan is different from most war films. Yes there is action and the music reflects that, however most of the cd is filled with understated music that makes a powerful impact on the listener. Perhaps the most enjoyable tracks are the first and last called Hymn to the Fallen, which is a touching memorial to those who died both during D-Day & during World War II. It is these two tracks that are the most memorable on this cd. Overall, I have to say that I found this cd to be totally enjoyable and a touching tribute to both the fallen and the survivors."},{"rating":"2","title":"As raw and inspirational as the movie","review":"Saving Private Ryan is a masterpiece of music. John Williams has once again surprised me with his ability to create stirring music. This soundtrack is just as inspiring as the film. Williams uses restraint, and does not try to create your typical movie score. When you listen to the music, scenes from the movie flash back to you. Not only is Saving Private Ryan a great movie of courage, but the soundtrack is a reflection of the very things those American men fought for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Williams hauting score pefectly matches Spielberg's classic.","review":"John Williams' score for \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" is an excellent example of the phrase \\"less is more.\\" Much of the film is unscored, as the realistic sounds of battle are more than enough to overwhelm the audience. What music there is, though, beautifully pays tribute to those who sacrificed their lives for our freedom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting, powerful, haunting, beautiful, and breathtaking.","review":"I bought this CD as quickly as I could after seeing the movie. I heard bits and pieces of it in the film and I instantly fell in love with it. Once I bought it I was mesmerized with the quality of the score and sound of the musicians. After seeing a very sad film, I cried when I heard the score for the first time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good music that was overshadowed by the film.","review":"I've seen the movie a couple of times and I could not remember the soundtrack at all when I left the theater. The music serves its purpose as background but it certainly does not stand out during the picture. The film's visual imagery is so gripping that all other senses are cut off for fear of overload. Too bad, because the music, taken apart from the film is beautiful and can stand on its own. It is certainly not John Williams' best work, but I commend him for holding back and giving this movie, this period in time, and these noble men the quiet reverence that they deserve."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece","review":"John Williams has out done himself with this score. It is breathtaking and extremely haunting. \\"Hymn to the Fallen\\" is one of the most incredible pieces of music I have heard in a while. Recreates images of the movie in our mind and will touch you deeply. A must have for anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotionally draining","review":"I have been listening to music of all types and sounds for over 60 years. Never, have I been so emotionally moved by the sounds emanating from the orchestra and chorus. I recall D-Day vividly, but was never emotionally involved until seeing Spielberg's masterpiece and listening to John Williams incredibly moving symphonic poem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully reflective &#65533; haunting.","review":"I found John Williams score moving and very reflective. I also felt a strong Aaron Copland influence, particularly Aaron Copland's \\"Fanfare for the common man\\". In contrast to the horror of war so well captured by Steven Spielberg in this move, Williams' music reaches out both to the living and the dead who gave their lives so that others might live in freedom."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of John Williams' Best","review":"Never has a music score been more captivating than the one John Williams wrote for Saving Privite Ryan. This score has been,in my opinion, one of his best. As a great fan of John Williams I believe that he has accomplished more than any composer today. I look forward to hearing more of his music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sountrack","review":"I loved Saving Private Ryan. But without this music it is nothing. The music captures the setting and the mood of that scene. Without again it is nothing. Here are the songs:1. Hymn to the Fallen2. Revitisting Normandy3. Omaha Beach4. Finding Private Ryan5. Approaching the Enemy6. Defense Preparations7. Wade's Death8. High School Teacher9. Last Battle10. Hymn to the Fallen (Reprise)IF you like just music get this cd fast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected from a John Williams Score","review":"Saving Private Ryan is slow, somber, and serene. I expected big musical flourishes. The good tracks are the \\"Hymn To The Fallen\\", \\"Omaha Beach\\", \\"Defense Preparations\\", and \\"Hymn To The Fallen\\" reprise. This CD is good to listen to while you read a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing soundtrack for a powerful movie.","review":"Wow,What a majorly disappointing album.All the songs sound exactly the same, and I had to turn the speakers right up just to hear anything.Great movie, poor music. Well one track is good... and as they are all the same, I consider this album to be a single.Sigh..."},{"rating":"1","title":"John Williams' worst score","review":"I was amazed by the movie at first, but now realize that it was a conventional war movie with fairly good acting and an unexceptional plot. The score is also average. It's not subtle, and it's not understated. It's just quiet. Too quiet. You never notice it and it doesn't add to the movie at all. If you want to see what John Williams can do, check out Star Wars. If you want a good World War II soundtrack, look at The Thin Red Line, a far superior movie in every possible way. And Life is Beautiful and Shakespeare in Love both have far, far better scores well deserving of the Oscars they received."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good primer book for HLSL","review":"One of my friend recommended me to read this book for my primer book to learn HLSL.As a Chinese, I can follow the author with the help of Lingoes."},{"rating":"2","title":"recommended","review":"I just wanted to try these just because I guess.

In this aspect, I am satisfied with the perfomance.I have two complaints.The first is minor; the rim is very thick a akward to drink from.Because of the second, I no longer use it. The cup reeks of a foul, toxic-smelling odor that I just can't get past. It is one of odors where your brain says this is really bad stuff, consume it and die.

This was a period when the Russians engaged in a war on two fronts. To the West were the German crusaders and in the East were the Mongols.During this period, siege warfare became more important. The Russians improved their military both in size and quality. In technology, their equipment kept up with the West. The Russians quickly adopted crossbows and then guns. Slowly the Russians threw off the Mongols and established a state centered on Moscow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book full of assumptions","review":"This book is full of assumptions and generalizations. Some information is distorted. According to the logic of the writer over 90% of the population should be already dead from \\"addiction\\".

It is possible, but the writer doesn't make any notes about the men and women centered systems. The only system that is good is the female system."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent value for the price","review":"It's smaller, lighter, and relatively quieter than my previous el cheapo $19.95 compressor. Took a little less than a minute to add 5 psi to a 195-60R14 tire. The clamp/connector seems to be more sturdy than my other one.What I didn't like: The rubber air hose feels fragile (not braided like others) so be careful if you wind it around the unit. No storage for the power cord (I just wrap it around the unit). Also, it didn't have a fuse built into the 12V power plug, so you do need to give it a rest every now and then for the big jobs.

There is little to no really useful information here. You could probably compile something close to this book simply by culling facts, quotes and descriptions from college web sites. An actual college student's perspective would have been more useful than Asher's. If you purchase this, you will absolutely be taken aback by the sheer volume of useless filler.

There was no great revelation here for me.I can see, however, that people living this lifestyle or who are artists may enjoy the book more. There is a lot of banter about whether Banana Rose is motivated to paint or not..whether Gauguin can write songs or not..whether Anna can write stories or not...and so on."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing effort","review":"I loved Natalie Goldberg's books about writing, which is why I found the novel so disappointing. The style is odd; it feels both too intentional, and also too much like a stream-of-consciousness exercise. Either way, it is not a well-crafted novel. Some passages were beautiful, and I love any book that can take me back to New Mexico. But Goldberg had a wonderful subject and setting, and didn't do either justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all time favourites","review":"Banana Rose is one of those books that make me glad to know that writers like Natalie Goldberg are in the world. I first took this book out of the library, and immediately fell in love with it. I took it out of the library a few more times, and then finally got my own copy. Anytime I want to remember Taos, or the dreams of what could have been in a believable character's life - or in my own, for that matter - I read Banana Rose. The book just makes me feel better; no small feat in this world. Goldberg also does a good job of making all of the other characters - besides Banana Rose, Gauguin and Anna - very much alive. Blue is one of my favourites. I can \\"see\\" all these people. The book rambles a bit here and there, but it's worth hanging in through those parts, for the magic of the whole.I can't recommend this book highly enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"blah","review":"I agree with the reviewer who said, \\"This book reads like an adolescent's diary.\\" That's exactly what I told my husband.

This is a good book and a good story...not always moving in a straight line like some of the books I've read...but moving somewhere and noticing along the way some of the things we might have missed while we demanded a story that felt familiar. Whether this book is as good as her books on writing is kind of irrelevant...it stands on its own and deserves a place in my world, at least. Thankyou, Natalie. More, please. Long Quiet Highway is a great book, too...check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read Long Quiet Highway","review":"I love every other thing Natalie Goldberg has written, and while I can't say I loved this book, I find it compelling enough to read again and again. It's honest, sometimes too honest. It's the same essential story as Long Quiet Highway, except it's about the hippie chick Banana Rose/Nell, not the ever fascinating Natalie and her exploration into Buddhism. The characters are authentic and very real, but the basic lack of suspense and purpose in their lives and the plot make it sometimes difficult to stick with them, or sometimes even like them. But then, that's reality. Long Quiet Highway was the best book I read this year, but this is a nice, if not extraordinary, companion. This was one of her first books. I'd like to see what she could accomplish now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy writing from someone who's brilliant abt. writing","review":"I agree wholly with those who found this book a disappointment. It was laughably, appallingly bad --- self-indulgent, whiny, neither plot- nor character-driven. I just couldn't care about these flat people. Natalie G writes brilliantly about the process of writing; she should have followed her own advice, but also kicked in with some good hard self-editing. It's not that I don't know Taos or the Sixties, nor am I unsympathetic to books which probe the search for spiritual self and identity. I just found Banana Rose superficial and blah. I don't believe it ever would have been published without the authors' much-deserved success in other genres... and it shouldn't have been."},{"rating":"1","title":"A horrible disappointment!","review":"I just don't get how such an inspirational, amazingly talented writer such as Goldberg could possibly have written this nonsensical dribble! Goldberg's previous work --is not work--it is art, her prose and wisdom sparkling like jewels before you. If you have ever even considered being a writer--her books are a MUST. Simply put, she is my literary idol... And then we have this book--an incredibly horridly boring, long and tedious tale about NOTHING. It is more a tribute to hippie life and self indulgence where she goes on for ever about a feeling or a thought her character has. If you like to read chapter after chapter about the colors of the sky, or the feeling of peace on a country road--this may be for you. But for those of you who actually like a STORY with a PLOT that goes somewhere--RUN I say--this is NOT the book for you.

Could not feel the least bit sympathetic to any character no matter what her problem was and the mention of one socialite spending $10,000 on desiger duds for her young daughters just made me want to lose my lunch.

Frankly, I wish she hadn't written it. Like many other reviewers, I was reminded of books like Hollywood Wives in the first half. Parodies of lifestyles of the super-rich, like most chick lit, have about exhausted themselves. Without more, it's like been there, done that. The second half of the book, if anything, was worse. Either someone else finished it for her, or she decided that everything in life was pointless and was going to illustrate that through each of the characters. Since it was difficult to care much what happened to any of these characters in the first place, I skimmed the last few chapters. Satire is the dark side of humor. It should be witty and thought-provoking.

There were so many points, when reading it, that I wanted to just throw it in the wastebasket. The characters are so superficial and sterotypical that it made it impossible to get interested in any of them. The only mildly redeeming character is the main one, Frankie, a doctor, the only character with any depth. What made this book so unbelievably annoying was how married characters would split from each other. People would meet other people at a party, and 'Ta Dah', they would start living with that person--then, several chapters later, without any real discussion for the sake of the reader, get back together again.

I had tried a Linksys adapter, (I use a Linksys wirelss access point) but it did not work on this HP mini desktop (win XP). The PC also has a built-in wireless card which is pretty bad, won't hold a connection. Esp. if I don't broadcast SSID on the router. Whereas this D-Link, installation was super fast, and after connecting, I stopped broadcasting SSID. It stopped connecting, but I was quickly able to reconnect and since then its worked fine.

What you should know before you buy this CD, however, is that the narration and all of the songs on the CD are in English, with an occasional word of Spanish thrown in. At the end of each music track, there are a handful of words spoken in English, then repeated in Spanish (for example, at the end of the first track: Hello--Hola; Here I am--Aqui estoy). If you want to learn 20 words in Spanish, the bilingual aspect may have some appeal.I would give this CD zero stars, because I believe the \\"Spanish\\" label is misleading. However, I give it two stars for the music because, while I find the songs irritating, others might find them soothing for the baby.

How three veteran musicians could combine to produce such claptrap is something I just cannot quite understand.

'Riddim Section Kings' Sly and Robbie are way-more legend than substance and you are lucky if you can pick out a live-drum sound apart from the occasional lazy (but nice) big rimshot, and the bass lines a 10 year old could play - I mean come on guys liven it up a bit and shove in a bit more effort for crisakes.

You can't help but listen to the son of Blues Guitar Legand -Luther Allison- with out some hope. But in the case of this CD, it is the bottom of the barrel, plastic funk grooves, lyrics so shallow you could wade thru them, and a musical direction filled with lurid images and tired ideas.I don't wanna hear about your drinking problems, your girl troubles, or hopes for world peace...I wancha to rock out and bend the guitar strings, dude.I recall watching an 18 year old Bernard playing so proudly with his pops on stage at Biddy Mulligan's in Chicago in the 1980s. Luther would make rare visits back to Chicago from France, where Luther lived in exile because the Amercian audiences would not support blues in the 70s, 80s & 90s. This is Luther's legacy?It hurts me so, cause this CD is the pits. R.I.P Luther."},{"rating":"2","title":"Evolution of an artist","review":"I bought this CD several years ago at one of BA's shows. I was surprised when I got it home and found all the funk, However, having seen BA a few times, I knew that he could do more than the blues. Now this is one of my favorite cd's for the car, especially after a hard day at work, and my ipod for working out at the gym. If ever lost or damaged, I would replace it immediately. The funk with BA's unique vocals is unlike any other cd in my collection and I enjoy comparing and contrasting it with BA's earlier and later works. If you're looking for the blues that BA performs at blues festivals, don't buy it. If you're open to something with a wider focus with some blues thrown in, give it a chance. Maybe you will like it as much as I do."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real disappointment!","review":"Having seen Bernard Allison live on many different occations, I know him as a great blues/rock/funk player.

Code samples contain frequent errors, including this gem:void page_load(Object Sender, EventArgs e){Dim myDataSet as DataSet;... switching between language mid code-segment is obviously incorrect - and demonstrates to me that the author hasn't bothered to test the code he's written. This suspicion is further evidenced by his habit of leaving out crucial lines such as includes in other code segments.Add this to his amusingly frustrating behaviour of referring to important concepts in an introduction to a section then never elaborating, I can't help but think this entire book is some sick joke written out of some sort of psychosis he developed as a child.It says in the introduction the author lectures - I pity his students."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't purchase unless you use it on a computer","review":"I am soooo disappointed.

It's pretty sleazy of them to try to pass this off as something new. At least they could have added some extras, or expanded it. That said, there is some good stuff on here, but the concert material is mostly from the 80's, and it's so frustrating when they show only half of a vintage TV performance of \\"You Don't Have To Cry\\" with Neil Young-it is the best thing on there! Also, they could have included the full Woodstock performance, instead of only two songs.

Isn't it time to seaze repackaging and stick to re-releasing? Those are the questions one'd likely pose to RCA Victor. With everything he has been to America and the world to date - Elvis is the last artist on the roster to benefit from this 20-something ad-hoc tracks culled from dozen original sources. OK, it's a brilliant remaster to bring out yet new dynamics in \\"Are You Lonesome...\\" and the booklet texture feels silky stylish, but what's definitely missing is His singularity. Mundane \\"Surrender\\" takes place where fancier \\"Suspicion (torments my heart)\\" should've been. Few live recordings (again and umpteenth time!) virtually ruin the studio homogenity of this - predominantly studio - collection. No, it's not THAT bad. No one can take Elvis material and come up with an offhand product. But it stand no chance in the store against a \\"two Elvis albums on 1 CD\\" thing. Remaster or no remaster."},{"rating":"2","title":"good product at a great price","review":"It was a bit tricky to use at first, since I had no idea how to use it. Once I got some tips from some folks with experience, it was easy to use. Instructions for using it are too hard to explain in words, it would be better explained with a video. Perhaps the manufacturer has a YouTube video; if not, they should. It was a good purchase that I expect to be able to use for a long time.

If you put all 300 lbs of sand in it, it would spill over the sides when kids play in it. My only complaint is about the lid. It doesn't have any latches on it to secure it to the sandbox.

We filled it with 200 lbs of play sand for my 2 year old son to play in. I enjoy sitting on the sturdy claw seats and digging with him in the sand. This is the largest sandbox on the market. There is plenty of room for toys and 1-2 children to play in at once. The lid fits down on the box securly and has not blown off. It also keeps the sand clear of debris and dry.

Throughout the movie one of the main characters trespasses on private property, vandalizes a police car by spray painting the windows, steals parts to a bulldozer and then ends up abducting an adult to prevent the demolition of the lot on which the owls are living. In real life any person who did those types of things would be arrested but in the movie it is brushed off and the boy responsible is never even punished. On top of all this the owls are only shown a few times making you wonder why they didn't at least try to insert more footage of the owls since the title is called 'HOOT\\".

It's also written in a breezy yet crisp, clear, and professional manner. I think it goes a long way to putting readers at ease about the stress of photographic apprenticeship, a valuable service in itself.There were many things I learned, from a trick about monitoring flashes placed far from the camera, to better ways to cut seamless paper, to a clever idea for checking in luggage carts on flights.Matt's book should be part of any assistant's standard kit, along with the sharpies, scissors, and gaffers tape.

Theory is debatable of course, but Park does not develop a format in which to capture historical data. That is left to the reader.

The software package packaged with the book doesn't even recognize up and down arrow keys. You must turn off the numbers lock and use the old keypad arrows to make his software work.

I like my Cold Steel bokken, but it wouldn't be my first choice. I like it for it has a great shape and weight and it is indeed very strong. The only con behind this bokken, is it's flexibility. I can hold one end of the bokken in one hand, the other end in the other hand, and turn the straight bokken into a 'C' with a fair amount of pressure. Meaning when you are sparring, the tip tends to bend away from your opponent's sword, possibly giving the opponent enough room to slip his sword by.

The set comes with a video that is helpful and the block allows room for a few additional knives if you choose. These knives are GREAT!

The knives are a huge improvement, sharp, no flexing when cutting through hard items, and the set includes all the knives an amateur cook will use.However, the wood block is a different story. The holes go completely through the wood block and the steak knives are too long so that the tips (of the bottom row) extend past the block. This means they scratch the owner's counter and possibly dull the knife tips.

The concepts are fairly simple, and I don't mind simple concepts at this age as long as you add in some ideas/crafts/games to make it fun and interesting. None of the subjects go in depth enough to hold his attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Purell Sanitizing Hand Wipes....Awful!","review":"What a huge disappointment. I've used Purell before and their products have always seemed to be of very good quality. I have found the exception! The sanitizing hand wipes should ONLY be used as sandpaper!

They were a bit expensive, but well worth the extra money as the wipes were, at 8X6\\", large enough to be usable for a human's hands. The material was also durable and absorbent. Oh, how I wish I had bought several cases before they decided that they needed to destroy the quality by making them smaller and making the paper much worse, effectively rendering them useless. No way would I buy these things again. It's just sad, really. They've lost not only my business, but my respect as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"very poor \\"upgrade\\" of what was a good product","review":"The \\"brand new\\" Purell hand wipes are a terrible new version of what were great hand wipes previously made by Purell and Cojo. The previous wipes (with alcohol) were larger 6 X 8\\" soft waffle cloth that worked well for any cleanup or sanitizing. The old version no longer made or available were clothlike and could clean while sanitizing. The new version are smaller hard paper similar to wax paper with liquid dripping from the hard paper. It is useless in cleaning and very rough on any surface. It has NO absorbing properties. I would never buy again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor \\"Improvement\\" on a Once Excellent Product","review":"This product replaced a first rate product by Purell, the 8x6 size, which was excellent. The \\"improved\\" wipe is much smaller at the 5x7 size. It is very small, is rough to the skin, and dries out immediately Also, because the put the new one in a cheaper packet, the wipe often dries out before it can be used. This is a wretched product! The manufacturer would be wise to bring back the better quality product and discontinue THIS one, even if it does cost a bit more. These ones are virtually useless compared to the discontinued larger ones. Try to obtaine 8x6 size before they are no longer available. This decision by the manufacturer was pure craziness! Or try another brand.. This product isn't what you want. Trust me on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"dumping","review":"The product itself purell sanitizing hand wipes is an excellent product.Because this product, which used to be readily available at many locations is now hard to find, I bought six boxes of 100.

There is really no kung fu other than Whang In-sik tryign to put on his worst performance ever. Well it certainly wasn't his fault because he looked like Bruce Lee compared to everybody else in this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book in an excellent series","review":"I think this book is an excellent book that deals with teenagers growing up and the problems they face. There are so many such books out today, but unlike most, the Cedar River Daydreams series portrays young people turning to their faith in God to solve their problems. They face tragedy and heartache but always keep their faith in God. The teenagers have good strong values and morals and high standards. This is an excellent teen romance novel. In this particular book in the series, the main character, Lexi deals with her family becoming a foster family to a young girl her own age, which can be akward and difficult at this age. So as I stated already, this is and excellent book in an excellent series."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was very disappointed.","review":"Only about 1/3 monsters have an illustration, which is particularly disappointing since most of them are obscure monsters from (non-Greek) mythology whose names mean nothing to me. There aren't really any guidelines about the monsters' relative power either. Additionally, monsters you'd expect to find (goblins, orcs, minotaurs) are absent. On the whole, a very disappointing product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Steve Jackson I need a bestiary!!!","review":"When I bought this book,I was convicted that all my problems withmonsters are over...I was wrong.

Luckily, there is a the \\"Paulina's\\" Book store in Miami that has these books in stock and we all would buy their inventory and give them out to whomever God inspired us to give them to. In my opinion, the best way to read this book is to ask God to speak to you and run your finger across the book and open it whereever your finger stops. No matter what, the reflection will be exactly what you need to hear at that moment. Sometimes it scolds you, sometimes it rewards you etc. After a while you realize that God actually speaks through this book. If it costs $1000 it would be worth it. (Amazon don't get any ideas).

It will revolutionize your life if you seriously seek to pattern your life after Christ.

Then, Russia decides to go on a rampage throughout Europe when it can't feed its soldiers. These are among the implausible scenarios in this former SecDef's book. However, there is one scenario, although not completely thought out, that is plausible. A nuclear armed Iran. Other than that, this book is a waste of time.

What he advised Presendent Reagon was to cut and run. This event has emboldened the terror organizations like Al Qada. So in a way Mr. Weinberger is responsible for the deaths of 3,000 Americans in 9/11. This lousy book is a third rated fantacy by a guy who ought to work in Wall Street not in Pentagon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading statistics are stranger than fiction","review":"OK, firstly any book with an introduction by Margaret Thatcher is deeply suspicious, but Weinberger serves to justify my suspicions well enough on his own. Scenario planning is a fascinating field, to which Schwartz's \\"The Art of the Long View\\" is a superb introduction. But the Next War is a lie, based on false premises about US security needs and capabilities. Apparently the Former SecDef has forgotten that the US is the pre-eminent military power in the world, without any significant rivals. But no, apparently the excessive level of arms spending during the Cold War was reward enough in itself, and so there is no need to reduce arsenals, or even reduce the rate at which arsenals are expanded, now that we've won the Cold War.Somewhere in the first chapter you start to draw the line between a hawk and a deeply disturbed individual (would 'fascist' be too loaded to use here?).

Ships, after being hit by missiles or torpedoes, repeatedly \\"slip beneath the waves to lie upon the floor of the sea\\" (or something very similar). Navy pilots, we are expected to believe, think of their carrier-based fighters as \\"iron chariots.\\"There's more, much more, in fact too much to list here.

You find yourself asking questions about our military leadership and you will even start to look at the world in a different light.Weinberger's knowledge of military tactics, strategy and defense planning our unmatched and unparalleled. He was Secretary of Defense for over seven years. His knowledge of world politics is with a doubt superb.Most impressive is the ability to show the complexity of the situations and show how the United States armed forces are matched against the world.

The vocals tell current life problems and are punctuated with brass and guitar melodies that I find myself humming at work. Upon repeated listening I do not find any cuts to skip. Sometimes they sound like Stray Cats with better melodies, sometimes more aggressive. Some lyrics get simplistic but the instrumentation always carries through.

As former lead guitar player for Mellencamp, Larry Crane picks up where Mellencamp left off. (after Big Daddy) He took alot of the great sound and influence with him when he left the band.

He mixes the cd up with alot of different varieties, a love ballad called \\"I'll Still Love You\\" shows off Larry's acoustic guitar playing and craft for great melody. \\"Leave A Little Time\\" and \\"King of the Hill\\" rock out... you can hear the classic edgy guitar sounds that defined Mellencamp. If you like good rock from the heartland and are looking for something quality that is not billboard top-40 I suggest to you to add this one to your collection.

Also, this product claims to be dishwasher safe, however, when i pulled it out of the dishwasher the first time, it had already started to rust and dripped rusty water every where."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be very careful..","review":"This product was not the quality I expected.

I have no doubts that they will last a very long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice but not excellent","review":"This is a great little cheap set that is non stick and a great starter for new households. You absolutely cannot use metal on the pans (spatulas, knives etc) or you ruin the non-stick surface, but that's true for just about any pans. They tend to cook a little hot and I overcooked some cookies until I was used to it, but overall a great set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money and effort","review":"I was really excited about this set after all the wonderful reviews I read here on Amazon. But it just did not live up to it.My main problem is that everything burns in these. I am a beginner cook so I tend to follow the instructions in recipes very closely and the temperature/time written in recipes always yielded a burned product. I even decreased temperature and cut time by 25% and still cookies/cakes came out with a burnt bottom layer.After wasting a lot of food and time, I just gave up on this set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Non-stick Baking Items Not For The Long Haul","review":"I bought this baking set about six months ago. I have already thrown away the baking sheet and cake pans. The non-stick finish does not last--and I do know how to take care of pans with a non-stick finish. They also were not really non-stick! They are light weight and cheap. This is a problem with other, newer Calphalon pieces I have purchased over the past two years. I wish I returned this item early on. It was not worth the cheap price I paid."},{"rating":"2","title":"great bakeware","review":"This bakeware is exactly as described! As long as you hand wash them ( which is extremely easy ) the food just slides off the pans. I made a cake and it came out better than ever before, the omly thing I changed was the pans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product","review":"This set far exceeds my expectations. It has a nice heavy weight feel to it and the non-stick surfaces are wonderful. I bought 2 sets and can now make a 4-layer cake without having to cook my layers in 2 batches.

They are a much cheaper grade than the other Calphalon line, and do not even have their logo anywhere on the pans. I thought for sure they were cheap taiwan pans in a calphalon box.

In fact - the whole CD is great for interval training."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quiet perfection","review":"The other reviews as always are diverse in their opinions and both amusing and shocking. I wonder what they are hearing. Barenboim's Bach is subtle and understated in the most possibly positive sense. Is it possible to be more clear, concise and controlled? Many Chicagoans don't think much of him as a conductor, possibly because of his last name, but once you leave the city limits his reputation soars. I have plenty of other recordings I admire as well but Barenboim seems to me to have something special going on besides playing the notes well and as a listener I have to dig deeper or just let it insinuate itself into my brain. I have never heard Bach played so delicately. I confess to being hopelessly objective. I have no agendas. You might not like Bach played so quietly but I am enthralled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Domage.","review":"The sound quality is murky and Mr. Barenboim's playing murkier. I frankly don't understand, for example, how his temporary slow-down in the F-sharp minor fugue is anything but random, ridiculous, wrong. Certainly, some individual pieces impress, but on the whole, methinks Mr. Barenboim was off his game a bit here."},{"rating":"1","title":"stay away","review":"Though I have not heard this CD I have heard Mr. Baremboim playing WTC I live in the Konzerthaus in Vienna- the first concert where I went away during the break, and as a friend told I have not been the only one...Sometimes you have to decide:being an opera director,being a conductor,being a pianist.....Buy instead: Fellner, Gould, Fischer, Gulda,..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still the best Keneally.","review":"Keneally has made a lot of records, some great, some good, this one is by far the best.

They are so cute... very small... adjustable color display... easy to set. The only thing I don't like is that they both keep terrible time. They run very fast. Both of the two I bought gain almost ten minutes every six weeks, so I am constantly setting their time BACK for accuracy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Runs Fast","review":"My clock is not accurate. It runs fast. That's a fatal flaw for me. A clock that plugs into the house current should rarely need resetting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Runs really fast","review":"The clock has a lot of features that I love, it's a good size, lights up nicely, has a decent alarm and is easy to work, but it doesn't do the one job it's supposed to. I've only had the clock a week and it's already running about 4 minutes too fast. The clock isn't very useful to me if it can't keep time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not easy to use, or turn off","review":"Pros: Small sizeCons: Hard to remember how to set it or use it. Plus, it's impossible to turn it off without lifting up the top flap, which is hard to do when it's dark and you're sleepy. Also, it's hard to see the numbers during the day from various angles.Over all: I would not buy this item again. The main problem for me is that it's not easy to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great at first, broke after 3 weeks.","review":"This alarm clock was great while it lasted. It is very small, which is perfect, pretty loud, and has a great little design. I also really liked changing the colors when I got bored. Unfortunately, I went to set the alarm tonight and every switch now only allows me to set the date, which obviously does not work for an alarm. I tried and unplugging and re-plugging several times, but it still will only let me set the date on every setting/switch. I suppose I shouldn't have expected much from a $10 alarm clock :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"The mode is selected with a slider bar on the top (time set, alarm set, calendar set, etc). After about three weeks the only mode that would activate was \\"calendar set\\" no matter where the slider was placed. So, now I can't set the alarm to a new time. So, when you buy a low cost alarm, made in China, this is what you get - poor quality. My other minor complaint is that the display is really too bright for a dark room. The one plus is the battery backup which keeps the time so you don't have to reset the clock after a power outage."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the money","review":"I could have gotten a similar alarm clock for $1 at Ikea.

I actually have great vision but if it is placed anywhere but right next to my bed it is difficult to see the numbers. Not because the numbers are too small, but because the hard plastic casing it's in distorts the numbers. The numbers are decent sized but the whole clock is so small they had to curve the plastic and the shell of the clock so the numbers get fuzzy looking.It also is too light weight. It it feather light and so gets knocked around just touching the cord.The good featue about it is that you can change the color of the background and the numbers. But even given that nice feature, I'm going to have to buy another one because I don't want to be limited to keeping a digital clock on my night stand and strain to figure out the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke within 1 month","review":"Got this for my daughter, it broke within a month.

That is a very cool feature. The alarm clock went off when it was supposed to, but I could barely hear the alarm even when I was awake. This might be ok for light sleepers, but being a heavy sleeper, I need something that will bring me out of even the deepest of sleeps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dimensions are incorrect in product description, very bright","review":"The clock is 3 1/4 x 3 1/2 x 2 inches, not the size listed in the description. The display is very bright. Good if you want a clock that is also a night light, bad if you like a dark room to sleep in. If you turn off the multi-colored back light, you can not see the display at all. The controls are easy to figure out. The buttons are under a cover. With the cover closed, when you push the top, only the snooze button gets pushed, since it is right up against the cover. A good idea so you don't accidentally press something else while fumbling for the snooze button."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT FOR SNOOZERS","review":"Things I wish I had known about this product before purchase:- VERY BRIGHT!! It is so bright that I have to cover it at night! Would be great in a baby's room as a night light/clock- NOT FOR SNOOZERS!! The alarm will allow you to snooze 2 times and then it is just re-set for the next day. I have to be extra cautious and get up right away so I don't keep sleeping!!If these two things don't affect you, then it's an otherwise nice little clock. It's super small, the numbers can change to several different colors. I experimented and purple seems the least bright. Not bad for the price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Time runs fast. Need readjust every week.","review":"I bought this clock last year. Initially i loved it. You can change the displace background color and the numbers are large and easy to read.

The alarms clock is always 4 to 5 mins faster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine and Dandy","review":"The clock is smaller than Amazon says, true. It fits in the open palm, yes. Another reviewer measured and listed measurement. I think it's a nice size for a night table. Unobtrusive. The clock plugs in and has battery backup. The display is clear and not too bright. I almost didn't buy it because one reviewer said it was too bright. I didn't find that to be the case for me.The good thing is you can change the display to suit your brightness or color needs. Some displays, depending on the contrasting colors you select, might appear brighter. I'd never seen a clock that allowed you to choose from a range of display color. Nice.I found this to be a discreet, functional little clock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Runs Fast!","review":"I bought this clock at a local mass-merchandiser. It was pretty cheap and had a color changing feature, something I liked. In the end, I returned that clock because it ran fast. In the (less than) two months I've owned it, the clock went fast about 4 minutes... Can't have that happening on such a simple device."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst clock ever","review":"I had low expectations for this modest clock but it failed to achieve even those. The clock has a plastic front that reflects and diffuses light from the display. The result is that I can not read the time from most angles. Almost more trouble than it was worth to return it but I don't want to just chuck it. My recommendation - keep shopping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rhobust Dynamo","review":"The different colors for the display are beautiful. I took this clock apart and wired it to ring a 95 decimal fire bell when the alarm goes off. I have to admit I am impressed that the clock still works even after all my wiring mistakes. Now I have myself a good clock with a lowd alarm to wake me up. If I could change anything about it I'd like a programmable alarm duration and a programmable snooze feature. However, all things considered for the price I am happy with it. The buttons on top of the clock sometimes have to be pressed three times before it changes the display."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great service","review":"The alarm clock is very compact and can even be customized with different colors.

It came on time and as described in an original box.Pros: Bright light, on time clock, long cord, adequately loud alarm, battery powered so will keep time even if power goes offCons: Won't work without battery, the button is a little weird, basically you have to slide it over to turn the alarm on/off or set the time or alarm. You can't turn the alarm off till you open the top, it has a weird viewing angle, don't put it above your face cuz you won't be able to read it.

I returned it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short, Informative, and Funny","review":"That's the book I'm describing in my review title above, though it could apply to Sarah Vowell herself. This collection of essays is the best kind of historical musing; Sarah ties in the past with the present, and weaves her own biographical comedy around it all.Not only is this book relatively brief, but the essays are as well, so if you're looking for a quick chuckle and an \\"I didn't know that!\\" before bedtime, keep The Partly Cloudy Patriot on your nightstand.Also recommended:Assassination Vacation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forecast for Vowell is clear sailing...","review":"I've been a big fan of Vowell's since her extraordinary obit for Frank Sinatra in 1999 on Salon.com. Her last book of essays was wonderfully eclectic. This one is a bit less personal and more about history and America itself. Vowell shone in her autobiographical essays in Take the Cannoli. Here, she has very few missteps (the Tom Cruise essay was not something I fully got), but her Gettysburg address essay is outstanding. She is full of liberal politics, but also is NEVER predictable. She loves her country and writes movingly of her place in it. She is one of Generation X's finest spokespeople. Bless her and America."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Little Disappointed","review":"I have to admit that I was pretty disappointed. I love Sarah Vowell, but this wasn't her best. Still, it was better than some other commentaries out there, but just not as witty (but always just as insightful) as I would have expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be duped -- nothing original here","review":"There's nothing much going on here, so I'm surprised why so many people find this book so interesting. Vowell's no deep thinker and there's nothing particularly funny about what she says. This book comes off as the mildly entertaining musings of someone you might meet at a party -- but not particularly want to see again. (And, oddly, despite a claim to have an essay on Buffy the Vampire Slayer on the inside of the dust jacket, no such essay in in this volume.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"I just don't get it.","review":"I dont know why this book got so many good reviews. Some parts of the book are funny but for the most part I found it to be whiny and pointless. I thought I was getting a history book that may have some interesting stories in it. Instead I got a book on current events with the theme Republican's are evil. In general I found this book to be yucky and depressing.Also I think Sarah watches too many movies because every other page is a reference to one. Then she has to explain why the reference is significant and by the time she gets back to what she was talking about I found myself yearning for her to come to the point already. Then I discovered there really was no point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just awesome!","review":"I read a book review via the Onion about Sarah Vowel and I was interested. I had heard her before on NPR, but I didn't know she was an author also. I checked this out at the library and was absolutely surprised that this book was as clever and charming as all the reviews said.Just by the title I had thought that this was going to be another one of those boring political supposed-to-be-satire type books (a-la Al Franken), but it was hilarious with very intelligent themes. I couldn't wait to finish reading this book after the first couple of pages!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Power to nerds and history buffs!","review":"The Partly Cloudy Patriot is a collection of essays based (loosely) about Sarah Vowell's love of America and U.S. history. I felt like a kindred spirit when she talks about nerds, the nerd voice, and Thanksgiving when her parents visit NYC. I recommend the Audio version just to hear her unique voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"A unique collection","review":"I've taken a fancy to memoirs and essays lately, and Vowell's stands out among them - primarily because most of her essays have a political/patriotic/historical flavor to them. It's a refreshing change from the typical tales of love, work, and foibles that are in many memoirs."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Liberal Patriot","review":"Vowell's love for the left is trumped only by her love for civics. In this book she talks about her political ideas and how they've made her think or act in a way that seems remarkable when translated to the page. Vowell lives what seems like a rather ordinary life, but her writing style allows you to identify with her and want to read more. Maybe it's when she delves into her personal life that keeps me reading, or maybe it's because her politics so closely match my own. Either way I couldn't put this book down until I was finished, and even after that I was quoting it to friends and making them sit down and read passages, sections, or the whole book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Writing","review":"Sarah Vowell's collection of essays entitled Partly Cloudy Patriot is a refreshing commentary from a liberal who actually thinks and can express herself rationally without sounding argumentative. Her opinions are well laid-out and she refrains from any of the typical mud-slinging that one would come to expect from a book with a political bent, which actually makes it easier to think about the things she is saying rather than trying to defend or justify one's own opinions. Wonderfully written and thought provoking, I would recommend this to anyone who has an interest in recent political history but wants to avoid all of the childish bickering."},{"rating":"2","title":"great as audio book","review":"I've been listening to a lot of audiobooks lately to make the most of my long commute, and was pleased to find one that finally really embraced the format, rather than simply reading the book to me.

The words of the Declaration of Independence are so right and true that it seems like its poetry alone would have knocked King George III in the head.\\"Vowell's earlier work is a collection of essays about American life (contemporary and historical) told with humor, anger, enthusiasm, love, and passion. Deeply poignant and thought-provoking, Vowell writes about historical tourism, the Civil War and Lincoln, Salem, patriotism, football, holidays, American culture, families, nature, Roosevelt, and existentialism, all with a passionate, loving, and critical eye that is both engaging and humorous. Wonderful writer. Though, I have to say, I prefer her Wordy Shipmates and Assassination Vacation. Grade: A-"},{"rating":"1","title":"A mess overall","review":"This was almost a disappointment from the moment that I opened the product as one of the pens I received ran out of ink even before I had used it. Also, the picture on the cover shows the use of at least four varieties of beads but only three were given in the box. Once I began making the pens, the sticky tape that they gave to put on the pens became very hard to manage and wouldn't stick on to cover the entire pen. After that when I put the beads on the pen, most of them wouldn't stick on at all and the ones that did somewhat began to fall off.

The illustrations are excellent, if a little small and well integrated with the text. I particularly enjoyed the coverage of textiles and manuscripts. Besides covering the history and archeology of the ancient Copts, the coverage of current dogma and liturgy and the problems experienced by the Copts in modern Egypt gives the book an unusually rounded feel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing character","review":"I didn't like the main character. She was a product of a dysfunctional family with a tragic sexual abuse background. Every response she had in the storyline came from a totally unconvincing response to her childhood rape. All of this is glossed over with \\"down-home, back to your roots\\" platitudes. I found nothing quaint or folksy about any of the plot. Alma compromised what integrity she had in order to gain approval from her Appalacian kin. She was a victim and responded in kind which is all too typical of victims. This novel leads us to believe if one returns to their dysfunctional past, somehow it is freeing and we become better in the process. This book does prove that being a victim of rape does not make one noble."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother with this one","review":"I picked this up at a used book store, so luckily I didn't waste much money on it. What a stupid book this was! The characters were boring, the dialogue was hokey with words like \\"yonder\\" and \\"ye\\". And the title does not fit the book. There is no revenge. It's just about a woman who goes back to her hick home town to defend her brother. This book is a waste of time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hurl Away","review":"This was a pretty bad book. It was all so predictable and the strive for that down home flavor came out rather burnt. What's with all these lawyer books anyway but a response to what's popular these days. Fifteen years or so ago it was cop books, now anything with a scent of lawyers is a sell, and this one could've been better. Heck, I could write a dang lawyer book and I don' know nuttin'.

The first one got pitting on the cylinder rods and then the fluid got contaminated and the pump failed. So careful cleaning and maintenance are needed for long life. the original lasted 6 years with poor maintenance I will be more careful with this one. Other than that the system works very well, easy steering thoughout the range of motion. Installation was fairly simple because I was replacing an existing identical system but I think even for a first time installation it would be easy. The directions were accurate and straightforward and templates for mounting are supplied. I'm not crazy about the system not being able to maintain a constant center position on the steering wheel but i guess that is inherent in all hydraulic systems. Perhaps rubber boots to keep salt spray off of the cylinder rods would be a good addition to this otherwise very satisfactory kit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes the boat steering stable","review":"I installed the Baystar steering on my wellcraft 190 ccf. The old steering was a cable system and my 112 johnson was always ready to fold to either side if I let go of the wheel. The switch from manual to hydraulic has made it so that boating does not have to be a white-knuckle affair. Know the wife will drive it also. Steering from stop to stop seems to have increased from the old cable system and it is not as easy as an inboard/outboard power steering system but I really love this. I am about to buy another baystar setup for my little scout 155 cc sportfish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Party in a Cookbook","review":"For those of you that loved the Silver Palate or Back to Basics cookbooks, Celebrate is written by Sheila Lukins who co-wrote both of those cookbooks.This is a super fun cookbook that's organized by holiday - everything from Academy Award's night to Greek Easter to Celebrate a Promotion.

It reminded me of the Richard Brautigan books ( which I enjoyed) but with a twist of the disgusting and mundane. It seemed to be a disconnected stream of consciousness type of writing which I do not enjoy. It seemed to me like a disconnected soap opera with characters that were not likeable.

A screw goes through the back portion and screws into the speaker magnet, and the speaker/internal center holds the cone against the backing section. Well, its WEAK point is on the plastic by the screw head. It was broken off. They dont mate flat together, theres a gap. This gap allowed too much pressure and the center of backing cap broke.Tried super glueing it. Same results, it breaks again.

I wish Gilbert would do a second video on the battles it took to enforce the Brown v Board decision."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jin Rocks!","review":"Ahh yes another Jin masterpiece. This book really gets to the hart of the cultural and thus organizational differences between Japan and The United States. Jin paints for us an image of the Japan's staunch workforce and management system contrasted with the languid, melancholic, and jocular laborer of the U.S. Jin eventually concludes that while U.S. business has been dominate over the last 30 years it is only a matter of time before Japan (complete with arsenal of Godzilla, Mothra, Gamera, and Rodan) will soon raighn again. Great book for those who want to find out about culture. \\"Das a good point!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"All time favorite Christmas CD","review":"I actually had this CD previously, but during a move it went missing. I was absolutely thrilled when I found it on Amazon and was able to get a new copy. This is my All Time Favorite Christmas CD!

For Clay Aiken fans, this is a collector's item.I personally did not care for any of the other songs included on this CD, which is why I am giving it 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adequate","review":"This cd didn't do much for me. It has an interesting mix of performers but only a few songs really stood out.Rachael Yamagata's \\"The River\\" is probably my favorite song on the album. This up and coming singer really provided a beautiful version of this less familiar Christmas song.Dido's \\"Christmas Day\\" is another beautiful song. This seems to be the \\"go to\\" song for her when it comes to Christmas compilation albums, as I've heard it on other compilation albums.Jerry Camp gives a nice rendition of \\"O Come All Ye Faithful.\\" He does justice to this Christmas Classic.All in all this is not a bad album, it's just not that great either.

While Mathew Brady is the best known photographer of that time, there were others who also contributed to the permanent record. Andrew Russell was a photographer whose work dealt primarily with the Railroad Corps of the Union Army as it moved through Virginia. As such, his photos are rarely of battle scenes, they show us buildings, bridges, brestworks and encampments.While these photos lack the immediate power of battle scenes, they are very well done and show a different side of the war. The clarity and detail in the pictures are amazing, in some cases, you can even count the bricks on the sides of the buildings. Russell was an excellent photographer, his work is simple, yet powerful as it shows us the physical structure of two sides of a society at war with itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product for dry eyes","review":"I use Hypotears to counteract dry eyes on airplane flights, during the winter, when I am tired, or at bedtime. These are not for redness - those types of drops have some chemicals I'd rather not put into my eyes. These are simply saline drops, with a preservative.I have used some other brands of saline drops, but they made my eyes itch. Apparently I was allergic to the preservative they were using. I have never had this problem with Hypotears, so I seek them out, although they are sometimes hard to find. I recommend them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of the last chapter in this book!","review":"I read this book with my daughter until the last chapter, when the two sisters have a disturbing conversation about their neighbors. It seems the neighbors are not nice, but the sisters speak hatefully of them and even compare them to Hitler!(I am not kidding) For being written in 1994, this book is shocking in its wording, full of mean comments and giggles about others. For those with a strong value system and rules about how others are spoken of and treated, do not buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very different from what I normally read...","review":"I took this book out of the Library having never heard of the book or the author. I was unaware that this was a \\"christian\\" themed book and I couldn't have been more surprised at how much I enjoyed it.The book does center around God and faith, but the reader is not preached at. Instead we are allowed to decide for ourselves, based on the characters, their struggles and their own use of faith, how much we want to incorporate God into our lives.There are several unanswered questions in the book, (i.e. why did Stephen commit suicide, why does nine year old Catherine have so much knowledge of Catholic Saints), but this does not detract form the story in any way. I loved how all these characters grew to love, depend and have faith in each other.I think the book ended a little too soon. It should have ended with the birth of Julia's baby, hence the four star review, but I still highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a glorifying novel","review":"The author may be the son of Message-renowned Eugene Peterson, but Leif's novel is not a Christian novel. It deals with Christian themes, certainly, but let's look at the characters. The protagonist is agnostic and drinks heavily. Perry and Juliana have premarital sex and get pregnant, and this is considered fine. By marketing this novel as \\"Christian,\\" the publishing house has bought into American culture which states that the Bible is good but not absolute and certainly not worthy of talking about. Likewise, sin is acceptable and doesn't need to be dealt with.

Clay is such a polarizing character who hates all humans and has no redeeming qualities that i cant stop thinking while i read the book how stupid Elena is to be with him. He bit her on purpose while in werewolf form to make her like him because he hates all humans but wanted to be with her. Nothing romantic about that. He doesnt care if humans live or die. What a prince. Too douchey for me. Im out"},{"rating":"2","title":"Book 6 of 7","review":"I did not feel this was one of the best books in the series. I am very partial to her first two books, Bitten and Stolen. However, I appreciate how she carries her characters through all the books and creates new story lines for each of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reading with Tequila","review":"Broken was fantastic. Kelley Armstrong took the usual urban fantasy aspects of her Women of the Otherworld series and broadened them to include both time travel and historical fiction (in the form of Jack the Ripper). Elana's journey through pregnancy and the concerns she has feel very true to life. At least, as much as they can with her being a werewolf and all. I loved how Armstrong wrote a world her readers know well, after five previous series books, and managed to make it feel new and yet so comfortably familiar. The Women of the Otherworld series is always fun and quite enjoyable but Broken stands out and really shines."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good Elena and Clay story","review":"These are my two favorite characters in the Otherworld, about to expand as Elena is pregnant in this book. That still doesn't keep her from getting into trouble in the Otherworld. So off they go, on a quest to put an escaped Jack the Ripper back where he belongs. The whole werewolf crew is involved, along with Jamie and a new vampire character, Zoe. It's an entertaining book, but I find myself getting a little bored with this series. I guess, the first two books were just too good, cause since then, they just have lost something the first ones had. At any rate, I will probably finish the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Broke nothin","review":"Fabulous book. I love that they finally got to have kids after all this time. The end of the book is sweet and as always so is Clayton and Elena's romance. And, yet it is still full of action and adventure, even if Elena has to waddle through it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great addition to the series!!","review":"I read this book in one sitting. It was a very satisfying addition to the story which began in 'Bitten'. I am hoping that some of the other reviewers are wrong and there will be more books in this series. I would love for there to be a story about Jeremy and Jamie. Also, one of the reviewers below is wrong... there are now six books in the Woman of the Otherworld series: Bitten, Stolen, Dime Store Magic, Industrial Magic, Haunted and now Broken. I would recommend anyone to go out, buy the whole set and get started reading about this wonderful world."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 Star 2 many","review":"How can I help you with this review?

The lead character in her werewolf series, Elena, was great and I looked forward to another installment of her adventures.What 'Broken' turned out to be was a big disappointment. Elena went from an action heroine to an 'omigod I'm pregnant and have to clutch my stomach in worry every other page so the reader doesn't forget that fact!!!' wimp. Hence the title of my review. With 'Broken' Ms. Armstrong's werewolf series has in fact \\"jumped the shark\\".As for the plot itself, the combination of zombies and the appearance of Jack the Ripper through a portal in time just didn't do it for me.If you are diehard fan of the character and of the werewolf series then pick it up & read it. I hope a new book in her 'witch' series is forthcoming, but please can plot make sense and not revolve around Paige getting pregnant?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Presents it in an easy to learn format.....","review":"After my son read the section about germs we ran out of soap in our hand soap pumps in two days.

I am employed in the field of school social work and I parent a 9-year-old son with Asperger's Syndrome. I extracted the stories on the hygiene section and incorporated germy pictures to make my own version of social stories. It's easy to take for granted that your child already knows what it means to be dirty and carry germs, particularly when you have modelled good hygiene from the beginning. These stories explicitly explain the concepts in understandable and relatable terms. Within one week of reading these stories and incorporating a reward chart, my son went from rarely washing his hands to washing them appoximately five times each day. This book will grow with him. Upon mastery of the basic hygiene concepts, I plan to graduate to higher skills."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wanted more pictures to teach my daughter","review":"I guess I was expecting more when I ordered this book.

However, if you like music by the Drive-By Truckers, Uncle Tupelo, the Bottle Rockets, or even the Black Crowes I can tell you you'll love this. Fast-paced rockers that'll make you bang your head and sing along in the car, and some ballads that are real enough to appreciate as well. This is one of the top 5 cds in my collection, and probably the best Slobberbone album, with the possible exception of Crow Pot Pie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slobberbone Rules!","review":"This is one of my very favorite bands and albums. The band has evolved and improved quite a bit since their debut record \\"Crow Pot Pie\\". \\"Barrel Chested\\" shows a more mature and focused band. The lyrics are dark and thought provoking. The music is well arranged and crisply played. Particular favorites are Front Porch, Engine Joe, I'll be Damned, Get Gone Again and One Rung. There is certainly an alt. country edge to the record, but one thing you must remember about Slobberbone is that they are a ROCK band, and guitar rules the sound. I think Slobberbone is the best rock band in the country at this time. With influences as wide as Lynyrd Skynyrd to Neil Young, this is a band worthy of attention, and \\"Barrel Chested\\"an album worthy of your money. Buy it. Listen to it. Enjoy it again and again. See them live if you get a chance. You'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soundtrack to my life!!!","review":"I LOVE all of Slobberbones albums with a passion.

I enjoyed Susan Andersen's newest book, thought it isn't my favorite by her. It was exactly what I expect when I pick up one of her books.Jax Gallager is a professional poker player who gambled away a family heirloom that he doesn't have in his possession. It is a 1927 World Series baseball that his grandfather caught and had signed by the entire Yankees team. Unfortunately his father's widow, who he is convinced is a gold digger, has the ball. While the whole \\"she's a stripper, therefore a gold digger\\" cliche was happening, I really enjoyed the story. Treena was misunderstood, but really, would you expect anything else? I really enjoyed the story overall.The secondary characters added to the story, as did Treena's friend Carly. Andersen opened up for the sequel, which I'm sure will be Carly's story. I always find her characters so loveable.

Jimmy Guterman is a great reviewer when he's written for 100's of magazines in the past, but Im afraid he's NOT a very good author. He keeps diverting from the tracks, and not just by a little few yards. Im talking miles. Pages and pages where Sinead isnt mentioned at all. When he mentions someone who Sinead worked with or even just met one day, he goes on and on for the next 4 pages about THEIR work and this leads in turn to people that THEY worked with!!! He also finds it very hard to belive that there are those of us who PREFER 'The Lion & the Cobra' to 'I Do Not Want What I Havent Got'. Just to praise the 2nd album, he spends half the book slagging the debut album off! Its an annoying read, and I only made it from one cover to the other because its about Sinead . . . . .well SOME of its about Sinead."},{"rating":"1","title":"White Blanco Silgranit Sink","review":"The white Blanco Silgranit (silly granite) sink soaks up stains like a sponge. The description says non porous and the opposite is true. It soaks up stains like an old white sink from the 1950's that you have to clean constantly. I had no warning of this when researching and purchasing it. It is well installed underneath beautiful solid granite counter tops which was special cut to fit the sink. To remove and replace it would cost the price of a new sink and about 2 to 3 thousand dollars to remove and replace the granite. Unless you like scrubbing your sink daily with expensive special Blanco Silgrant cleanser daily, either get used to an ugly dirty looking stained sink or don't buy this product. I wrote Blanco and described the problem and got no response. I searched on line for an easy cleaner and found expensive cleanser equivalent to soft scrub. I am now hoping there is a product that can seal the surface so it won't be so labor intensive and ugly."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened? A dissapointing end to a great series.","review":"I am a great fan of the Eva series, but seriously, what were they thinking? The last video was an amazing disappointment which did nothing but rehash ideas already discussed in previous episodes. There was no closure whatsoever in this confusing and dissapointing finale. The only thing that saves this video is the alternate universe possibility scene where shinji is shown a world where he is not a Eva pilot, but even this is marred by obvious budget cuts. Pitiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"a thought provoking and surreal evangelion episode","review":"the interesting thing about this last episode is that it is nothing like the other episodes and could conceivably be done without. it is a very densely packed episode featuring deeply philosiphical ideas of \\"the self\\" and neediness and lonliness. quite intriguing, indeed. may be too much for the average animae fan, but can be quite thought provoking and rewarding if taken with an open mind. it's definitely the most rewarding and interesting animae i've ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the best episodes","review":"apart from the -could have been possible-other version of reality, 2 episodes to watch before a philosophie test, no more.

It's a really disappointing ending to an otherwise amasing series--fortunately all is not lost, because the creators knew that, and went on to make 'The End of Evangelion' movie, which sums everything up and finishes off the series for us. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The True Meaning of Evangelion","review":"This video is what the Evangelion Series is all about. To be sure its definetly not what you would expect after the 1st 24 episodes but it was still a great ending. For those of you who enjoyed the series for its deep psychological side, you'll love it. If not then you should still see it but the action/violence ending will be in the movie coming out this fall. This movie expressed Anno's(the director) true vision of Eva. It was never about the Eva's but about Shinji's growth into self-confidence. There's nothing else that can be said."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not on text....","review":"This review is not just to do with the video, but it is doing with the whole series. this series may simply rated NR by Amazon, but this series is much involved to a 18+ rating. Strictly for the fact it was so violent it was nearly taken off the air in Japan. (Pretty violent eh?) This series was drawn byu a man who was insane (Seriousely!) This show is not for those who do not beleive that we are all a dream (IMO). This show deals with suicide, insanity, and many other things that you'll need to find for yourself. The show is about 3 choosen children that pilot this suits called Eva's. These suits are almost real, all they need is a soul to pilot them. There were 26 episodes counting Death and Rebirth which were kind of like OAV I guess. To learn more you'll have to watch the show..Bye"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you are depressed, dont see this video","review":"As one of the guys who wrote a review said: The most depressing anime. That is complitely true. The last two episodes of Neon Genesis Evangelion are the most depressing, sad, and mental illness (Im not sure if this word is the right one) that exist. Episode 25 was a heavy beat that I reseived one night. The next night while watching episode 26, it left me a taste of crying, it made my mind just.....fall.

The fact of the matter is, Hideaki Anno admitted to having problems he was working through while making this series. My advice to you: pick up this strong psychological finale and just enjoy the visuals if you don't get the psychotics. Then go find a friend with bootlegs of the movies, because I promise you will understand nothing and be completely blown away by these episodes. (Unfortunately, the movies don't help much.) Just sit back and enjoy the ride."},{"rating":"1","title":"In a word... Disappointing","review":"Don't mistake me, I loved most everything about this series-- the characters, the twists and turns of the story, even the music (bought all THREE CD's). But I hated how it ended. It just failed to tied together everything that has been going on in the story. I saw this version of the ending, as well as the one called \\"Rebirth\\" (where Shinji spends most of his time screaming-- yes, screaming). Genesis 0:13 doesn't explain certain images-- like Katsugari's and Ritsuko's corpses (you'll see that in \\"Rebirth\\"). The Instrumentality Project sounds like pure BS. It merely accomplished what you'd hire a shrink for, so I was left wondering why they had to employ the Eva for it. Also you'll still be wondering how the \\"Second Impact\\" came about, where Yui Ikari is, what the point of SEELE was and what the Eva was really built for."},{"rating":"2","title":"This one really makes you think","review":"This is a great ending to the series. Most will be disappointed, it doesn't answer all thos quesstions about eva. But the thing is... eva isn't even what he series is about. This entire series is about the characters, and how they choose to live. Well mainly it is about shinji, in the first episode shinji was an insecure, kid who thought he had no use in life. The final episode is when shinji realizes that he can decide what his use is. So it basically the point of the series. To tell how Shinji finds himself. I think that the Eva's are just a like a helper. I could be wrong though But its still good. The last minutes are great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I LOVED the Eva series!!!. They had evrything!!. Action, mechs, love, a very intriguing storyline..but then it came Genesis 13. What a disappointing finale to such a great series!!. I was very ansious for this video to arrive. I mean, Genesis 12 leaved you wanting more!. It was boring. No wonder Gainax had to make 3 more movies to calm down the japanese fans!!. Buy it just for having the entire collection. But if you're not an Eva fan, just don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well...","review":"I honestly don't think the episodes should all be rated individually but I do think that this final episode (or at least the last of the ADV published NGE videos) was terrible! It was probably the worst conclusion to a great anime series that I could have expected. What you see on the cover of the box is about all there is to it inside. Basically the main characters are interviewed and they see what \\"could\\" have happened as an ending. It was full of \\"Everybody hates me!\\" being every other sentence out of the character's mouths... and compared to the rest of the series this was just a very poor episode. No real action or even continuation of the story, if Genesis 13 was never published, nobody would even miss it.I'm eagerly awaiting more from Manga Entertainment which is the publisher behind the upcoming Neon Genesis Evangelion: The Movie..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Final Genesis answers lots of questions, leaves others.","review":"Final Genesis shows you what happend to Shinji's dream-world after End of Evangelion.

No fighting, no EVAs, but Shinji finally accepts himself and realizes he deserves to live.

The hapless hero is unconvincing - one moment all rugged virility, the next a wimpering wuss - and the dialog is often dreadful. As for the implausible plot twists noted by other reviewers, either you accept them as essential to the fable-like atmosphere of the book, or you regret that Gale finally resorts to a sitcom story line to pull it all together. But despite all its failings, I can't help but give Gale at least two stars for some writing that's good enough to keep me on his side - hoping in vain that in the end he'll really pull it off.

The 190-page book could have been cut in half; only that much is actually about John Denver. Collis leads the reader to believe the book is a biography about Denver, when in fact he jumps between issues and events surrounding Denver's life. He accuses him of being a \\"wife-beater\\", and does give an example, albeit one brief example towards the back of his book. Collis is more interested in telling us about his favorite music stars of the time than giving any information about the artist the book proclaims to be about.As someone said before, if you want to know about Denver, read his autobiography \\"Take Me Home\\", rather than wasting your precious time and money on Collis' biography. There's also a movie that made a better impression on me than this attempt to describe Denver's life, \\"Take Me Home: The John Denver Story\\". Don't make the same mistake I did by reading this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading title and description","review":"Unlike many of the other reviewers, I am not such a dyed-in-the-wool Denver fan that I take this book's shortcomings personally. For what it is, it's fine. But this is NOT a biography. It's more like a college term paper. The author conducts a 175 page music review, focusing on quotes from others, articles in music magazines, and demographic data available to anyone. It is misrepresented as a biography. There is almost no information here about the man or his personal or inner life, his relationships with others, his struggles or victories. It was SO BORING and superficial; a 5 page magazine article could have done the same thing and done it more effectively. A total waste of paper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame, Shame,Shame","review":"Pass this one up, folks.In my opinion,this is a very mean spirited piece of work.John Denver was a remarkable talent and a committed humanitarian. he deserves better than this.To leave readers with the impression that he was a wife beating drunk is unforgivable."},{"rating":"1","title":"John Denver Mother Nature's Son","review":"I was disappointed in this book. The dust cover was misleading and sensationalized minor incidents that really had nothing to do with the story. The author went off on tangents that I had a difficult time putting together with John's life. He might better have titled it Musical Timeline of John Denver. I was looking for information that I may not have garnered from \\" Take Me Home\\" and various articles I have read. I did like that the author's research made him rethink his original premise. I did like his memorial section at the last. I would not recommend this book as a straight biography."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless and self-absorbed","review":"It is clear that this author wasn't all that interested in John Denver, with so many meaningless tangents and so little new information. He doesn't add to our knowledge or insights about John Denver, and his treatment of John's personal life was superficial and indicated no research with people who actually knew him. His \\"analysis\\" of John's psychological state was speculative and lazy. You could find everything he had to say on a web site somewhere. And his snarky musical criticism was just irritating. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than one star","review":"Do not expect to find much out about John Denver in this book. The author should stick to a subject he likes instead of someone he so obviously doesn't. Fan or not this book is beyond boring and uninformative when it comes to his main subject.

The author was not a fan of John Denver's as you discover while you are reading his book. It seem to me that he did not dwell on the good that John did while he was alive. He jumped around also and was confusing and hard to keep up with him. Why bring up the troubles John had after his death. His fans want to remember him for his wonderful music and all the good work he did for the Wildlife Conservation and how his music brought the world together as one. John Denver fans will never forget him and the impact he had in all our lives. This author didn't even know John.

The thumb grooves and ridges on the back of the blade make this knife comfortable to hold in any way you will need to when using it. If you're looking for an affordable hunting knife that will get the job done, this is it. Best of all with the fixed blade, this thing is very easy to clean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too big!","review":"I had to return these because they were too big.

I would love to provide more information, unfortunately the liner notes aren't of much help on this one. The first track \\"Por Que Sera\\" really sets the tone with an excellent brass that adds swing to this uptempo song. A real gem that makes me wonder why it is not included in other of his greatest hits albums. You should know that the album does include a bolero \\"Para Ti\\" and \\"Juramento\\" which has more of a march style. As do countless other of his albums, \\"El Manicero\\" and \\"Mata Siguaraya\\" (both excellent tracks by the way) are included. Overall a very good album by D'Leon although I will admit has done better. The first track makes the album worth buying for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great beginning for slobberbone","review":"I'm pretty new to these guys, although i do have their four releases.

I was concerned when I saw the other review and then noticed that the bottle's packaging did not indicate otherwise, and so I called Avent and read them the serial number. I should have noticed this before buying the item, but I assumed the bottle was because Avent has only made BPA-free bottles since 2008 (my son was born in 2009).

This time, however, the focus is not on Mars, but the gray shores of Luna. More alien artifacts are discovered, answering many questions from the previous book...and leaving you with many more. The combat scenes are just as good as, if not better than, the last book. Douglas also manages to use several characters from the previous book, which gives a greater connection to the reader than if he were to start with a clean slate.Once again, there are a few cultural stereotypes that Douglas sticks in that the book could do without. Don't let that stop you from picking it up though.

It is possible to adjust it so that your hands are in a very comfortable position. The problem is that the action on the right side of the keyboard is terrible - the keys require _way_ too much travel to activate, and the action on the right side is much, much too stiff. Not only is there too much travel for each key, unless the keys are pressed down at an angle exactly pependicular to the keyboard, they won't go down. So my hands ended up more tired than they would have been on my old keyboard. I had to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Product, but poor (no) service after it broke!","review":"I have used the black Goldtouch keyboard for about a year. It is an awesome keyboard, and I have saved my wrists because of it. However, it recently broke during my conference deadline (as a computer scientist, a keyboard is one's life!). I emailed their support, and they do not have an option to repair or replace a faulty keyboard (even if I would pay for the fix). Sadly, I have bought a second Goldtouch, but I really really wish they would have made my $120 purchase worth it.

My first horror was to discover that it does NOT have a USB port for the mouse on the keyboard itself. As the MAC only has 3 USB ports, my hub is full and I don't need one more thing to plug into it.Secondly, it doesn't sit upright as shown. It adjusts awkwardly and sits flat. Beware also, Goldtouch's RMA form states: A 15% restocking fee will apply to unopened product. A 50% restocking fee will apply to openedproduct. I don't know how they expect you to know if you'll like it by looking at the box.Pass on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blu-ray nicely mastered, both image and audio, but revealing of deficiencies in the original negative.","review":"An image so vivid that unlike any previous blu-ray I have purchased to date, I had to dumb-down my monitor from \\"vivid\\" to \\"standard\\" to compensate, which is a good thing as the reduction in contrast subdues the occasional film grain which is evident quite often but short-lived, such as when Director Rush presumably zoomed in on the film negative for a close-up in post-production as an afterthought rather than having done so 'in camera' during the shoot. Though the original mix was mono, discrete surround sounds are quite evident from time to time. After enduring the poor print quality of the laserdisc pressing it's good to see Rush's beloved film get its due on blu-ray, both of which are well worth the upgrade if you're a big fan like myself, but if you're not and already have the two-disc Limited Edition, you won't find enough of a difference to warrant this upgrade to blu-ray."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the bargain you imagine","review":"The price compared to the bookstore is great, but after purchasing and taking to class I realize why.

Works as advertised: keeps ones eyes lubricated all night. One of my eyes has a damaged skin layer over the cornea, which happened years ago but only started bothering me when I moved to a climate that dries out the eyes. I used GenTeal Gel before this, but it didn't last all night. They are different chemical compounds, the gel being carbomer 980 and hypromellose in a base; whereas this Ointment is a simple mix of mineral oil and white petrolatum. One could even make it up himself from drugstore items, but, then, it wouldn't be sterile! The only con to this is that it affects your vision; you can't see clearly when it's in your eye. No problem if you're sleeping.Thus, for night-time relief, this is what you want."},{"rating":"2","title":"only type i found to work","review":"If you have severe eye pain from mold or other irritants this is the best. Even the gel type didn't work for me. I place this between my eye and lid and it gives instant relief. I think for what it is the price is too high. The main I ingredient is petroleum jelly, you may be able to rub that is your eye for the same relief. I wouldn't do it but it seems logical since that's what is in this. You only get a tiny amount though so for the price it could be more. I dont see any other ingredient or reason it cost so much. But it works. Other brands do work just as well though. Currently im using refresh pm and it works every bit as good. And cheap at target. So main point is if you have severe eye pain get the night time eye ointment and you'll get much better relief."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I bought this product because I love the gel so much, but this nightime ointment sucks.

This book is a realistic fiction book. Izzy, Willy-Nilly is a very realistic book that could happen to anyone. This book shows how a 15 year old girl copes with with the worst thing that could happen. I recommend this for girls from 13 to 18 years of age. It all starts when Izzy is in a car wreck because her date was drunk. She severely hurts her leg to the point it has to be amputated. She struggles through therapy, friendships, school, and cheerleading. Throughout this book it shows how she copes with her life.I think this book was very good. I love how Cyntia showed Izzy's emotions. It's basically based on a girls life as she grows up and moves on. It's a book that is one of my favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get into the life of Izzy","review":"Izzy, Willy-Nilly is a very interesting book. It is about a girl who was in a car accident with a drunk driver who just happened to be her date that evening. So she had to get her leg amputated. Izzy tells about her time at the hospital and when she arrives back home. Before the accident she feels like she doesn't want to do anything, and after the accident when she is incapable to do anything, she wants to get out and have fun. This book teaches you a lesson that you should do what you want to do in life, because there may not be another time to do it. I liked the book, but I hated how she would just keep on talking about the same thing over and over again. Other than that, I enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Minor spoiler....","review":"Izzy assumes that she \\"won't be having boyfriends anymore.\\" Huh? I hope that was meant to be only a thought in Izzy's mind and not an assumption that amputees do not date."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Greatest Book","review":"Izzy Willy-Nilly is a slow moving book and a boring one, I could fall asleep reading it. I hate how it tells what she does everyday when she does the exact same thing. It would have been better if the author would have made the book move faster, more details, and made it more exciting. Also in the book she repeats the same things. I would recommemd this book to anyone who like slow moving books and dull ones too."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible.","review":"save yourself. don't read this book. i would rather jump in the showers with sanduski and michael jackson than read another paragraph of this"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"My son was required to read this book for school. Although it discusses complex themes and human insecurities... all too common emotions, it wasn't an enjoyable read for a teenage boy. He read it because it was required and he complained because the main character whines and complains constantly..... too much whining going on.Unless your child has to read this for school.... skip it.

Before the accident, she was known as a pretty and semi-popular cheerleader, along with her three friends. None of them imagined anything would ever change. But when Izzy accepted a date with Marcus, a handsome senior, and then drove home with him after he'd been drinking, her life changed forever. Now her friends are uncomfortable around her and spend less and less time visiting the hospital. Instead, Rosamunde, an intelligent, eccentric girl her age and someone she's always considered a weird outcast, begins to visit. Rosamunde's world view is drastically different from anything Izzy has considered before, and she helps Izzy free herself of self-pity and blame. Eventually the two girls become friends. With the help of Rosamunde and her family, Izzy begins to heal."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is about knowing who your real friends are.","review":"Izzy the main character of the book has paid many cosucenses for being in a car with a drunck person.{Marco}She finally realizes who her real friends are.By the way they have been treating her after she lost her leg.

I liked because the character developed nicely from beginning to end. In the begining after the accident Izzy was so depressed, but as she became better friends with Wilemena, she recovers quicker.

She is just a shallow and popular cheerleader type until she gets into a car accident and must have a leg amputated. Suddenly, all her groovy friends stop calling and she is no longer BWOC. Because none of the cool kids will hang with her because of the stigma of her disability, she is sort of forced through her new associations with more down to earth people to be less shallow and more mature. I was just not that impressed with her growth or this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much DETAIL!!!!!!","review":"This book was a required summer reading book for my upcoming school year.

It captures the story to never want you to put the book down! It is a sad book about a girl who got in a drunck Driver crash and got her leg amputaded.

I recomend this book to those who enjoy reading spirtitual books."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book for all teens!","review":"Izzy Willy Nilly is a great book that brings a lot of attention to the subjects of choices and friendship.When Izzy, the all around popular, cheerleader,everyone loves, type of girl, gets asked out by a popular senior Marco, she accepts not knowing the consequences. Izzy and Marco go to a party and Marco drinks a little too much. On the way home they hit a tree. Marco gets minor injuries, but Izzy's leg is majorly punctured and must be cut off. Izzy who once was popular,is now the topic of everyone's conversation. She has to learn to deal with the plight of now being a teen age outcast."},{"rating":"2","title":"An incredible Story","review":"I loved this book!I think most people like it for all the diffilculties Izzy faces and eventually over comes but what I epecially like is how she evolves as a person too. Before the accident she's a little bland, a little to shallow. After the accident she relizes how superficial her freinds are and learns to stick up for herself too. A must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"not real","review":"I read this book a long time ago, when I was 12, right after I lost my leg. I didn't finish it because, despite having just experienced losing my leg, I could not relate in the least to Izzy. I felt like the author was just making up how she thought a person would respond to that trauma without doing any research. It's hard to write about an experience you haven't had, and this book felt fake and patronizing. Somebody gave it to me with good intentions, but it just made me angry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh","review":"Not nearly as good as it sounded to me.

The size is surprisingly small in an adult's hands but for my 4 year old, he is able to throw is nicely. I would say its about the same size as a NERF football.

He loves it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chinese","review":"When I read the product description of this football, it was described as the same as it's full size brother, even the \\"same quality leather\\", it's not leather, only a smaller version. Earlier I had seen a video on You Tube on how a football was made. It was shot in the Wilson factory in Ohio and the manager stated that all footballs that have the Wilson name on them, are only made in that factory. So I took it for granted that this was an American made football. So I was crushed when I saw the made in China stamp on the ball. Therefore I felt misled and therefore the one star rating. If it wasn't for that, this is a great little football."},{"rating":"2","title":"THRUST Review","review":"Great 80's fusion.

Of course, I wanted to know the film behind the music. Boy, was I knocked out. I love the way this picture looks, sounds and feels. It's like a time capsule of late 1960s -- the absurd and lovely modern art, Bacharach tunes (and Hamlisch score), amplified fashion, and a swinging social scene. But at heart, its romantic story is timeless, as are the performances. I never get tired of watching this one. I only hope that some day soon they release it on DVD.

The neighbor kids came running over and wanted a turn as well. The educational value is chiefly in the enrichment of imagination, but it also encourages a bond between the child and adult, as the child emulates the adult's work.

I'm all for buying bulk when it comes to office items like this, but apparently a dollar will only take you so far. I'd recommend buying other pens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exploded in my purse and ruined smartphone!","review":"One of these pens exploded in my purse and got all over my white Blackberry. The ink is impossible to remove. I could have traded my phone in or sold it for about $200 and was getting ready to do so when this happened. Now my phone is worthless. Thanks, Bic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nusi","review":"It's a really great product, easy to use, has a nice blue ink. I'm happy to find it. Got the product in a couple of days after I placed my order. I couldn't be happier. Easy and fast service. Thank you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE","review":"I needed red pens for work. I kept a couple of them in my bag. They write as if they are already worn out and the ink is not as dark. These pens are just awful. One minute they will work, the next it will be dead. Almost every single one I have used so far have exploded; luckily they red ink did not leak out, just into the clear plastic part. Even though these pens were cheap, I am still mad that they were all bad. WASTE OF MONEY, don't bother buying"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, Solid, Pens.","review":"What can I say? They're pens. They write on things. And these specific ones are black. I have known BIC my whole life. Anytime I asked my mother for a pen as a child, it would be a BIC. This company has been around for a while, and I trust them. If this pen were to be entered in a pen competition, it would win! Hands down. LOL. So open your wallets and make the purchase! You will not regret it. I suppose any color will do, but I prefer a nice sleek black."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I had to return this item when many, many of the pens were dried out and had faint, fading ink. These were quickly replaced, but I am still have trouble with many pens leaking, many dried out, and writing with pale light blue ink rather than the medium point darker blue ink I have come to expect from using bic pens since the 1970s. Time to look for a new blue pen, I guess. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money","review":"Ad does not match the product you will receive. What you receive is BIC Cristal pens, with octagonal handles, not round. They are not the Stic model. The pens write like they are old and dried out. The pens write very light, ink flows poorly. They just don't work. I discarded them. You can get the real BIC Ultra Round Stic Grip Med point at Staples for $2.49/dozen."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most simple and complete guide about sex and life","review":"I love this book because it is one of most complete about this subject and also one of the most simple to understand. I like the way in which dr. Ruth Westheimer explain things about sex which are not easy to understand. I think that it is a very good job."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you need a book this simple, you may be in trouble","review":"If you are interested in this book to learn more about sex, then you probably won't learn anything more because you already know what it contains. The material is very basic (and while it's good to state the basics there is also a place for what comes after the basics, and it isn't included here).If you don't expect much then this won't disappoint you, but it won't pleasently surprise you either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good (actually, it's 3.5 stars, but I'll round it up.)","review":"Yes.. it's good. Not bad, not great, but good. I'm giving 3 stars because I don't think they have found their own sound. Being from New Jersey, they will get TONS of comparisons with Saves the Day and Thursday. However, they do sound like Saves The Day a little bit. I heard \\"K Consumption\\" and liked it, and that ended up being my favorite song on the cd. There are some other good songs like \\"How To Say This\\", and \\"The Woods Are Burning.\\" Good cd, I would reccomend it to fans of Saves the Day."},{"rating":"2","title":"The girl can sing!","review":"I knew Karen as a girl and had no idea she could sing. Imagine my surpise when I listened to her CD and discovered what a wonderful voice she has. Jazz is not my favorite type of music but after listening to her sing I have discovered that it is one of them now. I wish she had more CD's out. I know I am going to order this CD and recommend to all our friends from high school and all my friends who love jazz. Way to go Karen Shane!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is a Joy","review":"I love this CD! Karen Shane's debut release hits the target. She's a great talent who does it all from love songs to Latin jazz rhythms, and even an original of her own. Ms. Shane is a gifted jazz singer with a rich, mellow voice, who has the knack of being able to interpret the lyrics into real meaning and feeling."},{"rating":"1","title":"1970s softcore porn","review":"This review is for the Amazon VOD rental of this film. This is a softcore porn moviefrom 1975. This film would be considered very mild on today's cable TV stations. RebeccaBrooks and Jody Ray are both very nice looking women and show a lot of skin. The plotis a rich man's daughter is kidnapped and introduced into the sexual world by hercaptors. This film has been edited quite a bit from the original and the transferplays like a third generation VHS tape recording. Rebecca Brooks has a few other filmson Amazon and all of them are much better than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as it could be...","review":"Looks like some of the sex scenes were edited to keep it softcore.

However, what we have here is a reprint of the original translation of Mommsen's first volume on the early history of Rome. It was undertaken by a Scottish Devine somewhere in the late 19th Century. This volume is uniformly considered the least important of the three, and the translation is awkward, dated, occassionally wrong headed and far surpassed by later work. At best this book is a very expensive item of antiquarian interest only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Again!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Do not buy this book until you read my review of a previous reprint identical to this one which also received one star from me for cause.

Sons is a novel for the serious romance reader who wants a new twist to a favorite subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"some good information, but better avilable elsewhere","review":"This book has some solid information, but it is all available elsewhere except some studies on Point & Figure profitability. However, tests in 2002 by djbaker suggested that the profitability of these signals had broken down, so i'm not sure how useful this book really is. Like the previous reviewer, i'd recommend reading the Dorsey book first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong device sent...beware of this seller!","review":"I bought the collated screwdriver, but received a corded screwdriver instead...tried to return the product, but this seller doesn't return emails or phone calls.

As each new letter is introduced, we love \\"searching\\" for the animal that matches it. Just a beautiful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"This book is so fun to read and a very good educational tool too. The reader finds animals that begin with the letter the page is focusing on. There are other animals too from the previous letters so it makes it fun to find the new animals. Very clever and well done. Thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice children's book!","review":"My 2-year old originally got \\"hooked\\" on this book after we found it at the library; after we'd borrowed it 3 consecutive times for him, he still wanted to read it every day, so we bought a copy!

Definitely a very nice children's book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Civil War Collection","review":"An excellent overview of the four years that shaped a lot of America's values and changed America's character. The 8 volume series was never boring and I found it especially valuable in that I could break it into 1-hour commute times. The introduction cassette covered some often over-looked tidbits of history and I found it most interesting. I would certainly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so good detective book","review":"Because I liked the first book in the Murphy series by the same author, I tried this series - didn't even make it through the first ook - too much swearing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well plotted mystery with an authentic Welsh flair","review":"I always treat the description of a mystery as \\"cozy\\" as a danger sign. Lots of times that is a code word for poorly plotted, cutesy, twee, shallow or self-indulgent. But, it can also be the description of a series with comfortable and engaging recurring characters, authentic settings, and reasonably vigorous plotting.Well, everyone's taste is different, but for me these Evan Evans books are always satisfying. If you have used up your favorites and are casting around for a new series to try, this could be the one.Best to try to read them in order, since a few side story lines develop from book to book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hamish??","review":"When I started reading this book, I was aghast at how similar--nearly identical it is to the Hamish Macbeth series by MC Beaton, which I adore. And that's the problem.I spent the entire time reading this book comparing it--unfavorably--to the HM series. I saw that the Evan Evans series began in December of 1998, while the Macbeth series began publishing in Feb of 1999, so it's not as though MC Beaton saw this book and feverishly began working on copying it.MC Beaton's Macbeth series is just more humorous, the characters have more depth to them.This book was ok. Probably won't continue on in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea spoiled by workmanlike prose","review":"The Welsh countryside setting of this mystery novel is unusual, the characters are potentially intriguing, and the plot is decent enough, but the writing style is too dull and workmanlike. The narrative never, ever sings, and the dialogue never rises above the terribly mundane. Because of the little-seen setting and the pleasant characters, I wanted to like this book a lot more than I did. Readable, but I'm afraid I won't be seeking out any more titles by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aquatic sci-fi/fantasy!","review":"Fans of the author's previous work, Battle Angel Alita, may be a little surprised by the subject of this manga. Instead of the dark, far future of 'Alita', we are introduced to a sunshiny, medieval-flavored fantasy realm at the edge of the world. A terrific change from most comics out there, I was quite impressed with Aqua Knight, and I'm waiting for future volumns. The characters are well-defined, for the most part, and provide an emotional element to the story which helps to drive it along. As a brief note for the uninitiated, the Japanese in general are quite comfortable depicting nudity, child or adult, and this is apparent in Aqua Knight. I personally feel that this does not detract from the book's merit in any way, I merely mention this in passing for the benefit of those who have not previosly experienced the manga art form, and would like to. In that case, or if you are already a fan, I can recommend this book as a good introduction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasts about 10 seconds","review":"Thymes Frasier Fir scent is very pricey and the bottle is very light.

With Papa Grows Funk, John plays a style that is largely a continuation of the Meters' sound, but this album is a mix of somewhat older styles. The sound ranges from early rock to basic New Orleans blues piano in the Professor Longhair style, to the type of thing Dr. John plays when he isn't in Night Tripper mode. Gros is consistently good, and consistently funky, even if this album never breaks any new ground stylistically. Gros is a versatile and, well, en-gros-sing player. (Sorry, I couldn't resist). The backing band is pretty impressive too. This may not be what you would expect from the founder of Papa Grows Funk, but if you are broadly interested in New Orleans sounds, this album is well worth picking up.http://eclecticmusicblog.blogspot.com/"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book will make you everyman's social better!","review":"Finally, a compilation of tricks that are easy to do and will quickly establish your dominance in any social arena.

He was terrific. Some of the best slight of hand I've ever seen; delivered with down home charm and wit. After the show Mac made himself available in the lobby to talk with the audience. I mentioned to him my nephew was interested in learning magic and wondered if his book would be helpful. I bought a copy and was happy I did.

Here's hoping we don't get another \\"message\\" book from Brin."},{"rating":"2","title":"possibly the MOST uplifting Science Fiction I've read EVER!","review":"Being a long-time sci-fi fan, I was totally unprepared forthe world that David Brin writes about in Earth. Having readquite a few shoot-em-ups in space and the *life will just belike living in a garbage can* depictions of the future -- Iwas stunned by the intricacies of this book.The ending will ABSOLUTELY blow your mind -- it did mine!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Brin's best!","review":"This is a great book, set in the near future. David Brin paints a believable picture of what life might be like in 50 years...some things better, some worse. For those of us who love our home planet, and are concerned with it's future health, this is an invaluable book. The action takes place planet wide, with a huge cast of characters, but is so well written that it's easy to keep track of everyone and everything. And the involvement of the internet to save the earth...well, WOW! Wouldn't that be cool?!This novel will leave you with renewed hope for the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Gaia, again...","review":"My reaction to this book was not good. I am not disposed to at all appreciate a Gaia ecosermon. I find that naive, shallow and boring. Nor did I think that either characters or plot were very well developed -- it jumped around like a nervous chicken in a barnyard and had no time for development. I am trying my best to finish the book (since I paid for it), but I confess I have not yet succeeded -- it's tough sledding. On the other hand, I recall with fondness Dr. Brin's Sundiver trilogy; I know that he is a very capable writer. I will read more of his works, but this one looks like a potboiler to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Eco nut ramblings","review":"Sheesh! Where do I begin? It could have been a fun book if it wasn't for incessant preaching about how we're poisoning the world! Doomsday is coming! Good Lord man. You're a good writer, just save the soapbox preaching and give us a good story. The people that say this is totally plausible are nuts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty much unreadable","review":"This is a horrible mashup of a somewhat interesting but very standard SF novel about a team of scientists attempting to deal with a black hole that threatens to consume the Earth, and a whole lot of gibberish about Gaia, ridiculous social changes, and heavy moralizing about what humans have done to the planet. Although I have very much enjoyed Brin's Startide novels, it took me three tries years apart to get through this thing. It got easier after I learned to just skim ahead and skip all the parts not directly related to the black hole."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Effort","review":"I really did not like this book. The end was good, but the long slog to get there wasn't worth it. The POV jumps all over, with many characters existing solely to express the author's pontifications. I had no problem with the science, and enjoyed the extrapolation of the future from the culture of the late 80s. The expansive growth of the internet is just about spot on, but then he ruins the effect by creating new swear words for his characters to use. They just sounded silly. Most of this book seemed to go nowhere and have no point. The plot gets lost amid the countless warnings and philosophical statements of the author. Characters feel like vehicles for the author's opinion, not real people. It got old, fast. I can't recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vaguely interesting, but too long","review":"After 200 pages or so I put the book down. The parallel stories were plausible, the future Earth was well developed, but it just felt like my time would be better spent reading other books. The characters weren't engaging and the book is just too long, so it felt more like a chore to read it than a pleasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great all the way to the ending, then....not sure","review":"Brin is one of those writers who somehow manages to keep 30 different threads going and to bring them all together in the end, under a unifying theme. Especially interesting in this book, is the fact that each one of these threads represents basically a different experience of, and perspective on, the state of the world 50 years from now. Brin's projections usually ring true, which helps to bring the world, and the characters to life. But when he reaches for the big ending, he reaches a little too far. Sure, it's fun and exciting, but as a reader, you can't help losing that sense of reality which makes the rest of the book work so well. I wish he had come up with an ending that was more...um...\\"down to Earth.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific plot, unique premise, and good characters","review":"This is an absolutely great book. Terrific plot, unique premise, and good characters. Even though it is a \\"message\\" book, the message is well delivered and doesn't get in the way of a fun read. You don't have to believe the author's eco-message to enjoy reading this. My only complaint: I've thought for years that the author left the ending open enough for a sequel which has never come unfortunately. And I've tried reading some of his other series oriented books and found them to be pale and shallow in comparison, obviously produced to meet an unending string of deadlines."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disjointed, tedious and boring.","review":"This book became too tedious after about 100 pages. Although some concepts in this book are interesting, the writing style is all about lots of parallel plot lines, interspersed with disjointed \\"news\\" and \\"net\\" clips. It's very predictable and became boring quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story but boring characters and writing kill this book","review":"Brin definitely has an interesting plot with many twists and turns. However, his characters are extremely boring and simplistic. The writing also was very mind numbing. I had the feeling that he wrote an outline then feed it into a machine to do the writing for him. These factor detract from an excellent story. Having not read any other works by him I'm not sure if this is the case with all his writing. I don't recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brilliant mind wasted on tedius plot with proganda throughout","review":"I rarely review the Amazon products I buy. Also, I almost never start a book and not finish it. Earth by David Brin is an exception. I made it to page 342 but can't go on. The book, while brilliant in concept, is plagued with a rambling, disjointed story-line filled to overflowing with evolutionary theories presented as fact.It's obvious that Mr. Brin is very intelligent but I can't waste any more time on this scifi book that reads more like classroom lecture notes than entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"Brin took a simple theme and stretched it into a long novel by constantly adding little side issues that totally distract you from the story line. I think this book was written with 'future movie' in mind from page one. It reads like a news reel. I got bored and couldn't finish it. And I hate not finishing a book that I bought myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Earth","review":"The story is fine, just as I remembered it. However the readers do a horrible New Zealand accent, makes us sound as if we come from the Australian shores. Not only that but they just mangle the Maori pronunciation. Spoils what would be a world first, Tangata Whenua as protagonists in a a Science Fiction novel"},{"rating":"1","title":"As poisonous in it's philosophy as it is thorough","review":"David Brin is often touted as a Libertarian, but this book belies that. Buy it, because it is destined to be the bible of anti-individualists and devotees of the \\"New World Order\\" everywhere. It is the perfect antithesis of \\"Atlas Shrugged,\\" and just as thorough in expounding its philosophical thesis. If you want to understand Ayn Rand, this book is a perfect example of how her fictional villains and real-world opponents think. The book is a tour de force poisonous philosophical tenets, from its metaphysics of pop-mysticism and its epistemology of the \\"multiple-personality mind\\" to its group-identity ethics, \\"third-way\\" authoritarian socialist politics, and thinly veiled nihilism. If it does nothing else, this book should be hailed for exposing the \\"Whole Earth Movement\\" for the collectivism that it is. It is a breathtakingly disturbing read for the rational individualist reader, but priceless for understanding the collectivist mindset."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and self-absorbed","review":"I loved many of Brin's other books (especially the first three from the Uplift series), but \\"Earth\\" is just terrible. At least half of the characters (and one very major one) are almost entirely unnecessary to the story and its eventual outcome. Every page that mentions these characters could be removed from the book and the story would barely suffer. Zap out roughly half the book and it might be palatable, but as it is it's alternately preachy, boring, or just ridiculous. The climax is so hokey and predictable that I found myself laughing out loud at how silly it was. There's no depth or realism to the characters, and no depth or realism to the story. Even in a genre that relies on stretching our ideas about reality, \\"Earth\\" just seems contrived, and as a result its message is heavy handed and uninspiring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic. Complex. Fascinating.","review":"This book is one of my top 10 favorite SF books ever. It has several interwoven plots; each of which is great. The new \\"modality\\" (as Brin calls it) of gravometrics is wonderfully detailed and interesting. Though the gravitometrics are fantasy, every other detail is well though out and completely beleivable. Brin's writting will make it difficult to put down once you've started. His education and intelligence contribute greatly to the book's quality. I strongly recomend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A drag to read.","review":"I was excited to read this book after it was highly recommended to me by a friend. It was so boring! I gave it two stars because I thought the plot was a great idea and I think there is a great story in here with a warning about the future of our environment but it ended up to muddled down. And the characters weren't very interesting at all either - some of them a complete waste of time to read about. I made it through the whole thing because I was curious enough to know how it ended and then I was sorry I spent the time to do so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Early climate change novel","review":"This was written decades ago, but the message still lingers for me. I read this book when it was first published, and it just amazed me. I even bought extras to give to others. The world's climate is changing radically. Ozone layer breakdown is leading to more skin cancer, water levels are rising in some areas while drought strikes formerly arable land. The vast majority of it was just amazing and eye-opening for me. Granted, other novels that have come since this one may have done a better job with the science, and the earth-spirit thing of this one is a bit outside of sci-fi, but this was still my first. It will always stick out in my mind as very special."},{"rating":"1","title":"An aged singularity potboiler","review":"This book hasn't aged well; it has been a long seventeen years and the technical and ecological references are quaint (where not obsolete). The ostentatious earnestness of the ecological message of book can be tiresome: I found myself muttering \\"yes, yes, I got it, yes, now get on with the story.\\" Oh yeah, the story: the \\"oops, I dropped the black hole\\" plot has been done many times since, so this book has had a certain influence: Paul McAuley's \\"How We Lost the Moon\\" and Bill DeSmedt'sSingularity. From a technical standpoint, read McAuley. Skip this one, unless you enjoy mystical preaching about the environment, with dated arguments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes You Wonder!","review":"This book was entertaining and thought provoking. The premise was unusual. The sci fi elements were pretty well explained and seemed believable for the most part. Mostly though, I liked the morality issues which seemed to weave their way throughout the story. The different shades of right and wrong in all the hues of gray! The author provided 'food for thought' and made me re-examine some of my own basic beliefs in the process. While enjoying an entertaining and scarey story I was also able to flex my imagination regarding our planet and some of the social aspects of our existence as a species.

A comparison of the Spanish and the English gives some indication of the choices made in translation. I would buy the book solely to support its trilingual intent.However, I recommend the book based on content. The poets range from political to traditional - every reader will have their own favorites. My favorites are: 1) Red Skirt - a delightful exploration of male/female interactions 2) Black Louse, White Louse - a poem that reminds me of a local Native American louse taleYou will find most of the poems heavily influenced by contemporary Hispanic poetry but retaining a sufficient touch of Quechua culture to set them apart. Somewhere among the collection, you should also find a poem or two to add to your collection of \\"favorite poems\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice, but some safety issues.","review":"I like the size and power of this smaller unit, but have a couple of concerns, strong enough that I returned it to the store. The chute for continuous feed is too low and it would be very difficult to get a bowl of any size underneath it. Also the lid easily popped out of the safety lock that is required to run the machine. Do not know it this is a machine feature or a defect on the one I tried. Hope this helps someone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to Open","review":"Nice power, nice features but the BIG problem is that the top is difficult if not impossile to open. You are supposed to push into the plastic to unlock but it only opens sometimes. I have to try and shake the ingredients out of the chute. In a made dash to make guacamole for guests, I had to shake all the ingredients out of the top and ended up tossing this Food Processor out into 10 inches of snow. WOuld be impossible for someone with arthritis or any slight hand flexability difficulty. We have had this machine for about 6 months.

Topics are those that we want to address with our kids but may not encounter the situation just yet so it's good that these devotionals can spark the topic of conversation ie: death of a loved one... it's nice to have discussed this from a Biblical stance now so that when we experience it as a family the concept is not totally foreign and we can refer back to prior discussions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dissection of a heart","review":"Rarely does a book come along which changes the way you see things. Johnson writes with such command and passion that you are immediatly drawn into his world. I started this book when I was in low spirits and the book quickly made me see the brighter sides of life. Although, its about the death of the loved one the way Johnson writes it doesnt make it fall into the catergory of a b-rate tear jerker. Its more about coming to terms with love, death and life. The reasons to live are the central plot rather then the reasons to die.I weeped at times but at times inwardily smiled because Johnsons perceptions and fears are so human, just like the rest of us!I suggest this book strongly for all those who want to get a little closer to reality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exquisite writing and graceful honesty","review":"Fenton Johnson's memoir of his partner's death is one of the most touching and honest accounts of love I have ever read.

The measurements given didn't seem quite right to me but I followed the recipes to the letter anyway. It wasn't a case of the recipes just not quite working or simply not tasting all that good. They failed miserably; the custard tasted awful and the batter for the tuiles was way too thin.I couldn't help but question the accuracy of these recipes from the outset simply because most chefs of the caliber/type in this book oftentimes can't give you exact measurements for their dishes. Also, why would they want to give away their trade secrets?In the end I'm left with the sense that this book is more style than substance and I'm so glad I didn't shell out any money for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The last book in the adventures of Mika","review":"This is the sequel to \\"The Demon Hand\\" (Greyhawk Adventures No. 5).

I have to admit that I bought these four books for $2.00 in a dollar store in Grand Rapids. It took me a couple of years before I decided to read them and I'm glad that I did. Rose Estes creates a marvelous world of majic and mystery, with all the necessary touches of good and evil and spliced with humor and wit. Others will say these books are for young-adult. They are, and that's what I was when I read them.

Income has different meanings in the personal and business spheres, it's unclear what the authors mean (especially in problem statements).

Truly part of the CD is that bad. I wanted to purchase Sammy Morgan's Gin on CD but I should have ordered another Bear family set. Half of the CD is wonderful. The CD is a Bear family release.

In the 80's it was cool to \\"go outside\\" to play after you watched a little TV. This movie was a fantastic summation of the old series and tranformation into the new wave of transformers. All the old favorites were there and some new favorites were introduced. I just feel good every time I see it (which hasn't been for years now) and look foreward to purchasing it in the future so I can pop it in anytime and re-live my childhood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best anaimated sci-fi movie ever!!","review":"As a long time fan of the transformers I have long awaited the return of the classic to video.I have been a lover of anime and transformers (the movie in particular) is what got that intrest started.Any fellow fan that shares my love for this movie please give me a hollar."},{"rating":"2","title":"i must have the transformer movie","review":"This was one of the greatest movies i had ever seen as a kid.

The authors actually succeeded quite good in not making it 'too dry'. For those who need 'more', like engineers and students in telecommunications/electronics, such as theories, applications and examples on efficiency, network performance parameters, etc., please look further as this book just doesn't offer that (and it probably never intended to)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Confusing","review":"This book is designed for someone who has prior knowledge with the underlying systems of a computer network. It is fairly in-depth, and explains a lot, but I think that for a true beginner it is hard to comprehend. I am working on a degree in Computer Science, so it wasn't like I was new to the idea of networking, but I found it hard to digest a lot of the technical aspects of this book. Some things could have been made to be more of an overview, rather than in-depth explanation of how something works at a bit level. I am now taking CCNA training, and some of the things talked about in this book do not relate at all to what someone needs to understand a working network."},{"rating":"1","title":"YOU CAN NOT TELL A BOOK BY ITS COVER...","review":"While it may be an over-all attractive looking book, it has its problems (many of them). First of all, it is over priced. Also, some pictures were selected foolishly and do not depict well what the captions state or what the text delails. Needlessly, many interesting and important historical facts have been omitted from the final text (i.e.: the very first chef for the hotel, the bellboy who began working at the hotel in 1956 and was still there 25 years later, the crash of a hotel helicopter, the leaks that happened the first day that the marina was filled, etc.).

I love Blackmore too, but am skeptical when no mention is made if he plays on it. I searched around and found this for twelve bucks. Although there is no Blackmore, I do recognize that he has versions of a couple of these songs on his Blackmore's Night CD's. So that is the way to go if you want to hear Blackmore's playing. This CD has some nice classical songs though.... but hardly 72 buck's worth .... seller obviously wants people to think this is more than it is.... This is NOT \\"by Ritchie Blackmore\\" ... merely classical songs selected by him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"Why, oh why, do companies insist on changing products that are perfect to begin with? I purchased the original hand cream at a kiosk at the mall and it was so wonderful. This new version is extremely perfumed, overpowering really, so if you are sensitive to perfumes you probably won't care for this cream. Very strong aroma. It doesn't seem to soften hands as well as the older version. The old version worked very well. Sure do with they hadn't changed. I will not purchase this product again. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Missing The Sugar of a Story","review":"I really enjoyed this story, although I thought it was missing the happy ending and \\"love\\" between 2 characters. All the talk between the charcaters about fulfilling there empty routine filled lifes would make you think they would do something about it and make the ending of the story happy,..but I guess that just misleads the readers. All in all this was a good book. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys learning."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Tight and compelling,\\" my arse!","review":"There aren't many books my nine-year-old son and I won't finish, but this was one of them. It's been a long time since I read such a slow, boring book. The characters were nothing but soul-less caricatures, and when one doesn't care about the characters, why go on? I'm astonished that the New York Times and other reviewers gave this such favorable coverage. It just goes to show--they're not reading these books with kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lost souls in search of lost things","review":"A fun, headlong read studded with a teeming cast of marvelous characters, intriguing lacunae, and a liberal dose of super-reality, all woven together effortlessly by poet and novelist Christopher into a dense -- if not lush -- web of suprising connections. But to explain even a partial summary of the plot would be an injustice spanning several pages, at least within the limitations of this anonymous reviewer. Suffice it to say, though, that there is enough here -- lost souls in search of lost things, a great love story, arachnology, astronomy, Zuni wisdom, mnemonics, ancient languages, and so on -- to make any reader rediscover that initial world-wonder subsequently tempered by the ravages of experience. If you enjoy this, try his somewhat under-appreciated New York novel, Veronica, as well as any of his critically-acclaimed books of poetry."},{"rating":"2","title":"A literal word feast! I am now a fan of Chrisopher's work!!","review":"I LOVE this book! It may take some concentration to get started with it, but stay with the story, it's an incredible read! Christopher is an artist, he weaves the cold realities of life into a sometimes suspenseful story using magical realism, and just enough fantasy to keep it lively while still remaining grounded. I'm not a big fantasy fan, so too much would have turned me off completely.\\"A Trip To The Stars\\" is a story about regular people in extraordinary circumstances. It's the perfect balance between magic, reality, fantasy, suspense and what the characters make of their journey through life.After reading this book, I devoured Christopher's other works, including \\"Franklin Flyer\\" and \\"The Solist\\". If you need a temeporary escape, or just need something rich and satisfying to capture your attention for awhile, get a copy of \\"A Trip To The Stars.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Watching and waiting","review":"The long intricate descriptions eventually got to me, as did the seemingly random New Age mumbojumbo, and I realized I didn't care about any of the characters, and just stopped reading. A real disappointment. It reads like something someone just made up, like a shaggy dog story, and kept going, and going."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Disappointing","review":"When I first started this, I liked it. The more I read, the less I liked it, and when I finished the book, I realized I didn't like it at all. Too many characters, too much symbolism, and an overly elaborate storyline that was like a jigsaw puzzle... and as passionate. Oh, and why in the world were there vampires in it?! This type of story demands a lighter touch. A book with similar themes (loss, love, fate), Four Letters of Love by Niall Williams, is a good example. When I was about a quarter of the way through this book, I ordered another of Christopher's books called Veronica. Can't say I'm too excited about reading it now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top 5 of my all-time favorites!","review":"I absolutely loved this book! The first chapter grabbed me and pulled me in, the middle parts intrigued me and the ending chapters were page-turners! If you are looking for a \\"how does this all tie together?\\" type of book, this is for you. While it was sometimes difficult to keep all the characters straight, I still thought each one had its' own interesting addition to the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A trip to the stars.

It is one of the best books I've read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A trip to nowhere.","review":"I really enjoyed Nicholas Christopher's last novel, Veronica, and so I decided to tackle this one. Many of the elements that worked so well in Veronica are also present in \\"A Trip to the Stars\\": abudant symbolism, strangely magical happenings, and Christopher's direct but highly descriptive writing style. Unfortunately, the result isn't nearly so satisfying.For starters, there is the small matter of the plot....there isn't enough to sustain this book through 500 pages. We follow the lives of the two main characters from the time that one is abducted from the other at the age of 10 until they are reunited 15 years later. In the interim they both live curious and improbable lives, but I just kept asking myself whether I really cared about them. In the end, I decided that I didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"One inout to two outputs NOT two to one","review":"I have two gamings systems for which I use an IR gaming headset. Currently the only way I could use it for one or the other was to manually switch the Optical cable from the back of the headset's receiver. I wanted to avoid doing anything manually so I was hoping I could use this component as others around the web have stated they could do. This does not work that way. People will say it will work as long as you only have one optical cable active at a time. THIS IS NOT TRUE. It only take one input and splits it into two. It won't work the other way around.

If you look at the tiny red dot that the fiber optic signal can emit before you split it into two, you will notice that it is twice as strong before you split it. As a result, the signal after the split will be half the strength of the original signal. If you split it four times, it will be only one fourth the strength. The strength loss will not be strong enough to power most audio devices, such as a sound bar, etc. The solution is to purchase an amplified splitter so that after the signal is split, it is amplified to a higher strength. The amplified splitter requires an independent power source (plug in or battery). When I used the amplified splitter, everything worked fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"The premise doesn't work - they stack 2 fibers and then aim them at the other - so they cannot be in line!

Optical maximum distance is about 35 feet from my experience and splitting the signal at either the end of this length or the beginning was a total failure either way.It's as cheap as the price indicates...stay away from this poor idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work","review":"I ordered this fiber optic splitter with the intention of splitting a fiber optic audio feed to two different devices. Did it work? Nope. I could see the light shining through, but neither of the audio devices were able to produce audio from the light that was split off to them.I also tried going the other direction (two different devices going to one audio output), with the intention of using it as a passive switch (as long as only one of the devices was on, it should play sound from that device, but if both devices were on, there would be overlap and the audio stream would be garbled or nonexistent).

I was VERY disappointed, though, and the film's biggest problem can be summed up in two words: Tracy Morgan. Unfunny, whining, and constantly mugging at the camera, Morgan may be Willis' worst co-star, ever (How bad is he? Seann William Scott, with less than 10 minutes of screen time, has more laughs than Morgan provides, the entire film). Willis spends most of \\"Cop Out\\" simply staring at Morgan and his unrelenting stream of chatter (director Smith, apparently, allowed him to ad lib at will).It's supposedly a cop comedy (involving drugs, a kidnapped wife, and a stolen baseball card), and a 'hilarious' send-up of buddy films. It fails at both, and wastes the talents of Willis, Scott, Kevin Pollak, Adam Brody, Jason Lee, Guillermo Díaz, and Ana de la Reguera.It simply isn't worth buying...What a mess!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bruce Willis comedy","review":"\\"Cop Out\\" is a film that you cannot take seriously. It is a comedy at heart. There is a distinct kind of humor in \\"Cop Out\\". This is what I call Bruce Willis comedy. Its slick humor which is funny at times, but can get old when used over and over.\\"Cop Out\\" is about two cops James \\"Jimmy\\" Monroe (Willis) and Paul Hodges (Tracey Morgan). These two cops have been working with each other for a long time. Paul thinks that his wife is seeing another man, while James is being replaced in his family by his ex-wife's new husband.While on the job James and Paul seem to be following trouble wherever they go.Overall, \\"Cop Out\\" is somewhat funny film that should be entertaining if you understand Bruce Willis humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny! Immature, but funny!","review":"Cop Out is simply a well made by the numbers police film with some old fashioned and sophmoric humor. It's hilarious to watch Bruce Willis and Tracy Morgan play two grown men who act like 15 year-olds. This type of humor may seem annoying to some, but I thought they pulled it off. Bruce's deadpan delivery made the jokes work, and Tracy was obviously in his comedic element.I was afraid Sean William Scott would be annoying, but he wasn't that bad. He had some funny moments and it was also funny when the duo put him in his place.The police procedural stuff was well done and there's a good bit of action as well. I like all of Kevin Smith's films, and this one is no exception. He may be known for low brow humor, but he knows how to film comedic timing and punchlines. Cop Out was simply a fun day at the movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Bruce Willis","review":"I had heard that this movie wasn't that great, but saw it on sale really cheap for Christmas, so picked it up. My wife and I like Bruce Willis films and he's usually pretty consistentThis movie stank so bad, we're still trying to get the smell out of our house. Tracy Morgan was not funny at all, but just annoying Watching this movie was like torture. We sat through the whole thing hoping it would get better but it didn't. Even at the $5.00 Wal-Mart bargain bin price, it was a waste of money. There were some talented people involved with this film, but they could not save it from the bad writing and terrible acting. It was sad to see. We honestly felt sorry for Bruce Willis for being involved with this stinker. It was if the director was trying to make it bad on purpose.

For Willis fans you might wait for Die Hard 4. He does not play a super-cop, but rather a mediocre cop paired with Tracy Morgan who uses lines from movies to interrogate prisoners.The cops screw up and get suspended from the police force. Willis, in a situation where he wants to pay for his daughter's $48,000 wedding, opts to sell his 1952 gem mint 10 Topps Andy Pafko card for $83,000. While in the card shop he gets robbed. They now try to recover the card, which leads to dealings with criminals.

And the movie is the biggest waste of Bruce Willis' talent since Hudson Hawk"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of Bruce Willis' worst movies!!!","review":"This movie is hot garbage. The plot is dumb, Tracey Morgan isn't funny and never has been. Bruce must of been hard up for work to do this movie. I found after 30 minutes of watching the movie I was fighting not going to sleep. So I guess its good for a sleeping pill instead of for entertainment. I want my 2 hours of my life back! Avoid this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cop Out","review":"I like buddy cop movies,that's why I wanted to see this one but it was so bad.Pretty boring and not very funny.I did like the scene where Tracy Morgan did that line from Robo Cop in the begining but that's about it.Sean William Scott wasn't that funny in this movie either.I thought he was annyoing.I bet Bruce Willis didn't like Tracy Morgan in real life,not just in the movie.Never will I see anthor movie with Tracy Morgan again.They should have paired Bruce Willis up with someone else.Don't even watch this movie for free!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"This is police brutality!\\"","review":"I didn't hate it. I didn't like it either. It was watchable, amiable, uneven, limp, and at times lifeless. Just look at the DVD cover and that pretty much tells you what's going on inside: Bruce looks embarrassed while Tracy looks just plain goofy. It was as if they were starring in two different movies edited together. One was a running monologue of stale jokes; the other wanted to be an actual cop film complete with a case to solve, the obligatory car chase, shootouts, and several executions thrown in for good measure! They literally went from a joke to a man being shot to death. It was more than a little jarring. Was this supposed to be a spoof, a goof, satire, parody, a bad 80's TV show revisited: what? It was none of that and so much less. I actually felt sorry for Bruce Willis.I won't even bring up Seann William Scott's part in all this; but to say he took \\"annoying\\" to a whole new level.I think we can safely say there won't be a sequel.Not a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad!","review":"First off I love Tracy Morgan. He is great on 30 Rock as well as SNL and his Live shows. Movies he almost always crashes and burns in. Cop Out has to be the worst of them all. The movie is just boring. I should have shut it off 30 min in. I wanted to end my own life after seeing this film that's how bad it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funniest movie in a long time!","review":"Why do haters always post reviews, and people who actually like the movie don't.

Lousy Movie! (I have tried to warn you)","review":"To say \\"Cop Out\\" is bad is to underestimate how excrable this movie truly is! I can safely say that \\"Cop Out\\" is one of the worst movies I ever sat through; and I've sat through some really bad ones. Not only is the pacing poor, the rapport forced, and the acting awful, there ar less laughs in this 'buddy comedy' than there were in \\"Julia and Julia.\\"Bruce Willis merely goes through the motions and looks like he was having second thoughts in merely every scene. Tracy Morgan should be given the 2011 Razzie right now...He's that bad. The plot is a mish-mash of Beverly Hills Cop, Fletch, 48 Hours, and Lethal Weapon. The music has been lifted right out of Fletch and you'll be longing for even one moment as funny as the weakest moment from any of the above named films.Do yourself a favor and avoid this movie like it was guaranteed to infect you with the Bubonic Plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"The combination of Bruce Willis, Tracy Morgan, & Kevin Smith does not work","review":"Length:: 5:04 MinsGina from Haunted Flower reviews \\"Cop Out\\" starring Bruce Willis and Tracy Morgan and directed by Kevin Smith.

Unlike Lethal Weapon, it wasn't endearing and I think they tried to hard to make the characters look like Riggs and Murtaugh, but without the charm.It's hardly the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's far from the best. I can see why the cable company gave it one star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent collection for the Price","review":"This collection should have been called \\"The Anthony Michael Hall Collection\\".

Now in my mid teens, I recently discovered these movies, and this DVD set is a great introduction that has already gotten my hooked, causing me to rent many other 80s 'classics'.The image quality is very good, although all three movies lack any extras other than theatrical trailers. I would have enjoyed seeing a \\"Making Of\\" feature, or commentary from the stars of these films.While all three movies are enjoyable, I think that Pretty in Pink would have been a better fit with The Breakfast Club, and Sixteen Candles than Weird Science is. That movie is a different style and genre that just doesn't seem to fit perfectly with the others.Overall, I'd recommend this set. If you already own the VHS, don't waste your money due to the lack of features, but if you don't, this is a convenient way to get all three movies at a good price."},{"rating":"1","title":"We want special features!!!!!","review":"Yeah ok, so Sixteen Candles has the original soundtrack, while that is a very good reason to buy this re-issued DVD, it's not good enough! I have both 16 Candles and The Breakfast Club on DVD from it's first release and I will hold on to them until Universal releases a special edition!

There is a trailer at the beginning that is several minutes long and there is no way to bypass it. If you stop the movie and decide you want to watch it later, you will be stuck watching the same long trailer again and again. What is this wonderful trailer you ask? Why it is an advertisement to purchase Weird Science, Breakfast Club & Sixteen Candles which you obviously already own. Then trailer number 2 comes up for Animal House and Trailer 3 for Monty's Meaning of Life.

I wish there were commentaries on the other two, but at least there will be a featurette or two.Would I have preferred these were on the \\"High School Reunion\\" releases, of course!

But, unlike the 1st reviewer's opinion of \\"Dealing With It\\" I choose not to support the Studio. Re-buying these movies for one cool commentary track on just one movie is a rip off much along the lines of the \\"I Love the 80's\\" DVD's that were recently released.The only way to stop studios from the \\"Double Dip\\" is not to purchase these product which are attempts at selling essentially the same product with \\"Minor\\" differences.Like the 2nd reviewer I actually give this 0 stars for the \\"double dipping\\"!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No thanks!!!","review":"Thanks, but no thanks.

I ordered the high school flashback collection with The Breakfast Club, Wierd Science, and Sixteen Candles, but what I got wasnt what I ordered. What I received was The Breakfast Club, two of the exact same Wierd Science DVDs and Sixteen Candles wasn't in there. I got duplicate DVDs instead of all three.

Thoughout the movie, I also notice very slight sync problems also.In Weird Science, turn on the English subtitles and about 7m20 in, you will notice that you don't hear Gary saying, \\"If there's one thing I know, it's female stats\\" (again, Dolby soundtrack)!On the positive side, I didn't notice anything wrong with Sixteen Candles and it is nice to have the original soundtrack back (the VHS changed some of the background music that was playing from the theatrical version).None of the discs come with booklets or features that can be called special."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good collection","review":"I'm not a huge fan of these movies, but my sister loved this set.

It contains great information on writing lyrics. If only it had some more info on the music part of songwriting. The stories are funny and entertaining and the information is really good.

If you're looking to upgrade to a larger cooker, or upgrading from aluminum to SS, then this is the unit for you. If you are new to pressure cooking, operation is pretty much \\"idiot proof.\\" Worried about it blowing up?

The quality of the steel is impressive and the heat distribution is very uniform. I have only one note to future users and that is to test out reactions to the high setting on your ranges since a lower heat setting may be more appropriate to avoid burning sticky foods.

This has happened several times where it did not work right. The steam is not coming out of the valve correctly, and I'm afraid of it. The problem, I'm past the 30 days return by 2 weeks.

I'll stick with my Magefesa, always works, first time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Cookware for all Cooks (Novice to Pro)","review":"This pressure cooker is a simple to use, yet advanced to accommodate all levels of cooking experience. Using it to cook any food item is virtually idiot proof - until it comes to cleaning the pressure valve assembly.

To prevent undue frustration, it is suggested you pay attention to how you took it apart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken handle!","review":"UPS did a nice job delivering this Fagor product as the box was in pristine condition, which leads me to believe the manufacturer did not catch the poor quality of the handle before it left their plant, only to shatter inside the box during shipment. I printed out the replacement forms and Amazon has already shipped the replacement (UPS hasn't even picked up the defected product yet)! Amazon's customer service so far has been stellar! I may return the replacement if I feel the handle or the gasket is questionable as we definately do not want supper on the ceiling. I opted for the Fagor because of the fabulous reviews, but this will be the second one posted about a shattered handle. Perhaps Fagor needs to rethink having China make their products instead of Spain. Kuhn Rikon (Swiss made, high quality, high price) may end up getting my money instead of Fagor. I am disappointed in Fagor's lack of quality control."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problems maintaining pressure","review":"We purchased this Fagor pressure cooker to replace a smaller Mirro that has been working well for us for decades. We can get our Fagor to hold pressure once in a while but most of the time it doesn't. The instruction book is 98% recipes with only one or two all-too-brief paragraphs on setting it up.

I checked it carefully, and noticed the valve \\"holder\\" broke for no reason. I researched via website, and found in order to fix it, I have to order a new handle + s&h which will cost me $30.

It's not even possible for attach a new handle to it because the metal part, which technically is part of the body, came off! I've replied to her with pictures of this and describing the problem, and so far I've gotten no reply.

The picture is the dull surface and the steam vent release button is the dark mustard color. The Duo's pictures are shiny silver and the button bright yellow. If you search from Amazon for the Duo, you will find it is $109, not in the $80 range as this one is (7/2011).

I was excited when it arrived since this was my first time buying a pressure cooker and I couldn't wait to try it. So I was really bummed when I opened the box and the shorter handle was broken off and in two pieces, even though the pressure cooker had been packed with styrofoam. I took that to be a sign of being poorly made, and remembered the reviews that complained that the handles seemed cheaply made. Of all the things you would want strong handles on it's a pressure cooker! I took it as a sign of worse things to come so I just sent it back. I didn't have problems with the return, but I am very irritated that I wasted time buying the Fagor Duo, had to find the time to return it, and instead of enjoying using my pressure cooker I am back to researching again to decide on another brand to try, sigh...."},{"rating":"2","title":"pressure canner","review":"The Fagor Duo 10 quart pressure canner that I purchased is great.

My Fagor, on the other hand, burns everything! The only thing that doesn't burn is water. Occasionally I like to cook food in something besides water, but if I want to do that I have to use my oven and do it the old fashioned way. Very frustrating! I do not cook it on too high of a temperature. I keep it barely pressurized during the cooking time and things still burn. If any of you have recommendations on this, I'd appreciate it.

It may have been released at a time when traditional Salsa was losing ground to both Cumbia and Merengue but (based on the strength of tunes like \\"Maria Elena\\", \\"El Condenado\\", \\"La Mitad\\", \\"Tormenta\\" and \\"Te Quiero Tal Como Eres\\") it's obvious that Willie Rosario was not fazed by this. While not as compelling or mind-blowing as albums like 1975's \\"Otra Vez\\", 1978's \\"From The Depth Of My Brain\\" or 1983's \\"The Salsa Machine\\" this CD has plenty to recommend it. My only complaint is that Univeral Latino could have done a better remastering job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still In His Prime Years","review":"\\"The Portrait Of A Salsa Man\\", Willie Rosario's 1981 Lp (produced by himself), finds Willie's band, still playing their brand of \\"hot swinging salsa\\" at the height of their most creative and successful years( from the mid 70's thru the mid 80's). Sharing duties on vocals were, Bobby Concepciòn and Gilberto Santarosa. Eladio Peguero \\"Yayo El Indio\\", Elliot Romero, Mario Cora, and Mario Viera rounded the chorus section. The themes; \\"La Mitad\\", Rafael Hernàndez's \\"Marìa Elena\\", Tite Curet,s \\"El Antifaz\\", and \\"El Condenado\\", were given plenty of air-time on countless radio stations, making this album one of many \\"salsa\\" classics."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a disappointment!","review":"Having read and enjoyed other Truman books in the Capital Crimes series years ago, I was extremely disappointed in this rather sophomoric story. The plot is completely predictable, way too long and dragged down with unnecessary details which do nothing to advance plot, characterization or setting. The characters are either thoroughly unlikable or cliched stereotypes. (Sometimes both.) The toast on the last page which lauds the Mason, senior curator, as \\"a good and decent man who made one mistake\\" is exceptionally nauseating. Finally, the relationship between Annabel and her husband, Mac, is so corny, it makes the marriages depicted on \\"The Donna Reed Show\\" or \\"Father Knows Best\\" look noir.

Definately not one of her best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Margaret Truman's best","review":"I'm a fan of Margaret Truman, but I found it laborious to get through this one.

Overweight Readers Beware!","review":"I have enjoyed Truman's mysteries in the past, but found this one contrived, mildly entertaining, and significantly irritating. The characterizations seemed melodramatic and/or stereotypical. Not a total loss, but you can do much better for your book-buying buck.What I really found offensive in this book was the consistent characterization of every overweight character as disgusting, repellent, absurd, etc. Apparently, in Truman's mind fat equals bad and thin equals good. How sad for the overweight reader who picks up this book to escape from the unkindness of the world he/she inhabits, only to be bashed by Truman's obvious prejudice.

I wasn't ready to see 80's music make its cyclical return. But the album surprised me. Rocket Ride, Hunting Season, Short Skirts, & Watching Cars Go By are all great songs. Those aren't even all that 80's sounding. Ready 2 Wear, on the other hand does sound like something out of about 1983. While there are some weak tracks toward the end including one that rips off Alex Foley's theme this is still my favorite album of 2004."},{"rating":"2","title":"Devin does Dazzle","review":"Unlike so many others, I really enjoyed this album very much. I know it's different from his last release, and it does definitely have an eighties sound (his sound has always been retro!)

If he were to make an identical replica of \\"kittenz\\" his fans would most likely have ripped him a new one. There is no winning with fickle \\"fans\\" of music. This album sounds like an obvious progression for this artist.

I was really let-down. I was looking for songs on the level of Silver Screen, Happy Hour, and Glitz Rock- all excellent songs from Felix. But there is nothing like any of those on this cd. There are maybe 2-3 listenable tracks: Rocket Ride, Watch Cars go by, and Hunting Season and Neon Human are all-right. Devin Dazzle, which I was hoping would be the best song, turned out to be my least favorite.

Assembly wasn't difficult -- my 8-yr old daughter and I put it together in 15 minutes (the stickers were probably the most time consuming part of assembly). My son (age 6) played with it for two weeks and then got bored -- Shark Park was soon forgotten. Hey, I paid ... for this piece of plastic! It wasn't about to be shoved aside that quickly! So I put in the 3 batteries and Shark Park is a favorite toy again (ok, we'll see how long before the novelty wears off...we may get another two weeks out of it, who knows?). Frankly, I think this toy limits the child's imaginative play; he's better off building mazes and roads out of books, blocks and lincoln logs, but I caved in to the \\"big beg\\" for his birthday, and he's happy (for now)."},{"rating":"1","title":"States \\"12 phrases\\" for the Sharkbite Bay playset","review":"First of all..

I understand that to many of you it may not mean a whole lot, but I feel that a 4yr old should not have to think that it is ok to say that. I just want to make sure that my playset is not the only one that states that.

The excitement quickly dwindled when we started putting it together and was completely gone after playing with it for 5 minutes. It's made cheaply, the triggers for the sound either don't work or misfire 90% of the time, and it has zero educational value. If it ships to you enclosed in bubble wrap give the bubble wrap to your kids to play with and send back the Shark Park. They'll enjoy it more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Present for a 6-year-old!","review":"I read reviews of this toy stating that it fell apart easily or was difficult to assemble. I disagree!! Sure, an adult should put it together, but if your child is anything like my son, he'll take it apart and put it together himself time and time again. He \\"helped\\" me put it together, and he can slip the large pieces apart and back together when he wants to move it to another room. Just about all of his cars fit the toy just fine, including his Bakugan! He loves watching to see which car gets eaten by the shark. Since the shark is mechanical, not electronic, the batteries and sound don't need to be on to play with it.And the shark sounds have an off switch!!

The design of the lid makes it difficult to dispense the whole content out of the compartments. You have to turn upside down the cup several times to try to get the formula out of the cup (because it keeps staying around the hole). At the end you will manage to take the formula out, but when you have a hungry crying baby waiting for his food, it can get very disturbing. Maybe as a snack cup it works just fine.Later on, I bought the Munchkin formula dispenser, and it is great! The hole in the lead is in an angle, so the whole content goes out immediately when you turn the cup. Also, it is smaller and cheaper. By far, it is better than the Avent formula dispenser .Munchkin Powdered Formula Dispenser, Colors May Vary"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not perfect, but great for the money.","review":"The good?* It's inexpensive* It's very sturdy* The lid stays closed/locked* The formula doesn't mix with other compartments* You can fit a lot of formula in each section (at least 6oz, I haven't tried 8oz yet)* The cup will be good for snacks when formula is doneThe bad?* It takes a bit of tamping and shaking to get all the formula out (and even then you might still miss some--but it's not usually that big of an amount to worry about)* It's a bit bulky."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to get all of the formula out","review":"This is fine for what it is, but it's not as convenient as it could be due to the fact that formula gets stuck in it. I bought this as a solution for nighttime feedings but ended up using it during the day only, when I can see and make sure all the formula has been poured out.The first night I used this, I was leaving the lights off during feedings to help baby adjust to nighttime. I didn't realize that I hadn't dispensed all of the powder, so my poor baby got a very diluted bottle, and I didn't notice until daylight that not all of the formula had come out. I felt bad.Due to its design, you have to pour the formula out, then tilt it in one direction to get the rest out of one corner, then tilt to the other side and shake it to actually get the rest out.The positives are that it is dishwasher/microwave safe and BPA free, so I'll probably be using it for snacks in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Happy!","review":"This was bought as a gift and I hate it.

(hence the four stars)I've been thru a lot of milk dispensers when my nieces where growing up, most of the problem is how they are cheaply constructed making them susceptible to cracks when dropped or hit by stuff inside the diaper bag.This one is made to last.

I also love that it comes out and can be used just as a Tupperware for snacks etc. Its not too big, and you can probably fit up to 4 scoops of formula in each compartment, I've only done 3 so far. But it works great no leaks and the top stays pretty tight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to get formula out","review":"The lid is almost flat, so getting all the formula out of the spout requires a lot of shaking. I've spilled a bunch of powder on more than one occasion. We have a Munchkin one that has a more tapered spout that is much easier to get the formula out of.Also, this is a cup with a 3-compartment insert. This makes it more annoying to wash since you have to take it apart and basically have another cup to wash.

It's easy to use, good control of the wah. As far as the extra knob for the Bad Horsie 2, it's hard to say if it's worth the extra few bucks or not: It allows depth/shape control, but we played with it and, pretty much, once you've set it how you like it, you don't change it. It's more like a tuning knob than a control knob, in that sense.But the sound is nice and clean and the pedal's tough and can take a beating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some bad horsies get C's in class","review":"I don't totally buy into the vintage thing, but this pedal sounds way too digital. Has none of the percussive qualities of the intro model Dunlop Crybaby. However, it seems ultra sensitive, great for that underwater sound that comes with quick foot movement on the pedal. I kept the Bad Horsie 2 for about five days to give it a chance, then ended up returning it.There was a little glue strip along the top of the foot switch that attracted a bunch of hairs and dust. Hard to clean off.I play guitar and bass, and although the product description reads that the Bad Horsie is useable with bass and keyboard, I thought it sounded terrible on my bass. My Boss ME 50B has way better wah capabilities, and a stand-alone pedal should beat out a multi-effects pedal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Morley Bad Horsie 2 Wah","review":"I have tried a lot of wah pedals, and this is the one that works best for my high-gain applications. Simply screams, with a deep enough bottom end and a not--overly-piercing top end and plenty of midrange. Great as a solo boost with that midrange-Schenker kinda thing.

What the Heck? If you step on it and move it forward it automatically comes on. If you bring your foot all the way back it turns off. So here are the two main problems with this design.1. If you move your foot all the way back while playing it cuts out! If your moving your foot quickly it doesn't seem to do it, but if you are playing a soulful slow solo it cuts in and out every time you move your foot all the way back...Annoying! Steve Vai must have this position memorized, but those of who don't, can potentially keep turning it on and off. No Fun!2. Ever like to leave the pedal somewhere in the middle? Take your foot off and play for a while? A lot of players like to play for a while with one of those cool tones in the middle. Not on this one. If you take your foot off, it springs back to the upright position and turns itself off!I'm selling this thing. It doesn't do the things that Wah pedals have always done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"greatly improved","review":"This is not a stripped down version of the old book, but contains much new material and much that has been rewritten.

Other than graphic accounts of torture scenes, I was left with little feeling for the period. The characters felt cartoonish, even at the end of the book most of them were still undeveloped.

Further, it makes me cringe that someone somewhere made money off of this horrible use of trees.This is just plain awful. Painful. Uninteresting. Painful. Did I mention painful?If you want something more spellbinding, perhaps pick up a book written about colon research. To all future publishers: Let's see to it that Leckie never be permitted to write again. Thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"A screnplay based on Leckies book \\"Hannibal the Conqueror\\"","review":"They are now making a movie based on this trash, and of all people - Vin Diesel is playing Hannibal. Yes, Hannibal did a few amazing things but he was no Conqueror. The real hero and conqueror is Scipio Africanus, Who defeated Hannibal at Zama, and conquered all of Hannibals Generals in Spain. A better read than Leckie, is \\"Scipio Africanus, Greater than Napoleon\\", by Sir Basil Henry Liddel Hart. Scipio was one of the greatest Generals of the Ancient World. A movie about Scipio should be made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste time, money, brain cells on \\"Hannibal\\"","review":"When I got to the chapter where a young Hannibal tames his horse, I put down the book, picked up Mary Renault's \\"Fire From Heaven\\", and encountered the same scene, practically word for word, of Alexander's taming of Boukephalos. The difference? Ms. Renault wrote her book first. And it's genius. Ross Leckie is an unbelievably bad writer, unintentionally funny in a \\"dark and stormy night\\" sort of way. The book is slow, flat, and derivative. But that scene made me close it up and return it to the library. If I'm going to read second-hand fiction, I'm going back to the original source."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for historians or Punic War buffs","review":"Mr Leckie makes it obvious he has not read the works of Livy nor Polybius. He calls the allies auxiliary the Extraordinarii (crack roman troops), thinks Trasimene happened in a valley with a lake at one far end, has the cavalry chase the velites off the field at Cannae and has no clue what Hannibal really accomplished in southern Italy. Definitely not for literate history buffs or ancient military buffs for that matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, Hannibal deserves better","review":"I'm sorry, but this is an awful book. I've never written such a thing in a review before, but I'm absolutely aghast that this thing ever got in to print. The story of Hannibal's war with Rome is one of the most engaging, dramatic stories in world history and it should make for wonderful fiction. Mr. Leckie, unforetunately, reduces Hannibal to a paper thin ogre of a man, and fills the novel with unpleasant extremes far outside what's required to tell the story. That's not to say that I shy away from violence. Just the opposite. I know how violent the times were. But Ross Leckie's writing is artless and that renders all else in doubt. Reading this novel is like chewing cardboard. It's like driving splinters up into your fingernails. Don't do it. Read the other negative reviews on this website and believe them! Await the day when Hannibal finds the storyteller to do his tale justice. When that happens, we might all be in for a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Swinging salsa","review":"Known as Mr. Afinque, Willie Rosario has become one of the finest salsa institutions ever.

Although a bit different from his older salsa dura sound, \\"Plato Roto\\", \\"Ignorante\\" and \\"Atizame el Fogon\\". \\"Mala Mujer\\" is my standout tune on this album, which really is good from start to finish with no clear top song.

Apparently, the box they come in & disc they're burned on cost between $6 & $8, making this a bad value.There is a reason BioWare is selling Shadowguard & Witch's Wake on their website at 2 for $5, & that reason is that Shadowguard & Witch's Wake are incomplete modules with unresolved cliffhanger endings.

It's great because it's not totally holiday, so she will relate to it far longer than throughout December. Little Bear is an appropriate character for her age because the stories stress the importance of family and friends, imagination and pretend play, and respect and love. Many have questioned the use of the \\"Winter Solstice\\" on this one, but as a Christian I really don't mind it because it is relevant to the importance of holiday tradition. My daughter and I are going to make \\"bird cookies\\" to hang on a tree in our yard, just like Little Bear and his family did for the snow angels.I highly recommend any tape or DVD with Little Bear, although I understand that they are becoming out of print now.

Finally a movie for kids that embraces the family & family values. It also shows that Little Bear & his friends use their imaginations to find things to do. What child, grown or otherwise, doesn't like to drop in the snow & make a snow angel every now & then?

Richard S. Tedlow, a historian who teaches at Harvard Business School, neither lionizes nor lambastes Grove. Instead, he provides gigabytes of facts about one of the twentieth century's most demanding and successful technology leaders.

So it's interesting to note that in Loop, he opts to end the trilogy as a whole on a postive note, one of hope and healing. Along the way, Suzuki asks the Big Questions, namely those of existence and the nature of reality.Many reviewers have noted, some to their dismay, that the series shifts from a more horror oriented slant to science fiction. I have no problem with this, as it shows Suzuki's range as a writer, with an ability to work in different genres. If you would like to see the evolution of an idea, be sure to pick up Loop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mind Blowing","review":"Loop is the conclusion to Koji Suzuki's Ring trilogy. Although each book in the series can be read as a stand alone work, it is best to read the prequels Ring and Spiral to feel the full effect. If you haven't read those before, there is a brief synopsis of both novels to let you in on what has happened.In truth, the series is more science fiction than horror, with concepts such as DNA sequences and theology touched upon in profound detail. Before reading I had heard that some would claim this book is a rip-off of the Matrix, not true! The only comparison is the idea of different realities, but comparisons stop there. I found near the end to be some surprising plot twists that to some may sound cliche, but are worked in a manner that works beautifully. The conclusion I must say though, is on a more positive note than the previous two books, I'm still contemplating the series even though I finished Loop days ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its a brick","review":"Not even worth 1 star.Problems with firewire implementation.

However, all I have received from the item is hours of frustration and a high-tech paperweight. The quick-install disc fails to properly set up the range extender. There is a backup, since apparently this is a common occurrence, which requires fiddling with your ip address and then accessing the device using your web browser. I am familiar with this, since I have used a similar process to set up and adjust my wireless router. However, nothing seems to work to make this item do anything of value.

It has definitely improved the strength of wireless signal in the distant sections of our home (working well for iPhone as well as wireless G PC's). Only down-side: Speed-tests for the PC's are a bit slower, but doesn't seem to make much difference on the iPhone internet response times. Worth the price, in my humble opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Support","review":"It is possible that this product works, BUT without support it is just junk. After 5 hours on the phone with 4 different people the range extender did not work.

Hawking is not the only company that has sold its soul, Linkys, Neatgear and the rest have done so. Without support the wireless connection becomes hopeless.

Using it to post my review right now!","review":"The Hawking Wireless G range extender, does exactly what it said it would. That is, extending my current network to usually unreachable ares. Speed is good, link quality is great at 54mbps and have had it for over a week now with no problems. Performs better than my existing Belkin G router. Of course you'd have to expect slightly slower speed when repeating an existing network. Though doesn't seem to be that slow at all. Setup was easy. I was expecting to get something that would take even an avid PC user like me hours to setup. This took me literally, 10 minutes to setup, very easy. Now my PS3, Wii, PC, DS, PSP, Laptop, and iPad can now all access the net from anywhere in the house, even outside. I will also be getting a Hawking range extending antenna for even more speed and range. Thanks Hawking Technologies. Am very satisfied with the repeater.

I said that after wasting two hours with no results, I preferred not to call anyone else and asked for an RMA. After the person I was dealing with checked with a supervisor, he said, \\"no.\\" They can issue an RMA only after finishing troubleshooting and troubleshooting would not be finished until i called Linkysys to get them to change the channel number.

I DID go into the configuration, made sure the assigned IP addresses were correct and tried switching channels (keeping the Hawking on the same channel as the 2wire). Did NOT help. I do get 5 bars all over the house from the Hawking signal, but what good is it if BOTH computers in my house randomly lose the Hawking signal FOR NO APPARENT REASON. Hawking is incapable of mantaining a lock on the signal. I did check with tech support and was told that all of my settings are correct.

I finally figured out that the very small switching power supply doesn't work properly with the extender. If you plug the power supply into the extender BEFORE you plug the power into a wall outlet it will NOT work. If you plug the power supply into the wall outlet first, and then into the extender it will work fine. Even though it will work that way, anytime you lose power it will not work again until you disconnect and reconnect the power cord at the extender. I picked up two 12 VDC power supplies at a thrift shop for $2 each, and now I'm back in business. It does work well as a repeater.After spending hours on the phone with people in India, I called Hawking sales, and got them to transfer me to someone in Engineering.

I really wish they had told me this on the first call- could have saved me HOURS of my life! They suggested I purchase a more expensive product from them that swould do the trick- but after this experience I prefer to suffer through the limited range of my router. On the plus side the tech support line never had a long wait until I spoke with a representative.

Also the sign in on to the Hawking was a bit different with devices than the manual said w/regards to passwords for devices but was able to figure that out too.

That's one of the great things about \\"true\\" youghurt (which can't be purchased anywhere), that it doesn't contain any lactose at all. Use whole milk, which gives it much moore of a smooth taste, don't add the powdered stuff and you'll end up with not only healthy, but great tasting youghurt."},{"rating":"2","title":"very convenient and cute","review":"Simply follow the instructions and the taste is way better than what's sold in the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you crazy????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I saw this unit for $9.95 a year ago.

Yogurt incubator, maybe","review":"I thought this would be like a breadmaking machine--that you would put in the ingredients, turn the machine on and come back to a finished product. Well, no. This is a yogurt maker in the same way that your _oven_ is a breadmaker--you have to cook the ingredients to a certain temperature, cool them to a certain temperature, and then this thing apparently (arguably, judging by some reviews) keeps it at a steady temperature as it reaches its final stages. It may or may not be useful as a helper in this final step (some people just use their oven; others find it doesn't have a low enough setting). However, the initial steps were too much work for me. It doesn't cost much, but it doesn't do much either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use, much better than the old single cup model.","review":"We used to have the 6 individual cup Salton maker and it worked well but was just a little bit of a hassle for people who want to make a large batch.

At first I was confused about all the other yogurt makers on Amazon that are pricier. However, after reading some good reviews on this item, I decided to try it. I must say It turned out to be an excellent purchase. We now make yogurt every night. For the first try, we used the live cultures of commercial yogurt from safeway. We've been using it for about 1 month ever since and it has never failed to create excellent thick yogurt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yogurt maker","review":"Great product. Simplifies the process. Found it important to rinse container with boiling water before adding the milk. Otherwise yogurt was much thinner."},{"rating":"1","title":"This product contains BPA - find a different yogurtmaker!","review":"I bought this yogurt maker 2 1/2 years ago and used it regularly. However, when the recent BPA scare came out, I contacted the company to ask if it contains BPA. At first they did not respond to me at all. When I tried again, they sent me a ridiculous boilerplate message about how the US gov't does not see BPA as being dangerous. I would strongly recommend using a non-plastic yogurt maker (or at least one that doesn't contain BPA, as the chemical especially leaches into food when heated, and the whole point of a yogurt maker is to incubate the yogurt at the proper temperature) rather than risking exposing your family to more of this chemical than they have already gotten. It's upsetting to think I was doing something healthy for my sons by making them homemade yogurt instead of the storebought find, only to learn that they were exposed to extra bpa because of this maker. I am using the glass jar method now."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe the price","review":"I have one of these yogurt makers. I bought the unit new about 4 years ago. The cost was $12.99. Are they really selling these for over $200? I was going to purchase another one, but at this rediculous price I will continue using the one I have until it breaks. Yogurt can be made using a crockpot if it has a warm setting. Put some water in the crocpot and then put in your container of milk and culture and let sit for 8 hours. It is certainly much cheaper than what they are charging for this unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tired of plastic","review":"I bought this as a gift for my wife but when she saw the flimsy plastic tub for cooking the yogurt she refused to use it. I wish I had read the review about substituting a wide mouth quart jar for the plastic tub before I returned the unit.But, seriously, do you really want your healthy, organic milk cooking in warm plastic for any length of time? And even if they say it's \\"safe\\", do you want your kids to be guinea pigs for the industry that gave us #6 plastic baby bottles, now recalled due to the potential for BPA to leach into the milk?When Salton makes a version with a ceramic or glass tub for heating the milk I'll buy it, even if it does add a couple bucks to the cost. In the meantime we've come across a recipe for making yogurt in the crock pot - which thankfully doesn't have a flimsy plastic inner container."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"Works great for keeping constant temperature during incubation period. I like the fact that I make one large container and not many little containers.It does not have automatic turnoff, so I set my stove timer for 7 hours to let me know time to transfer container to fridge.It has two angular indentations in container (the spoon, which I don't use) nestles on the outside of container), so I'm more careful about making sure that area gets cleaned properly. Otherwise, easy to clean.After making yogurt, I strain about 1 cup of whey in Donvier yougurt cheese maker, which I also rated a 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good choice","review":"I'm glad I chose the one quart maker rather than fussing with individual serving containers. The Salton is simple to use and works well.I came up with a good idea for eliminating some of the whey to thicken the yogurt. When you are ready to refrigerate, remove the lid and place a piece of cheesecloth over the container. Secure it with a tight rubber band around the upper edge. Leave it inverted over a bowl in the fridge. By the time the yogurt has cooled you will have drained a lot of liquid. Wash and dry the cheese cloth and use again."},{"rating":"2","title":"great yoghurt maker for the price!","review":"Yoghurt maker is easy to use and makes very good yoghurt! I used store-bought non-fat yoghurt for starter,(natural, no additives), no-fat milk and non-fat powdered milk---nothing difficult about the whole process--just use a good thermometer to check milk temperature. as you don't want milk to boil.

My children love yogurt with every meal. With this machine I always have it on hand.The yogurt comes out perfectly creamy (I use whole milk).I made the first batch using the starter I bought on this site.The first batch didn't set though and I realised the milk might have been too hot when I added it. I bought a candy thermometer and since then I've not had any problems. The book tells you to use a half cup of yogurt to make a new batch. I have made it using the organic yogurt (with a couple of teaspoons of starter yogurt) from the store and that came out perfectly too.The only thing that doesn't work for me, is the timer(?) dial on the lid, because I am very forgetful. So instead I use the stove timer which will beep to remind me.If you are a yogurt lover, then this machine make a lot of sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yogurt making made easy","review":"I have now settled into making yogurt three times a week... After some trial and error -- I use two quart-size - wide mouth - canning jars - that I alternate with. I don't even measure anymore - just eye-ball the amounts. Since everything I purchase is ultra-pasturized I just zap the jar, in the microwave, for a minute - then check temp -- once the contents are at 110 degrees I add the culture. Cook time varies from 10 to 12 hours - again not to concerned with time. There is no such thing as a bad batch of yogurt. . .

Yogurt turned out perfectly. However, directions should say \\"about 30 minutes\\" to cool to 110 degrees. 7 hours warming time seems to be just right. 4 hours, not 2, in the fridge. Don't add any ADDITIONAL dry milk after warming; makes the texture grainy, but DO add it when the booklet says to. I microwaved the 2% milk in the container. I added 6oz., not 4oz, of Dannon plain yogurt after cooling, but before warming, like the directions say."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for specific carbohydrate diet","review":"I'm on the specific carbohydrate diet to address food intolerances, and being able to make 24-hour yogurt is essential. I bought this a few days ago and just made the best tasting yogurt I've had. Unfortunately because I drained off the whey, then let the rest drip out through a lined colander to make creamier, greek style yogurt (you can't use milk powder to thicken on SCD), this maker doesn't produce very much yogurt. But given the limitations of my pots, drip pans and other equipment, a larger maker wouldn't work, so I've just ordered a second one of these. It's extremely simple to use, and small enough to store even in my small city apartment. Also, I read a review of one of the water-filled makers, and the reviewer pointed out that it gets too hot after 10 hours, so it wouldn't work for SCD. This one is perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Yogurt!","review":"Salton YM9 Yogurt MakerThis is a very easy to use, easy to clean simple Yogurt maker. I have had nothing but full success with it. I use Fage Greek Yogurt to start every 5 batches and have tried some others and find they all make good yogurt. Since I like mine a bit tart and as stiff as I can make it, plus, I like the maximum of lactose converted, I just let it 'cook' for 24 hours.My one hint is that I use a 1 qt. sized peanut butter jar which has a very wide mouth which I've had for years. I heat the milk in it (7 1/2 min.-8 min.) in the microwave and then just let it cool and add the milk and yogurt starter and place in the Salton. Since I'm lactose intolerant, rather than pay nearly $4 for a half-gallon, I can buy regular milk and pay about $1 for a quart as yogurt. So much better tasting and good for me as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!!! with one small complaint","review":"This yogurt maker is really so easy to use and makes the best yogurt! My only complaint is the plastic container to make and store the yogurt. I'm not a big fan of plastic. But I have found that a 1 quart mason jar fits inside the yogurt maker perfectly and I use that to make my yogurt and store in the refrigerator. This also enables me to make more instead of waiting for the container to be empty. That being said, this is a great product. I use Dannon plain or Stoneyfield plain as a starter and I have great tasting yogurt in 4 hours.Linda in GAUpdate:Good grief! When I bought this it was $24.00.

It tastes so much better than store bought. It isn't tangy at all. I just let it sit for 4 and half hours and it is very sweet. I hardly need any sweetener in it at all. My kids love it too. They keep asking for yogurt and my oldest didn't even like store bought yogurt, it always made him gag."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is very convienent and easy to use.","review":"My family immigrated to the US in the 50's. Back then we kept a starter in our refrigerator and my mom and my grandmother (Tata) would pass the starter back and forth between them and their friends who were in need of a starter to make their weekly yogurt. You could not buy yogurt at the supermarket. At an early age I was taught how to make yogurt as this was a staple in our diet and in our cuisine. It takes time, patience and nurturing to get it right. When I saw the reviews for this yogurt maker, I knew I had to try it. I work full-time and would rather not have to watch over my yogurt to make sure it is kept warm until it sets. This yogurt maker is so easy to use and the size is just right. I love it and hope others will try it out as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little yogurt maker","review":"I have been very pleased with this yogurt maker. I have made several batches and they have all turned out great. It is very easy to use and has produced wonderful yogurt just as good as any I have bought at the store. I have made only fat free yogurt and the instructions warned that it wouldn't be as smooth or thick as that made with whole milk, but I haven't found that to be the case at all. The fat free I have made is just about identical to what I have been buying. I would definately recommend this product.

I decided to give this yogurt maker a whirl because I could use organic milk to make it, and Polander all-fruit-sweetened spread to flavor it. Both my daughter and I love the results! It tastes so much better than store-bought and is so much healthier. It was not hard to make, either. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is, it has a plastic inner liner rather than glass. I called the company to ask if it was a safe plastic to heat food in (after hearing it's not safe to microwave food in certain plastics as chemicals can leach out). The lady I spoke with assured me the plastic was safe, but could not tell me how she knew that to be true (such as tests were performed and it was safe?). How did I know I could believe her?

After taking the temperature with a candy thermometer, I discovered that there was not enough heat. So it broke after 2-3 uses. Great. This is very typical of Salton products, as I had a Salton Farberware Pressure Cooker (FPC800V) heating element also fail after 8-9 uses, and the company said they could not fix it, even if I was willing to pay. Junk, Junk, Junk. A friend has the Cusianart yogurt making setup, and loves it, but advises against the individual cups. Make sure you get a one quart yogurt maker. Otherwise, clean-up takes longer. This is the one positive with the Salton set-up. Unfortunately, their machines are junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but not for $120+","review":"I bought this probably 5-7 years ago, still works great, love how compact it is, and love the yogurt it reliably makes. I also love that it is one canister, not lots of little jars. My mom wants a yogurt maker now, so I am looking for a new one, but it is crazy to pay the $129 price that is listed currently. Salton should consider manufacturing these again, given how people are getting into making their own food nowadays. In fact, my next stop online is to the Salton website to suggest it to them. In the meantime, I will buy the 2 quart Euro Cuisine yogurt maker from my local kitchen supply store for my mom.

I bought my first one for about $10-15 about 12 years ago, and then they went on clearance for $5, so I snatched that one up. It's easily well worth the purchase price of up to $30 if you're going to make yogurt more than a few times a year. But at $99-250? That's insane. It's not worth that.

The first night I left it in for 16 hrs. It didn't go bad, but it was tarter than usual. This is good for making pinkberry-like ice cream.

I had failures too, but it was due to my errors, not the machine. I like the simple easy-to-clean single container, rather than the 5 or more containers other models offer.I came to Amazon looking for a replacement because mine was lost in a move.

It made reasonable yogurt, but not great yogurt, because it got too hot too fast. Worse, for me anyhow, was that the excessive temperature killed the culture making it impossible to use one batch to seed the next.

I microwaved the milk instead of heating on the stove for 3 minutes, Placed it in the machine and 12 hours later had great yogurt. The yogurt was thick and creamy and was not in the least bit sour.I purchased this machine because the price of yogurt is going through the roof.

No need to buy another appliance to make yoghurt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good, but needs glass jar","review":"I wanted a one-quart yogurt maker, but couldn't find one with a glass jar. I finally bought this in April 2009, and immediately swapped the plastic insert for a glass jar. Finding the right size and shape jar isn't easy, but Costco often sells sun-dried tomatoes in a glass jar that is ideal. It fits inside the Salton yogurt maker. I've bought 3 (fortunately, we love sun-dried tomatoes), emptied them of tomatoes, sterilized the jars, and rotate them for making yogurt. Having done that, I'm very happy with the yogurt maker as we got it at a fairly sensible price of about $24, which I believe is the most anyone should pay for this simple device.Salton YM9 1-Quart Yogurt Maker"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use","review":"I've been making yogurt for friends as well as for myself because this product is so easy to use, and clean-up is a breeze. Everything except the heating canister goes in the dishwasher.

I like to buy imported Greek yogurt, and use that as the starter. The yogurt I make is creamy and wonderful. Very thick, and mild. I love to put frozen mixed berries in a tupperware, and add some of this yogurt and a sprinkling of splenda. By lunchtime the berries are thawed and the yogurt is still cold, to me it's like cheesecake! I also use this yogurt in the place of sour cream, and I make a great Tzatziki by adding a little olive oil and some grated cucumber. I have used it a lot and just love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"I got this a few weeks ago and love it. Very easy to use, easy to clean. THe yogurt tastes better than storebought.

Its simple and my kids love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not necessary but really nice to have.","review":"While you don't need this to make great yogurt it certainly helps to keep things neat and clean.

Now I get the option to make it whole, skim, 2% or whatever. I love this yogurt maker. The only thing that I didn't like was the 1 qt container that it came with. The top doesn't seal and there is no extras available if you want to make yogurt before it's all gone. We came up with an easy solution. We now use a 1 qt wide mouth Ball canning jar. All I had to do is decrease the milk by 1/2 cup since the jar is a little smaller. Now it couldn't be better"},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved it till it started overheating","review":"On the plus side, I liked that I could use a 1-qt glass canning jar instead of the plastic container it came with. On the negative side, after a couple of years it started overheating enough to not fully \\"yog\\" anymore.

It was an expensive lesson, and I won't buy another Salton product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Yogurt","review":"Yogurt-making requires considerable preparation before you incubate it. This product is an incubator, no more, no less. However, it's tops at incubating the yogurt! I made mine with goat's milk, and never tasted better.Although it has a dial on top that tells you how many hours you plan to incubate, it would be nice if that was instead a simple timer that would go off when the hours are up. But I suppose that would be a different, more expensive model.All in all, I'm pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"PERFECT!","review":"I love this yogurt maker. It works great with the standard recipe or with just a yogurt starter. My only problem is that I can't keep up with how fast my kids eat it. I wish it were a 2 quart maker.Recommendations: Add 1 tsp. Vanilla and 1/8 c. pure Maple Syrup after cooling the plain yogurt. Or... just stir in a Tablespoon of homemade raspberry freezer jam. Delish!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"shop around","review":"If you pay more than $28 for this machine, you are being ripped off ROYALLY. The price range for this should be between $16 and $27, max. If you can't find this yogurt maker from an online supplier in that price range, buy another brand. The prices quoted on Amazon are an outrage. Don't bite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works very well","review":"I made several batches of great tasting yogurt using this machine and each one turned out fine. Each batch was made using an envelope of starter though which could get expensive. I tried making a batch with some yogurt set aside from the previous batch but it didn't turn out, I think I waited too long and the culture died. The thing is, you have to use up the starter yogurt within five days and I don't really want to eat a quart of yogurt every five days. Unfortunately I can not buy plain yogurt containing cultures where I live so in order to have some plain yogurt I have to make it myself and use the freeze dried starter. Anyway, the yogurt machine does exactly what it is supposed to do - I used only dry powdered milk and filtered water (plus culture) and had great results. And even though the \\"timer\\" on top is rather simplistic, I find it very helpful to set it to tell me when I began the batch. Also I like that I can put the inner container with its own lid into the 'fridge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great with the right recipe!","review":"I got great, thick yogurt on the first try with this yogurt maker. I didn't use their recipe though. Simply mix (with a blender, if you can) 1 cup of NON-instant, nonfat instant dry milk powder, 1 Tbsp. of yogurt with live cultures, and fill the rest of the container with warm water. The milk powder can be found in most health food stores or bulk dry good stores. By using the dry milk, it's cheaper plus it eliminates all the temperature measuring and you only need 1 tbsp of \\"starter\\" so it's cheaper that way, too. I let it in the machine for 10 hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"will pay for itself in no time","review":"Yogurt came out wonderfully--seemed a little thin after it cooled in the refridgerator for a couple of hours, but was thicker by the next day. It's great to have control over the flavorings (my favorite is Stonewall Kitchen's blackberry jam).

I am just angry about the ridiculous price asked here, from 2nd hand sellers. I was reading an article about this yogurt maker, that it worked well, and was reliable, but they said you could do the same by insulating a container for about 5 hours, achieving the same result. They also mentioned that it was selling for around $18. I've seen it on other websites for $24.95. But guess what, it isn't manufactured anymore. And good luck trying to find it in stock ANYWHERE!

I am very excited!This item is a basic yogurt maker in that it just serves as a container and a warmer. It helps the bacteria to turn milk into yogurt by keeping the container at a constant temperature.The timing dial on the cover seems like decoration only without any real function, and that's why I am giving it four stars (hoping the new model would come out with a timer somehow).Other than that, this yogurt maker is good and worth the penny I spent for it. Would recommend it to friends!"},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect for family health!","review":"This is a great little appliance, particularly if you have young children that you wish to keep healthy. I limit my kids' sugar intake, and this is a wonderful assistant in that endeavor. I never feel guilty giving them FRESH yogurt mixed with homemade jam or berries.

After a few moves from house to house, it went missing, and I've always wanted another one. THIS is it!It's got a great quart capacity, and will ultimately save you money and allow you to really know what is in the yogurt you are eating.

I started out scientifically measuring the temperatures and measuring the starter. Now, I microwave milk in a pyrex bowl(in)for about 5 minutes let it cool a few minutes then pour it along with about 1/2 cup of starter (from the last batch or a new container)into a clean empty Dannon 32 oz. yogurt container (which fits the unit perfectly, is easier to clean, and I can keep several in circulation so I always have yogurt in the fridge!). I plug in the unit and forget about it. I notice the orange power light every time I'm in the kitchen and retrieve the yogurt in 24-48 hours (I like it fairly thick). Fantastic! I buy an 8 oz. plain yogurt (if I can find one, blasted supermarkets usually only stock plain in 32 oz. size) for starter about once a month."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thick creamy yogurt!","review":"I just got this last week and made my first batch of yogurt. I wish I had discovered this earlier and saved a whole lot of money! I like yogurt and with a baby, we having been eating a lot of it.I used 1 qt organic whole milk yogurt, 1/2 cup of non-fat dry milk powder and 7 oz of greek yogurt. I let it incubate for 10 hours.After all the reviews, I expected yogurt that would be runnier than the commercial kind, but I was pleasantly surprised to find quite dense creamy yogurt, even before it set in the fridge. It was the perfect tartness and tasted better than the store bought plain yogurt. I added some preserves and it was quite a treat!I will be making more soon and trying skim and soy milk for our adult portions. I am hoping to figure out how to make frozen yogurt as well.Also, the machine takes up very little space and I actually liked the little spoon it comes with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does its job","review":"This is a very simple product that is designed to do a simple job. It does that job well, however, and at a price that's hard to beat.Sure, the \\"timer\\" on top is nothing more than a dial that you set to a number - presumably the time at which the yogurt will be done. Sure, the futuristic dome and spoon are not particularly useful. Sure, you could do the same thing this yogurt maker does a number of other ways for free/cheap. But, in my book, $20 to sidestep the hassle of using a cooler and/or heating pad and/or pans of hot water and/or an oven is totally worth it.Two tips to keep in mind: Pricier versions come with a thermometer. Don't sweat it - you do need one, but you can buy a simple analog one here on Amazon for $5 or at your local grocery store. You should also remember to preheat the Yogurt Maker for about 20 mins (while you're heating the milk) for best results - once it's up to temp it will maintain the right temp for as long as it's plugged in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Salton Yogurt Maker dYM9","review":"I have just made my first yogurt with the Salton YM9 1 quart Yogurt maker.

I thoroughly enjoyed each of the installments of mystery, murder, and the keen eye of Miss Marple. Geraldine McEwan is wonderful in the series, and each inspector learns quickly of her wit and gift for snooping that always solves the murder. I love how she picks up an unsuspecting amateur snoop to teach along the way, and her nail biting endings when she reveals the true culprit. Usually, I get it wrong each time, which is the fun surprise of mystery. The scenes from the various locations from the coast of England to the buzzing hotel in the heart of London are wonderfully shot with detail and wonder of the English way of life.

If you are looking for something to guide you through their topics using trance or deep relaxation, these may be very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some excellent Stewart here","review":"While many of us old people still smile when we hear the Kingston Trio, which John Stewart sang with after the departure of Dave Guard, I think most of us would admit his best work came after he left the Trio. The recent re-issuing of some of his early work will, hopefully, acquaint a new generation with one of our most unappreciated but best singer-songwriters. With roots in rock and folk, Stewart's music is poetry in the best sense of the word. His range includes melancholy (Wild Horse Road) to hard thumping (Wolves in the Kitchen). At this writing, sample tracks were not available (come on, Amazon! ;} ) but listeners who take a leap of blind faith and buy this CD or who otherwise manage to hear some of Stewart's music will discover there is a treasure trove of his work out there - I strongly recommend the Phoenix Concerts CD but there is no such thing as a weak John Stewart album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still My Favorate John Stewart Album","review":"I bought this album back it 1971 and loved every song.

While other young blues guitarists around the country seem intent on speed licks, Culberson combines tasteful licks with intelligently written and well sung vocals. From the opening \\"Blues Is My Religion\\" to the closing \\"Wrapped In Love Again\\", it's power blues with a feeling. I don't know how something this good gets buried for 5 years.

It didn't. I'm just now reading \\"Ring\\" since \\"Spiral\\" made no sense having only seen the movie of the first book.\\"Spiral\\" is not good. It's not terrible either but it leans toward bad rather than good. Suzuki seems to try to incorperate logic thinking into the main characters but the plot is so ludicrous it's not even funny. If Suzuki wants the characters to get the hang of some mystery, he just lets them get an idea based on absolutely nothing, or make conclusions out of totally absurd circumstances, to get them on the right track.

However, after only 1 month of use,my chainnose pliers broke at the rivet. I called the company and they told me to ship them back and they'd look at them. They determined that I used themto bend too heavy of a wire, and told me that they wouldn't be exchangeable, but would replace them with a factory second, just this one time.I was using them to for a crimp bead, ridiculous!

The book covers the importance of a great attitude, studying body language, the power of listening, building trust, opening closed minds, personal power of the super persuader, and communication skills. It's 152 packed pages of concise, relevant information to help the reader increase their ability to influence others possitively. This is more of an overview book regarding the traits of an ideal communicator. There are many areas of human behavior the author attempts to cover, unfortunately without enough detailed, step-by-step scenarios or approaches. I enjoyed reading the book in high school 10 years ago. Now, I'm enjoying reading the book again. This book helps me understand why people react to me the way they did, and how becoming more aware of the power of persuasion has helped me to communicate more effectively with others, benefitting myself and everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the two-sided version","review":"I bought this for my second child because I was already using the double sided version for my older son. I bought it because I liked the added security, which it did provide (although ultimately I found that it wasn't really necessary - the head of the bed is against the wall). However, I have 3 problems with it:1. It made changing the bed very difficult;2. The metal pieces that hang down to 'grip' the box spring would rip the fabric on the box spring whenever it shifted;3. (and most important) last night the metal snapped, causing my son to fall out of the bed.I'm sure it's a odd case with the breakage because I have always liked Summer products and would still recommend them; however, I definitely think the two sided version is made much better, much safer (no pointy metal ends), and despite some wear on the fabric is still usable today.

I am usually very good at these things, but this was impossible. You were required to depress a metal button to get everything to slide in place.

Coupled with the small Serto font and dithered-out vowel pointing, some of which cannot be read at all, one has to labor visually to find and associate terms.

All those long-neglected works are at last getting their due, with brilliant and sensitive interpretations. This is particularly true of this rendering of Deidamia. The conducting is good, with appropriate tempi; the singers are great, especially Simone Kermes, who has got the right type of voice for Handel, ie, neither \\"white\\", nor with too much vibrato in it.

Those original glasses compared very favorably with the Riedel Vinum line, but were more sturdy and fairly priced at about $6 per stem. These Vino Grande stems are more like white wine glasses - the bowl is too small for fine red wine. They also feel thick and less delicate the old glasses. I'm returning mine and looking for alternative stemware.Update - in looking around on Amazon, the glasses I remember now appear to be carrying the suffix \\"Magnum\\" and are no longer available on Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"not wonderful for red wine","review":"I bought these because they are advertised as \\"vino grande red wine glasses.\\" I bought a similar-titled item 2-3 years ago but they had a different and more red-wine-friendly shape. Actually, they are more suited for white wine or a desert wine. Red Wine likes a large bowl with a thin lip. The glass is high end (spiegelau is wonderful) but the bowl is not large. If you prefer a barolo or cabernet type wine, you would be advised to purchase the \\"burgundy\\" or \\"bordeaux\\" glass which is better suited for most red wines."},{"rating":"2","title":"CD Track Listing:","review":"Track listing1.

To my disappointment, I found countless typos and no in-depth info whatsoever. Sometimes I wonder if the author knows the subject herself... Now, if you're looking for a great book on system administration, check out UNIX Sys Admin handbook by Evi Nemeth and friends... It's slightly overpriced, but worth the money! I hope J. Winsor continues to improve on both Solaris guides, because both of them definitely need to be beefed up. I was hoping Sun would read the books before putting their logo on them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of paper...","review":"I have both of Winsor's Admin guides. The first was suitable for junior admins but close to useless to anyone who new Unix Administration on System V R4 variants and a little about Solaris 2.x. But this book I bought in hopes that when I had problems getting specifics from Sun's spartan man pages I could get a more in depth answer in it. No such luck. VIRTUALLY every time I turned to it the information I already knew was there and the information I needed was stated to be beyond the scope of this book or just not there. If this is Sun's idea of advanced system administration then what was it I was looking for? I would not recomend it to anyone. Shell scripting in an advanced Admin book? Try Advanced user book. I teach Unix and Unix System Administration and the users I turn out must know more than what Winsor expects Administrators to know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost useless reference","review":"I've used a variety of unixes for over 10 years, but I hadn't used a sun since the pre-solaris days. After our company got a couple of ultrasparcs, I tried to use the two Janice Winsor books as references for setting them up, but I found them completely useless. The very first task I needed to do was set up the network interfaces, but, nearly impossible to believe, I could find nothing on the subject in the two books. Then, I needed to set up the suns to resolve addresses through our DNS ibstead of the default NIS. Again, there was no help I could find in the books. A number of other times I went looking for information in the books, I was unable to solve my problems. I ended up using Sun's online docs, which are much more comprehensive and told me exactly what I needed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Solaris Book","review":"This is in response to the general, \\"This is all there is\\" feeling from most of the other comments. For those who are disappointed with this book and looking for another, check out Sobell's A Practical Guide to SOLARIS. It's comprehensive and very well written.

I just bought it and am very happy with it.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of money.","review":"The Administrator's guide is OK. But this one, the Advanced System Administrator's Guide is terrible. I finished the shell script part and the the first two parts. I find out the authors did not explain things clearly.

I've used them for hunting, hiking, ice fishing and snow shoeing. I've even stood in the middle of streams while photographing and they never leaked a drop. I've used them on many 8 to 12 mile snow shoeing/ice fishing trips in Montana and my feet never got cold or sore or wet.

All 10 tracks are taken from the mid seventies period when Chinn/Chapman had been discarded in favour of their own compositions and some pretty muscular stuff resulted. I was never a fan of bubblegum or glam rock and that's why this collection is very agreeable. No singles. No filler. No nonsense, this is good.The guitar work is very good bordering on Purple-esque at times, especially 'Sweet F A' which reminded me of 'Speed King'. Rhythm section is tight and hard working and the vocals excellent with great harmonies. You may not recognise any of these songs but don't let that put you off.Do yourself a favour and discover the other side of The Sweet. If you like your rock hard, heavy with a mix of intellegence, then this is for you. Check out the Zep type riff of 'White Mice' just one of many delights on this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun pleaser","review":"My 2 year old enjoys the surprises around every rock, hill, and tree when she pulls the flaps.

I have read through it myself and talked with two colleagues who have also used it- we all agree that it is filled with useless minutia not relevant to the practice of medicine either in real life or as would appear on board exams. There are a lot of other texts on the market today that are better in terms of their focus and relevance.One other thing that is not reflected in the description: this book contains only questions and answers.

The projects in here are mediocre, at best (e.g., an alphabet or Chinese symbol entirely comprised of round coils, which look ugly. When paying $20 for a book, you deserve to be told which shapes - and arrangement - will be appealing. Another problem is the lack of resources listed - e.g., it calls for a Chinese coin stamp, but gives no hint where to purchase one, and I wasted many hours on Google searching in vain. The entire book is like that - mediocre (or ugly) designs, very vague, insufficient directions, and no hint of where to purchase materials.In short, don't waste your money.

Maybe lost libido is natures healthy response to the culture we live in, which does more to harm a woman's sexual development than help it. Not only do women have to deal with objectification, negative cultural messages about their intrinsic worth and purpose, as well as the threat of rape, but they should have a robust libido in the midst of all this.

I bought this book expecting it to be of the same quality as the columns. Quite honestly, I would have settled for simply the material given in the columns with no improvement. Instead this book takes same material that is so interesting in the columns (the importance of fake kicks, proper sideline attire for cold weather, unusual college mascots) and presents them so quickly that they lose both their humor and informativeness. Part of the problem is that Easterbrook's observations seem much keener in the column, applied to last weekend's games, but I think Easterbrook still could have written a much better book, and I hope he does."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is no credibility in this offering.","review":"I am of the opinion that authors should know a little something about their subject.

Some songs were made much more harder that they ought to be. For example there are occasions when power chords were tabbed when it was obvious kurt was strumming the guitar. Notice this book isn't tabbed by Nirvana, its been tabbed by someone else and is subsequently their opinion how the songs are played.However the illustrations are good, and some of the songs have been tabbed correctly.There are better Nirvana books out there, leave this one alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK for $","review":"I was hesitant.

With each page I turned I felt as if I had read the book before, even though I know I hadn't. There were times during the story when I was confused and had to flip back and reread sections to see if I could understand what I missed. Sometimes, I couldn't find what I missed and it left me wanting. I'm not sure if it is Ms. Thomas's writing in this book or if her content editor wasn't on target. Normally, I find Ms. Thomas's books engaging and moving, this time--well, we all have our off days. I will still grab her books to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUST MAYBE NOT A GOOD DAY FOR ME TO READ!","review":"I was so upset as this was nothing like the Historical Romances that Jodi writes.

If the house falls, then the secrets will be forever buried, and the mysterious person will be safe, or so they think. Potential secrets are not all that might be unearthed. Feelings are brought to light as relationships shift and find new meanings during the course of decision making. Aged sisters with a penchant for rose stealing, a rugged sheriff, a fiesty waitress, a preacher who does not meet the conventional image of a stuffy man of God, and others find their lives converging as the secrets of Rosa Lee come to light.** Though there are bright moments to the book and strong characterizations, it has a rambling quality that makes it easy to fall off of the plot path. As much as I love appealing characters, more focus is needed on the plot to make them work. **"},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete and Utter Disappointment","review":"I was thrilled to get Go Smile as a Christmas Gift - what a complete disappointment.

I had no idea the whole family would love it so much and no recollection as to how good this program is. I'm 37 now and I haven't watched Flipper since I was a little kid. I remember thinking it would be so cool to have my own dolphin and I thought Flipper was so smart, but I had pretty much forgotten the rest. Surprisingly, even though this appeals to children, it is really adult orientated; the themes are adult (ie., a man has been poisoned by a dangerous fish and is laying dying in his submarine; will the ranger find him in time to save him?).This is also a refreshing video to share with children. The boys in this video are respectful to the father and obedient to adults. Adults are intelligent and in charge (unlike in modern kids' shows). Problems are ultimately solved by the grown-ups. Refreshing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Show","review":"I loved this series when I was a kid. The movie \\"Flipper\\" is one of my earliest movie theater memories. I only saw the TV show in B&W; because my parents didn't spring for a color TV until 1978. It's a treat to see this show in color on these DVDs.I am really happy that these two-sided DVDs seem to be much higher quality than some previous TV series DVDs. Also, they released a whole season rather than a half. The increasing trend of releasing half-seasons is deplorable.This is quality family entertainment that has held up well over the decades."},{"rating":"2","title":"Episodes on Both Sides of Disk","review":"After realizing that I had only received one-half of the episodes in the Flipper season 2 package, I thought that I had similarly only received half for season 1.

Unfortunately, my season 2 disks did not use both sides, so half of those episodes were never received."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flipper","review":"I think it was awesome.

Even the film prints were black and white so no chance to see the series on a film projector....but now.....after all these years and several generations later here is Flipper in glorious color! I have to commend MGM for the excellent transfer probably from the original film stock. Looks like it came from 35 mm. The storylines are harmless fun...and yes we can put up with the constant repeats of all those dolphin clips. I'm sure there must have been more than a few \\"flippers\\" involved.

Captain America is merely a one-dimensional character in this storyline. The dialogue is trying at times and the plot is jumbled. I have to say, however, that the artwork was more than acceptable. If you are interested in this character, there are some much better offerings out there. Pass this one up unless you are a completionist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful","review":"When \\"Captain America\\" was relaunched under Marvel Comics' \\"Marvel Knights\\" imprint, it began with about a year of good, solid, thought-provoking stories by John Ney Rieber. Then, for no apparent reason, Rieber was removed from the book in the middle of this story arc and replaced by Chuck Austen, who treated us to inane characters, insipid dialogue and contrived soap opera plotlines that were enough to get me to drop the book. (And having been a Captain America reader for close to a decade, that was not an easy drop for me to make.)As far as the artwork goes, Jae Lee did a marvelous job as always. He manages to fit superheroes into his darker style without losing what makes them majestic in the process. But he was saddled with such a lousy story and bad dialogue that you just wind up wishing he could have given his talents to something more deserving instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth Two Cents","review":"I was already outraged by the storyline of \\"Captain America: The New Deal\\" in which the writers of Captain America seem to suggest that America deserved 9/11. Now Marvel revisits the controversy surrounding the decision to drop Atomic boms on Japan at the end of World War II. In this story it turns out Captain America was against this action and was so outraged by it that the \\"evil\\" U.S. government decides to place him in suspended animation in order to silence him. (Isn't it amazing the way all of Marvel Comics' characters share the exact same political views as the Baby Boomers?). For those looking to read some quality Captain America stories I would suggest buying \\"The Essential Captain America\\" volumes one and two. \\"Captain America:Ice\\" ranks down there with \\"CaptainAmerica: New Deal\\". Both books are incredibly biased and one sided left wing diatribes. Jack Kirby must be spinning in his grave!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book","review":"This storyline comes with a political agenda. If you like having someone else's political views rammed down your throat in a puerile fashion, this book is for you. If you like to make your own decisions on politics, look elsewhere. Marvel allows this \\"writer\\" to undue over 40 years of characterization (next to Superman, Captain America has been displayed as one of the most patriotic figures in the comics genre), to produce this storyline which I'm certain is entirely consistent with the writer's extreme views. Even putting this aside, the writing is poor, the art is no more than adequate, and the story drags. If you are looking for a good Captain America storyline, try some Kurt Busiek/George Perez Avenger Compilations. This book is a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save trees and retire this dog","review":"This book was required for my college class.

They say \\"Both whites and reds show well in it.\\"; 2nd, they're the right height (8.5 in) to fit in our kitchen cabinets (and dishwaher, but see water spots above).

This is an engaging idea for a picture book, as many children are apt to wonder odd things like this, and will appreciate the tone of comfort. Those who know better will find it all funny. The book is marred only by the completely unnecessary ending, where the mother says \\"Merry Christmas, my stinky face\\" to the child.

I am so happy with Bostitch and with the CPO company. My nail gun arrived early (as did my 18v lithium ion drill gun from this company). This nail gun has worked flawlessly and has certainly made it easier to install trim work. I found that the nail gun is easy to disassemble if you need to (I didn't, but wanted to see how it would if I had a jammed nail). It is very easy to use and accurately sets nails to the desired depth.

I don't give it anywhere near a heavy workload though.Also, I'm not sure about other nailers but this unit needs at least 110 pounds of pressure to drive the 2.5\\" nails below the surface. Good to know if your compressor doesn't go that high.I berate this unit heavily for these two very important points not being mentioned in the description."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light and easy to use - but definately reconditioned","review":"My use for this nail gun is home remodeling (my home only). In this arena, the nail gun performs well. It is very light - the housing is made of magnesium. The nails, even though they are not the most popular angle, can be had at the local big box store. It is easy to remove the magazine for clearing jams. .It does not come with a compressor fitting - nor is one pictured - so be prepared to attach your own.

His karate concepts are just copies of what bruce lee was saying years ago.. I thought, he sounded a little jealous! Then, towards the end there's a comparision, to muhammad ali against bruce lee.. Just stupid..Bruce Lee 145lb,at the most, to Ali' over 200lbs, in boxing.. Bruce lee was not a Boxer, he didn't train that way, that's not what he was..Boxer's have rounds to take out there opponent, streetfighting, you want to end it as quickly and simply as possible..Overall, the book, seemed to me, that this author wanted to try to rattle some cages, to sell books.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tao of Davis Miller","review":"If your a Martial Arts fan, you'll be kicking yourself in the head after buying this book,but If you want to read an uninteresting story aboutthe author then you will not be upset,even the reviews on the back cover are a con and written about a different book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still looking for an objective perspective on B.L.","review":"The Tao of Bruce Lee is anything but. The story is largely about the author who drew immense, life-changing inspiration from Bruce Lee's life and then, in the second half of the book, proceeds to nitpick about a variety of the man's flaws including how his jaw isn't optimally shaped for a fighter. I am looking for a book giving a critical perspective and truthful examination of Bruce Lee's life but this isn't it. I got the feeling that the author had a \\"bone to pick\\" or a \\"chip on his shoulder\\" about Bruce Lee. In fact the author seems to have some unresolved issues of his own, which is no surprise given the uncommonly painful childhood he endured.There was some good information in the book but I couldn't get over the feeling that the author had an agenda; to tear down the Bruce Lee legend.

How good is this book? It's one of the most thought provoking, rigorously written, sanely optimistic, and even sometimes funny reads I've had in quite a while.The author's chief problem is that this book may be too thoughtful, challenging and literary for many Bruce Lee fans, even though it is a speedy and \\"easy\\" read. As is true of much serious literature, this book should be cherished and shared. Unfortunately, that is often not the fate of tough-minded writing. In his favor, Mr. Miller seems to be a survivor.

I got the feeling that the writer wrote the book for the sole purpose of trying to destroy Lee's reputation. Sure, Bruce had a lot of flaws, we all do. However, he didn't need to concentrate on JUST the flaws for nearly half the book. He interviewed many different people who knew Lee, and made a \\"Top 10\\" worst moments they had with Lee, where they whined about the days Bruce wasn't nice, or when he did or said something direspectful. Nobody's perfect! Leave the guy alone. If you want to read a good book about Lee's life, this is not it. John Little's work on Lee is MUCH more informative and his books are a lot funner to read.

I find this book to be just the author's personal experience without any interest for the Bruce Lee fan. I must add that the title is great and lead to the confusion of buying the book. If you want a nice book about Bruce Lee buy his wife's bio. It is written with love, has a lot pictures and is easy to read. Bruce Lee was a man with virtues and defects like everybody else. It does not matter how he died but what he did. He changed the martial arts world forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, please!","review":"Bottom line: Chris Mooney can write.Top line: This book is beyond far-fetched; it's badly edited (on one page the hero, Jack Casey, is in a truck with the supposedly good guy, ubermensch/superman [but possibly bad] Malcolm Fletcher; farther down the page, Jack's in a Porsche; then in the next paragraph, he's in a truck. On another page, a cop throws away the same cigarette three different times--a trick I'd definitely like to learn.)Deviant Ways is repetitious, and hardly credible, with a villain who-when he is finally introduced-fails entirely to come to life. He's simply not real.The book is beyond derivative; it reads like an homage to Thomas Harris. And while Harris's books may _seem_ simple, it takes great skill to write as well as Harris does. Mr. Mooney is nowhere near that point. I do think that once he stops trying to ape other writers and begins to explore the scope of his own abilities, he may well write a book worth reading. But Deviant Ways isn't it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not horribal, but a tad cliche","review":"this book was on its way to getting 3 stars, I found that the writer fell into the same ole song and dance for his genra... you could tell in the first few chapters that this guy has read silience of the lambs, However..

I was on the edge of my seat the entire time.For a first time novelist, Chris Mooney demonstrates a remarkable ability to write a disturbing thriller. I was especially impressed by his attention to detail which really brought each character to life and made each chapter seem so realistic. I could visualize the Sandman's every move and feel Jack's inner suffering and victimization.Deviant Ways is a movie in the making -- Lot's of great action, sex, violence and heroism. I can already imagine someone like Harrison Ford playing the role of Jack, and Sean Connery acting as Fletcher.Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great thriller!","review":"Deviant Ways is a great book - a nonstop thriller packed with excitement. Jack Casey is a man who is haunted by his past - as an FBI profiler he saw the worst in people and also experienced the loss of his wife and child. Now trying to start a new life in a small town he is confronted by a serial killer like no other. The Sandman is cruel, gruesome and cunning. Jack teams up with another ex-FBI profiler Malcolm Fletcher to find the Sandman. Fletcher is a dark mysterious man with a hidden agenda which adds another level of suspense to the story.The chapters are written like James Patterson (short, tight and full of suspense). Chris Mooney does a great job of developing the main characters and grabbing your attention early in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like a Bad Summer Movie","review":"Omnipotent villians ... who create wildly complex electronic destruction machines that conveniently fail to work properly when needed to further the story line ... an absurd female character whose only job is to have a flat stomach and \\"perfect\\" breasts (he mentions that a couple of times).

Thing is, if Jack quits now, the Sandman is going to continue killing entire families, and blowing up entire neighborhoods in his quest for revenge.A gripping, well written, and well thought out debut novel.

I did not like it. Found that the main character was difficult to feel anything towards, the foray into Amsterdam's redlight district not understandably connected to the storyline and the story overall seemed disjointed.

Often it's not the story that counts, but HOW you present the story. And oh, boy, Irving has clearly never understood that.By giving his characters a dramatic background, does NOT give them any psychological depth. At all.He basically defines his characters merely by their sexual life, which is not interesting whatsoever, Irving probably thinks he's being progressive using the 'f-word' a lot.His style is poor. Repetetive, referring all the time to events that are coming up and not giving any chance to identify with any of the characters. Partly because they're uninteresting, and partly because of the way he describes them 'the sixteen year old', 'the future novelist'.I advice both Irving and his readers to read some real literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I thought the first third of the book was outstanding. Irving's writing style used here - going back and forward in time - was just beautiful. Then Marion left and the story went haywire. I could never figure out the relationship between Ruth and her father ... it seemed sort of perverse yet there was no explanation as to why that was so. The Amsterdam subplot was ricidulous and I ended up just skipping through those pages, hoping for a good ending.

Unfortunately, he has apparently mined this turf so well that he no longer has anything to add. A Widow For One Year is as exciting as watching a checkers game between two contestants who have no desire to win. Ruth is a dismally flat character, as is her father, who should have been more exciting given that he was portrayed as a womanizing geriatric. Hopefully Irving will soon tire of the Dickens length novels he's been writing for so long, and attempt some slimmer works, as Widow could easily have lost two or three hundred pages and been a stronger novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"The widow according to Irving.","review":"I had such high hopes for this book as I'm an Irving fan, but the characters were so flat and the pages just drag on. I've not had the experience of being in love with the same absent person for 40 years but it makes for very dry reading, I must say. I agree with the other reviews that the first part grabbed me but then it just fell apart.

I read the book waiting for Marion to come to her senses.. and had to wait until the very end to find out and was only given about 3 sentences... And yes.. I did notice an inordiante amount if italicizing... and how about the titles of Ruth's last book. My Last Bad Boyfriend... I don't know.. the whole thing leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Hannah makes me ill...Eddie is just plain pathetic...only Harry resmbles anything close to an Irving character. This book lacks the warmth and humor that carrys Iriving's signature tragedy to a place of learning and growth."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read.

Had it not been an Irving Novel I could not have forced myself, as I did, to finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to Irving standards","review":"\\"Widow\\" was nothing like his other novels. I am a big Irving fan and miss his Owen Meany-type novels. Reading this book was a total waste of my time. Unfortunately, I will think twice before buying another Irving book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, place me in the minority.","review":"I ran out to buy this book as soon as I read an early review--the NY Times, I think. Besides, one of the main characters has a name similar to mine, I liked Garp, and I've always admired a writer who is a Renaissance Man, able to write knowingly of wrestling, running, lifting weights, etc. However, my 17 bucks was wasted, I'm afraid. The book plodded from chapter to chapter, character to character, towards an ending that was all but announced in the first chapter. Overall, Widow was a tedious, mechanical read that was more demanding on me than my matching John Irving push up for push up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tragedy and humor live on in Irving's latest","review":"The lives of Eddie, Marion and Ruth are not nearly as far-fetched as the lives of many of the characters known to Irving fans. They are, however, no less interesting. And the tragedy that he somehow manages to turn into smiles is there as well. While the book is purportedly all about Ruth Cole, the daughter of Ted and Marion Cole, it's really about four different writers, their odd, yet believable, lives and how knowing each other affects their lives and their writing. While I found \\"A Widow for One Year\\" to be a slightly slow start, it's worth the effort to get through the first 50 pages or so....from that point on, I couldn't put it down! If you're a John Irving fan, don't expect the usual Irving \\"weirdness.\\" But do expect a tightly written, humourous, sexy and captivating read."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Tried to Care, But Just Yawned Instead","review":"I gave this book three chances, the last after taking a two-week break from it. It just never grabbed me. The first 200 pages are witty and interesting, but as the hum-drum bore of a protagonist gets older, she loses her appeal. There are some glimmers of good reading in here, but overall this is not nearly Irving's best."},{"rating":"1","title":"wandering story whose characters lack substance and interest","review":"I found the book tedious and almost defensive in its insistence that the novelist is a misunderstood creature. If that is part of his content, I found little to convince me that I should make the effort to understand. I found the characters neither not rich or memorable. The feeling I got was that he had the pieces of three unfinished novels written and decided to publish them without even reading the proofs."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Addict for Three Days","review":"In the Summer of 1998 John Irving may just have been one of the most brilliant authors alive..."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books I have read in a long time.","review":"This book does not measure up to Irving's previous niveau of storytelling, for example The Hotel New Hampshire or The World According to Garp. Too bad.

THEN IRVING WEARS OUT THE READER WITH INCESSENAT ITALICS (AT LEAST 5 ON EVERY PAGE!) AND AFTER THE FIRST TWO THIRDS OF THE NOVEL IT DRAGGED ON AND ON. HIS EDITOR IS OBVIOUSLY AFRAID TO TELL IRVING THAT HIS BOOK WAS 200 PAGES TOO LONG."},{"rating":"2","title":"a change of pace from Irving","review":"A Widow For One Year is different to all Irving's previous novels in that it is a easy character study more than a rollicking character development. The pace of the novel is never rushed, and the lack of highly comic situations noticeable, however the author keeps us interested because he gets us to feel for his characters - even those we don't particularly like. Each character can seduce and repell the reader, which means they are pretty close to real. I was disappointed by Irving's last book, A Son of the Circus as it tried to do too much and yet did not do enough, however, with this one I feel he has returned with a different type of story for us - we just have decide whather we are prepared to accept him in this manner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contrived plot, no characters to identify with,","review":"I have enjoyed John Irving since he wrote Garp. Some books failed to live up to that quality, but this one hits the bottom. The plot is too contrived, rediculous ending and although I love Irving's Dickens like characters and humor they are missing here. Only the pictures of the dead boys live up to Irving's usual inventive twists. His writing is fluid so I enjoyed the book for a while although I thought the premise of a woman who had just lost her two sons would bed a boy of the same age who looks like her son. Typically a man's idea! And why would Ruth and Hannah be friends, but then we don't really know any of these people who care about what happens to them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overly ambitious plot with underdeveloped character","review":"The ambitious plot to span three different stages of a writer's development in a humourous and engaging way could have worked. Unfortunately, Irving's style of writing and farcical story led to a meandering of waffle during the reading of which this reader managed to complete 2 other far more engaging books. It was impossible to empathise with any of Irving's characters and each chapter left a who cares feeling in this reader's head. Very disappointing, but I know a lot of people who loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Many substories support the main plot.","review":"The story in this book is made up of several short books by the author characters John Irving creates. Each author-character's books are read out(at least in part)to the reader. Each story written by the characters enhances the overall plot of a woman's struggle to overcome loss and the effect that abandonment has on so many people. Twisted humor, but intriguing characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"It will be a wonderful movie, and Kevin Kline should be Ted.","review":"This is the first book I've started and finished in my home since my first child was born 3 1/2 years ago--the other three books I've read since then were sneaked in on business trips. I felt sure that John Irving's book would be worth the effort and I was right. The aformentioned three-and-half-year-old looked at me while I was reading \\"A Widow For One Year\\" and asked, \\"Why you laughin', Mom?\\" This is classic John Irving--laugh out loud funny, brutal on his characters, and full of perversity and humanness. It will be a wonderful movie, and Kevin Kline should be Ted."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a dissappointment","review":"Long ago I read The Hotel New Hampshire and fell in love with Irving's superior storytelling. I looked forward to each new novel, and treated myself to A Widow as soon as it came out. I had planned to attend a reading in Boston, but was not able to make it. Lucky for me! Irving refused to sign books. That certainly explains a lot, in my opinion. I hope Mr. Irving comes back to us soon and replaces this pompous imposter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still a hopeful (less certain) fan.","review":"I found this novel to be very disappointing. After struggling with \\"A Son of the Circus\\" (and, finally, giving up after 100 pages), I was eager to read \\"Widow.\\" While I did finish the book, it was not a page turner. I've read the other reviews at this website and, while fellow disappointed fans pretty much covered the flaws in \\"Widow,\\" I noticed that no one mentioned one blatant message that I could not escape (though I tried to deny it):Mr. Irving does not like women.I had heard about a review that called Mr. Irving a misogonist, and I regretfully agree with that description.

Probably because I paid $16.oo for it! The main traits of the characters are continueously repeated. How many times does Irving have to mention Ruth's large right arm and breasts, and Eddie's penchant for old women, and Hannah's constant use of \\"baby\\" and \\"f******\\". Isn't there more to these people then this? I was most disappointed when Irving related the first chapter of one of Ruth's books. Did anyone notice that the voice of the author never changed? Are we to believe that Ruth writes and sounds exactly like Irving? At least he could have varied his voice to make it seem that this particular chapter was indeed written by someone else.

Not that he was ever a GREAT writer, but this book puts him on the level of Danielle Steele. Stick with Garp."},{"rating":"1","title":"John Irving, what happened?","review":"I picked up A Widow for One Year, anticipating another great read by Mr. Irving, who's earlier works, The World According to Garp and Owen Meany, were favorites of mine. Instead, I've found a poorly conceived, puerile, rambling excuse for a novel - seems like a throwaway effort by a truly talented contemporary author. Loaded with badly developed caricatures of characters spouting infantile dialogue, droning in-your-face narrative, in which every subplot line is literally beaten to death by relentless repetition, I've been shocked into a mode where I just can't put this book down - I'm waiting for Mr. Irving's joke to end, waiting for a complete turnaround in style and substance - and if it doesn't come (don't think it will) I'll be more than confused that the reviewers actually liked this feeble attempt. Mr. Irving, what have you done?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Twisted. Very, very twisted.","review":"I read \\"Garp\\" when I was 13 years old and have been an avid John Irving fan since then.\\"A Widow For One Year\\" is an interesting mix of characters: A family who is nostalgic for two boys long dead before the main character (the four year old sister of the two boys) is born, and a young man who was hired to be an assistant to the father of the main character but specifically chosen to be seduced by his wife (the mother of the main character). The young man gains a lifelong friend (the main character) and a lifelong infatuation with older women.The story is separated into three parts, but the first part is the best - it is arguably some of John Irvings best work. Parts two and three finish the story, but don't have the impact of the compellingly twisted nature of part one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best JI book","review":"This is john irving's best book yet.

Who has time to read bad books these days?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful character development.","review":"John Irving is one of my favorite American novelists. In \\"A Widow for One Year\\" he again delivers a book full of quirky, but very human and believable characters within a good story."},{"rating":"1","title":"The first and last Irving book I will read.","review":"Unfortunately, I have no desire to read another John Irving novel. If this is a good example of his other novels, you won't catch me reading any more of his work. It was a chore just to finish the darn book."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT NARRATOR MAKES THIS A GOOD CHOICE FOR BOOKS ON TAPE","review":"John Irving is twisted, perverted, and America's Best Living Novelist.This book is of particular interest to NOVELISTS -- All the main characters in this book are novelists, so Irving is a bit self-indulgent in describing the characters' process of writing novels.There are so many reviews of the hardcover, i'll just say that i've listened to numerous books on tape and this Guidall feller is by far the best narrator i've heard.I definitely felt engaged it the story, which is what it's all about for me. But I wouldn't put it on my \\"favorite books\\" list for which I would reserve the five star rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"What can I say! It's wonderful!","review":"I finished this book in 3 days and I loved it. Irving is one of those writers that never lets me down; I've read all of his books and every time a new one is published I buy it even though I know nothing about the plot. And 'Widow' has everything an Irving-novel must have, it really works. It's hilariuos and grotestque, gross and ... simply wonderful. IMO this is definately one of his best books, it's right up there with 'Garp' and 'Son of a Circus'. For any true Irving-fan this is a must read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"This book is almost pornographic in describing it s many dysfunctional relationships. There is very little else to the story besides a tragedy in a family that creates dysfunction between the characters and how they display their twisted emotions through their sexuality. It dragged on and on about the same porblems until it finally ended the exact way I thought it would end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning Book....Best since Cider House Rules","review":"I am a huge John Irving fan and being a little dissapointed with some of his last books I approached this book witha little trepedation. But is this man back to form or what!! It is wonderful to see a man taking his time with a story and letting his characters grow through the story. The scenes with the prostitute in Amsterdam are both touching and disturbing. WONDERFUL BOOK"},{"rating":"2","title":"Moments of Stunning Beauty","review":"What is said of the fictional children's books embedded within Irving's newest novel can also be said of Irving's own style: \\"You always see what you're supposed to be afraid of; you see it coming, and coming. The problem is, you never see everything that's coming.\\" Once again, as he did so brilliantly in The World According to Garp and A Prayer For Owen Meany, Irving lays before us the lives of Ruth Cole and Eddie O'Hare, touched equally but differently by the tragedy and grief readers expect from Irving. But for his devoted fans, and the reader \\"alert enough to notice,\\" Irving also captures those familiar moments of stunning beauty \\"when time does stop.\\" As the novel draws to a quietly satisfying close, Eddie O'Hare says, \\"There's something so moving about someone's whole life.\\" He may well be articulating Irving's own passion and purpose for writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hope to finish this someday...","review":"I overheard someone saying they were late for a dinner because they could not tear temselves away from this book. I have been working my way thorugh this for three weeks now, and am only 2/3 of the way (I usually read at least one book a week). Granted, it is long. TOO long. I just cannot bring myself to care about the characters, or Ruth's breasts. I want to give up, but feel like I may be just getting to the good part - sort of like with \\"She's Come Undone\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly disappointing...........","review":"I was recommended this book by a close friend, who is an avid reader of \\"titillating\\" books, and she mentioned that this one had a definite erotic edge. Well, it definitely struck out on this and many other levels and toward the end, simply finishing it seemed like a chore. It was a mildly interesting story at best. The only parts of the book that could really count as any form of erotic idea at all were a teenager masturbating with his fantasy woman's sweater. An unfortunate offering from a gifted author."},{"rating":"1","title":"not compelling","review":"I found that I could not sympathize with these characters. Most of them were simply not likeable. It was a really annoying read--overuse of foreshadowing, predictable flat characters, and not very believeable. And the word \\"irony\\" was misused more than once! Nothing good really happened in the book. I wanted to shout out \\"Get some counseling!\\" to each one of the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old, Same old...","review":"I've finished A Widow for One Year and like some of his books, there is the same tired cast of characters. There is always an author, someone who likes track or running, and visits overseas, usually Germany of Denmark, with prostitutes and with street names that are unpronounceable. \\"On the Molensteeg,and in the area of the old church on the Oudekerksplein...\\" \\"This time the prostitutes on the Korsjespoortsteeg...\\" When you run into words like that more than once it gets annoying. Thankfully, there were no bears in this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my cup of tea","review":"Maybe it's me, I just didn't care about any of it. I read the whole thing and it just never grabbed me."},{"rating":"1","title":"not Irving's best","review":"It was a dificult book to finish, Ruth a famous author is witness of the murder of a hooker in Amsterdam, a few years later a street cop (who knew very well the hooker) finds Ruth and they fell in love(yeah right,yuk) I've read some Irving's novels and like his work but this one dissapointed me."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing book with unlikable characters","review":"By far one of the most nonsensical books I have ever read. The characters, while intensely detailed, are unrealistic and entirely unlikable. Ruth is an angry, convoluded woman who is only interesting as a child. Her relationship with Hannah is only slightly more unrealistic than the far-fetched love affair between Eddie and Marion. That we are to believe the \\"love\\" between a 16 year-old boy and a 39 year-old woman survived a 37 year estrangement is ridiculous. The only hihglight of the book is the tragic story of the two boys' accident. However, beginning Eddie and Marion's sexual encounters with Eddie's physical resemblence to Marion's dead sons is disturbingly unnecessary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero stars - only because there is no minus category","review":"One of the most poorly written books I have ever read. It is a shame, given the excellent writers who struggle to get their manuscripts read by publishing houses, that a major publishing house would roll over for the name: John Irving. Did any editor read this? Did the author feel any necessity to craft his work? Or did Mr. Irving simply submit his initial rough draft, complete with parenthetical afterthoughts, shrug his shoulders and say, \\"They'll publish anything I write.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not John Irving's best work by a long shot.........","review":"Perhaps my expectations were too high, but I really disliked this book. The first half was terrific, but the second half seemed rushed and pointless to me. I only wish the book had continued the storyline concerning Marion Cole, rather than Ruth. Once Ruth gets to Amsterdam you might as well turn to the last two chapters, since that's as good as it gets. I did like the last paragraph........."},{"rating":"1","title":"It just went on and on and on...","review":"I started this book with such high hopes. Unfortunately, what a bore! It took all of my strengths to muddle through to the end. I wish I would have given up earlier and not wasted my time. Parts of the story were intriguing, but overall a dud! I am not recommending this book to anyone that I know."},{"rating":"1","title":"I left it at jury duty.","review":"First I'm hooked by good writing, then by a profound storyline, this book had neither. I first attempted to read it while lying comfortably in bed, didn't work. Well we all know how boring jury duty is. I figured that while waiting to grace a panel of fine jurors, it will hold my interest. The book is just plain boring and left me asking the question, why? I threw it on the table with the rest of the magazines and opted to read \\"The Great Gatsby\\" for a second time. They just don't make books like that anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"A story in need of an editor.","review":"I regret enriching the author by one penny in having purchased this book. After a splendid set-up, the reader chases the dream that the little girl will ever be reunited with her Mother. Personally I coudn't care less about Eddie and his sixty times. I'm sick of all the \\"breast\\" references. Did Irving have a bet with someone about how many times he could illustrate a breast fixation? Somewhere in this book lies a good, maybe a great! short story. The ham-handed coupling of Ted's children's books with Ruth's eventual life ( Amsterdam and the Moleman for instance) seemed amateur. I'm disgusted with the success of this book, but it reveals much about the free time available to many Americans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Irving still knows how to push those emotional buttons","review":"After reading The World According to Garp, one of my favorite books of all time, I read all of Irving's prior work. By the time I had finished I felt that I had heard enough about bears, wrestling and infidelity to last a lifetime, so haven't been inclined to read another of his books until recently opening A Widow For One Year. I have to say, he still has the talent for making the bizarre seem believable and for tugging at a range of emotions - frequently all at once, so that one doesn't know whether to laugh or cry. For anyone who likes the Irving formula, this should be a truely satisfying book. I enjoyed it much more than I expected to - even when I realized that my emotions were being manipulated."},{"rating":"2","title":"How did John Irving avoid me?","review":"I am an avid reader, but somehow I missed all of John Irving's books! I found a widow for one year, and I am just now finishing it. John Irving took me from one extreme to the other and I love the characters. Ted Cole, we all know a Ted Cole. Eddie Ohare could be my own son, and Ruth...well as a child, I wanted to wrap her in my arms and protect her, as an adult, she becomes my heroine. I really want this book to not end. I just bought the hotel new hampshire, the cider house rules, and a prayer for owen meaney. I have become a firm and fast fan of John Irving. This is a book that I will read again, with pleasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage, a waste of time","review":"Thankfully, I borrowed this book from a friend. What trite garbage. After reading about 200 pages, I had to force myself to skim it to get through the rest of it. The first few pages are well done. Unfortunately, Irving goes nowhere from there. The predictability of the plot is something I would expect from a very, very young writer. Boring-----"},{"rating":"1","title":"No! No! No!","review":"I am a huge Irving fan who reads most of his novels at least once every two years, but I have to be honest: \\"Widow\\" (along with \\"Son of the Circus\\") will probably be a once every three or four year read. Like so many, I loved the first section; it is Irving at his best - the characters are rich and their hearts are alive. But once everyone grows up, the tale turns into a disaster. So much of a disaster I wonder if Mr. Irving isn't playing some sort of a game with us. Immediately after closing \\"Widow\\" - like someone washing down horrible tasting medicine with their favorite beverage - I began to swallow up the glory of Owen Meany again; Franny and Family will follow."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very disappointing book and a tedious read.","review":"This book is over-long and sloppily written. There are far too many parenthetical explanations of extraneous material or observations already made plain to the reader, distracting from what might otherwise have been great scenes, some of which could have made excellent short stories. I was disappointed -- only great determination kept me reading to the end. Sorry, John. Maybe I missed the point. Were you trying to write a pornographic soap opera, or what?"},{"rating":"2","title":"great and moving storytelling","review":"Irving is back in shape. I was somewhat dissapointed by \\"Son of the Circus\\" but loved \\"Widow for One Year\\". Character development is great. The story is told with a keen eye for details. The main plot and subplots are brought to an end in a satisfactory way. You always know what is coming but, when it does, it does not fail to surprise and move you. The book has some slow passages though. Overall, it is a great book to read. Beautifully written!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The writing is brilliant.","review":"As I read each several pages I thought of another friend to phone or e-mail to tell them that they MUST get it and read it immediatly. On page 240, \\"Stick your right index finger in the ketchup\\" made me need to put the book down and try to compose myself. This is an incredibly written story. Beautiful beyond words-- unless you're John Irving. So as not to be a bore,and carry on further; this is the best book of the year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read GARP instead.","review":"Too many things in John Irving's latest novel are painfully repetitive, for instance...when Marion leaves her family earlier in the novel, the author even wrote at that part that Marion will come back thirty-some years later. As a reader, I'd rather to find that out for myself later in the novel when Marion actually returns. But the author spoiled that by revealing everything too early in the novel and knowing that Marion will return, I didn't have the chance to feel the actual loss of her. The author explains everything too early and then repeat them again and again throughout the novel. Simply a bore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engrossing; excellent summer vacation novel","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this novel. This is also my first John Irving book (if you can believe it?!) and I am so glad I picked it up. From the first chapter...I could not put it down! The characters were totally believable and so well developed. I loved Ruth and Eddie's characters.The only thing I didn't like was the titles of each chapters -- it kinda ruined what the chapter was going to be about.Are there any readers from Toronto, Ontario out there! Please e-mail me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm in mourning; I just finished John Irving's latest.","review":"Irving has certainly matured over time. He is writing now of writing...and that must mean he is showing us a part of himself. This is truly a book for budding writers as there is much to think about in the words of Ruth and Eddie. The story of Marion, Eddie, Ruth and Ted is good reading, too. The only weakness that I can see is in the story of Harry. By the time I got to his background, I was tied of the predictable format of the novel. Still, a great read, one that teaches a great deal about writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling","review":"I was thoroughly engrossed in this novel from start to finish. After having been bored by rehashes such as The 168-Pound Marriage, The Hotel New Hampshire, and The Son of Circus, A Widow For One Year was a refreshing return to the brilliance Irving demonstrates in Garp and A Prayer for Owen Meany. The character of Marion, although not present for a significant portion of the book, was most compelling. Her spectre haunts the novel with sadness and loss. Although the novel was at times self-indulgent (Parts II & III could be shaved down a bit), fans of Irving will come to expect and forgive him for his characteristic wanderings. His ability to draw startling real characters and depict the absurdities of everyday life is in full force in A Widow for One Year."},{"rating":"2","title":"this book made my summer","review":"i opened the sunday paper one week before mothers day to a review of this book and cried when i realized john irving had a new book out. what a grand mothers day gift! i read it with relish and great expectations and i was not disappointed. did anyone think this was also a book about EDDIE? i mean, i know he gets lost in the shadows a bit and we all KNOW what he's got going, but i felt such a tie with eddie the whole way through the book. ruth seemed less feminine to me than did eddie, although they are both great characters. every summer i re-read an irving book; i look forward to re-reading this one again next year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotionally drained, but utterly satisfied","review":"I had not read an Irving novel for a very long time (college perhaps). But Irving's latest was quite a find. It was hard leaving Marion Cole in 1958, but the trip with Eddie and Ruth was one worth taking. Strong characters, page-turning plot and a perfect ending. Who could ask for more?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Was there no editor?","review":"Was there no editor for this book? The long boring sexual escapades are what you would expect from these uninteresting people. I heard it on tape marvelously read by George Guidall. After two tapes I found myself roaring with laughter. I checked the jacket to see if it was meant to be a spoof. No, not at all. This nonsense is serious business. I listened through the 16 or 17 tapes out of curiosity. To the end the characters were shallow, uninteresting, and predictable, lacking in character. They learned nothing in 40 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"This novel deserves no less than five stars.","review":"It seems that many reader reviewers have missed the mark. \\"Widow\\" is, in fact, a masterpiece - which is not unusual for Irving. His characters (including minor ones) are richly developed and far more interesting than most real people.While several reviewers have complained that the novel is too long, my only complaint is that it is not long enough. I could have continued to live in the world of Ruth, Eddie, Marion, et al for many more chapters.Irving, as usual, is a storytelling, picture-painting genius!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book about very interesting characters","review":"Beautifully written about a group of people you like and you dislike. But their stories are always interesting and entertaining. Richly detailed like The Cider House Rules, but not as humorous."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm BORED!","review":"This is the first book I have read in a long time that I question whether I want to finish it or not??? I don't think I get it. Is John Irving redundant or what?? I wanted a story, but I keep getting the feeling that he is just trying to give us filler..... in the words of Shirley McLaine \\"blah,blah,blah\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"And the point is...?","review":"This book was one that I didn't want to put down because of the strange and sordid things that happened to the characters, but once I reached the end, I wondered what the point was. I couldn't identify with the motivations of any of the characters; they didn't seem to evolve much at all throughout the book.This was the first book I've read by John Irving, so perhaps meandering is a trademark of his. In my opinion, this would be a good book to take on a long flight, but it's not a book that will change anyone's life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wordy, colourless, and lacking in direction.","review":"I was so excited to hear that Irving was coming out with a new novel, that I couldn't wait to read it. I can't begin to describe my disappointment in this stupid story. Not only were the long, rambling narratives unrelated to what I'd thought was the main plot, but the timing was 'off' in some of the key action ploys. My feeling is that Irving tries to emulate Robertson Davies, but he shouldn't even try. If he sticks to his own style, as in such works as PRAYER FOR OWEN MEANY, CIDER HOUSE RULES, and A SON OF CIRCUS, he'll be just fine. Just because an author is a big name doesn't mean he can write a good book EVERY time. I mourn the trees lost on the paper for this 'work'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed after waiting so long.","review":"I am unaccustomed to feeling disappointment at the end of an Irving novel. The plot was uninventive. It had a disjointed sense and I felt no emotional attachment to any of the characters. There is a common personality type in many of his main male characters that is getting tiresome.I adore Irving and all of his other novels. This one was disappointing and anti-climactic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of wool pulled over lots of eyes","review":"How could anyone begin to believe that an intelligent, caring woman would hide in a prostitute's closet to gain material for a new book? I was enthralled to the middle of the book but it then looked like an automaton wrote the last half.....a terrible cop-out for Mr. Irving and a total waste of my time and money. I should have listened to the many friends who said they couldn't finish the book........"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed Irving Fan","review":"I have been a fan of John Irving's novels for some time. However, I was recently disappointed with this novel. Irving's characters, most often New Englanders living in prep-school towns have always been humorous, quirky and awkwardly loveable for their flaws. In this novel, Irving unfortunately recycles many of these character types, ultimately selecting a self-absorbed female novelist who is, not only surrounded by an extended family of writers (tiresome in itself), and feels the need to extend her lame autobiographical experiences into her own writing. The plots and sub-plots of this novel are weak. With the dearest intent, I sincerely hope that Mr. Irving has not run out of ideas. Although I finished all 500-some pages; I am regretful to say that the three parts could've been compressed into a mere 300 or so. In addition, I was irritated with the amount of circular (and boring) narrative that surrounded the often sex-crazed (but not shocking) and shallow characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Widow for one year","review":"It is a great book and It lived up to my expectations. It is one of the greatest novels i had ever read!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The same book that Irving has been writing since Garp.","review":"This book contains all of the usual devices that led me to stop reading John Irving after college. It was only at the insistance of a neighbor that I read it at all. The formula-Take a few reasonably well developed though quirky characters, then kill or maim them or their loved ones in ways designed to play on the darkest fears of the reader. The structure of \\"A Widow for a Year\\" is the same one we have come to know from all of Irvings other offerings. While the storytelling is workmanlike, what we have here is a combination of the morbid fascination of looking at a car crash combined with a story with hooks that keep the reader turning the pages. In the final analysis, the experince is a bit like watching an episode of Jerry Springer."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed in this book.","review":"I had heard so much about John Irvings work, that I couldn't wait to start this book. I valiantly struggled to finish it, but gave up before reaching the halfway point. The tedious style of writing did nothing to enliven the characters.I found I was becoming irritated when Ruth, as a child, asked the same questions incessantly. I also couldn't see how diverging into every minor character's mundaneness was central to the theme of the story. Maybe you just have to be a fan, but my advice--skip it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this what happens to all writers","review":"I really loved almost everthing Mr. Irving has done but it seems that, like many writers, he has run out of creativity andonly writes about being a writer. Sometimes over and over. I am just tired of writers writing books where the main charaters, in this book it seems like even the pets were writers, are writers. I think it lacks creativity. More bears and less writers!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Will this ever end?","review":"I normally devour novels. This took me from August through February to finish.

Forget this one!","review":"Sorry Mr Irving...after 150 pages the hard going got too darn much and I packed it in.....not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"I absolutely love John Irving. The Cider House Rules and A Prayer For Owen Meany are my two most favorite books of all time. I was very dissapointed with this book to say the least. I'm not sure how to fully explain my thoughts on the book. It seemed like just when I was starting to like the story or a character something would and I wouldn't like the character or the direction of the story. I tried very hard to like it while I was reading it and it never happened. I agree with what on reader said about it lacking warmth. None of the characters seem to have any passion behind anything that they do. It seems like they move on sick compulsions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't live up to the hype","review":"A Widow For One Year was our pick for my book club this month and it left me wishing we'd picked something else. I don't know why reviewers thought this was comic or interesting -- the hype surrounding it is just hype. No one in the book is likable; the actions the characters take is not believeable. It seems to be a book about sex and people who refuse to grow up and get on with their lives. Dissapointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"Sorry, after getting half-way through this book, I couldn't summon up any interest in finishing it. No particular complaints; sometimes an author leaves a reader wondering why he bothered to write a book and why the reader should bother to read it. (Not finishing a book is _very_ rare for me.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"No!!!!!","review":"Please don't judge John Irving by this book! I sat down excited to start and found myself plodding through this book for the next six months. I loved \\"A Prayer for Owen Meany\\" and \\"Cider House Rules\\" so much I was about to declare John Irving my favorite author ever. Now I must read a few more of his works befor I can award him this distinction."},{"rating":"1","title":"By far, Not His Best Work","review":"Having read the majority of Mr. Irving's works and throughly enjoying all have have read, I was sadly disappointed with this novel. Editorial reviews, which I have now learned to ignore, claimed that Ruth was one of his best characters yet! Where they reading the same book I was? Ruth does not possess any of the flare that his other main characters often have. She, and the other characters in this book, is dull. I had to force myself to finish this novel. I usually look foward to re-reading his novels, this novel will most likely end up in a garage sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I was a widow from this book...","review":"Widow for a year was one of those books you keep reading and hoping that it will finally hook you. This book never did. I was bored out of mind and found it better that tylenol pm to get to sleep. Please don't make it into a movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Writers Who Love Themselves Too Much","review":"It seems a shame to me, when writers make their heroes and heroines novelists. Can't they be a bit more imaginative? All the main characters are writers. The most fascinating part of the book for me was Ruth's investigation into Dutch prostitution as research for her book. It was terribly exciting, believe me, I was right there behind the curtain! The sexual encounter between beautiful 16 year old preppy Eddie and the elegant Mrs Cole was also quite titillating but his life-long continued enfatuation quite ridiculos. I feel slightly embarassed to say John Irving has a very high opinion of himself, which I share, but for all the wrong reasons."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pseudonym?","review":"I am very disappointed in this book. To me it was idle ramblings of a bored writer. It contained long passages of repetitive descriptions, which in my mind had nothing whatsoever to do with the story - for the was a story there but it was overpadded with witter. The book could have easily been editted down to 100 pages. Maybe John Irving is a pseudonym for Eddie O'Hare!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointed","review":"I want to say that first and foremost I am an avid reader, always giving a book a chance. After reading 90 pages of this book and waiting for it to show signs of hope I gave up. I was very surprised to see that it was a New York Times bestseller and notable book. I guess I should of read some of his better books first because after reading the reviews on this sight I saw that this was not one of John Irving's better books. I felt the book was very boring. I also felt that it had no plot, I just couldnt keep interest. I'm sorry if I have offended any Irving fans, but I just found that the author gave to much information. I found myself wanting to skip paragraphs, which I never do."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a book without heart","review":"If you're looking for an engaging book and you've heard John Irving is fabulous, skip this novel. You'll be disappointed. Try A Prayer for Owen Meany instead.Irving tells his story from such a great distance that none of his characters are people you can care at all about. The language is crude and the plot relies so heavily on absurd coincidences, that as I turned the pages, I became more and more frustrated. It is possible to create a fantastic ending or story arc if a writer has the right touch with humor and surprise, but in this work, Irving seems like he's \\"phoning it in.\\"He touches on important issues and there are touching moments. Some of his narrative devices are effective and compelling, but overall the book lacks a soul. Skip this and look for John Irving elsewhere. You won't find him here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who cares about these characters?","review":"Going back to F. Scott Fitzgerald and beyond, it's the same old dilemma: Rich people make boring characters, and we don't care about their various dysfunctions and neuroses.There's not one likeable character in this book. They're all a bunch of spoiled, Volvo-driving, squash-playing yuppies.Maybe Irving was trying to do satire here, but the subject matter isn't worth satirizing.Irving is a very florid and wordy writer, in the tradition of Dickens, whom he admires. Well, at least Dickens wrote about real people, with real conflict coming from external circumstances. The conflict here comes from the pathology of the characters' sick and narcissistic minds--people who never had a creative thought in their lives because they were too busy worrying about \\"themselves.\\" Who cares?Irving's novels always remind me that humanism is a hopeless philosophy."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Irving is on familiar ground- right where we want him.","review":"John Irving has always been fascinated with the dynamics of unconventional families and the behavior of their often quirky members. Throw in some erotic undercurrents, remarkably detailed vignettes about each character, and a healthy dose of dysfunction and you have all the ingredients of a John Irving stew. This one is emminently readable, with only occasional lapses into superfluous exposition, and the characters and their bittersweet tales are equally compelling. A Widow For One Year is neither fast-moving nor economical, but the prose has a calm, almost luxurious feel that remains steady until the final, atypically satifying resolution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Betrayed by a lazy John","review":"I wish I had waited for the paperback so I could have wasted only seven bucks. A Prayer for Owen Meany and The Cider House Rules are two of the best pieces of new fiction I have read. A Widow for A Year, however, is a big disappointment. After the first part, this life story in three parts is simply a boring rehash of Irving's themes. Don't waste your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Find another book...","review":"After a strong start, it's all downhill--unless you're really a fan of trite plot, unconvincing characters, and a cliche ending. Don't judge a book by its author."},{"rating":"2","title":"GARP, IT'S NOT - BUT . . .","review":"I love John Irving's books, so when I saw this new title I was delighted to add another to my library. I was somewhat hesitant when I saw \\"thanks\\" to the Dutch Government, but, I thought, look what he did with Austria in \\"Hotel New Hampshire\\". Well, I finally read it and, although I could put it down, it was far better than I had expected. It was not pleasant, but interesting. Many of the characters are true to life, others - well, just a bit far-fetched. This book is not the tragi-comedy \\"Garp\\" nor \\"HNH\\" is. There is far more tragedy than comedy here, excepting some of \\"Dad's\\" escapades. If you love Irving, do read this book, but don't expect it to reach the level of what he has done before. Enough said!"},{"rating":"2","title":"must read!","review":"I loved the book - as others, had trouble really getting into it at first, but towards the middle, the plot and characters pulled me in, and didn't let go. Being Dutch, I can also add Irving has done an EXCELLENT job at not only getting all the Dutch names right, but he also obviously has spent quite a while roaming the streets of Amsterdam: I could not find one single mistake or 'made up' fact. What a wonderful book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Job :)","review":"This book totally got me into John Irving. It started out a bit slow and there are some boring parts, but i like how this story went throughout ones lifetime, it was so real and the emotions were flowing. I definitely suggest reading this book :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Irving's Mid-write Crisis","review":"To be plain and simple about it...this is hardly one of Irving's greatest accomplishments. It doesn't even touch \\"The Cider House Rules.\\" Don't get me wrong, I finished the book and managed not to be thoroughly disappointed...but one thing is for certain, it did not leave me in anticipation every time I put the book down. While there is no doubt that John Irving is a talented (if not brilliant) literary novelist,this saga of the life of Ruth Cole was slightly better than luke-warm.I'd have to say that Irving should have spent less time with incessant detail and more time with raw emotion...I saw little of that here.In a nut shell, I found this novel to be somewhat predictable...and without trying to sound ridiculous, it seems more like it would have been written by Danielle Steele."},{"rating":"1","title":"I waited for this?","review":"What a disappointment - I struggled through the first part of the book and then decided that life is too short to have to endure such bad writing from the man who gave us Garp, Owen Meany and The Hotel New Hampshire. Mr Irving, you have failed us - shame on you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Irving's Best Work","review":"WIDOW is not as compelling reading as was GARP, CIDER HOUSE, or OWEN MEANY. I found it tedious and overly long for the story it offers. The characters were interesting, but disappointingly not fully developed. Curiously, I found myself more interested in reading Ted Cole's children's books than in finishing WIDOW. The scary children's book ideas were intriguing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sex and Crime isn't enough for an Irving fan","review":"Being an Owen Meany addict I was very dissappointed about the Widow's blandness. Somewhere in the book it is mentioned that fiction authors shouldn't go autobiographic. I believe that Mr. Irving should stick to his own advise. Keep inventing the unbelievable and unreal - I guarantee I'll stay your fan! Sex and crime doesn't suffice for an Irving fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"An incredible book, keeps you up at night reading it.","review":"The detail of characters was very in depth. You actually feel like you know them. Once you get into the story, it is very hard to put the book down. I finished it in 5 days. I haven't read any of J. Irvings other books, but I plan on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and too long--avoid this book!","review":"I'm a long-time fan of John Irving--loved \\"Peggy Sneed,\\" \\"Son of the Circus,\\" \\"\\"Garp,\\" etc. However I was very disappointed with \\"Widow.\\" After 301 long, boring pages I gave up--something I seldom do. The character development is OK but not that interesting. The main problem is lack of a plot and endless words that drag on and on and on. I was disappointed--recommend you avoid this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for die-hard Irving fans","review":"As a huge fan of JI, I was disappointed in this book. It's not a bad book, but it's not Irving. It didn't grip me as much as the others, wasn't was funny, and the characters weren't a memorable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is this a best-seller?","review":"I really do not understand. I enjoyed The World According to Garp, I tolerated his other books, but A Widow... just bored me to death. I gave up reading it about 2/3 the way through, and I have never in my life stopped reading a book. Fellow readers--this one is not worth the time or effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, Touching, Thoroughly Engrossing","review":"From the first page, John Irving's new book is nearly impossible to put down, as Irving whizzes through a brisk and marvelously laid out plot. With his flowing prose and his intriguing characters, Irving has created a masterful novel full of gripping surprises and overwhelming emotions. Amazing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, waste of time reading. Depravity. Much too long.","review":"I found this book to be boring, and a waste of my time. Irving overdoes the sex thing. There was no real substance to the book, and went off in too many different directions. Much too long and drawnout. Could have been effectively said in half the pages.Disappointing reading and a waste of my money."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Irving's various alter egos.","review":"Is John Irving a blend of Ted and Eddie with Ruth and/or Marion his feminine side in real life? Irving is my favorite author so perhaps I am biased. Humorous, outlandish, and moving. I always end an Irving book with lots of questions and this one is no exception; however, the rushed ending may have something to do with this. All in all, a good read and a must read if you love this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"female Garp, only less so","review":"It is only because Irving is so good that his readers can be so critical of him. He is simply a magician at his best, and a con artist at his worst. Undoubtedly, Widow displays his wonderous magic, but as an avid reader, I anticipated all of the tricks and even knew when and where to expect them. But, that doesn't make them any the less wonderous..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not his best, but if you like Irving...","review":"I am actually a big fan of John Irving, and I enjoyed the book very much. But writers as fictitious characters are, generally, not interesting to me. Otherwise, it's a pretty strong effort and worth reading, but be forewarned that this isn't \\"Cider House Rules\\" or \\"Prayer for Owen Meany\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book I've ever voluntarily read start to finish","review":"Did John Irving really write this or did he employ a 7th-grade ghost writer? He reduces his main character Ruth, a supposedly world class literary fiction writer, to the size of her breasts. Obsess much? There is only one mildly likable character (Eddie) -- even the 4-year-old children in the book are annoying. The children's dialogue is completely unbelievable, unless these kids are intellectual freaks. The entire book is littered with exclamation marks, which remind me of \\"applause\\" signs so a TV studio audience knows what's \\"good.\\" But you won't walk away from this book empty-handed: you'll get a wonderful recipe for stir-fry shrimp, John Irving's work-out routine and a few squash-playing tips. I'll be happy if I can get $2 for this thing at a yard sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irving at his worst","review":"After reading Hotel New Hampshire and A Prayer for Owen Meany (one of the best books I have EVER read), Widow for One Year was completely dissapointing. The characters are dull and not well developed, and worst of all the plot resembles a Lifetime movie. If you like Danielle Steele or romance novels, I recommend this book highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Fun Ride!","review":"Like waiting for a long time for a bus , I plodded through this monotonous, boring story waiting for the 'masterpiece' to appear, it never did. I wanted to give up on it many times but felt I'd already invested too much. I had not read a John Irving book since the Hotel New Hampshire (which I loved) and I had high hopes for this one.I found the characters one dementional and the plot unbelievable. Other than Marion the characters were neither likeable or compelling as well as inconsistant (ex: Ed emerges as a confidente youth after his summer with Marion only to come back 30 + years later as a bumbling hack?). I also found it all highly predictable. I was so sick of hearing about those picture hooks, and photos, UGH!!! Possibly the most intersting story, Tom Coles involvment with a mother and daughter he never even goes into. I really feel I wasted good reading time, I should have just walked!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable!","review":"I'm surprised that many reviewers recommend this book as a good one for first time readers of John Irving. As a first time reader of John Irving, this book might be my last. It wasn't the prose or even the characters that bothered me, but the foundation of the story itself.As a mother of a 16-year-old boy, I find it utterly implausible that anyone could believe that Marion would seduce someone that reminded her of her dead son. Do we have reason to believe that she had fantasies of incest? Did her perverted husband have reason to believe it?You don't have to be a prude to find the multitude of references to masterbation and to the size of Ruth's breasts tiresome. This book is heavy on sex, and light on reality."},{"rating":"2","title":"I forgot how much I love John Irving","review":"until I read this book recently(well, I listened to it on 20 cds over the course of about 2 months). I've loved all the Irving books I've read, but between each I forget how attached I get to the characters and how satisfying it is how he ties up any and all loose ends so elegantly.I also love that I don't know his characters, they are not like anybody I've ever met. I've never known a man obsessed with the same woman for 40 years, who hasn't been able to move on. I've never known a woman who lost her 2 sons as teenagers and then left her 4 year old daugher out of extreme sadness. I've never known an alocoholic squash player who is also a caring father and excellent driving instructor. Perhaps I've known a successful writer with lovely breasts, but not one who ever witnessed a murder. And so on. That is why I love this book - I got to meet new people. It made me laugh, it made me cry."},{"rating":"1","title":"I could hardly bring myself to keep reading","review":"This book dragged on for so long that I had the hardest time finishing it. I put it down one day and didn't pick it up again for about 6 months. I just wanted to finish it so I could say I'd finished it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome back on track, Mr Irving.","review":"All that really needs to be said about this book is \\"Thank you, Mr Irving.\\" If any journalist bothers to read what the author has written, there can't be many questions left to ask - all the answers to why and what he writes are covered in the text. And after having just read a bunch of Grisham botpoilers, it was such a relief to read a story told with real style and panache. \\"It's okay Ruth, it's just me and Eddie.\\" Loved it. Next please!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho-hum...","review":"I have been a fan of Irving's work in the past, but I found \\"Widow\\" a bit of a non-event. Mercifully Irving has abandoned his obsessions with bears, Vienna and wrestling, the familiar theme of prostitution (that is not sleeping with, but simply talking to prostitutes, as in Garp) surfaces again in this work.While the story is entertaining enough, the writing fails to sparkle. Irving's repeated use of italics for emphasis is grating. And as for other reviewers who have remarked on the absence of coincidences in this,as compared with Irving novels, wouldn't you call a family where mother,father and daughter (and the mother's ex-lover) are all published writers a little unusual? Give it a miss. Read \\"Enduring Love\\" by Ian McEwan instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"yawn....z-z-z-z-z-z","review":"The desperation of the movie industry's tendency to produce movies about movie-makers is surpassed by this writer's writing about writers. John, put away the \\"Playboy\\" magazine and get out of the cabin once in a while!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I could not put it down!","review":"This book starts out slow, and may lose you at times, but I really enjoyed it. Stick with it...because the story is really interesting. I could not wait to sit down and read more! I am excited to read more of Irving now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"next book..","review":"I found this book to be too long for the actual story it told. It went on and on and on and by the time I was finished I was totally unsatisfied. Blah-blah-blah-blah-blah...finish it already. I loved Owen Meaney but this was a major dissapointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irritatingly simplistic","review":"John Irving is too idiosyncretic a writer to doubt that the same person who wrote 'A son of the circus', which was immensely entertaining and captured the flavour of Bombay amazingly well, allthough he had been there for only two weeks, has now written 'A widow for one year', which is boring and irritatingly simplistic, and full of home-grown psycho-analysis. He must have thought to write a children's book this time, and the publisher decided to publish it as an adult one because of the subject matter. Plus all the characters are unsympathetic and not very credible, especially Ruth's mother, who abandons her child and has sex with another. I wish I hadn't bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Production-line,commercialized story","review":"This is the lowest quality novel produced by John Irving. The plot, cheesy and disconnected, a conglomerate of various mini stories, is almost an attempt to create an interest around a rather blunt storyline. The quick, gratuitus conclusions to each story (violent lovers get their knee broken, murderers get discovered, the bad guys run into the end of their line) will make good airplane reading - if there's no sit-com on the screen. Even worse, the writing style itself is not up to par with previous writing by Mr. Irving. The language handling is hasty and unworthy of previous examples."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real page turner.","review":"I finished the book during my vacation within three days. I was enchanted by the people in the book. Couldn't put the book down. Also because a part of the story took place in the Netherlands (that's where I live). My verdict: well not as good as 'Owen' and 'Garp' but much better as 'Circus'. Happy reading!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boos from a fan of many years","review":"This book is an embarrassment. Irving must know that since the paperback version has an interview with him appended as a feeble attempt to explain to us why he wrote such a bad book. It was also offensive both in storyline, character development and presentation. Mr. Irving, please cease your habit of emphasizing words via the use of italics. It was distracting at first and then just plain annoying. I cannot believe this mess was from the same author of Owen Meany, Garp and Ciderhouse. I am so terribly disappointed and angry at the time I spent trying to find out if anything of any merit was being said."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Prayer for John Irving","review":"A Widow for One Year is so literarily thin and implausible of plot that the only device which might have salvaged it would have been to have all the characters sporting bear costumes. It rates one star for making a good paper weight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Character Development","review":"This book is definately a character study. It's well written and enjoyable to read. It takes some surprising turns and some of the characters are laid bare in a very raw and \\"real\\" way. It taps into the neediness of humanity. Not a lot of \\"plot\\" per se but definately an overall great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"John Irving needs an editor badly","review":"If you think back to Garp and earlier novels and compare them to his most recent novels you get the notion that Irving has lost all sense of editorial constraint. Yes, there are some mildly amusing monents but they are few and far between. I used to wait eagerly for a new Irving novel and I had high hopes for this new one. I fear he has lost his muse and is just writing on technique with noheart to back it up. John- reread Cider House andOwen Meany. Maybe you can find your way back byhome. Try writing a 300 page novel next time andleave out all the filler. I think I'll go reread Owen meany."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down","review":"A fun read - great characters and kept me interested until the end. I have recommended this book to several people and everyone has enjoyed it. Well worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Widow\\" begs for your attention.","review":"Once again Irving has created an odd lot of characters, mostly likeable, although in the case of Ted, it is sometimes difficult. Read this book with your disbelief willingly suspended. There are a few too many hard-to-swallow coincidences coupled with a pat ending to make this a GREAT novel, but as usual you read Irving for his well-drawn characters and his ability to create comedic situations on a par with the best of them. The scene in which Ted breaks up with one of his paramours is worth the price of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this the author of The world... Cider House rules...","review":"Having so enjoyed Mr Irving's first books, this is a real disappointment. The story line is unfocused and the characters loose in being too detailed. None of them are people you would want to know. The subplots and interminable descriptions that add nothing to the drama or comedy (e.g.the time spent in Amsterdam) are distracting. Mr Irving's habit of underlying seems to indicate that he doesn't think the reader of sufficient intellect to \\"get it\\". The humour is just too facile. All in all, in the same league as his last novel. Has Mr Irving lost his abilitiy. Hard to think."},{"rating":"1","title":"First and last Irving I'll read","review":"It's pretty obvious from reading the other reviews listed here that people either liked this one or hated it. I'm with the latter group. The book starts off with what seems to be a lot of potential (I don't have a problem with reading sex scenes or with improbable coincidences if they're used cleverly). But the book goes downhill fast. First, the characters quickly get vague and boring. I wound up not liking any of them, except, oddly enough, for Ted, the drunk womanizer, and Harry the cop. Irving apparently has a really superficial understanding of women, how we talk, how we think. And I got really tired of the constant references to Ruth's breasts; not only was it excessive and superficial, it was also boring reading the same word over and over again (there are some other terms, albeit vulgar ones, that would have worked much better within the context of the story, would have been much more realistic, and would have added some variety and texture)."},{"rating":"1","title":"How the mighty hath fallen!","review":"The beginning was kind of amusing and beguiling, but the second half of this book left me with literary heartburn. I'm afraid Irving once more fails to live up to the standards he set in *GARP*. In the end, Widow is as trite and predictable as a one-star movie plot, and I couldn't wait for it to be over."},{"rating":"1","title":"A VERY LONG, DRAWN OUT BOOK","review":"This is the first/only book of John Irvings I've read and probably the last. Although I DID enjoy the book and the characters, his writing style is just too wordy for my tastes. I found myself 'speed reading' through parts of it just to FINALLY get to the end. If the book would've been half the size I would've rated it higher because the story and characters ARE interesting and I found sympathizing with Ruth and all that she had been through."},{"rating":"1","title":"FOR SHAME, JOHN IRVING","review":"I was sorely disappointed in this book. As somene who loved Owen Meany and the intricate messages underlying, this novel was porely crafted, and a sad regurgitation of what is obviously the same plot line or a trauma of Mr. Irving's youth. Mr. Irving, we who selectively choose our books and are not entertained by the Harlequin caliber or the Kay Scarpettas of the fictional world expect more from those whom we know are more talented. We are not easily amused by aggregious sex scenes, cumbersome alduterous relationships and unfulfilled women seeking healing from the emotional scars of their youth. Digest the world a little more thoroughly and possibly seek a sabbatical. We are harder on you because we know you can do better, and somehow this makes us even more indignant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Y chromosome fault","review":"Another bestselling novel about men abusing women. Only a man would write a book like this. Irving portrys women as objects once again, so easily picked up and thrown away. It's not funny. It's not interesting. Why do publishers allow this sort of book to merit being printed when read by any ethical member of society that loves another human would have rejected it? It was totally worthless. I read it as part of a book club. I would NOT recommend purchasing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read overall","review":"This book is artfully crafted and I can't help but admire the way that Irving weaves together seemingly random incidents and complete characters to create his novel. \\"Widow..\\" fits together like a puzzle, going in an almost full circle and falling together in the end. I enjoyed most of this book, though there were tedious parts. Some of the characters rubbed me the wrong way -- Hannah, for example, and Eddie when he got older. The first half of the novel was a little better and more engaging than the second half, which is always a little dissapointing, but it wasn't enough of a difference to really stop me from enjoying the book. And it WOULD be a good movie, though I think the director would have to make Marian a little younger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really disappointing","review":"John Irving has a nice style, but does he really have anything to say in this book. Maybe I just didn't get it, but I couldn't wait to finish it so I could go read something else. And why are so many of his characters writers?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Snore City","review":"I guess Irving is trying to be Wally Lamb - trying to make it to Oprah. Whatever the case, this is a weak and silly book. The characters are all reroutes of those created by better authors, and the plot is senseless."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Irving fans only. Others won't get it.","review":"Not a classic like Owen and Garp, not a total waste of time like Circus, this novel will be lost on those not already familiar with Irving (unless they like the word breasts). I think his next work needs a character or two that the reader can really care about."},{"rating":"2","title":"A delight for lovers of books, the makings of an author.","review":"Irving's novels rarely miss for me, and Widow for One Year is no exception. While I did not find myself as emotionally entralled as with my two Irving favorites (Garp and the Cider House Rules), I found plenty of enjoyment nonetheless. Although Irving frequently sets the stage for his characters developing as writers, Widow explores the histories and psyches of several characters' development into all sorts of authors. From the bestselling protagonist to her morbid children's story writing father, all sorts of writers are explored. As an avid reader, I loved the typical Irving slant to the behind-the-scenes worlds of novelists and their novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the Deuce?","review":"Personally, I can't understand why anyone would want a book with a picture of the author on the cover.

Overall, a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down.","review":"After reading some of the customer reviews, I totally disagree with the negative ones. Boring? I don't think so. I really enjoyed this book. To me it was one of those books that you would like to start and not put down until you've finished it. I found it quite interesting and I really love his writing style.

They can be quite harsh - even gruesome.That said, this is a wonderful and scholarly collection of African-American tales. These tales have a different feel and cadence from the better known European tales. I love them for their novelty.The book is divided into different sections - if memory serves me - trickster tales, Carribean, Creole, and many, many more...

The book shows us the horse behind the legend, for what he really was, no superhorse but just a racehorse like all the others. With good days and bad days a real horse, who looses shoes and gets induried.At the same time a lovely tale of the men around the horse, showing them for what they really were too, just men that makes mistakes and flaws like everybody else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I suspect many folks considering this book are like me: really loved Seabiscuit, looking for more like it. This book had some glowing reviews on its cover (including one from Laura Hillenbrand) and mostly favorable reviews here, so I was optimistic. But I found the book very disappointing. The quality of the writing is second-rate. Her knowledge of the subject seems fine, but I wasn't looking for facts, I was looking for an engaging story. I wish I'd read the first 10 or 20 pages before buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to great writing?","review":"Whatever happened to great writers? (Or even good ones?) Miss Ours should have collaborated with one. She certainly doesn't \\"meet Hillenbrand's standard\\" (Booklist review) in any way. I agree that she exhaustively researched her facts, but then she set down a monotonous, inferior presentation of them. Sleep-inducing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"Ours certainly researched her topic, but the writing is so poor it never captures or holds our interest. I tried again and again to get into it but couldn't. This historical tale needs the touch of a good writer to draw us in so we're not faced with endless recitations of fact, and this is where Ours fails. Such a great, exciting horse deserves a story just as exciting! Even if you don't compare it to Hillenbrand's acclaimed work on Secretariat, Ours's book can't stand on its own merits."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great book!","review":"I just finished reading this book and have been inspired to write my first Amazon review. I agree with one review above that things start slowly, with a seeming overload of extraneous information, but everything Ours describes up front turns out to be relevant as the story goes along. In fact, her exhaustive attention to detail really helps set the scene so when things take off, the reader can come along for the ride. Chapter 8 made me laugh out loud, and I was hooked for the rest of the book. Couldn't put it down past page 99! I just finished it and still feel a warm, happy, glow (plus I learned a TON about horse racing). Two thumbs up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice wine glasses","review":"They are a nice set of red wine glasses. They are well made and have a good feel to them. Their design enhances and concentrates the aromas of your fine wine. I have been a fan of Spiegelau wine glasses for some time as they are of good quality and value.

These things are big! I mean, at 9 inches tall, they're at least and inch taller than the big Riedels 2) Some visual distortion through the glass down near the bottom. Perhaps the glass is thicker, creating refraction. The Riedels don't suffer from this - perfect 'optics' all the way to the step."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big and beautiful","review":"I couldn't bring myself to spend the money on Reidel glasses, and these are a great alternative. They really do make wine drinking more enjoyable. The size and shape of the glass brings out the aroma of reds beautifully. The rims are thin, and the glass balances nicely in your hand. The generous size also makes for a striking table setting. Very satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect red wine glasses.....","review":"I have 12 of these beautiful red wine glases, and I have to say I absolutely love the size/shape of these glasses. They really enhance a given wine beautifully, yet cost much less than Riedels (though look just as good.) Of all the Spiegelau red wine glasses, the Vino Grande bordeaux is by far my favorite---it is larger than the standard red wine glass (around 17 ounces), yet slightly smaller than the 25 ounce burgundy glass, which is a little too big in my opinion. Overall these are very classy, yet durable glass---which is why you'll find these exact same glasses in many, if not most fine steak restaurants."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I found this software to be very disappointing.

I bought a set and we ended up \\"splitting\\" them (he only wanted/had space for 4 - he lives in a small! apartment). I love them so much I've now put them on my wishlist.

I felt like I was constantly in fetal position in this car, which after driving 2 hours everyday started wreaking havoc on my back. It's a little too big for my seat since it has \\"wings\\" that stick forward and the cushion back support isn't small enough to fit between. It also doesn't stay in place because it's too big, so I have to move it every time I get in the car. Not a huge deal, considering how much better I feel after I get out of the car.

I have a strained back and have a hard time being comfortable when sitting for prolonged periods of time. I bought this online without having tried it out. I must say, I am very pleased. It supports my lower back perfectly, especially since I am small in stature and most chairs are made for big people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleased","review":"I like this product. It works to force me into an upright position and good posture. The bad thing is that there is nothing to hold it in place. I need to position it into the right place before I buckle up.

It does take a few times to get used to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cover disintegrating after two months","review":"The cushion is firm, not too big, nicely shaped for my 2012 Camry seats, and comfortable. The problem is that the front seam on the side facing the passenger is coming apart after only two months. I'm beginning to think this is what they meant by \\"removable cover,\\" since as other reviews have noted there doesn't seem to be a way to remove the cover. Unfortunately, my return window expired after only one month, so I can't return it, apparently not even to replace an obviously defective product.

I'm not much of a hiker.They fit great, and they are a huge improvement over regular cotton socks in terms of both warmth and moisture-wicking ability (my feet don't get very sweaty in them).I usually wear them around the house on the weekends instead of slippers. I've found that slippers get very sweaty, but these socks work great.The fit is very good- molded to the shape of your feet. The thickness is also pretty good, and I can still fit into my regular sized sneakers when I wear them.For the price, compared to other wool composite socks I've seen, these are probably the best.After 2-3 months of owning and wearing them on and off, I have noticed the bottoms are very \\"fuzzy\\" and if you hold them up to the light you can really see that extra fuzz on the bottom.

My favorite part was the weapons and I thought they did a great job giving the game more depth in what you can do, but they made the game easier by giving you the ability to steal the other person's weapon. Now you have an arsenal of weapons to choose from because of that you end up taking a rapid fire weapon and just holding down the button. Which makes the game too easy. Also they put in an easy mode. Other than that I was pretty good but if you want a good megaman zero game I would go for the second or third."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great entry to the Zero series..but not without some minor flaws","review":"I'll keep this as short as possible, I've been a fan of the GBA's Zero series since its inception. This entry might be almost as hard as the 1st MMZ game (and you all might remember how tough THAT one was). But the difficulty is vintage Mega Man.The game is more of the same (which isn't necessarily a bad thing), but what I didn't like was the Recipe/Body parts system. I had a hard time finding recipes that would HELP me in the game on my own & ended up having to go to gaming sites for a little help. Also, if playing in Normal mode, Sub Energy Cannisters are a MUST to complete the game (unless you're just that good).A great little entry that seems to be the finale to the Mega Man Zero series of games (though the DS' Megaman ZX is a losse sequal of sorts)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Essentially a drug pushing book","review":"Duchaine is a criminal, served two federal prison sentences for drug dealing.

He tends to loosely outline only the very surface behaviors identified by the MBTI and pairs types without any consideration for a deeper purpose to life and relationships. I had the sense that if I planned to stay as I am for the rest of my life, cling tenaciously to the habits of thought and action I formed early on, and never search for any deeper spiritual experience, then the person this book recommends would suit me nicely and cause me the least irritation as I went about my static little life. If, on the other hand, I had a desire to grow and learn beyond behavioral reactions, if I wanted to be more in ten years, than I am today, then the person I would choose based on this book would have no idea what I was about or why they were stuck with me. Generally I found the book not very useful or realistic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book with big flaws","review":"This book was very enjoyable. The personality descriptions are dead-on. My girlfriend (an ENFJ) and myself (an INTJ) were shocked at how accurate they were. I especially liked the part where the author gives a list of movies that each personality would like. Some of my favorite movies were on the list for my type! Where this book goes seriously wrong is where it prescribes which type each type should marry. There is no rhyme or reason to it. For mine, it says to marry the scholar (iNTp). It makes little sense to marry someone with SO MUCH in common. I think that David Keirsey and the Quenks are right when they say that the NFs should marry the NTs, therefore making sure neither partner becomes too one-sided. This is a good book, but buy David Keirsey's Please Understand Me II or the Quenks' True Loves to get a more accurate idea on which type you should consider marrying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very shallow overview of MBTI and matches","review":"I first came across this book many years ago, without any familiarity of MBTI. I tested INTP in this book, and was so upset by the overwhelmingly negative description of that type (and all NTs for that matter), that I cried, and then I rejected the entire system. The book seemed to stereotype people in horrible ways, and I related to no type in it. The descriptions are caricatures, and the advice for meeting types & getting along with them is cliche.Years later, I revisited MBTI, only to discover through much better tests that I am an INFP. Reading other material helped me learn much less biased views on my types and others, what my strengths/flaws/needs as an INFP are in relationships, and who might make a good match for me. In contrast, this book pigeon-holes people and gives you a mental block on certain types. I give it 2 stars for introducing me to MBTI, albeit poorly, because I find the typing system fascinating in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally - A guide we can understand!","review":"Dr. Avila has hit the nail on the head with this book.

We live on a lake so these were ideal for us. This worked great for the first 10 minutes and after that, it had a mind of its own. It now runs on its own and the controller will not shut it off or control its movement. It is totally useless. We let it dry out for a few days but even that hasn't helped. So if you want 10 minutes of fun, this is the boat for you.

We thought maybe the battery was the issue, so we brought it home and recharged it. It never ran again - engines simply wouldn't go.

I tried touching it with my hands tried rotating it manually, nothing helped. The other engine barely moved as well. I'm very disappointed. The shipping cost more then I expected and the boat for my nephew doesn't work.All in all with the disappointment it cost me about 40$ to buy the boat another 100$ to ship it to Israel and there is no use sending it back as it will cost me even more money.0 out of 10"},{"rating":"1","title":"28\\" Blazingly Fast Victory EP Racing Remote Controlled Boat","review":"This product is not worth the money.

Boat is cheaply built but works real well. Supervision is definitely required. During the first use, one motor stayed on continuously even with the power switch turned off. I contacted A Xheli and they said it probably just needed to dry out internally. We let it dry out and tried it again and it works fine. Now I'm just more mindful about letting water get inside.

The remote control, that has a sticker claiming \\"one of the best remotes in the world\\" it's supossed to have some adjusting potentiometers to compensate this next to each handle, but they all are fake. You can't adjust it. There are no electronic components on the inside that you can adjust.When I contacted the supplier they sent me a replacement, but this one worked even worst; it losses the direction even worst than the other one...

Admittedly, it's actually an entertaining read with the core message of the book being that having loads of confidence is necessary when engaging any member of the homo sapien race.The book is brought low by its juvenile insistences that both genders fit into a sparse selection of 2-dimensional cartoon character descriptions as well as its adherence to a played-out, pimp-style POV that material goods make the man. Come on now, the only clothing a true mack wears are made of leather, mink, silk, suede or chinchilla? Guess you can't be environmentally conscious and a mack too. More evidence of the silly hood-type mentality that ultimately holds Blacks back while the rest of society tries to move forward.This book is not recommended for the individual thinker.Two stars for the entertainment value."},{"rating":"2","title":"This will give you the skills needed to be fully prepared to maximize your game to the fullest potential!","review":"In order for a football team to reach its maximum capability, the coach must get the best out of your ability.

I have not finished it, because it was rather arcane. I feel the author was too nebulous in writing about the \\"interior\\" rooms of the spirit/soul. I wished to know what specific steps were taken as one entered into each room and what the different possible feelings/outcomes could be for people other than Teresa."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls disappointingly short","review":"I found this book a bit pretentious with its L.A. dwelling main character and her proclivities for designer clothing. The middle of the book was excellent and touching as Dora develops a relationship with Bea and Harper. The ending disappointed, though, so that I was left with an overall feeling of ambivalence toward the book. Had the entire book been as heartfelt and tender as the middle section, this book would have merited five stars for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money...","review":"What a disappointment. When I began reading this book, it didn't take long to figure out that the authors are completely clueless as to what it is like to be a woman in L.A. The back cover is completley misleading, it states that the main character will be forced to choose between two men - nope, never happened. Neither wanted her - there was no choice. The geographic locations mentioned in this book were so off. Obviously the author being from Missouri or somewhere far from L.A.People not from L.A., should not write about the L.A. lifestyle. Transplants are not L.A people. The story lacked depth- all it had were beautiful excerpts of other peoples writings. That was probably the best part. On nearly every other page the author reminds you that her mother was an alcoholic and that her father left, just incase you forgot two pages earlier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I'm hugely surprised by all the positive reviews. I was deeply annoyed that I wasted $12 on this book. The premise is great - romantic comedy combined with bibliomania; what could be better? - but the characters are vapid, the plot is thin, and the whole thing is poorly written. Don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"somewhat excessive","review":"Not a page turner. Felt like authors were name dropping by listing so many other books and authors. I chose the book to read because I like to read and pretty much lived my younger life lost in books.

This book is not one I would recommend to my book club."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liked, enjoyed, would recommend, but didn't LOVE","review":"I finished this book this afternoon, having started it yesterday... it definitely has a story that makes you want to keep reading, and I love all the literary references (I kept a sheet of paper in the book to jot them down - before I realized they were all listed in the back). I wasn't expecting the storyline about Bea and Harper, though I thoroughly enjoyed it... it just confused me about Fred; I wanted more development of him -- he seemed to do a few things that would have been \\"dealbreakers\\" for me and I was frustrated when they weren't. But I really liked Dora, Darlene and Virginia... and I appreciated the idea of the book -- I can certainly understand escaping into books! It's definitely a must read for anyone who loves books...

The blurb on the back described the plot as that of a woman who deals with the problems of her life by going on a book reading binge. Okay. Excellent strategy. And the authors (Why are there two? Two authors concerns me.) tossed into the story every wonderful book title, every wonderful book quote, every wonderful author...but it wasn't enough.A stew of things obsessive readers love, but it wasn't enough. The book still read like a rough draft. Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous","review":"The best thing about this book is its sleek, sexy cover. It all goes south fast from there. The premise, that reading is wonderful, certainly doesn't come through in this effort. The plot is insipid; worse than a bad daytime soap. Listing & quoting great works of art does not a novel make. If the authors love reading so much, they should stick to it & give up the writing. It would do us all a favor. Clearly a vanity book; definitely not worth your time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Literati","review":"This book was sub par.

Living in LA and working in the screentrade, I totally bought into the 'weird' characters. The mismatched people who become friends and lovers. Los Angeles is a patchwork quilt and the film business itself seems to be the batting. I enjoyed the namedropping of titles, quotations, and authors. This book felt fresh to me while living amongst the filmies that routinely quote lines of dialogue (say hello to my little friend) but haven't picked up a book in years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just okay","review":"The literary angle is a good hook, but this slender book (like most chick lit) still wants to have it all ways. The relationship that the protagonist ends up with involves no real effort of her own other than the genre's need to provide a hunky man (preferably with a pot of gold) at the end of these types of books. The stuff set in the bookstore is the best (esp. if you're an Angeleno who knows the real store), but it seemed weird that a woman who spent so much time reading great works of literature still ended up so shallow, at least on the page."},{"rating":"2","title":"A stunning tour de force","review":"This opened my eyes to new avenues in late antiquity scholarship.

After doing the roof on my house it has even more scratches on it, some of them not so light. It is easy to load and has not misfired once in about 1200 nails.

I decided to but a foot pump not only to reduce the risk of having problem with the pump battery, but also to accelerate my work. It was pretty cheap and at the same time very useful. I have used it a few times now and think it is good enough. Simple technologies are always more reliable!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed Quickly","review":"This pump worked great for first couple of times I used it but within a few weeks of receiving it, it failed me twice during the same trip to the river with my inflatable boat. First one of the metal bands holding the bellows fabric slipped off and allowed the air to escape the bag. I managed to get this fixed in the field with a screwdriver I just happen to have on a multi-tool. Later once I was on the river I tried to pump up an inner tube only to find a tear in the side of the bellows right below the metal band that did not fail. I did patch the hole but it has not held. So after less than a month the pump is almost worthless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Low Tech Solution","review":"There are some problems in life that are best solved with a simple solution.Perfect for inflatables.

In a world saturated by fake punk garbage the Godfathers of NYC Hardcore have put out what is without question their best album yet. Victim in Pain, Liberty & Justice, etc are all epic albums, but 'Another Voice' is unreal! Agnostic Front have always been mainstays of the true sound, but believe me, this is on a completely different level. Also, it is a mastery of punk-metal 'crossover' (Slapshot meets Slayer). Brutal... absolutely brutal!"},{"rating":"2","title":"About What You'd Expect","review":"Its a wooden plug, not much to review. Fits the holes from the jig. Why only 4 stars? The price, way too expensive for wood plugs turned out by the gross on a machine. But, unless you want the hole to show, you need them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some decent music, idiotic lyrics","review":"The first song, Homecoming Weekend in a Small Town, is quite good. It's catchy, with hooky lyrics and a great overall sound. Kind of a Postal Service/Go Find kind of vibe - but without the smart lyrics. And boy, in the rest of the album you really really notice the absence of those smart lyrics. Wow. Plus, the tones and beats also seem to suffer from a lack of imagination. I don't want to overstate this though as the music is nonetheless fairly nice. It's just that, coupled with the juvenile lyrics, one can't help but take away an overall impression of this album as being an (awkward) adolescent effort. I'd still probably recommend this album on the strength of the first song, but don't get your hopes up for the rest of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too small","review":"This serving set fell below my expectations because the pieces are too small. I bought it mainly because of its tart server which turned out with a serving surface shorter than 2.5\\". If I had read the dimensions/descriptions more carefully before purchasing this set I would have noticed that it was a \\"tart server\\" and not a \\"cake server\\" (latter would be bigger).

This being said, however, her book is a hopeless mess.

The sooner I can put this absurd reading experience behind me, the better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much of a revelation.","review":"Lots of \\"fuzzy math\\" and typos. This book has a few interesting concepts but nothing to become inspired about.If your looking for a good \\"end times\\" novel there are many better reads on the market. This book makes some incredibly illogical assumptions. A good sci-fi short story but certainly not an addendum to your Bible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Think!","review":"This book is largely a summary of \\"traditional Catholic prophecies\\" that have been rewritten from several web sites. For example a certain person mentioned in the book by his Internet name, World Teacher, is said to be the AntiChrist. This seems unlikely in view of Scripture - how could anyone *know* who he is at this point? The claim is also very old news (10 years or so old...), and information about World Teacher can be found easily on the 'net. Same is true for the concentration camps mentioned in the book. Pictures and information appear to be taken from web pages as a resource. Another example is the cataclysmic events predicted, noteably the meteor predicted to hit earth. This, too, is rehashed from the Internet and breaks no new ground -- readers can get the real, scientific facts from the Jet Propulsion Lab's web page. I give this book a low mark in that it does not break new ground or present a compelling case."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a book!","review":"I heard Kathleen on the radio and had to buy this book. I am so glad I did. I'm going to have to re-read it, it's really full of information. I like the way she connects prophecy to current events. I'm a fan for life!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Lies","review":"NO STARS-Anyone who would believe this garbage is either naive or stupid. The pictures are several decades old and the lies she tells about internment camps should put her in jail. The publisher lost ten million dollars in a lawsuit against his former company, because he defrauds the authors, who pay for him to publish them. The author has no real credentials as an investigative journalist; anyone could call themselves that. The whold thing is trumped up in order to sell \\"survival\\" items. Full of Catholic paranoia; none of it is true. Pure fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for a laugh","review":"The final warning seems to be that god is going to send a comet to earth to destroy all those who don't believe. However you will be safe as long as you are a true believer. You will be safe from earthquakes if you sprinkle holy oil around your door. You will be able to drink the contaminated water as long as you put some drops of holy water in it. She even conveniently puts a form at the back of the book so you can buy all the holy things you are going to need to survive. The author's evidence is mainly from visionary's and the bible. The rest is all spectulation on her part. Some parts of the book were very amusing however."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most important book to come out in a long time","review":"Just finished reading this book and I'm going to order more copies to give to my family.

I've been reading through the reviews posted here, and they touched on a lot of good points. I do have to agree I couldn't put the book down. Just a fantastic book!I did want to make one point, and I know we're not supposed to do this, but how can Amazon post reviews that are incorrect? Nowhere in this book does it say that Mary forgives sins. I don't even know where that came from!Trust me, this was a great book, well worth the wait, and very informative. I'm very impressed with Ms. Keating!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I was interested in reading Ms. Keating's book after hearing her on Art Bell's Coast to Coast. I was very disappointed when I received the book in the mail. There are absolutely no footnotes or references, although the author makes constant reference to things that are happening in the government, in the military, in the Vatican. I guess we're just supposed to accept everything she says on faith! If she has sources that readers could look up, why doesn't she include them? She does include a bibliography, but it appears to be related sources of information, not the sources for the quotations she includes or the accusations she makes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch for this book","review":"to make waves.

Fifteen minutes into the interview made me realize that this woman is a complete nutjob! If you like reading the opinions of religious wackos who think that we are all going to PAY for every impure thought that we have, go for it! She reminds me of those evil nuns of bygone days, who used to beat the little boys for looking at the girls and give the girls ugly haircuts so that they wouldn't tempt the boys! This woman is so sexually repressed and puritanical that she told Art Bell that the women who tempt him and cause him to have sexual thoughts will have to answer to God and pay for those sins!That is about as far as I got in the interview. I wouldn't read this woman's books if she autographed them and GAVE them to me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"the Final Warning by Kathleen Keating","review":"If your faith is grounded in the actual teachings of the Bible, thus Jesus Christ,there are somethings in this book that will cause you to wonder.Very few of the Visions actualy from Jesus. The kissing of a medal can have your sins forgiven??? Placing a statue of a Saint in your field to protect your cattle? Mary offering grace to all who serve her?? Mary able to forgive sins?? Some of these fly in the face of what the Bible teaches."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was *so* disappointed when my book arrived. It was small and not well written at all. I too found much of the material to be old -- I think it was lifted from Catholic web sites!

I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the read...","review":"I heard this author on Art Bell's show 'Coast to Coast'. In the book, only her way is correct on translations of the final days. Actually, the book is alot of gibbish, and more sci-fi/horror than anything. It could be considered a scare tactic to unnerve the populace.Believe me, this book isn't all that it's cracked up to be. It's really not that good. If you want to read about the New Millennium, read Edgar Cayce, or Nostradamus. They give a more open, more exact way of the new millennium"},{"rating":"1","title":"OH SO EVALUATIVE, \\"INTERESTING,\\" and PITHY!","review":"I am, of course, referring to the REVIEWS of the book, and not the book itself. Reviews drenched in terms such as \\"wonderful!\\", \\"fantastic!\\", and \\"I can't wait for her next book!\\", wreak of emotionalism and evaluation and give other readers no critical criterium or clue as to the book's assets. Unless, that is, we are all just reading for entertainment or, perhaps more detrimentally, for \\"info-tainment.\\" The only comment I want to make about the author is that anyone who fingers someone like Benjamin Creme's Maitreya as the antichrist and then writes such drivel probably deserves such effusive, gushing, and uncritical assessments of her work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loses credibility quickly.","review":"Not only is this book exceptionally small (more of a pamphlet size), it's not written well. Poor referencing, lack of any credible bibilography, and reliance on single sources also make this book just not worth your time. But it's a fascinating subject, so don't let this book's poor treatment of it stop you from looking into the subject. Someone else on here recommended Malachi Martin, and I would concur with that. Or just search the Web. A Web search is cheaper than this book, and you get the same information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money.","review":"I've never written a bad review before, but this book deserves it. Poorly written, very sparse, and to echo another reviewer, shoddy.Don't bother with it.On the brigher side, there's a convenient list of suppliers in the back of the book. Give me a break.Read Art Bell. Read Malachi Martin. But not this."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book Is Pure Self-interested Fear Mongering","review":"This book is not a serious piece of work. Rather is a lie from copyright notice on. If the author was an honest person, she would have posted the first copyright date. No, she posts 2000 so as to give you the impression that this book entirely new. It was obviously written in the early 90's and has been doctored up here and there from time-to-time. But this only makes sense when you get to page 119. They have a for-profit catalog of product covering 18 pages. One real survival tool that is a must have in this for-profit money pitch is the book, How To Change Your Husband."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid","review":"I received this as a gift; it was dead out of the box. Installed new batteries (and the other review is correct, very bad battery case design); still dead.

I bought this software to see how it operated and find out if it worked very well so that I could recommend it to family and friends.

Good program if you are familiar with estate planning documents and their purposes."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of few that is filled with mystery and humor","review":"In reading the previous reviews, I think this book has not been given it's due. I have read the book several times for the humor found within it. I have been a police officer for 26 years and found The Golden Orange to be full of police humor from the first chapter to the last. The lead character leads the life of a pentioned out officer who is constently battling his past using alcohol and levety to ease that past. Wambaugh molds every character into ones we can all relate to. The police characters are no doubt taken from Wambaugh's experience as police officer from the synical old timers to the optomistic green rookies. There are FEW books I would recommend as highly as this one for action, mystery and real belly laughs. I only wish he had 100 more like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pulpy","review":"This is a really enjoyable read. What's unusual is that the author telegraphs the plot twist very early on, but you still enjoy the characters enough to keep you reading until you find out exactly how it plays out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bring back the stories about ordinary cops!","review":"Joseph Wambaugh's earlier books were renown for their black humour which would sometimes be so good that you would laugh out loud. He told stories of cops walking the beat and living on the edge.As the years passed, he seemed to strongly veer away from this sort of story and go towards stories with cops as a side attraction but novels that were more about human nature.In this novel, we are in the Golden Orange, an area where the very rich people play and we get to see Winnie, a former cop and current alcoholic who is down on his luck, who meets a wealthy woman who has secrets.The book itself is not terrible or anything, it is just ordinary. There is very little humour and it just seems to me like the author was writing about the people that he spends time with. The problem is that the wealthy tend to be rather dull......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor","review":"If Joseph Wambaugh had no track record, this novel never would have been published. And I live in Orange County, so I was pre-disposed to like this book. But it is poorly written, and the plot doesn't even start until half-way through the book. I wanted to like this book. But I sure didn't"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wambaugh dishes the dirt: Orange Curtain turns red","review":"What do you want in a Wambaugh book? Cheesy sex, tough cop talk, twisty plot, alcoholism... Plus Orange County gossip. Sound exciting? If you know Newport, or were there in the late 80's/ early 90's, there's some good in it. He captures that funky essence of the place.

Otherwise, it would have received no stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cultural String theory.","review":"I come from the same people as the author and see things quite diferently.The book impressed me as a very windy and preachy screed of self-adulation and pseudointellectual posturing.Filled with nonsequitors,gushing kudoes to his liberal friends and the Kennedys,and all based on this laboriously contrived theory thatIrish-Americans possess cultural and personality traits that have their origin with the Potato Famine.There are a few.The dont tread on me attitude is one but then most people who have been oppressed(and that is most people)have the same trait.I admit to a certain bias.While Mr. Hayden was sleeping with Jane Fonda and getting arrested in Chicago in the 60s becoming somewhat of a political celebrity,I was starting a medical career on the southside of that city while raising 5 very young children.Nice try Tom but Robert Emmet your not."},{"rating":"1","title":"What you see is NOT what you get!!!!","review":"I ordered this calendar and expected the cover photo you see on the website.

When I was planning a day-long train trip, however, I started thinking about how the thing is always in the way when I'm sitting down. There is no good place to put it and still have it handy. If I try to lean it against a wall or my chair, it slips and falls to the floor with a nerve shattering \\"clack!\\" If I sit there holding it, someone is likely to trip on it. This dandy lightweight cane pulls apart easily into three pieces which fold together to fit into its plastic carrying case. You can put it out of sight in a shopping bag, large purse, backpack, etc., or on the floor under your seat. If nothing else, you can leave it on your lap. It's light and maneuverable but strong enough to support well over 200 pounds. There's a sturdy wooden handle and a non-slip tip. And the pretty floral design? It turns your old grim cane into something kind of fun! (It's adjustable, too!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"The label that won't let go","review":"Functionally, the cane is fine.

The album is worth having if you're interested in blues, especially if you like to understand the roots of the music and its development over time. As a series of performances, however, the album is fairly weak.The album features some well known blues singers such as Taj Mahal, and Honeyboy Edwards, now a very old man, who actually played with Robert Johnson. Edwards' interpretation of of a Johnson song may well reflect Johnson's actual style quiteaccurately.Overall, this is an album that will interest committed blues fans, but probably won't appeal much outside that group."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly as good as it gets!","review":"Not an alternative to the original recordings of Johnson by any means. But, definitely a potential to re-discover them and to gain an enhanced appreciation via recordings with 100% better fidelity than the originals. (That is - assuming that you have a decent sound system and fidelity is of importance. Believe me, Telarc's Pure Digital Mastering will put these guys in your living room!). At least this was my experience with \\"Hellhound. . .\\", especially with the more straight forward re-interpretations. In fact most of the tracks are acoustic & straight forward covers, which is the difference between this CD and other \\"Tribute\\" albums. Incidentally, If you like or love this cd, you'll also want to check out \\"Screamin' and Hollerin' the Blues\\" released by Shanachie a year before Telarc's \\"Hellhound. . . \\" and the perfect companion CD.

I got a heck of deal!"},{"rating":"2","title":"chair covers","review":"great heavy canvas type matterial...these should last for a good amount of time....fit well over approx: 6 stacked chairs...was a good purchase"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, why didnt I think of this before","review":"After 10 years of hauling the six deck chairs to the basement for winter and back out in spring, I decided to get a cover so that I could stack them and leave them out. Only time will tell if this cover's construction holds up to NJ winters, but it appears to be of quality material and construction. Fit well and protects all six chairs well."},{"rating":"1","title":"I only wish it was a comedy. Or was it?","review":"Where to start? Edits that go on for too long. Really bad makeup effects. Bad Dialog. Lousy sets, costumes and props. But I will give them a star for the idea of the plot and the lead killer's acting.This definitely stays true to indie, low budget Horror!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too expensive for its short life","review":"While I really enjoy this product, the pen is really too expensive for the short amount of time that the highlighter has ink. The ink will dry up severely quickly and refills can be hard to come across. The highlighter is also not very bright.If you are looking for a pen and barely using the highlighter, these pens will probably do just as good as any other. Plus the benefit of the highlighter will definitely allow you to save time. However, it is a little on the bulky size so writing becomes difficult.If you are looking for a highligher(as I assume most people are), you are probably better off sticking to your average sharpie than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"i thought this would be a useful item...","review":"but unfortunately, the pen does not work no matter what i do, so now i just have a highlighter with a big hole in the middle. not very helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cannot refill both parts, highlighter only. Makes a single (after pen part runs out)","review":"I bought this item recently (I bought two actually) at a local office supply store. I thought, great, it gives me both a pen and a highlighter, which comes in handy when one needs to make notes and highlight something. However, I found out quickly, and it was confirmed by an email sent from Bic, that only the highlighter is refillable. The pen part isn't, which makes it (after the original refill runs out), a single [mono], as the highlighter is refillable by direct order from bic. At $5.00, approximately, it's hardly worth the money. They need to make the \\"pen\\" portion refillable too. Be warned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for students","review":"My girlfriend loves these for her law school work. She can quickly switch between highlighting text and making notes in the margins with a quick twist of the pen. I recommend also buying some highlighter refills as they don't last as long as full sized highlighters."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Conference-Goer's Pen","review":"This pen may not be your first choice for everyday writing, but in a situation where you are researching, taking notes or attending a conference, it is very handy to be able to quickly highlight something while you are writing. The highlighter cartridge advances over the pen tip with a simple twist, and retracts so you can continue writing. The highlighter is a bright fluorescent yellow, similar to most highlighters available.If you are doing copious amounts of highlighting, this is not the pen for you. I carry a separate highlighter for that purpose. But for a situation where you are primarily writing with an occasional highlight on conference handouts or other literature, this is very convenient.Although it would seem that the highlighter cartridge would run out before the pen ink cartridge does, I have yet to experience that problem because these pens tend to get \\"borrowed\\" so that you need to obtain another..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the correct book for beginners!","review":"Though not bad, but some of the explanantions are a bit confusing and the answers are not detailed enough for readers to understand fully."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Regular Folks","review":"I've always liked computers and decided to try a C++ programming class. This was the book used in class and while the language itself was easy to learn, the obstacle to actually learning it was this book. It starts out by explaining some basic principles of programming and computer science before getting into the actual programming, but the terminology and teaching methods used within the text are overly verbose and poorly-written. The \\"hows\\" of programming aren't quite there and the exercises aren't always explained clearly or entirely.If you want a C++ book that you can understand check out Gary Bronson's \\"A First Look at C++\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good FRS from Motorola","review":"This FRS has all the 14 channels and 38 subchannels similar to other FRS. It has back light feature which is useful at night. It is bigger than the latest version from Motorola like the 280, I still found it very easy to carry. It did not have the channel scan feature which is easier to find an open channel in a crowded mall. Overall it is very easy to use with 5 different call tones."},{"rating":"2","title":"very impressed","review":"I recently purchased the motorola fr60 and let me tell you it's great. I was trying to decide between the fr50 and fr60 both are exactly alike except for the privacy codes. I live in a major city so I would recommend the fr60 just for the privacy function. The range seems to live up to the 2 mile limit. Althought I have noticed a few times in the city among high buildings this may be reduced. The call tones are great. This allows you to ring the other radio such as a telephone. I would recommend this to families, skiers, friends just out and about shopping. It's a great way to communicate and there are no charges such as a cell phone. It's a compact radio. So ladies it is great for the purse. Guys don't worry there is a belt clip and that works well too. Good luck with your purchase!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Motorola Talkabout FR60","review":"First off, I will start by saying that this is a review of a very old model. Back when I got this (around the time it came out) it was a quality radio. However, given the advances in technology, you're far better off getting a new model. It will be more compact and have a much greater range. This is great for my purposes (few hundred meters max)Bottom line:PROS:Quality radioIntuitive to useCONS:Short range (compared to modern 2 way radios)Bulky"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product - I'd purchase one for everybody I know","review":"This is the best two way radio I've ever seem. It is impressive in terms of usage range. It is funny to use, and even my parents understood how to use it with a short explanation. I'd recommend you to purchase one if you are the kind of guy that wants to be communicated all the time or wants to make an expedition with a group of friends in different cars. An excellent purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"radio","review":"I think that the motorola fr60 is the best. The whole family has them. we use them everywhere we go........."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheaper that works","review":"Its the cheaper model of motorolas 2 way radio, but it works like the most expensive. Its really reach the 2 miles conversation for the price of the SLK model. If you do not worry about the desing, you might consider to buy the FR60 instead the SLK's. It works even better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OK for the price","review":"This radio is an ok product for its cost, but no where near as good as the radios with a slightly higher price tag. I bought these radios for a summer trip to WDW and had little to no luck finding a free channel to communicate on. Spending a little more cash to get a radio with 40 channels would have been worth it in order to have good communication between our parties."},{"rating":"2","title":"....
