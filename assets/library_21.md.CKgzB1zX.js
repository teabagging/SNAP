I did however enjoy the forward by Dean Koontz."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gimme A Break!!!!!!!","review":"It is work such as this that propagates the notion in the literary world that horror fiction is second tier material.The plot is ludicrous from the get-go. The author's intent was to clearly pander to the lowest common denominator with respect to readership, when one considers the overt emphasis on gratutitous violence and the (expected) fixation on lewd sex.This book should appeal to anyone seeking cheap literary thrills.If you're seeking a good read, that is, strong writing, believable plot, character development, etc. - skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of his very best.","review":"I am not one to award 5 stars to a book very often but this deserves it. Island is my favorite Laymon and believe me, I've read lots(21 and counting). This novel is very unique in the sense that not only is it narrated in the first person, but the events actually take place while the narrator is writing them.We follow the adventures of Rupert Conway, a college student who goes on a spring break trip in the bahamas with his girlfriend and the rest of her family on their private boat. While setting shore on a tiny remote island, the bloat blows up, thus stranding its passengers. Of course many other things will go wrong along the way.Fast-paced, voyeuristic, violent and sadistic, this will undoubtedly please all Richard Laymon fans old and new."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worst book I have ever been uable to put down","review":"In nearly 50 years of reading, this is the worst book I have ever read in two or three sittings. I found it to be a real page turner. The plot is paper thin, the characters sophomoric, and I'm not certain that the kind of terrain in which this book is set really exists in the Bahamas. Nevertheless, I couldn't put it down. This is a great book to take along on a long flight. Know what...I'm probably going to pick up another Laymon book for my next trip. It is a shame that this talented man is no longer with us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pandering to the Lowest Common Denominator","review":"This is the type of novel that gives Horror Fiction a bad name. Laymon's formula can be quite simply stated - create a totally ludicrous premise, then add liberal doses of gratuitous sex and violence. Never mind plot development, characterization, suspension of disbelief, or the art of storytelling for that matter.Laymon is clearly pandering to an audience that finds a ridiculous plot sprinkled with over-the-top violence and sex to be a page turner.This book is an embarrasment to the publisher and the horror genre. Proof that people will buy anything these days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Written by a horny child","review":"Crazy that this author is published.

Once again there is found a people who wish nothing more than to be left alone, yet are forced to protect themselves at great price. Modesitt continues to write of the inherent lack of understanding by most people. There are those characters that will not listen to reason. They must go their own course untill they are forced to act differently. The main characters cannot, by their very nature, act in a pre-emptive manner for any reason. Modesitt's developement of the ideas expressed in the \\"Paradigms of Power\\" and the \\"Construct\\" work excellently with this theme. All in all a good read and I look forward to the next book sent forth."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Earth is a Dangerous Place","review":"I believe Modesitt is trying, with this book, to get the readers to look around at the world today for what it is. His Cybs (in a very Vulcan manner) can view only the literal facts and are not able to deduce the power they are facing.The Demi's use near telepathic powers to communicate and control their planetary powers, much as secret societies use hand signals and sign language to control, subjugate, and enforce their will on others.

I have never read a Koontz book i didn't like until this one. Right off the characters were hard to relate to, and just about everything was not explained. Like what Bryan Drackman was \\"Becoming\\". Was it a Devil, a god, WHAT?? It never said!!! Also the thing it never said that bothered me the most is Drackman's motive - why did he want to kill Janet, Danny, Harry, Connie and Sammy??? When Koontz said \\"His Greatest and Most Secret Power\\" over and over it seemed so childish. Why did bryan act like such a child??? There was one pretty exciting part and that was the Pause. That was about it though. All and all this book didn't do enough explaining, the characters were 2 dimensional (had no depth) and seemed to lack the \\"horror\\".

I don't think a ever read a book that had me so interested in exactally what was going on. The way that Dean Koontz brought all of the different stories together in the end... it's undiscribable. Every one that I have recomended this book to agrees that it's a 5-star, two thumbs up story! Enjoy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought the book lacked style.","review":"In my opinion the book was a two thumbs up book. The begining started off fastpaced and intresting. It made you want to keep reading, at first. Then it started to get slow and boring, it was unable to hold my intrest so i stopped reading on page sixty-five. The way Dean Koontz shifted from story to story kind of confused me, you were'nt getting the answers like who was the rat guy. So I thought this book was weak, I read some of his other books and they were exellent. basically I give this book two thumbs down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping and told in wonderful prose.","review":"Recently, I listened to my first suspense novel in an audiobook format while I drove to attend my Nieces high school graduation.

I found DT to be a very good story that is very well written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flawed","review":"Suspenseful and somewhat literate during the first few hundred pages, Dragon Tears is way too long. I lost interest in it about halfway in. The stock characters became annoying (why don't they ever do or say anything besides the usual horror genre prattle) and the plot became extremely linear. I knew the ending and did not want to meet it once again under such miserable circumstances. Koontz is better than King and Barker is better than Koontz but does anyone really care?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Forced myself to finish","review":"It's been a long time since I read this book, but I have to say it left a mark. I always rush out to buy the latest Koontz book and was really happy when I found one I'd missed for only $5 in hardback! Well, when I finished the book, I was rather disappointed at having wasted $5. Clearly the worst book he's written, I felt like he was beating me over the head with his views of good and evil and the decline of morality in today's society. Nice try, Dean, but you can do better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whew, ZZZZZZZZZZZZZ","review":"This book was one of the biggest letdowns in a while.

Also, I despised the generalizations Mr. Koontz made about ravers and rave culture; not all ravers are druggies who don't give a $*&t about their lives or the world around them. Mr. Koontz, do your research next time, please. Readers, avoid DRAGON TEARS as if it were a plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst novel I've ever finished","review":"I read a lot of books, and I'm pretty charitable. This is the harshest review I've ever written, for the book I hate the most. This book starts out with mystery elements, and suspense; \\"How did the killer do that?\\" \\"How did he escape?\\" etc etc.Spoiler alert: the bad guy IS A GOD. He is omnipotent and can control all time and space and matter. Well, that neatly explains how he managed all that mysterious stuff. Man, I bet Agatha Christie feels like a chump; look how much effort she put into her killer's plots, and the detective work required to solve them- wouldn't it have been simpler if ALL OF HER BAD GUYS WERE GODS? A locked room mystery? Easy- the killer is omnipotent! Missing murder weapon? Easy! The killer IS A GOD!Worst plot ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Poor Effort on Koontz's Part","review":"*Sigh* seems like I have to write more bad reviews of Koontz than good ones. When I enjoy one of his books, I love it, but he writes more than his share of poor efforts, or so it seems.Anyway, this was another less-than-well-written novel about a cop who is chasing after a morphing supernatural being who has a fascination with eyes. The novel is a long chase that fails to hold my attention. It was truly dull, poorly written, and hard on the suspention of disbelief. One bias I have that did affect my ability to like the novel is my loathing of police and books where they are featured as main characters--as was the case here. That wouldn't have helped it much, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"A cliched Masterpiece!","review":"I can see how a person can easily hate this book. However, I found it to be very entertaining despite many of the \\"Koontz Cliches\\" that can be found throughout. READER BEWARE: The book starts out painfully slow, but about halfway through it really starts to grab your attention as the action picks up. Koontz successfully weaves a devious villian, cliched cops, and some of the most nerve-racking white knuckle suspense filled chase scenes ever to come out with one of the best books I've ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vintage Koontz","review":"Detective Harry Lyon is having a bad day. He and his partner stop for a quiet lunch and find themselves in a life or death gun battle with a crazed gunman. But it's only the beginning and things are about to get much worse. By sheer coincidence, Harry runs afoul of someone far more dangerous and far more powerful than a lunatic with a gun. It is a phantom he will come to call Ticktock and his abilities are superhuman. He is like a vengeful god and he makes a sport of punishing people and terrorizing them before he kills them. He gives Harry 24 hours to live and during that time, everything he loves is in danger unless he can put a stop to it... This is classic Koontz and a highly entertaining read. I've read nearly all of his work, but somehow never got around to this jewel until recently. He was in the top of his form during this time and I highly recommend picking this up for fast moving, suspenseful fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uh-h-h...No","review":"Sometimes I think Koontz is just pressed to get something done on a deadline, and falls back on the tried-and-true to make it on time. But, he has to create new incredible explanations for the impossible weirdnesses going on in his story, and...well, now and then he comes up a-cropper.This one builds fairly nicely, but ultimately disappoints because of lack of credibility. Mind you, Koontz often has pretty hard-to-believe situations or explanations, but this is one of his weaker ones, and how the protagonists find it out isn't at all credible, either.Substandard Koontz. Many of the author's books from this period (late '80s, early '90s) weren't very good. This is definitely one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice introduction to Koontz for me","review":"Just finished my first Koontz novel, and it will definitely notbe the last. A very impressive staging of suspense and action, whichbegins within the first 20 pages.Granted, the ending is too shortand a little anti-climactic, but realistic from a logical point of view.There was a nice exploration of the characteristics of Ticktock's powers, including the Pause. I laughed out loud when Harry has to employ the use of the breaststroke in a manner he never imagined.......... You'll be reading along about an ordinary scene, and he'll sneak in a semi-casual mention of a threat. You're tension level immediately rises, and you have to check to make sure you read what you thought you read. This is the case several times with the passing mention of the appearance of the hobo.I've read about ten Stephen King novels, and this Koontz one definitely holds its own in comparison. I would be interested in seeing Koontz attempt an \\"epic\\" novel, a la The Stand. END"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping and worth buying","review":"My first Dean Koontz book, just picked up casually when I had nothing else to do. I couldn't put it down. Opening with a dramatic shootout in a restaurant, it turns into a chilling tale of fear and pursuit in a California town when Harry Lyon and his partner Connie Gulliver are hunted by a serial killer with inhuman powers. The scenes where time stops are truly frightening, and the whole book is brilliantly original - a notable difference for Koontz, and is a good predecessor to his later work such as Seize The Night and False Memory. A great piece of storytelling."},{"rating":"1","title":"First Koontz novel","review":"Could not agree with Milo \\"gjm\\" more (see second page of reviews). Although the story line captures the imagination some of the writing is down right atrocious. The author often felt the need to 'explain' what he means which I found demeaning and I think if I had read \\"...it's the 90's\\" one more time I would have flung myself off the nearest bridge.He digresses, pontificates and includes trivia that has no place in the story. Had the novel been 300 pages instead of nearly 400 I suspect it would have been a tightly knit, less frustrating and more coherent novel. This was the first book that I have read by Koontz and will be the last which is a shame because I do see a great deal of merit in the book. However poor writing is to me like chalk across a blackboard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Read","review":"This book keeps you going from page one to the last line. The characters are real people it seems. You get frustrated, anxious, nervous, and happy all in one little book. Koontz does a good job of swtiching off from character to character to tie all parts of the story together. Harry Lyon is an unsuspecting hero, and Connie Gulliver is a hard-nosed woman who knows how to live life.

The unorthodoxy of the neo-orthodox theologians is shown as he demonstrates, using their own logic, that the conclusions they've reached are unjustified. The rub is supernaturalism versus naturalism. Orthodox Christianity as a worldview requires a belief in the supernatural.

It's a long dissertation about a woman named Esmay who is supposed to be a hero and a leader. Apart from the author, who can regard her as a hero? Esmay behaves as a very ordinary and plain woman. Nevertheless, her superior officers keep claiming she's a born leader... How can they be so dumb to think so? In fact, we quickly note her superior officers are even dumber than Esmay.I think EM completely missed the point. Her claimed heroine is colorless and insipid. How can anyone be interested in Esmay? A leader does behave differently from others. A leader acts, doesn't wait for things to occur, submits oneself, or simply yields. What a difference with the Miles Vorkosikan series by Bujold!

There they meet again and slept together, then fought. Very boring. I felt the main character, Nelda, had little compassion and did not truly love Lute for taking his words to heart as much as she did. I did not like her very much. She had witnessed the last concert of Buddy Holly, The Big Bopper, and Richie Valens and it did not seem to affect her at all when they were tragically killed in a plane crash. She was too wrapped up in her own pity party to care. By the time I got to the end, I did not care whether they got together or not.

Unfortunately this one is not too gripping. The main let down is the Monoids. They just do not have a stong presence nor do they convey any real fear. Sometimes they speak like a normal person and other times their voice is modulated. Many small details are off which makes this appear more like a play and failed to make me believe in the adventure.The story creaps along at a very slow pace. Don't get me wrong I prefer slower paced stories when they are intellectual and provoke thought. I think it was an error to refer to the Monoids as Monoid 1, Monoid 2, Monoid 3 etc... That would work for Daleks or a race of Robots but the Monoids are suppose to be an alien race.

It IS a movie with a strikingly similar fashion to that of a TNG episode. It is a visual effects masterpiece. It is the most off-beat of Star Trek movies. And it is that uniqueness that allows Insurrection to hold its own.In contrast, Insurrection IS NOT the best of the movies, or one of the best. It is not the worst of the other 8 either; I've held that spot solely for Generations. And if there is one thing it is definitely not, it is not the parallel of The Search for Spock.The DVD, on the other hand, plays on the visual effects and score by making look and sound more stunning. Bonus trailers and featurettes on one DVD make it a great keeper. However, it will never rival the Motion Picture, or First Contact.Bottom line - Buy it for the DVD.

As a devoted Trek fan I of course liked it but was a little disappointed in the story. It seemed like a big bugeted TV episode and when you have to wait two years in between Star Trek The Next Generation appearences a glorified episode doesn't quite live up to par. On the other hand the special effects were incredible. With most of the SF shots being computer generated it was nice to see the reality that can be achieved (as you know, coming this summer, Lucas' Star Wars I is mainly digital too). Needless to say the Movie itself was entertaining and I'm sure that the average viewer will get a kick out of it.

IN my opinion its the best odd movie, I highly recomend it.

What is the flagship of the Federation doing futzing around with the beautiful people? The good Star Trek movies have involed monumental events such as wars with Klingons and the Borg, potential destruction of Earth by alien probes and the death/rebirth of a main character.

That is where it started to go down. In this movie, we are treated to cheesy character, shallow plot, really bad effects, slow music, and \\"bad\\" humor. If the humor was really funny, like Voyage Home, it might have been better. Unfortunately, the characters created in the TNG series died at the end of that series. They have never been the same in the movies. They didn't develop into the people they are now. They just became these people. I don't like them.

I'll probably not watch it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who Watches the Watchers","review":"Anyone remember the episode from ST:TNG called \\"Who Watches the Watchers\\"?

Well except for the fact that he is in orbit..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gooey and sickly sweet nonsense","review":"A tired story seen before in other sci-fi stuff like outer limits and twilight zone. Machines make mistakes; people are suspcious of the machine; want to get back to nature, but machine is providing the comfort of the good life. Machine falls, people awaken.... blah blah blah. I agree with the other reviewer - the Final Frontier was better and I hated that one. Bring on the big screen battle scenes, the Enterprise and running and jumping - yeah that's the trek I love. Skip this tape and see the Phantom Menace - that's got probs too but at least we have your gratuitous battle scenes and big box battleships."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hurt the Franchise","review":"Star Trek could have used a hit movie when this was released, unfortuantely we got Insurrection.I'm happy to see the TNG cast whenever I can, and it was nice to see them in the movie but that's all the enjoyment I got-seeing the cast.The movie itself suffered from a poor story. I found the movie very slow, I had little sympathy for the people Picard was trying to save, nor was I impressed with the villian.I originally saw this movie in the theatre and left unhappy, I bought the video and watched half of it and then shut it off. I've never watched it since. Buy it if you want to complete your TNG collection, otherwise I can not recommend this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the Odd-Numbered Movies","review":"I myself have been a Star Trek fan all of my life: old Trek, Next-Gen, DS-9, and the movies. This is one movie that my non-Trekker friends actually went out of their way to see. All around, a most excellent movie, though not the best in the movie series. As I mentioned above, it is certainly the best of the odd-numbered movies-- if one were to put the Trek movies in order from best to worst, the even-numbered ones would be at the top of the list, and so would this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perhaps the concept is getting tired..","review":"One of the things that has always been a problem with Star Trek (all flavors) is the tendency to lower the plot level to elementary-school levels. One person is always good, another always bad. There's no grey area, and the good guy always vanquishes the bad guy, followed by a lecture from a social worker.The effects were good, as usual, though not spectacular. Maybe my standards are going up, but, I think this is the last Star Trek movie for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good guys try to stop bad guys from getting eternal youth.","review":"I thought it was really superb!

(Everyone who watched it, probably, except you had to really pay attention.) This selection is a refreshingly \\"freed\\" and less stoic group of characters who are less worried about making a mistake and more worried about doing the right thing against the odds.It's a good story, a wonderful showcase for the characters, including a wonderful flirtatious affair for the Captain, and a moral victory. We get to root for the good guys and watch the bad guys either see the error of their ways or get incinerated.Good fun overall. You'll want to watch it more than once and keep it handy for when every show on TV is \\"reality.\\" Given the choice, I'll opt for Star Trek every time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame on Paramount!","review":"When Paramount released the Director's Edition of \\"Star Trek: The Motion Picture,\\" they showed an interest in giving fans a truly special and well crafted DVD. However, since II, they've gotten chintzier with each release. Now, Insurrection is packaged in a completely asinine case that literally has the two discs touching one another! It's bad enough that, editorially speaking, the Trek DVDs have gotten weaker with each release, but can't they at least continue to ship them in packages that promote the physical protection of the discs inside?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Over-all great","review":"This movie may not be 'Trek worthy', but it was still awesome. I loved the Riker/Troi story! It gave me the closure i needed for their relationship."},{"rating":"2","title":"A light adventure film with some food for thought.","review":"As a Star Trek fan I was curious about the so called curse of the odd numbered Treks. I think this one finally broke that. This film was everything one could expect from Star Trek. I liked that it was a light outing as the last one was intense. This one was like a taking a breather without compromising the series themes. The idea of slowing down, that each moment is a universe in itself appealed to my Zen sensibilities.We should take this to heart in our fast paced lifestyle with all its stresses and crisis. Once again Star Trek gives a message to our culture . Perhaps we should listen closer. A worthy entry in the series. I can't wait to see what lies ahead in this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"It had all the classic sense that all the other movies had","review":"the special effects were good i hope that in the next one Troy and Riker still have feeling for each other.

Imagine my surprise when I started getting deja vu! The plot of this movie was interesting, but it would have made for a better TV episode. The love story between the Baku woman and Picard would have been better left out of the film. It was interesting that the two races wound up being the same, though. The story was decent, the movie itself followed Star Trek: TNG's usual stories, but just not a good plot choice for a feature length film. There wasn't really enough action for me. I'm not an expert movie critic, just my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well....um.....Okay!","review":"Insurreection for lacks two things:1) An interesting story and,2) A convincing enemy. F. Murray Abhram is a great actor, but this role, couple with his \\"holding back\\" may have made this movie fall a little short.Again the film is filled with cute scenes and certain actions that interesting. But overall, the director (Johnathan Frakes again (Commander WIlliam Riker) didn't seem to have as much fun in this one.The most ridiculous thing in it was that in the 24th century when you have a spaceship that is five football fields in length and the size of New York, is that your steering apparatus for this gigantic ship is a JOYSTICK! Yiches!Anyway, after you buy all the other films, this is the second to last to by of the Star Trek movies. (The last being \\"Star Trek V:The Final Frontier\\")Hopefully movie number 10 (Due out in fall 2002.) will be much better. Take a chance on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Star Trek movie","review":"This movie is, in a manner similar to IV, the perfect Star Trek movie - all that is so good about it. We see Data further explore humanity, and the good guys come to the rescue. There is humor, pathos, integrity. I cannot say enough about it. The only thing missing is the future. This story could be told in any time. The science fiction aspects of it are almost irrelevant. To all dedicated fans, you have to see this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This is a GREAT Movie!!! If you like Star Trek then you will love this movie.

There is nothing else to say, except buyer beware.Oh ya, ps. too bad there is not a choice for zero stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reminds Me Of Generations (ST 7)","review":"Okay was I the only one who felt like they were watching Generations all over again? What did Paramount do recycle from that movie into this one? Where is all the villians we've come to know and love? I mean they got First Contact right with the Borg. (A Favorite among us Star Trek fans). Why couldn't they get it right the second time around? Well it is an odd trek film and for some reason odd number films don't seem to do well. But still no excuse.It seems though that the cast will wait three years before making the next trek film. They have reportdly stated it will be their last and pick up from where Insurrection left off. My advice: If the next film will be your last why not have Q as the villian? I mean after all, hes one of our favorite characters and has been with ST since TNG came on the air. And still makes appearences on Voyager."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Star Trek Movie, Ties as Worst Movie with Star Trek V","review":"This has to be the worst Star Trek movie that I have ever seen, and I have seen all of them.

But before this movie, this series had been blessed with a form of consistant quality, that makes it easily the best series of its kind. This movie simply has a terrible plot. It has more holes than substance, with none of the basic storylines holding up to any kind of coherant thought. If the movie was more of an action movie they might get away with a little of this, but not here.This movie is based on the worst kind of moral absolutism that the TV series sometimes fell into. The crew desperatly over reacts to every situation so that they and they alone can solve this problem using the brightness of their halos. Sorry, but instead of thinking that they are these really great people, if I were the federation I would court-martial them for stupidy, which is what the authors of this script should face."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth anyone's time","review":"I went into this film expecting live everyone else a good action film, like most of the other Trek fans. But like first contact, the trailer was a bald-face lie hatched by Paramount just to get us into the theatre's door, because there is very little action. It does have a lot of character, but no movement whatsoever. This film is about the Enterprise crew disabaying the prime directive, not interfering in a civilization, and tries to save them from the Federation and bad guys who have found the \\"fountain of youth\\". What a joke! I hate to say it, but this is even worse than the Final Frontier! The music is sweet and corny, and everywhere there are children running around and playing in the grass and crap like that.

The acting top notch. The story line is good though the plot somewhat weak. This would have made a much better tv episode or made for tv movie than a theatrical release. I feel this movie doesn't know what it wants to be--a love story, an action/adventure, a drama, a comedy. It tries its hand on all the elements yet comes up short. It's a good effort that just doesn't pay off at the end. It's one of the weaker movies in the series, but still enjoyable enough to watch on a Saturday night with the family."},{"rating":"1","title":"So forgettable I actually forgot it once.","review":"This film is actually worse than most episodes of the Next Generation. It might give the die hard trekkers who don't care about plot or logic something to guffaw at with its nearly soap opera qualities, but those of us who actually can remember when a star trek movie was a good movie and not just a good inside joke yearn for better than this. Along with Generations, it consitutes the worst Trek film yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding me? No, Trekkers won't swallow everything!","review":"The \\"mighter-than-thou\\" crew of the USS Enterprise decide that they know better than the entire Federation Council (including the Vulcans) and override the decision to remove the _non-native_ Ba'ku from their _non-native_ planet. Humph! The audacity of the Council! Remove these handful of vagabonds so that the planet can be used to save the lives of wounded Federation defenders from a genocidal race that wishes the erratication of all Alpha-Quadrant beings??

It is not first contact though which even people who hated star trek liked."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie has it all!","review":"What is with all these negative reviews? This movie combines all the best qualities! It's STAR TREK, it has humor, action, message (without being too preachy), romance (and I'm not really into romance, but in this case it was actually not bad)! Anyone who doesn't like this movie just cannot be pleased. Or perhaps their tastes are just bizarre. Anyway, support TNG! (Not just for TNG's sake, but because it's a good movie.) Buy Insurrection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No Oscars but vintage Trek","review":"Great film! When someone knocks it they say it's simply fluff and didn't have any overall effect in the Trek Universe.Who the heck cares? This is vintage stuff. Yep, it has some stuff stolen from the episode \\"Who Watches the Watchers?\\" but the message and the following plot is relatively fresh.No mandatory scenes like in the first TNG movies. In the 1st we knew we would have to see some contrived plot putting Picard and Kirk on screen at the same time. We knew we would have to see the Enterprise. We knew we would have to see Data get his emotion chip and a few cutsie scenes about it. In the 2nd, MOST of us knew we would have to see the Borg.This movie was, as some lament, a \\"big-budget TV episode.\\" Damn straight. And I got my money's worth on a Trek film for the first time since I saw \\"ST IV\\" on the big screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie,wrong villians.","review":"Once again the Star Trek series has another notch in its belt.And keeps on going strong.This was a great movie,super effects and a easy to follow story.But I thought that the introduction of two unknown alien races was the wrong thing to do in a Star Trek feature film. The die hard fans will have no problem with new faces and names,but the casual fan will be uninterested,and wonder who the heck is this person? Thats why i think Star Trek First Contact did better than this film. Everyone loves the Borg!!All in all a great movie to watch. Cant wait till the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would have made a good 2 part TV show.","review":"If you are a trekie, you must see it (of course). But this is not movie class stuff. It's all about a single planet. No saving the Universe. The Enterprise gets attacked and they run! The impulse engines are over worked, and smoke! Picard learns a new trick. He can effect time, or slow down things around him. Maybe he himself speeds up. This new talent is not used. At one point the crew are shooting down small objects, lots of them. This is when Picard should have used his new skill. He could have made Data look bad buy firing 10 times per second, then Data could have said \\"How the hell?\\" or something. This new trick does seem stupid, I wish it was not in the movie. Anyway, this movie would have been a good NG TV show!Treker"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Movie","review":"This was a good movie. Not as great as its predecessor Star Trek: First Contact, but has great f/x, and an ok story line. It was time for the producers to add some light comedy to a series that has had 2 previous movies that had a serious undertone to them. I enjoyed it this movie a lot. It also helped to explore the Picard and Data more fully since First Contact. It also showed that Picard has a human heart afterall. It was funny and intense at the same time."},{"rating":"1","title":"How did this insult to \\"Star Trek\\" fans happen?","review":"Michael Piller should publicly apologize for everyone to developing the story for this film. It's nothing more than an ill-fated attempt to apologize for all the war-like stuff we were seeing in DS9 at the time of this film's emergence. I was actually offended by this movie, as though Paramount was talking out of both sides of its mouth. Worse yet was the way the advertised this movie as \\"action-packed,\\" which it most certainly is not. What happened to the drama? This movie doesn't even have a happy ending, it has a sappy ending! The Enterprise and her crew don't have to blow something up every five minutes, not by a long shot. That's not what \\"Trek\\" is really about. \\"Star Trek V\\" pulled off a much better show, compensating for a weak plot with some great moments between the characters. \\"Insurrection\\" offered even little of that, and as far as I'm concerned, we haven't had a real Trek movie since '96."},{"rating":"2","title":"ITS NOT THE BEST BUT HELL ITS NOT THE WORST","review":"Hey I liked this movie, I'm not a star trek fan.

Downhill from there. While trying to maintain ultimate 'cuteness', this film becomes silly and unfulfilling. Frakes decides to deep six the starship models and opts for CGI only - and it shows. When I saw this movie in the theater I thought the Enterprise looked fuzzy because of the screen I saw it on (although it was at Mann's Chinese theater in Hollywood!). Upon DVD viewing I saw that all the starship shots are fuzzy because of the CGI rendering. They almost look video game-ish. Nothing, plot-wise, is taken to fruition, except the warmed up left-over we've eaten once before - the bad guy gets blown up in the end. Stewart and co-stars are capable of so much more - let's hope the next time the crew dons their space tights they become three dimensional characters that are actually headed somewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"what were they thinking???....","review":"When i heard this film was gonna be more funny and lighthearted the last one i thought it would be awful and i was right.Star trek films are better when they have a darker tone eg: ST2, ST6 and first cantact , when will they realise that??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the critics said","review":"Movie critics are pack animals. As soon as someone made the observation that the odd-numbered Star Trek movies seemed to be worse than the even-numbered, the hack-critics started repeating this ad nauseum.

By the same note, the people who say it was the worst Trek, or even the worst film of the year are just mad that the film was not as good as it could have or should have been. The film lies somewhere in between.

La idea de la historia es interesante,el libro no la aprovecha sino que cae en los lugares convencionales de: algo de accion,algo de romance y unos cuantos tipos con disfraz de extraterrestres (?por que los detalles asquerosos de RuFAR?.La idea respeta el espiritu de la serie,la pelicula prefiere los efectos especiales {no siempre utiles a la historia} que,por otra parte, en First Contact fueron mucho mejor utilizados y mas creibles {el E NCC1701E no se ve real}.Algunas escenas graciosas me parecen ridiculas , sobre todo no concuerdan con los personajes.A pesar de todo las ganas de ver a TNG son mas fuertes que mis criticas y estoy esperando una proxima pelicula en el mejor estilo de la serie y de First Contact."},{"rating":"2","title":"perhaps not a great film...but it is true trek","review":"Whereas, Wrath of Khan and First Contact stand on their own as terrific films, whether you're a ST fan or not, Insurrection, has to rank up there with Final Frontier and Generations: films that despite their plot holes and somewhat disappointing special effects, succeed because we Trekkers love the characters, and they stay true to the original Trek concepts.However, I must say that Paramount has really missed the boat on these DVDs. Insurrection comes with a lame 10 minute making-of featurette, but that's it. Let's face it, we Trekkers are the ones who WOULD sit through a two hour director's commentary, or 5 theatrical trailers, or real behind-the-scenes documentaries, etc.If you liked the film, then by all means buy the DVD, but I suspect that down the road, Paramount will release a Special Edition box set with all of the extra crap. Until then, my widescreen video editions of Star Treks 1-8 will have to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was pleasantly surprised. . .","review":". . .by this \\"Next Generation\\" picture.While I thorougly enjoyed many of the \\"Star Trek: Next Generation\\" television episodes, I have been disappointed by the \\"Next Generation\\" movies. \\"Generations\\" was OK -- \\"First Contact\\" was insulting to all classic 'trekkies'.HOWEVER, \\"Insurrection\\" was wonderful. The plot was reasonable (considering 24th century technology, of course) and the moral questions which were explored were relevant and meaningfully discussed.In addition, the cinematography and special effects lived up to the high standard which fans of \\"Star Trek\\" in its various incarnations have come to expect.I'm truly sorry I missed this one in the theatre."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's ok.","review":"I just watched this movie, and when my wife asked me if I liked it, I didn't know what to say. The special effects are good, the acting is fine, but this movie just didn't grab me. That's not to say that I didn't enjoy it, but it seems like the story is too small for a movie. The whole premise seems a little weak and then there's all the usual \\"save the day\\" tactics with no surprises.It's not so much that this is a bad Star Trek movie, but that I was hoping for a lot more. If they took this back to the cutting room and remove 40 minutes they could make one of the all time best TV shows. Instead, you have a movie which lies somewhere in the middle of all Trek films.If you're just going to buy one, I'd get the Wrath of Khan. If you've already got a few, this isn't a bad one to add to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"StarTrek Insurection","review":"All in all it was a good film.

I just hope that Star Trek 10 will be lots better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A special Trek film, I love it!","review":"Insurrection is not the best of all Trek movies, but also not the wrost one. I think it is the most beautiful Star Trek movie than ever made. When I saw this movie at theater first time, I have a terrible feeling. Because it doesn't look good as First Contact. Then I watched it again with VHS version, my feeling have changed and I find out myself really love this film. Although the storyline is not epic, and I really like the scenes that Enterprise-E fight with Son'a warships. It remind me THE WRATH OF KHAN.

I don't know... moving 600 people so countless billions in the galaxy can be saved by a new medical technology... sounds like a compelling reason to me.

A lil glamor but falls short of military tactics that made Star Trek famous. It's for the \\"socker mom\\" type. Not a real \\"man type\\" movie. This was kiddie fare stuff, nothing but wimpy crying men scared to excercise their machoism. It lacked adventure and mystery. They spent more time looking at their hand-held \\"tri-corders\\" than they did observing what they had to do, I don't see how they got where they were going. One redeeming value though, the movie wasn't all that \\"cartoonish\\". i.e. Star Wars.

The story line is weak, complex relationships and tensions among crew members are torn apart and solved in a blink of an eye. Seems like a big revenge strike against those who always knew better (and used to be in charge). Characters are flat and their relationships reflect no desire for bridging cultural gaps, for understanding, something that used to be so important in the saga. I do not really see why every feature version has to come with a full destruction of the ship, but so be it, if the story carries. Unfortunately, also the directing makes it clear from the very beginning that the god guys are going to win once more, an attitude which (since we know this will happen because it has to) frankly reflects the lack of precision in directing (not only the story). A pity, but this is just a crash and explosion movie that tries to exploit the saga. Well, I guess it worked at the time, and it paid well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie?

Star Trek TNG had a big budget and great writers and we all fell in love with it. Most Trek fans think this movie is just a two-hour television episode made into a movie, I happen to think it's an excellent representation of what Star Trek is all about. Great special effects (you can never get enough of them.)Once again Brent Spinner steals the show as an android gone mad and a loveable best friend. Finally Picard acts like himself and not some phsyco Borg dude. After watching this movie you feel good.

Instead, a Ni-Cad battery lasts longest if you discharge it fully and then charge it up. It's the perfect solutions for a camera. I've bought five of these batteries.

Factors like a healthy self-image and certain other attributes can change a negative and failure-prone personality to a positive one that admits no defeat and recognizes that good luck is not an accident. In reality, \\"good luck\\" means the attraction of favorable chances by a positive mind-set within. Personality factors that attract luck include a high energy level, generosity and a firmly held belief that one is lucky. Also, the will to attract luck, in the author's own words: \\"The extent to which we make ourselves luckier is likely to be directly proportional to the force of our will to be lucky. The will to be lucky is the crux of our internal development, the channel through which we can realize our full potentialities as lucky human beings.\\" This is a pleasant read with valuable practical advice that will benefit the reader if applied to her/his life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Disturbing...","review":"This is a very dark unsettling little book. It's a fairly fast read and wastes little on long winded exposition. Some events are left vague and blurry like a bad dream. I found myself asking what just happened quite a few times... If you dig expressionsim you'll find probably enjoy this book.A little side note though the last chpater titled \\"fragment\\" is not part of the original text. It kind of kills the mood and I'd recommend letting the book sit a while before reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful visions","review":"I bought this for a 9 year old girl.

She doens't have much trouble holding her eye to the opening and seeing the colors. My 2- year old however can't quite figure it out. It's a fun gadget. Not exactly a toy, because I suspect that it would break if played with roughly. Not with like usual play, but if left under a another toy or stuffed animal and stepped on, the shape of it lends itself to snapping in the middle. Not something I would want to clean up. I usually take the glitter wand out of the kaleidoscope area to store it, and it's durable enough to toss in our regular toy box. I just make sure it's flush and flat against the bottom so there's no downward pressure on the middle of the tube. This will last for quite a while unless something traumatic happens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awful pretty.","review":"The display is very pretty.Don't aim it at the light like a regular kaleidoscope -- the light should be to the side of the tube at 90 degrees. Use a bright CFC light bulb (say 100W equivalent), and hold the toy close the light (a few inches away)."},{"rating":"2","title":"High quality, what you'd expect","review":"I agree with the previous reviewer (the first I think was referring to the soft case) but I will add a couple of things.First of all, like the camera itself this case is very high quality. There are two negitives I'll mention:1. You cannot really use the viewfinder. 1/3 of the view is blocked by the lens housing so you'll end up using the screen and using more battery power.2. The camera is a TINY bit loose in the case. It will shake just a little bit. It was fixed by ising a small amount of tape on the \\"rails\\" that hold the camera. Really no big deal.The strap is really nice and can be worn like a traditional SLR which is nice for boating or rugged use. Really a neat case if your camera would normally be in danger.One thing-- I had read a review elsewhere which made it seem like the display could not be turned on or off in the case. Not true, you do have access to the display botton for conserving power."},{"rating":"2","title":"nursery rhymes","review":"very cute frame. went perfect with our theme. no surprises,what you see is what you get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Are you listening?","review":"This is one of the best cd's I have ever purchased.

It really does have an old-school R&B feel to it (a la early Marvin Gaye and Otis Redding, The Four Tops, Gladys Knight and the Pips). This is a first rate slow jam. It is not revolutionary, don't look for anything overly innovative. Carl Thomas knows his strengths, an excellent voice and good song-writing skills, and he works with those. He is not D'Angelo, he's not going out on a limb.

Carl Thomas is one talented brother. The title cut of the album is one of the most beautiful songs and so is the rest of the album. His album is like a cross from classic soul to a mellow R&B. I listen to his album in my car, at home with a nice glass of wine (maybe red) and I then relax and let the music take it's course. Listening to his music and reading his album credits really show that he had alot of creative control on his album, which most new artists do not have. His album is an exception from all the rest because you can play it over and over again and never get tired of listening to great music."},{"rating":"1","title":"I WISH He Didnt Make This CD!","review":"GIRL! When I first heard I WISH, I was like...\\"NO HE DIDNT\\". Let me just say this...I HATE that song w/a PASSION! The lyrics are SO stupid and to top it off, the song only has 4 beats! . I HATE the piano introduction. I HATE his voice. I HATE his lyrics!If I had to choose what song I like best of his it would be...NONE! Any fool can write lyrics talking bout..\\"I wish I never met her..even though I love her so.\\"No of his songs appealed to me at all.

Seventeen! And you have to get to 14, 15, 16 to hear some great singing (Supastar, Summer Rain, Hey Now) outstanding songs. Why? Why is it some artists feel they have to bombard you with 17 tracks of useless noise instead of focusing on 9 or 10 great tracks? I can't believe I put the time in to find the 3 songs that are simply outstanding on this CD....I didn't give up after the first dozen of painful tracks..wish i had a delete key to get rid of the horrible songs....this guy can flat out sing...someone give him a new producer or songwriter"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could I give this a zero stars, please?","review":"It's been said that for every 8-10 artists the RIAA supports, only one returns a profit. I now know why that is.I'll admit to not owning the album. Just the first song I've heard (\\"I Wish\\") is enough for me to toss the disk into the garbage if someone bought me the disk. It doesn't even warrent being a coaster. Yes, it's that bad.\\"Then she dropped the bomb on me/When she said that she/was unhappily married with children/and I wish I never met her, at all\\" Or: \\"Oooooaaaaaooooo. Anything. I am anything. I am the one that you're perceiving in your heart.\\" Yes. Such deep, meaningful, high quality lyrics go so well with music that sounds like someone just got a new keyboard and thought that music consists of pounding a few keys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mellow Fellow","review":"I especially love what I call real R&B like Brian Mcknight, Maxwell, Eric Benet, etc. I heard I Wish and thought he had to be one of them: great voice, nice style, nice flow. I listened to it and the only thing different from what I expected was that most of his songs are really mellow, slow flowing. Its like the perfect CD for a day or night of relaxing on the couch with a book and tea, or daydreaming in a tub full of bubbles. Its like a CD for musical healing. I would also recommend it for a nice evening for the couple. I personally expected a more eclectic score of songs pertaining to flow and rythm, but other than that the album is very good, Carl is a great singer with a great style. Perfect for your afternoon at home after a stressful day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Perfection","review":"Carl Thomas has taken R&B back to what it needs to be. Instead of money, cars, and drugs, Thomas remains grounded. He sings about things that the \\"average joe\\" can relate to. He has also brought back great writing which has become a problem lately. For instance: Can you pay my bills? Can you pay my telephone bills? Blah, Blah, Blah. Basically, this is trash and Carl Thomas has set himself a part from the average sound. The soothing, sexual, relaxing melodies force me give the album a five-star review."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm The MaN","review":"Anybody who credits themselves on having their own opinions should pay absolutely no attention to the words of the (above) \\"critic\\" Ricky Wright. What an absurd review, this is the most creative soul music for a long time and summing it up with a sentence like \\"...seems flat against the light of day.\\" is a ridiculous one to say the least.Also, anyone who would base a 'non-musical' interlude as a way of \\"bucking the formula\\" needs to actually listen to the CD.If the formula has not been 'bucked' on this CD - for this style of music - I don't know what will.Carl Thomas Rock on! PD Rock on! Bad Boy Rock on! (me) Rock on!PeAcE EASY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"True voice, true soul","review":"I have to say, this CD proved to be one of the year's most pleasant surprises. Though Carl Thomas is part of Sean \\"Puffy\\" Comb's Bad Boy family, this record bears no resemblance to previous R&B releases from the label (with the possible exception of Faith Evans) in that it has soul. Musically, all most all of the tracks are well produced, quiet storm material, but what seperates this album from the pack is Thomas's voice, which the radio hit \\"I Wish\\" only hints at. Think a sort of Johnny Gill/Brian McKnight/Sam Cooke combination. Cuts like \\"Emotional\\" and \\"Cold Cold World\\" showcase an expressive combination of power and subtlety that really make you FEEL the emotions of the song. The album also carries a distinct old school vibe, in particular, \\"Give You All My Love\\" (Think Isley Brothers), and \\"Superstar\\" (Think Stylistics). If you're a fan of Soul music, definetly give this album a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"I Wish\\" Carl Thomas Had Come Out Sooner!","review":"Carl Thomas's debut CD \\"Emotional\\" is a MUST HAVE! He has an exceptional voice that sounds like no other artist out today. He sings with so much soul and emotion that the listener can actually empathize with him. Of couse, I am totally loving his debut single \\"I Wish.\\" This single is the classic love song of regret. Thomas sings as if he KNOWS what he is singing about--hurt, pain, and the loss of love! And the video to \\"I Wish\\" is one of the few videos that actually complements the song! I love that and would not change the video. It's perfect! Other songs that are \\"must listen to\\" cuts are \\"Lady, Lay Your Body,\\" \\"Emotional,\\" \\"Cold, Cold World,\\" and one of my favorites \\"Summer Rain.\\" If you don't have this CD, RUN and go get it! It's a must have for any lover of classic pure, R&B Soul Music."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"SO EMOTIONAL\\" , yet slightly uneven.","review":"I just purchased SO EMOTIONAL, and just finished playing it, and for what it's worth, it's pretty good, yet pretty confusing. On certain songs, his voice fits perfectly, on others, it's like he TRYING to make it fit perfectly. There are tracks where his voice shouldn't be on it at all! Believe it or not, I focused on the music more than the artist. Carl Thomas has potential, so I won't write him off. What is needed is for all tracks on his next offering to blend in and fit with his voice, so that the end result will make a more balanced effort. Last I heard, square pegs still don't fit in round holes."},{"rating":"2","title":"emotionally yours","review":"I am totally in love with this cd. i feel the way i feel when i listen to al green, stevie wonder, soulful. true, \\"i wish\\" is his commericial success, but the cd proves to be one of the best this year. stand-outs on \\"emotional\\": \\"emotional, giving you all my love (feat. kelly price--this should of been on her cd as well,)you ain't right, summer rain and my favorite of all--hey now.\\" as carl said, many babies will be made from the cd this year and years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sexy Sounds From a Sexy Man","review":"This has got to be the hottest, not to forget sexiest, slow jam C.D. of the summer. Carl Thomas is not afraid to tell you how he feels in everyone of his songs. Coming from a sister who has had her share of heart breaks, lonely night cries, and fantasies of being romanced, as Carl Thomas romances everone with his soulful sound, I know where he is coming from in everyone of his songs and I am sure that you will too. Fellas make your night with your favorite girl just a little more romantic by popping Carl in the C.D. player and Ladies after a long hard day or breakup etc. get in to that steaming hot bubble bath listen to Carl and your troubles will go bye-bye. It's kind of like Carl Thomas' voice is a medicine that makes you feel better when you're sick. Take it from me Carl Thomas' C.D. will do the trick."},{"rating":"2","title":"It will restore your faith in true love","review":"I was hooked from the first time I heard Carl Thomas' ballad \\"I Wish\\" on the radio. I still can't get enough of it, and let's not even talk about the remix featuring L.L. Cool J. When stations followed up with the title track \\"Emotional\\" then \\"My Valentine,\\" and \\"Summer Rain,\\" I knew that Carl Thomas was a brother who was going to be on the music scene for a while. Carl Thomas' cd offers tight lyrics, smooth melodies, and just plain good music that has been long overdue. Ladies, this is the cd to pop in for your candlelight bubble baths, and fellas, this is the cd to put on when you want to romance your special lady."},{"rating":"2","title":"musicman","review":"Simply put, Emotional is one of the best r&amp;b albums I've heard. Carl thomas is an artist that is in a class of his own on this one. To get the feel of the album, you need to listen from the first track and let it play through. It's so easy to have a song on repeat 3 or 4 times because there that good! My top 5 would be (not neccesarily in this order, but perhaps), Hey Now, Emotional, Cold World, You Ain't Right, and a tie between either Summer Rain and I Wish. If you like songs that you can feel, this CD is a good one, even on Lady Would You Lay, it's done in a way that isn't sexually vulgar for those of discriminating tastes even. It's different, it's a hungry artists debut, overall good album."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best soul/R&B releases of 2000!","review":"I do not usually get into R&B/Soul music that is embraced by the mainstream audience, but I decided to give Carl Thomas a chance after hearing so many good things about the album. I am glad I listened. I do not know how to classify this album because it is much better than most of the stuff that you hear on urban radio, but it is not quite neo-soul. This album is an example of what real R&B/Soul music is supposed to sound like. Hey Now and Supa Star are some tunes on here that are reminiscent of old-school sounds. Summer Rain, Emotional, Supa Star and Cold Cold World are some of my favorites. Get this album and if you are like me, the only button that you will be hitting while listening to this album is the repeat button."},{"rating":"2","title":"YES THIS IS....","review":"A great CD.

I have had to send it back to Creative three times at about $7 a pop for different reasons (a stuck button, audio cutting out, display cutting out, volume control only going up). Generally, support has been of little help until badgered into giving me an RMA. The last time, I sent it back I was told I would receive a new player. I have no way of knowing for sure that the player is \\"new\\" or \\"refurbished\\" (they said it would _not_ be refurbished), but judging from the condition of the case, I'm a bit suspicious. The player, however, is having problems with the display cutting out.

For starters the normally ships in 24 hours ended up shipping in about a week. When it did arrive it was fairly easy to set up. The software that came with it was very good and made it very easy for a novice mp3 user to both add internet music and rip stuff from my CD's. The mp3 functions are fine and the sound is good. Now the problems- after about three hours use the unit stopped working. The battery clip wasn't holding enough tension on the battery to make contact, when I tried to fix it broke. With a small piece of tinfoil I was able to make due. Now my major complaint- The FM tuner is garbage. I'm in the NY Metro area, less than an hour from Manhattan, and I am totally unable to pull in the major stations and those that do come in switch between stereo ad mono making them un usable.

They would not repair or replace this unit. This player sat on my desk for 2 months was never dropped or damaged by me in any way.

This is a great book with a truly unique style and voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"I thought this was a good book. It was very realistic. I liked how Elliot decides what he is going to do with his life. He sticks by his decision and does what he wants even though everyone around him does not support it. He learns to deal with hard issues and his family. He still keeps in contact with his family and old friends from Tennessee. He also makes new friends and starts a whole new life in D.C. This book goes to show that just because you do not go to college, does not mean that you are going to be a failure in life. Elliot learns a lot of new things and he sticks by what he believes in.

The concept of this book had so much potential, I can't understand why the author didn't do a better job of conveying the adventures of a punk across to the reader. Eliot, the main character, was active in the DC punk scene, but there was only a terse interaction within that scene. Overall, the book reads like one giant zine. If it's a zine you want, buy a zine. If you want a book, don't buy Tales of a Punk Rock Nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"this book was extremely boring. i bought it expecting a nonfiction point of view about the historic punk scene, but what i got was a boring tale about a vegetarian who moves into a city and lives with others like him.

Elliot moved to DC about a decade too late - after the punk/hardcore underground had long been drained of its choler & fury, replaced by apathy and infiltrated by confused, bourgeois transplants with delicate ideas. Elliot, not surprisingly, btiches about the state of affairs in DC punk, lives and works in all the trendy spots, starts an emo band, rubs shoulders with aging sXe scensters, and then promptly leaves. Too bad. Underneath the camouflage of Elliot's DC is a tremendously interesting city; flavored with Go-Go music, endless summer heat, and some of the most eclectic, gritty neighborhoods on the East Coast.

Its description of two friends' promising beginings, full of idealism and high aspirations which in the end come to naught, crushed by the hum-drum mediocrity of daily life, remains unmatched.Watching the hero stumble along his path, making his rather foolish errors is extremely frustrating, but these mis-steps are all too realistic.

I leave it to others to decide what Frederick Moreau's gradual loss of idealism says about human nature. This novel is in many ways an epic poem, so sonorous and beautiful are the descriptions.

Since Moreau's sentimental obsession with Madame Arnoux drives the action to a large degree and he never lets go of it despite his experience he is a study in arrested development. He lives through tulmutuous times , witnesses fortunes made and lost and yet in the end returns with his boyhood friend to where he began and seems to have absorbed no lesson from any of it.Flaubert's prose is eloquent and at times incredibly poetic in it's descriptions of settings and expression of feelings and the translation here is excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Disappointed!!","review":"I have ordered a lot of used books on Amazon and always had success.

I had to go to the hardware store to purchase missing bolts and nuts. The angle from the metal tube (part of the reel assy) with male fitting to the hose which is taken up on the reel is insufficient and causes any hose to 'kink'. I fixed this by routing the hose to the outer ring of the reel and tying it with a tie-wrap. This affords the hose a more gradual and kink-free bend.

When that box arrived it had the wrong parts and wrong hardware packet. Another call to the company... more incorrect parts. It's now Dec. 16 and we're calling again for more parts (getting only voicemail and a message that they'll return our call on the next business day). We should have simply returned the hose reel in the first place instead of trying to \\"work with them\\" and make it right.

The box was pretty beat up when it arrived, but I didn't want to deal with shipping it back. Some small parts (bolts, etc.) did not match the instructions. The handle is supposed to slide onto the rest of the assembly but was almost an inch wider than that. Finally, the hole for the bolt to lock the handle to the rest of the cart was \\"dimpled\\" in which wouldn't allow it to slide over the tubing.After some sand paper, lubricant, and alot of muscle, the cart is together.

The good points are:1) It holds a lot of hose.2) It is easy to wind up this large amount of hose.3) Easy to transport, but since I leave it in place most of time, it's not that big of a deal.The downside is that it probably won't make it through another season.1) The reel is starting to get very stiff and hard to turn.2) The chrome handle, pushbar and wheels are rusting badly.3) The green paint is peeling and rushing underneath.At this price I expected this to out live the cheaper plastic reels, but I'm very disappointed with the quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Parts missing","review":"If I had listened to previous reviewers, I may not have bought this item.

It was much easier to access the camera and extras than all the other bags I've seen (due to its outer flap and inner zippered flap that both opened wide). The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was because the outer flap did not seal in such a fashion that sand and such could be well kept out (it was not really a problem on my Caribean vacation however).

Too much focus on his personal quirks and not enough on how the music developed, except Chris Blackwell trying to justify his adding guitar overdubs and faster tempos in an attempt to appeal to rock audiences."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional!","review":"This was one of the best documentaries I have seen on Bob Marley's life. I love how it went back to before his childhood and ended after his death. I think it clears up quite a few misconceptions about Marley and even sheds light on his relationship with Rita. The music was wonderful, quite a few songs that weren't previously released. Any true fan of Marley should get this DVD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing documentary!","review":"I was a fan of Bob Marley before but after watching this documentary, my respect for him grew ten fold. I didn't know anything about his story or his background, or even how he died. I just loved his music and thought he was awesome. He was such an amazingly inspirational human being, and I feel that this documentary really captured that. The never before seen interviews and footage were so great to see. It made me want to learn any and everything about him. Luckily the boyfriend has his biography so I'll be reading that as soon as possible. I highly recommend this movie for any Marley fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marley","review":"This was a great movie. It left me with wanting to know more.

There was more in depth information in this - than the previous one. I would recommend it for those fans of Marley. I was aware of most of the information as I had bought another one years ago that was included with a full performance from the Rainbow Theater in London. But for those that don't have that - and are Marley fans - I would recommend this.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bob","review":"Growing up in Jamaica, you tend to hear a lot about \\"Bob\\" and you come to view him as a folk hero. This documentary showcased Bob\\" the man and was an eye-opener. Visits to the Bob Marley museum hint at a lot of what is revealed in the documentary but I think this film provides more of an understanding of the reasons behind the music. I rented the movie and now I intend to buy it and I don't feel like I've wasted a penny. Enough really cannot be said about how honest this film was and how authentic the people portrayed were. I did chuckle a couple times when I saw Jamaicans being Jamaicans but I think this added to the honesty of the documentary. I was not displeased and would recommend this to any Jamaican or Marley enthusiast."},{"rating":"2","title":"A definate must-see","review":"I absolutely enjoyed this film about Bob Marley. I'm a Marley fan and also being a Jamaican made me want to check this out. I have nuff respect for Bob and what he has done for reggae music.

I loved all the interview clips of Bob. That is something that I have not seen alot of. Also loved the commentary from Rita, Ziggy, Cedella, and the various people that worked with or knew Bob. I thought there was a perfect mix of interviews and performances. The best part for me, something that I haven't heard alot about before, was the last few months of his life. I think the movie covers that well."},{"rating":"2","title":"marley","review":"My husband was very pleased and watches it every chance he gets.

The interviews are touching as well as funny. The Bunny Wailer interview is worth the price alone. The movie is also lovely to watch from a visual standpoint. The live footage of Bob Marley performing is captivating, giving the viewer a chance to experience the power and talent that Marley used to get his message of peace and love for all people to his audience. HIs passing was all to soon but this film carries the torch and is the only film about Bob Marley that is authorized by his estate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost as good as seeing him perform live","review":"I had the privelege of seeing Marley in concert several times.

The movie itself was fine, well produced, and portrayed Marley in a neutral light. I was interested in learning more about the man, but now I'm glad that I was never into his music. I have to admit that if I didn't have a streaming video credit, I would not have wasted the money on the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great footage, great story telling","review":"An interesting and seldom-told history of Bob Marley and reggae with amazing archives and tour footage.

No matter how many times I play it, it still manages to make my head spin. It's witty lyrics are humorous, yet thought-provoking. Their appeal may however be limited by the necessity for the listener to have quite a good grasp of Nigerian pidgin English. I doubt though that this will significantly detract from the rich textures and tones of the music. I'd strongly recommend it to jazz saxophone fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"angry musician attacks system with rootsy african funk","review":"Fela ain't happy. He's been oppressed, jailed, and hassled by his government and colonial mentality.Luckily he has an outlet- Really awesome music.This album combines African rhythms, funky horns, and angry lyrics fighting for justice in a corrupt society.

I was looking for a seasoned, balanced counter to current Dispensational teaching. I was very disappointed. The tone, in my opinion, was at times sarcastic. It is very tiring to hear why something cannot possibly be a fact because \\"it doesn't make sense\\". The author spends too much time nitpicking details for this reason. My other frustration is that the author spends a great deal of time saying the other position must be true because a bunch of early Church Father's believed this. Not satisfying or helpful, in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a very good buy","review":"the product arrived on time, but the quality is poor.

The entire 1st chapter is nothing new to anyone who has ever looked at statistics or data of any kind. Nor is much of the rest of the book for that matter. There are a few good ideas near the end, however, he spends so much time talking in circles, quoting himself, and using writing styles that I would never accept from my students that much of the meaning is lost in the process. Perhaps it is simply the style of his writing I do not like.

It is a combination of education and tear jerking laughs. It is the kind of book that you think will be a preacher, but in reality the author is subtle in his teaching method, but extremely effective. He teaches so you want to learn and he has a real knack for making you want to \\"tame your tounge.\\" After reading cuss control I feel like I am a lot more aware of how I affect others in conversation and I am also a lot more aware of how others affect me with their swearing."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you have a problem with profane language, then read this book","review":"I laughed when I got this book from a friend because I did not realize how much I was swearing. I was just getting used to using profane language and sometimes I would catch myself when I was in front of kids. It was starting to become too casual and not just reserved for when I was really mad. However, my friend noticed and got me this book.

When those wore out we went to get another batch from Amazon. We were surprised with how much thinner it was and how much less resistance these new ones offered.

I have found this thing to be very accurate at measuring distance. Shortly after I got it, I took it to a local track and ran 4 miles to get a feeling for the accuracy. The RS200SD reported that I had run 4.02 miles. That works for me. I do lots of trail runs among 200\\" Redwood trees and unlike a GPS based device, it never lets you down. I have found that the heart rate reading seems to lag a bit, but it's no big deal. The reason I give this heart rate monitor only 4 stars is because I find that I have to clean the contacts on the chest strap before every run, or it give inaccurate or sporadic heart rate information. When it is working, it is the best heart rate /pace/distance tool I have ever used."},{"rating":"2","title":"rsd200sd--Awesome","review":"I got the watch as a gift in December.

My watch went blank after a few months of careful use and is now completely useless. The wristband also cracked after only a month. The construction of the unit doesn't seem up to par and I found the buttons to be fiddley and unresponsive. Also the software seemed slow with a lot of waiting when switching between screens. It does the basics well though - the footpod and chestband both worked fine and I found it to be pretty accurate for measuring heartrate, distance and speed. However, until they sort out the reliability problems I have a hard time recommending this unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Morale Buster","review":"I just bought this heart rate monitor while deployed overseas a few weeks ago from Amazon, and I finally got it. Maybe it's a great tool if it actually works. I happened to received the product with defects. When I got the watch it didn't work at all, sadly the battery was dead. I got the battery changes, which worked for a day. Then the display started to dim while I was using the unit. After my workout, the battery was changed for the second time and the same issue happened. Now I'm in the process of sending the unit back to Polar for repair, which will take weeks before I even get it back for use again.I did a research of the different type of heart rate monitor that Amazon has to offer, before settling for the Polar RS200SD which I think really wasted my time. If I could go back, I woul've never purchase this item.****Update***After using the watch for about a year, the LCD display is already dimming. The battery was just replaced!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This watch is an excellent choice for basic running. I'm not an athlete, but I wanted to start some exercise after Christmas parties. I bought it with the footpod and works great. It can measure distance, speed, calories, heart rate, and time of course. It records average values and maximum values. You can access polar personal trainer on the web, open a free account and download information via microphone, to the web service. Really good for establishing a goal and keep track of your progress. The only complain I have is that you need at least 8 hours to read user manual and other 8 hours to try a test, and to know how to use it, otherwise you will be using only 20% of it capacity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Well","review":"This watch/heart monitor is just what I expected.

I know I am pretty thick, but I did not realize there were dishwasher detergents out there that actually removed and prevented hard water stains. When I finally made a switch to something else (Finish powerball tablets), all my hard water woes went away. Before, we had been throwing away our clear glasses about once a year because they were so milky white from mineral deposits.

I smoked at least 5 cigarettes during my daily commute to or from work (about 40 minutes). I would light up almost every time I got a telephone call, after every meal, first thing in the morning...I was a typical, highly addicted smoker. Before reading this book it was hard for me to imagine a life without cigarettes. I started smoking when I was very young and, like most heavy smokers, I have spent the majority of my life smoking.This book works. It is that simple. The fact is that nicotine does not hold some magical power over your life or will. This book lays out why, scientifically and logically. It also provides a method to make the withdrawal a PLEASANT AND EMPOWERING EXPERIENCE. Quitting smoking was the greatest thing I have ever done for myself.

If you don't believe me, read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I quit after 25 years","review":"I started smoking, I realize after reading this book, because of a low self esteem problem that I had when I was only 13 years old.

I feel very very lousy for doing it and feel the need to get my own copy of this book and read it again. And again, if I have to. I do not want to be a smoker again, I have enjoyed so much freedom from them. I do a one hour work out daily and have never felt so good in all of my life.

I smoked for 12 years and tried to quit probably 30 to 40 times prior to reading this book. Quitting is incredibly easy and enjoyable once you have the mental battle won. He helps you do that. I always used to look at smokers and be jealous once I had quit. No more. Oh, it's been over a year now for me, I purchased this book for a friend.The book is very proud of itself.

Really the tips in the book are not anything special at all (don't use cigarette substitutes, don't chew gum or eat candy and think \\"by golly I'm happy being a non-smoker\\". If you are expecting subliminal messaging that would lead to putting down a cigarette it really isn't there.

More than anything it forces you to pick a quit date (the day you finish the book)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow !","review":"This has to be the best CD that I have Ever listen to on quitting smoking . I would recommend this to anyone that really wants to quit smoking & has tried everything else . I was a pack a day & then some smoker & I now am proud to say that I am a non smoker ! I don't know why I never thought of smoking the way Allen Carr puts it, but wow did he change my thoughts ! Thank You for writingthis book !"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Easy Way to Stop Smoking","review":"This book is a real eye opener. I couldn't put it down after I started reading it. It really does make quitting any type of tobacco much easier. It recommends not quitting until after you read it and gain the tools that make it an incredibly easy choice. Most of all it gives hope that even the most addicted tobacco user can quit.I liked the part about \\"thinking about what tobacco is doing for me\\" and \\"would I take the first cigarette if I was not addicted\\". It made me realize I could go back to the place where I was not addicted in the first place! And it only took a few weeks.Life's better now than before I smoked. Much better. And it was much easier than I thought.Thank you Allen Carr for the hope you gave me in a seemingly hopeless situation.Benny"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Helps!","review":"I have given this to a couple of friends as gifts. One really wanted to quit and finally has after more than 20 years as a smoker and multiple failed attempts. She did say that although this did help her to feel better about quitting she does still want to smoke when she sees/smells smoke. It has only been a week so far but she and her boyfriend report this time around has been the easiest so far. She definitely attributes that to the content in this audiobook. My other friend is still dragging out finishing the book...so I guess I can update if and when she finishes it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It actually works","review":"Several members of my family have gotten good results from reading this book My sister has been seven months without smoking after reading it.

I would always go back to smoking, which was really depressing for me. Then I have learned aobut this book from one of my classmates. I purchased it on Amazon with not much faith. I was reading it for aproximately 4 days. IT HELPED ME HALF WAY THROUGHT THE BOOK!I flushed all my cigaretes down the toilete and did not have a wish to smoke again. It has been three weeks since I have stopped. Earlier, wherever I would quit smoking, after a week a cigarete would feel like a blessing. Now, I tried smoking after the book and it just feels different. The pleasure of smoing disappeared completely, and I feel free!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It works.

I would definitely recommend this book to any smoker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book ever!","review":"This book works!!I didn't think it would be possible for anyone to quit smoking just by reading a book. Especially a long time smoker like me, but I did!!I'm so grateful for this book. I'm so much happier to be a non smoker and I know I will NEVER smoke again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great","review":"I read the reviews and thought this book would be great. It's not. It's very redundant and telling me 100 times it's easy to quit smoking doesn't make it easier.In the first chapter, the author tells you he got hypnotized and quit smoking. My question is \\"then why should I listen to your quit smoking method? Shouldn't I just get hypnotized?\\"I read the book and got little out of it. I got hypnotized and I haven't smoked for a week now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"Don't buy this book without reading the reviews that give 1 and 2 stars - there is nothing revealing or revolutionary in this book. It is short, useless and doesn't ACTUALLY tell you HOW to smoke smoking!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It just simply was not for me.","review":"I am generally open-minded but this book was not at all what I expected. The writing is terrible, he tries to pass off his opinions as facts, he is condescending and he is basically telling you to quit cold turkey and be happy about it. Apparently this does work for a lot of people, but I wasn't one of those people."},{"rating":"2","title":"15 months ago...","review":"I needed to quit smoking but I did not know if I wanted to. I read 3/4 of the book and set it down. The date of the 4th of July was a long way off so I set that day to quit. At 11:35pm I stopped. That was it! It worked. I stopped on the 4th of July, 2008, 15 months ago. Like the add said no withdrawls, no remorse. After 33 years at a pack a day it worked.

I received my book in a timely manner. All is good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Going on 3 years","review":"I smoke for 12 years and thought I could never quit. I read all the reviews on here and thought there had to be something. I figure what the heck I would give it a try for a $15 investment. I read the book and when I finished it I never picked up another cigarette. That was March 1st 2006. I am not even bothered by others smoking, my husband still smokes and have no cravings to have one. I tell everyohne I meet about this little miracule book. What can it hurt??"},{"rating":"2","title":"He quit! After 35 years!","review":"My husband read this book a few months ago. He didn't quit immediately. He had a lot of fear around quitting, although at the time he would never admit to that! He's smoked for 35 years. After the info from the book percolated through his system, he finally quit on Jan. 2nd. He attributes his ability to do this directly to this book... and the nicotine gum he's temporarily using. Good luck to everyone trying to quit. You CAN do it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stop Smoking!!!!! I DiD!!!!!!!!","review":"A friend recommended I buy this book through Amazon when I said I was looking for it. I read it!

It will be 2 years on July 30 this year!"},{"rating":"2","title":"All Smokers Must Read This Book.","review":"If you have any desire to stop smoking, or ever feel guilty lighting up a cigarette, you must read this book. Carr takes a logical approach to changing your perception of smokers to make quiting so much easier than you can ever imagine. No scare tactics or preaching of things you've already heard from TV or doctors a million times before; just simple logic that makes so much sense, you'll wonder why you ever started the habit in the first place.So don't be affraid, you'll be so much better off after you finish this book. TRUST ME!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This really works.","review":"I never would have thought that a book would help me quit smoking, but it did. I just happened upon this book by accident. I had been thinking about quitting, but was having a hard time making myself actually do it. So, I thought I would go online and look for a \\"how to\\" book. I happened upon this book and read the reviews and gave it a try. I got the book and began reading it immediately. Then I got sick with bronchitis and the book made even more sense to me. So, I just stopped smoking 3 weeks ago. I never suffered any withdrawal symptoms. I can't begin to describe how liberating it is to be a non-smoker. It's unbelivable! Thank you Allen Carr."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ummm...its a start.","review":"Okay. So I tried this book about a year ago and it helped me quit for a few days. It didn't really address the important psychological aspects for intellectuals like me. The book Quit Snap has been the most useful (I was able to quit after reading it)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't help if you actually enjoy smoking!","review":"I had high hopes for this book, but it didn't help me at all since it didn't address the one reason I smoke - I really enjoy it!I read the book twice, hoping I messed something the first time around, but I didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"The easy way to stop smoking","review":"I wasn't impressed at all with this book. I read the reviews before I bought so thought it was a good one. A lot of repetition, nothing wedon't already know. He did say at one point he went to a hypnotist andquit, so thats what I did and that has worked. Two weeks so far and joined a group for extra support. You really have to be ready."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is based on common sense and smoking is non sensical","review":"Sorry, found this book most unhelpful. If you know all the perils of smoking and continue to do so, like me at this time, don't think this book is going to help.This book is very logical and \\"left brained\\" which some addictions are not.This may be a wonderful tool for some, not me."},{"rating":"2","title":"OMG!","review":"20 years of smoking, and many attempts to quit, 4 hypnotherapy sessions later... DONE!!! Someone had to tell me how it made sense to me! Not the usual stuff. Tells you how to think and talk to yourself as you are going through it. Finally, someone tells you the psychological aspects! I've recommended it dozens of times in the 2 years since I have quit!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It helps BIG TIME!!!","review":"I heard about this book in an online forum weeks ago and found it recently in a book store. In conjuction with a medication to quit smoking this book has helped tremendously! The way Allen Carr exposes the illusions of smoking is amazing. I now see smoking in a way that I never would have realized without the book. If you want to quit smoking, I HIGHLY recommend this book. It has helped me..."},{"rating":"2","title":"To the point, very good","review":"Very well written, supportive, to the point. For me, trying to stop smoking always got more difficult after the second day of cold turkey, and generally by the third day, I would argue that \\"just one\\" wouldn't hurt, but it does. This book helped me to remember during those tough times when the brain didn't want to recall all my reasons for stopping because it desparetly wanted the nicotine. I found this book supportive to have on hand for me when I needed it to get past that craving. I do hope it helps all that are trying to stop the expensive unhealthy habit like it has done me. PS: I have smoked up to 2+ packs a day for almost 30 years, you CAN do it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't think this is just another gimmick!","review":"This book really puts smoking in a new perspective, one that I believe to be the most reasonable one. I read this book with an open mind and it worked in a pinch. It has many revolutionary points, which are drilled into your head through repitition and real life examples. After the book, with no hesitaion, my Marlboro Lights pack went on a one-way trip to the trash can. I then just stopped, and for a long time reflected on the cigarette that started it all, how smoking has interfered with my life each day, and most of all, what a waste it was! Bought 3 more copies for co-workers and family."},{"rating":"2","title":"It worked!","review":"I quitted right after reading this book. Before that, I had been smoking for 12 years. I tried using my own will power, my family's support and various other methods. None of them worked. They just made me constantly frustrated, dependent and impatient around my family members.This book helped me analyze why I smoke. I acquired internal strength from this book to deal with my addiction in a positive way. I could do it independently without relying on others' support. I even maintained a social life with my smoking friends while continuing quitting smoking successfully. It is easy and effective!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST solution to quitting forever!","review":"I had tried the patch, gum, cold turkey & even some online quit smoking support groups, and still went back to smoking when my life was impacted with high stress.It wasn't until I read Alan Carr's book that I finally understood the reasons of addiction to nicotine that I quit and can honestly say it's for good for the rest of my life.When confronted with certain situations now, like finances, if the thought comes into my mind \\"I need a cig\\", I know why that thought is there and I make a rational decision NOT to have one. I feel no urge to smoke at all and am actually disgusted over the whole concept due to knowing the backround of tobacco/nicotine industries.Thank you Alan Carr and RIP!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Read it.","review":"Is $10 worth not reading this book?

I was not planning on quitting but then one night i just had enough. if it was not for this book being in the back of my head for those 2 months i never would have got there.I was a pack+ a day for 15 years and now have never felt better.

Then when you are ready you will have what it takes to be a non-smoker once and for all/UPDATE: I wanted to point out I have been a non-smoker for 3 & 1/2 years now ever since reading this.

At the time this book was only available in England and Canada. I read the book and was immediately hooked. Carr's words are so powerful and persuasive. It is amazing that such a short book can transform someone's life from a dependency to cigarettes to a life free of smelly breath, coughs and potential lung cancer.I persuaded my fianc�� to read it (and he loved smoking and had no intention of quitting). After he finished reading it he stopped smoking too. We have both been non-smokers for 1.5 years. We very rarely even think about smoking.I am so glad to see that this book is available in the States.

After reading this book, I've been a non-smoker for 14 months, and will never be a smoker again. NEVER! In the past, my biggest hurdles had been withdrawals that I couldn't tolerate and an addiction to my smoking \\"routine\\" that I just didn't want to live without. This book changed all that.

Your life will be yours again."},{"rating":"2","title":"The easy way for sure","review":"I smoked a pack a day for 23 years. I tried every possible way to quit and nothing worked until I read this book.My story is pretty much the same as all the other reviews. Halfway through I had already decided to quit but I kept smoking until the end (as recommended by Mr. Carr). By the time I got to the end I was excited, happy, and looking forward to quitting. Then I quit without any pain or irritability, and hardly any cravings whatsoever.That was about 9 months ago and I haven't had a puff since (and I'm quite certain that I won't ever again). Don't bother with gum, patches, pills, or other pharmaceuticals. The whole industry is a sham. All you need is Allen Carr's book and a few hours to read it.

My 30 year habit progressed to a pack and a half to sometimes two packs a day. I've tried everything over the years to quit and even had managed to get two and a half smoke free years under my belt before I picked up that nasty cigarette again. Even after 2 1/2 years it still had a grip on me. This book was recommended to me and I figured that it couldn't hurt. Not being much of a reader I found this an amazingly quick read.

After smoking for over 30 years, I have never missed it not for a second since I quit. I am so happy to be a non smoker and free of the slavery he speaks about in his books. It's true what he says, it's easy to quit if you know how. I read the book a few times however, before I decided to quit, 'cause I wanted to understand well all of his points and have them firmly in mind.

Really wanted to quit smoking but I was powerless. Only God knows what I have tried. Read this book but didn't help either, I think I was too screwed and used smoking to cope with my daily stresses and any uncomfortable feelings. Then a friend of mine recommended Nicotine Anonymous, a self-supporting 12 step program pioneered by Alcoholics Anonymous. !2 step program is the fastest growing spiritual program in the world and the most effective for any addiction, compulsion and psychological dysfunction. Long story short I did quit smoking, and changed my life for the better because I use the tools of this program in my everyday live. The point of this program is you're powerless over your addiction, so you need to reach out to some sort of higher power for help. It's humbling but it works.

This book changes the way you think about quitting smoking and how we are brainwashed to think that it is so hard to quit when it really is not. My boyfriend didn't read the book but when he saw how easy I quit he quit two days after I did and he is still smoke free. I feel great since I quit smoking! Please buy this book and really read it and you will be able to quit too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It worked for me!","review":"This book flipped on switches in my brain and exposed the myths and lies we are lead to believe about smoking. I really wanted to quit and read this book with an open mind, concentrated and took it all quite seriously. It was the best purchase I ever made! When I went out to a work Christmas party recently and watched a group of smokers go outside of the restaraunt after ordering their meals; I was glad that wasn't me anymore! I am breathing better, I have more money to save (or spend) and I no longer have to feel ashamed or embarrassed by having a \\"dirty habit\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"What have you got to lose","review":"If you wanna stop smoking then give this a go. You'll either stop right away or you'll never beleive your doomed to puff on for life . Either way you win. strange thing to say about a book but true i say. Amazing stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book? Yeah right!","review":"That's exactly what I thought when I stumbled upon mention of this book online. I had tried tapering off, wearing the patch, even prescription pills. If neurological drugs couldn't break this addiction, there's no way reading a book could. But it did. I'm thirty one and I had smoked for twenty years, since I was eleven. I have been smoke-free for over a month, for the first time since entering junior high. I recommend this book to everyone. It costs way less than a bottle of pills, or a box of patches or nicotine gum, and from what I've read, and lived, it's got a better success rate too. Why pay some shrink to tell you this stuff under hypnosis when you can read it on your own?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Wait Any Longer","review":"Any smoker who is ready to \\"want to quit\\" smoking has got to buy this book. Actually, I suggest the CD version of the book. I was a self-proclaimed heavy smoker. My saying was, \\"I wish I wanted to quit\\". By word of mouth, I heard of this book and purchased it...because the reading isn't terribly exciting, it was easy to put the book down and not finish reading it. So, I decided to purchase the book on CD and put it in my car. I listened to it, when I was in the car, for a week. At the end of that week, I happen to be going on a 3 hour road trip. During that trip, I finished the CD, smoked my last cigarette, and have never looked back! That was six months ago and I can promise you that I will NEVER smoke again. There is NO desire! This is the best thing I could have done for myself and I am so thankful for this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I bought this based on sooooo many positive reviews....","review":"and after reading the first few chapters, feel I can do it but am finding myself just not ready so I set it aside. I know I shouldn't, but there you go. It is sitting next to me now, not out of site but I plan on reading from cover to cover in one sitting. I do hope it helps and I am sure it is mind control..... got to do it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite amazed","review":"Not something that can easily be explained; you must read it to see it. Not the typical book that dwells on the information all smokers already know. Quite impressive honestly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very useful!","review":"Read it. If, when you finish reading it, you wish to continue smoking, nothing is going to stop you. Maybe, you'll say, it's his point of view. But it makes sense. Total sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE UGLY TRUTH ABOUT SMOKING AND ADDICTION IN GENERAL","review":"I'm 28 yrs old and have been smoking since I was 16 arnd 5-20 fags each day depending on stress levels, how happy or depressed I was etc etc. I have been trying to give up for 7 years now unsuccesfully. I gave this book a try and quit smoking. No drama or headaches or depression. Some mild physical symptoms which lasted only a couple of weeks, and my self confidence vanished for the same period, but I was expecting that so I didn't panic. I am exactly the same person I used to be when I used to smoke, nothing changed (confidence kicks back in after a couple of weeks).. Haven't smoked for 8 months now and I'm happier than ever. I think it's a criminal the NHS is prescribing nicotine subtitutes... anyway buy this book and you won't regret it. Book explains very clearly that smoking is not pleasure but addiction, there is a huge difference which is key information for everyone.. smoker or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME Book","review":"I smoked three packs a day for twenty years since I was fourteen and tried quitting millions of times. I think I tried every way there is out there and all it took was reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book changed the way I view smoking","review":"When I first heard about this book I was skeptical to say the least, but after it worked for about ten of my friends, I decided to give it a try. I finished the book on August 23rd 2011 and haven't looked back. I have not had or wanted to have a cigarette in almost 2 months and it feels wonderful! I was smoking a pack a day, sometimes more, for almost 12 years. I never thought I would quit but I did. I let my boyfriend, who was also smoking almost 2 packs a day, borrow it and he too has now quit. My only con was buying it on the kindle app on my iphone made some numbers not come up, they were just blank little boxes, but that is nothing big! Pick it up if you are tired of smoking. What have you got to lose?"},{"rating":"2","title":"It really works","review":"Ok so I red this book three years ago and I haven't smoked a cigarette since. I was a heavy smoker, almost a pack and a half a day.The greatest thing about this book is it tells you not to stop smoking untill you have finished reading it.So if for some unknown reason you read it and it doesn't work, you are in no better position than you were before you red it. Nothing lost and nothing gained.What do you have to lose?? I can cross my heart and hope to die when I say, if you really want to stop smoking, I mean really want to stop!

This works, you get to smoke til you finish the book!I cannot believe that I am a non smoker and that I don't give cigarettes a 2nd thought! THANK YOU ALAN CARR< YOU SAVED MY LIFE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quit Smoking...easily","review":"I read Allen Carr's book 10 years ago and haven't smoked since. Not only that, but I had next to no withdrawals, and gained no weight.I had tried EVERYTHING: hypnosis, patches, gum, tapering, cold-turkey, medications. Even when I did manage to go some time without smoking, I'd rapidly gain 10-20 pounds, then re-start smoking just to stop the weight gain.This book works!I'm now reading his book on stopping drinking..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Update 6 years later","review":"Pure and simple - I read the book 6 years ago, put out my last cigarette, and still have not lit another. I was completely skeptical and read it on a lark. But 6 years later and I am still a nonsmoker."},{"rating":"2","title":"8 1/2 weeks and still going strong!","review":"There are cynics out there. Maybe people who think it is to good to be true. Both of those were me 9 weeks ago. How could a book help when nothing else did? But then I read this book and have not smoked a cigarette since. It has not been without withdrawal pangs but nothing that I couldn't handle-not even close. If you are ready to listen, Alan Carr gives you a different point of view to look at quitting smoking. There is no magic paragraph-no secret that he will reveal. Just a different perspective...one that we all had before and lost when we started smoking.I hope if you are reading this that you will just purchase the book. For the price of 2-3 packs of cigarettes, that's all it cost. Good Luck to all!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"works!","review":"great book. Worked for me. So far, (3 weeks).

Yes, readers, this works. Alan Carr shows us how to bring all the psychological snakes in our heads out into the light of day where we can see how ridiculous and harmless they really are. I really feared the horrible ordeal of quitting smoking AGAIN, because it had always been so terrible for me, and I never quite managed to overcome it. After days, weeks or months, I would always give in and start smoking again. This time, I smoked my way through his wonderful book, finally understanding with awe that I wasn't doomed to smoke forever after all. When I finished the book, I smoked a last cigerette and joyfully quit forever. What a feeling of freedom! No weight gain, no grumpiness, and no panic! Oh c'mon....try it! What on earth have you got to lose? I've stayed smoke-free through a family crisis, and through two weeks at Christmas as a visitor in a house filled with smokers. Now how's that for proof!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I QUIT","review":"I HAVE BEEN AN UNSUCCESSFUL \\"QUITER\\" FOR 50+ YEARS. FINDING AND READING THIS BOOK MADE A HUGE DIFFERENCE.

I GAVE IT 5 STARS BECAUSE I HAVE \\"QUIT\\" A ZILLION TIMES. THIS WILL BE MY LAST QUIT."},{"rating":"2","title":"What can I say...it worked.","review":"I purchased this book after reading about 50 positive reviews here on Amazon, still unconvinced that a book would undo 15 years of smoking. Well, I followed the instructions, and here I am: a non-smoker of 6 weeks. I must admit, you probably will have to want to quit smoking to accomplish this feat, but aside from having the desire, Allen Carr takes care of the rest. I am not sure how it works; it is my theory that the author hypnotizes the smoker into being a non-smoker through repetition. No matter how it works, I can breathe, and my fiance was pleasantly surprised with my dedication to non-smoking.Give this book a try. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It worked. I quit.","review":"I'm not 100% sure it was all this book, but shortly after finishing this book I quit smoking cold turkey. I was a smoker for over 35 years and had tried the patch, accupunture and other methods. With this book, I was able to stop smoking without any aids and have been nicotine free for over 8 months now. Thank you Allen Carr."},{"rating":"2","title":"It really works.","review":"I smoked for over thirty-five years and after reading this book I stopped smoking cold turkey. I tried many times to quit but always failed, but for some reason that I cannot explain this book made me quit. It was like magic. I still had small cravings but I have not touched a cigarette since April 2006 (over 2 years). Now I don't crave them at all. My brother bought the book and he also quit, he was a 30 year smoker and he has not smoked in one year. I bought the book for my Uncle but the results are not in yet.

Twice - nothing. Listened to both CDs several times - nothing All the information is regurgitated over and over. We've heard it all elsewhere too. I am just one. Try it if you like."},{"rating":"1","title":"EASY WAY????","review":"I kept waiting to hear how it would be easy. On and ON and On with the same points over and over. Some of the book has some sound bits of general information on nicotine addiction. But it's really nothing we smokers don't already know. I am desperate to quit smoking, and I was really hoping this was it. It certainly was not. There is no magic \\"EASY WAY\\" He basically touts, just stop smoking and be glad about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a success story","review":"I was very hopeful upon receiving this book however and read it with an open mind but after completion I am no closer to 'snuffing out'. Everything Mr. Carr says in the book regarding smokers; I'm an addict, a social outcast, disgusting, etc are all things I'm already aware of. I feel I didn't get any new information or an \\"aha moment\\". His arrogance and repetition did annoy me though. I'm not sure how this method is helping so many people. I want to quit smoking but sincerely find it to be a pleasurable activity; it does not taste gross to me. I will begin to explore other options."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for everyone","review":"Of course this is not going to work for everyone, but it will work for a few people. I don't mind the repetition in the book, it serves to reinforce what he's saying. Also there's a bit of a pompous attitude that I feel with his style of writing, but it doesn't bother me at all. This is the first time I have gone without a smoke in 24 hours (after 28 years) and I feel great.If one life is saved from this book then it's worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Common Sense","review":"The only thing this book gives you is common sense reminders about smoking. The only thing that stuck with me was 'you weren't born smoking, so you don't have to smoke notion' - oh really? Thanks for the heads-up I had no idea. I'm sure it's helped some people but this book really is just another one of those quick fixes for quitting smoking. (Yeah, I fell into it to)I would suggest that you spend your money on something else. For people who think and don't beleive everything they read, find something else. This book may work for someone but not for most."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smoke and Mirrors","review":"I read this book years ago and was very disappointed. The basic idea is that the tobacco companies are lying to you and you are lying to yourself thinking that you like to smoke and if you just realize this you will magically want to quit. I should probably give this book 2 stars since Carr was crafty enough to make millions on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quitting smoking is NOT easy","review":"The old saying stands true once again:If it sounds too good to be true...I'm still a smoker."},{"rating":"1","title":"should be titled \\"my easy way to make money\\"","review":"If you want to hear all about how successful the author was in writing the book, how nasty and disgusting cigarettes are, and reading over and over that you can live without them (really? no kidding*), this is the book for you. I put down the book after struggling to read the first 3/4ths of it. As for as for easyway methods for quiting.. maybe it was written on the last page, I didn't get that far. I quit using Smoke Away sold at Walmart. It really worked!!

I was a 23-year pack-a-day smoker.You have to read this book with an open mind. During the time when I was quitting, my then husband smoked in the house, and I was going through some very stressful family situations. I had even lost my job. I was able to quit remarkably easily. I've not had any cravings that I couldn't easily blow off, even while drinking. The smell repulses me rather than temps me now.READ THIS BOOK and you'll be a nonsmoker tonight!2012 Update... May 2013 will be 5 years for me. I recommend this book all the time. It's crazy how easy this is. I no longer have cravings whatsoever. RIP Allen Carr, you're my hero!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling and Sensitive Introduction to the Jewish Year","review":"This book provides a sensitive introduction to a year of Jewish religious holidays, so well woven into the text, that they clearly become a part of the main character's life and much more than a backdrop for the changes that occur. The device of marking the passing of time and the growth in a child's understanding by the lighted candles, works both gently and well. The writing is lyrical, and the action engrossing. This is a wonderful book for anyone interested in knowing more about Jewish observances. In the process, he or she will discover a compelling intergenerational story. The illustrations are somewhat sylized and static, but many have an endearing quality that will appeal to children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This book should be required reading for anyone that has the slightest interest in international affairs.

Not a very positive surf movie.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I bought this video in preparation for a trip to Morocco. I expected a modern day adventure, some beautiful scenery, and local culture. The movie is pretty much solid surfing. Brief comments by the surfers are inane, there is no interaction with locals, and no historic or cultural context. There isn't even a sense of journey, just hanging out on the beach and watching wave after wave after wave ... .

I was going to get the GS3, but when I saw I could get two slightly lower wattage speakers for less, I bought these.I am amazed at how good these sound. The bass booms from these like a small sub-woofer. I know some have said that the low end is lacking, but I disagree.I am powering these with a cheap receiver (Pyle 260A 200 watt peak), and they are a perfect match. They are very clear at (relatively) high volume. They will deliver plenty of sound for my modest backyard.I recommend these to anyone looking for outdoor speakers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissenting Opinion","review":"One of the speakers had very poor treble response compared to the other - I would guess a fault with something.

If you're a beginner racer, you can develop an understanding of the entire contents of this book just by doing a few road bike races.

Apparently he never raced in northern California."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great conductor - poor orchestra","review":"This recording was among the early studio versions; consequently, there was not much for comparison at the time (Bernstein, Leinsdorf, Scherchen, Barbirolli, and Adler). The first notes expose the weaknesses of the Utah symphony. Rather than a forceful beginning, the result is weak and almost indecisive. The real deficiencies of the orchestra becomes even more apparent in the slow movement and in the high string open sections in the last movement. The middle movements are ordered: scherzo, andante. Throughout I found the orchestral balances to be the most annoying aspect of this performance. Other than the pacing within the movements, I was not impressed with much by the recording. Now with more than 100 recordings of the 6th, this one lags far behind."},{"rating":"2","title":"My family, including 3 toddlers, love this pasta!","review":"Don't be concerned that whole grain means it will have a rough texture or objectionable taste. We all love it. It cooks up great, either al dente (slightly firm) or really soft for the kids. The flavor is mild, meaning that you won't think you are eating a piece of 9-grain bread when you eat it. We love that we can feel this to our kids and know that they are getting all the great health benefits of whole grains, as opposed to refined grains in typical pasta. For our 2-year-old twins, we cut the cooked tubes in half, just to be sure they don't choke on the longer pieces of pasta.

Its dual story role centers around the life of two men connected througha job referral by a friend of a soon to become lab assistant. It is a remarkable journey through the lives of two of remarkable men andtheir impact on medical science. Both brilliant, one a top doctor and medical researcher, the other a black lab assistant. While the impact ofprejudice reigns throughout the story, their relationship and the synergy between them elevates them to fulfill their dreams while making the world a better place for young children.

So this movie helped me to understand how Dr. Taussig perfected the first blue baby operation. And Dr. Blalock performed it.

I will watch anything he's in. The actual topic didn't particularly interest me, but I was quickly enveloped in this movie. It really is quite informative and amazing how it was based on a factual event, because its such a historic and important event. Mos Def was actually quite good in this and he and Alan were wonderful to see interact on camera together. It is a quiet little film, but a powerful one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Love this Movie","review":"This movie did not receive the credit it was due. Mos Def was wonderful... too bad he didn't get the award; he certainly deserved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Victory over Racism,","review":"A very impressive film based on real events about the uneven partnership of black cardiac pioneer Vivien Thomas and white heart surgeon Alfred Blalock, who in the 1950es pioneered successful heart surgery for \\"Blued Babies\\". United in the Johns Hopkins medical labs, privately their lives were strictly separated, due to the racism common in the 1950s; this led to the peculiar circumstance of Thomas serving drinks to people he had been teaching earlier in the day. Only in 1969 did Johns Hopkins officially recognize Thomas's achievements and hang his portrait next to that of Blalock, and in 1976 awarded him an honorary doctoral degree in acknowledgement of his decades of training Johns Hopkins surgeons. The movie makes the conflicts and triumphs of these yeatrs come alive and justififedly received a good nuimber of awards."},{"rating":"2","title":"First open heart surgery","review":"The content of this movie was excellent history. The movie itself was rather dark and the words hard to hear. The actual facts that this was the first successful open heart surgery, guided by the genius and courage of the people involved.

Realistic portrayals of human bias and overcoming obstacles to achieve great things make this a very positive movie.

The beginning said it was rated for all age audiences, but...finally had to turn it off because the bad language increased as it went along and permeated it and distracted from what would have been a good story. I would not have gone past the first few minutes if a young person or teen had been present, but I stuck with it for about 25 minutes. Wish I hadn't! I cannot believe HBO rated this as acceptable for all audiences. I also cannot believe that a professional doctor who is worth anything would lower himself to continual gutter language. Don't buy it unless you are somehow immune to trashy speech.

The things we take for granted now - from open heart surgery to integrated society to being able to get college credits for material we already know - none of these opportunities existed back when Dr. Vivien Theodore Thomas started helping Dr. Alfred Blalock. The film includes great performances by Alan Rickman (who is never bad in any of his roles, but is particularly strong here) and Mos Def. The film's powerful message and sincere treatment of history provide an excellent opportunity for further discussion of race relations, medical breakthroughs, and animal experimentation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun gift for medical friends","review":"A very well-done movie that we gave as gifts to friends in the medical field this year, most of whom are in the surgical field."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lord Made Something Real Good","review":"This was an exceptional film that spoke to the heart and soul of humanity.

It has it's obvious stories of medical pioneering and racism, as well as the not so obvious stories of struggling afro american families and a man that would not and could not give up on his dream and what he knew he was supposed to do with his life even without the recognition that he so diserved. Each of the actors gave superb performances and made you FEEL all of their emotions. I recently allowed my daughter to watch this movie with me. I felt it was an important film for her to see since her school was teaching Black History and she herself, bi-racial.

The idea that a weather girl could flip up her skirt on air and that would somehow make her famous nationwide is just silly. There's a brief moment of eroticism in the film after a powerful female producer assigns a girl to become the weather girl's personal slave, and the girl is consequently shown bathing her new mistress, even licking soap off of her legs!

I do, though I do not like the part on the interview of the pervert for the Hello Pervert TV Show hosted by the ex-weather girl kicked out by Mizutani.It is a film that shows we could still hold ourselves innocent and survive in a world full of perversion, disguise, hyprocrisy and treachery. As long as we could produce films like the Weather Woman, we could be safe from doomsday.Hilarious, loud, innocent and sexy. A special mix and a film genre classic.

Dr. Winbush has succeeded in compiling a full spectrum of the arguments for and against reparations in such a manner that the average reader can gain a full understanding of the reparations movement.

This is not to say that American Blacks should be isolated from the mainstream of American society; American Blacks should have had their rightfull place in American society a long time ago. But Reparations are an insiduous form of Guilt by association, an attempt by a small minority to feed forever on the cash cow of White guilt. But why now? as Black Americans are beginning to reap the benefits of America. I think there are some Black Americans who miss the old days of racism, those days where they could talk (and brag) about \\"what the \\"White Man\\" done to them.\\" Now, realizing that most whites arn't racist, these people are emotionally lost, who can they blame for their own failures?.

The author confuses inflammation with insulin resistance, and ends up with a mish-mash of ratings that make the mistake of trying to combine the two. There are already two great eating plans for insulin resistance, The Zone and South Beach. However, an anti-inflammatory diet is very different: foods like tomatoes, for example, should not be part of an anti-inflammatory eating plan. So I would suggest that readers looking for a true anti-inflammatory diet book, skip this one and instead take a look at The Anti-Inflammation Diet and Recipe Book, by Jessica K. Black, ND. You will find there lots of great recipes and a much more helpful (and accurate) table of \\"Foods to Eat\\" and \\"Foods to Avoid\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good dietary recommendations, but not quite the whole picture","review":"This book offers up sound dietary advice. Foods are rated according to a formula that predicts how inflammatory they are to your body. The formula is not specified, although the factors that are considered are listed. I would have liked more information as to how much weight was given to the various nutrients and why. Information not contained in the USDA food database wasn't included in the formula. Therefore, a number of factors, such micronutrients, pesticide residues, etc. are not addressed. The inflammatory effects of eating charbroiled foods or deep fried foods are not discussed. This is an interesting attempt at quantifying the anti-inflammatory and inflammatory qualities of most common foods, and for the most part is quite helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle owners!

At that time I was exercising hard, I had already lost a good amount of body fat, but the pain kept coming back every once in a while. All I did was introduce some of the anti-inflammatory foods in my diet, reduce or eliminate the oness that were highly inflammatory, and in a matter of months, the pain was gone. I'd say it's a pretty good result after over 20 years of pain. Now I can work out hard, play tennis, table tennis, do high intensity interval training, without any pain whatsoever. Just to make one thing clear - I don't see this book as a guide to a diet that you can go on and once you're done you go back to eating the stuff that's bad for you.

And there are several ratings that don't concur with the website ratings. Also I think she misses the boat when she outlines meals that can come out with a minus score, having the day end with a plus score. This causes spikes in inflammation attacks throughout the day. Why not have each meal end with a plus score?"},{"rating":"1","title":"not bad","review":"So far I'm a little disappointed with the product.

Its slimmer than standard mugs which makes it more comfortable to handle.I prefer the 8.5 oz, which holds one cup of tea or coffee (hot or cold).It keeps hot drinks hot for 6 hours and cold drinks cold for 10!It has a secret compartment in the lid that screws off and will holda few vitamins or medications, or loose change (other than that I see no purpose to that part).

I will just use the winamp plugin I think.Also, the RIO does copy files slightly faster, but not much."},{"rating":"1","title":"4 month repair and poor customer service","review":"We bought a Nomad II MG as a Christmas gift.Unfortunately, we received a defective unit.Creative Labs had us send in the docking station only, and then when that came back unrepaired...they had us send in the entire unit.But at least Creative said they would expedite the second repair and send us better headphones or memory to make up for the two repair attempts and shipping costs.That second repair was at the end of Febuary.Today, April 24, 2001 we were finally told that the unit will ship back to us. 4 months and $36.00 in shipping later, we hopefully will get a working MP3 player.Creative Customer however reneged on their promises to send better headphones or memory.I am disappointed with this level of warranty and customer service...and will not make my Creative Labs product my first choice in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is a very great book","review":"It had great depth, and content.

I am disappointed to say that it broke the first time I used it. I made a double batch of bread dough, which I had made many times using my older, smaller food processor from another company. This machine burned right out and I can't get it to work at all. It doesn't surprise me, since it is made in China like so many products are these days. It certainly was not the quality I'd expected from such a well known company.

So basically those two blades are useless until I spend more money. The instruction DVD casually tells you to attach the stem to the discs, acting as if you should have it with you as part off your new purchase. My processor also came without the instruction manual.

He was really looking forward to using it but when he took it out of the box and tried to put the lid on we discovered that the lid was so cheaply made that the plastic latching mechanism was broken. Considering that we had previously had one of the original Cuisinart food processors for twenty+ years with no failures, this was extremely disappointing. After doing some research we learned that Cuisinart is now made in China and is no longer associated with Robot Coupe, which explains the complete lack of quality with this food processor. Given how much Cuisinart costs and the cheap quality they now produce, we will not be buying any more of their products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never worked","review":"I received this as a wedding gift and was very excited about it. I promptly opened it to make something, but could never get it to work. I've had food processors before, so I know everything has to be locked just so for it to function. I'm sure this one was set up correctly, but it would not operate. Since it has zero user feedback, I couldn't even tell if the unit was getting power (but I tried different outlets that I know work). I'm returning it in favor of a KitchenAid.

I took care if it as per manufacturers recommendation and never put it in the dishwasher (hassle) I bought this one to replace a Cuisinart that I had for nearly 10 years. The price is high and the quality is sub-par. I will purchase a Kitchen-Aid, my friend has one and the components are very well made. Cuisinart you have lost my faithful business.PS.

The motor was still working, but the bowl mechanism was shot and it kept jamming. I did a lot of research on new food processors, and finally settled on this DFP-14BCN. The lock mechanism is quite different than my old one, and seems to be a little more \\"plastic\\" feeling than my last one. That said, so far it all seems very durable. I have used it several times, and was very impressed with the chopping evenness that I achieved. An additional bonus for me is that this model uses all the same blades as my last one. When I first bought the old one, I invested in just about every blade they make, so I don't have to buy any additional blades for this one. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a food processor with reliability and multi features...I'm hoping this one will last another 30 years!"},{"rating":"1","title":"oooops, not so great","review":"Replaced my trusty and cheap ($39) Hamilton Beach food processor with this. Expected splendid quality. Oh, HAHA. The safety feature is a show stopper (yes, I need to use the feed tube with the processor running). Sometimes it was near impossible to get the top on, or the large tube back into the top. Then the stinker broke, sort of, the safety feature no longer worked, and I couldn't get the work bowl off the base. We won't even mention how very large and HEAVY the base is. Nor mention that it only has one speed, which is too slow to really mince stuff well without grinding it to powder. So, my husband finally figured out what was wrong. The $46 work bowl part of the safety feature was broken. So, for slightly more than the price of a new Hamilton Beach unit, I can replace the work bowl. Hooray for Cuisinart. Sucked me in with their myth about quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this food processor!","review":"I bought this food processor as a Christmas gift for my husband. When we used it in February, the unit did not work properly - the motor would work occasionally but not all the time.

This is a newer model and the design has been improved in that the disks of the original were clumsy to store but these have a separate stem that connects so it is much more space efficient. I love the larger bowl - 14 cups and a new safety when putting on the lid. You have to get used to attaching everything right as it will not run when it is not. Blades are sharp and in my opinion the safety is a good thing. I have never found another processor that would chop up onions without pureeing them. The price on Amazon was also great and I see it is about what they get for the 11 cup processor in other stores."},{"rating":"2","title":"14 cup Cusinart Food Processor","review":"This is a great product for use in the kitchen.

Ugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overkill on the safety features","review":"I received the stainless steel version of this processor as a gift. I have only had it for 2 weeks and I am already discouraged with it. I seems to work fine, however, because of the \\"safety features\\" I find it awkward and inefficient. The large sleeve is designed so that you must disengage the lock each time you want to add more food. I can imagine that it will break in a short time if you use it often and this lock is necessary to start the machine. Also, you cannot put any food in the processor that is taller than the pusher because the pusher cannot be removed from the sleeve. If these things don't bother you, you will enjoy it. I haven't had a food processor for about 10 years. My old one had a removeable pusher and was much more convenient than this model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get ready to replace $70 of parts every year","review":"First - Cuisinart has the worst customer support I've encountered lately. If you should need parts for this, and try to order them, you will encounter a slow-as-molassas and confusing website with incorrect photographs and descriptions, persistant backorders, long hold times, and telephone representatives who really don't give a darn.I am not basing this on a single call I was unsatisfied with, rather a series of them, all with different representatives.Our unit is used lightly (1-2 times per week to chop potatoes, onions, and the like, but the plastic (lexan?) portions are incredibly fragile.

The replacement part would have cost almost as much as a new machine, so I went for the new machine. I stuck with this design and size so that all my attachment blades would still fit. The new processor works perfectly, so I'm quite happy with it. But that's just what I expected after more than a decade of using a Cuisinart. I highly recommend getting at least a 14-cup bowl (do they make a larger one?) as it holds a lot more than the 12-cup version, making it easier to process large quantities of whatever you put in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Useful Tool","review":"I've been using this food processor for over a year and can verify that it is made very well. I use it about once a week (more in the summer months) and it has held up beautifully.This is a very large food processor! It is for preparing large quantities of food and is less useful for smaller tasks like cutting up a potato. It's best for making soups, salsa, or cutting up a large number of vegetables.One complaint that I have is that it is a little hard to get the plastic basin to attach to the processor. It needs to be in exactly the same place, and this can be bit hard to achieve if it is partially full of food or liquid.The processor successfully blends a wide variety of things including finely chopping basil or cilantro which amazed me considering the size of the basin.Overall this is an excellent tool for a busy kitchen, and while I don't think I really use it to its full potential cooking for only two, it is still a welcome addition to my kitchen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bowl made of BPA","review":"Good processor but bowl is made of BPA (a component of Lexan). Boo. Just spoke with their customer service, they said there is no plan to manufacture BPA-free replacement bowls. Double boo.

Power, yes, but the manufacturer has gone overboard on the safety bit just as other folks have described. Of course, that may be due to our over lawyer-ed litigious society! I have had my machine for about a year, use about once a week, and find the construction awkward too. Fortunately, no cracks yet but I am sure they will eventually show up. I have another criticism, the machine leaks terribly. I like to make soups, gazpacho etc. There is always a lot of liquid left behind on the bench when the bowl is removed. Furthermore, when you try to pour out the liquid, the cutter falls out unless you are sure to retain it. Hint: I fixed that problem by wrapping some teflon pipe tape around the shaft. Add that to overseas customer service, an oxymoron, and I am sorry I spent the bucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb","review":"Due to the large volume of cooking I do for larger crowds, I was looking specifically for a product that could process larger quantities of food in a very short time.

I am really disappointed because every time I use it to create a large batch of something that contains liquids, the liquid always flows out *somewhere* and ends up underneath the processor bowl. What's the point of a large bowl if it won't contain the food? There is a marking on the bowl for liquid level, and even when I don't go over that mark, the liquids still flow out. It seems that eventually the liquid will seep under the central post and into the electronics and there goes an expensive food processor.

I decided when I purchased a food processor, it would be a Cuisinart. The power, sharpness of the blades and convenience of being dishwasher safe are such great features. This model comes with an instructional video, which is very helpful, especially the added tricks and precautions it provides. The instruction booklet also includes recipes to start using the processor immediately. The video demonstrates several of the recipes. I was considering buying a mixer,also; but I found this processor does mostly everything a mixer could do. I priced this model at several stores and websites. Amazon has the best price. It even dropped $10.00 since I purchased it, a short time ago. I also purchased the blade and disc holder, which you should buy to protect the blades and yourself! (they are extremely sharp).

I use my processor about 12 time a year, so my frustration level with the quality of the work bowl is heightened by the fact it breaks about every fourth time I use it. I make hummus, chop veggies, shred cheese etc in my processor, nothing heavy duty. The work bowl itself cracks and breaks, the pusher assembly has broken off completely, the little plastic tabs on the pusher have broken off and the white plastic thing that allows the processor to work has cracked and broken off. Each time this happens, I am forced to purchase a new bowl and top/assembly. I tried to contact Cuisinart and they hung up on me, stating they could do nothing for me. I will not purchase a Cuisinart product again due to the fact the company does not stand behind their product nor value their customers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best ever","review":"The basic paddle type switches on this model and the ease of on/off opening with the chute engaged (not possible on other models) makes this my choice over and over.

The rhythym section is spot-on. And Jake! ...well, simply put, he is probably the most underated hard rock/metal player of the last 20 years. Again, he stays away from his enormous ability for finger tapping solos that he established himself as a master of with Ratt and Ozzy and just grooves with some excellent melodic rock lines. Bravo Jake! Hope to see you live on stage again my brother... (the only criticisms on this CD are that the tracks sometimes seem unfinished, especially in the lyrics, [but it might just be my imagination], and a curious song where Sammy Hagar's \\"Heavy Metal\\" and the song \\"Peace Dog\\" by the Cult are combined into one song.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"One more time with ray!!!","review":"I coulndt belive when this actually came in the mail, i got home from work and there it was!!!!!If you love those songs they wrote together on the first 2 albums then just buy it.Ray and jake together again,.....its a beautiful thing.Its raw and bluesy, alot of feeling in these songs, a little like the voodoo highway stuff.If they stired you inside before theyll do it again on this one!!!

I highly recommend this book for serious students of the Bible as well as those who teach Bible classes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who knew?","review":"Who would have thought that my son's 5th grade Social studies book wouldn't be included on this cartridge? When the item description didn't mention that it wouldn't be compatible with all curriculums, I didn't think twice about ordering this. My school system uses all of the mainstream text books, yet I keep striking out with these cartridges because none of our books are included in any of the subjects.

This CD was awful and sounds no different than the trash played on U.S. radio, probably even worse. There was not one single song on here that stood out and I was bored. The girl who does the lead singing- and I don't know which girl it is- has absolutely no range at all. I think in the last song she does this whispering thing, but I don't consider that any real vocal ability. Anybody can whisper. Anyway, this CD is not worth paying $17-$35 for. You definetly need to skip this at all costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sugababes :-)","review":"I really enjoyed their sound,their music has a good beat and the vocals are better than most other groups I have heard recently."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good in many ways","review":"Sugababes are back with their fourth album. Neither do they disappoint, nor surprise - they just deliver yet another portion of solid pop music. What stands for the Sugababes' trademark, is the way their voices brilliantly blend together, creating a perfect harmony, which is a simple joy to listen to. The girls' singing is, as usual, heart-felt and top-notch; I bet nobody doubts that these babes really can sing! Besides, their producers never fail to craft some great, addictive tunes, worth Sugababes' wonderful voices. The best songs here are \\"Ugly\\", \\"It Ain't Easy\\", \\"Bruised\\" and \\"2 Hearts\\" - closing track and a definite stand-out of the album. \\"Taller in More Ways\\" doesn't really bring the killer singles like \\"Round Round\\" or \\"Stronger\\", however it's still a worthwhile release, which takes a few listenings to be fully appreciated. If any babes in show-business deserve your attention, they're surely Sugababes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An invaluable addition to academic Latin Studies","review":"Medieval Mosaic: A Book Of Medieval Latin Readings by A.

The author/s are definitely not trying to impress the reader with this small volume. It is a clean write-up minus any verbose intellectuality....direct and to the point...if Gangaji intimidates you - from what I garner from it's pages - the problem is not hers. The story is lacking in particulars but I suppose she is just being very candid and speaking very humbly, speaking only about the most salient aspects of her life thus far - I was actually amazed(!) that other reviewers saw very much otherwise - she does come across as very ordinary...that is until you read her other books - they are indeed quite heavy and not light reading at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"It happened to her, it could happen to you","review":"Everytime Gangaji speaks, she gives us the secret.

But much like the spiritual ramblings I've seen on numerous occasions on public access TV, I find the enlightenment bestowed upon the masses by Gangaji to be vacuous and self-important. While it's a heartening journey she's undertaken to find peace with her own life, and admirable that she wants to share that with people seeking their own direction, I find her \\"teachings\\" to have an irritating smugness and all the substance of a bag of air.

In addition, the actual natural materials used for these uninspired and basic crafts are generally things one can't find in their own backyard - spanish moss, sheets of bark, grapevines, etc. This book was extremely disappointing in content, with simple and unoriginal ideas.

Not exactly a natural material. I own a hot glue gun, but we made the basket by tying the twigs together with twine rather than hot glueing.There being no photographs, I wonder if some of these projects are maybe a tad 'theoretical' in nature.My daughter is still extremely into the book and has a long list of things she wants to make.

The diary entries are almost exclusively written by Southerners, reflecting their feelings about the war, with comments about \\"that horrid man Mr. Lincoln\\" which are hard for me to tolerate, having the respect for him which I have. The stories have almost nothing to do with quilting, and overall make for a very disappointing book. I would suggest as an alternate title, \\"Diary Entries of Southerners During the Civil War, \\"Illustrated\\" With Quilt Blocks.\\" I won't even sell this book; I'll just give it away.I am an experienced quilter and someone who loves books, reading, and quilting, so I wanted to love this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quilting Book","review":"I still do not have the item I ordered, It might be that I am overseas, but usually it does not take a month to receive something.

This book has lots of pretty quilt blocks, but no patterns or instructions to make them. The quilt blocks are given names based on the diary entry they correspond to and no mention of the modern or proper name is given which would have made finding patterns far more helpful.

I bought the jump rings because I did not want to wrap my own and than attempted the project only to realize this problem.

This Season is less campy and much darker than season one, but the production value is so much better. (Bigger Budget and it shows) It still has the comic book feel but like a more expensive and mature comic book (like comparing batman's old detective to the new Dark Knight). I would still recomend that you get the first season first so you have the back ground story.Note: Si no habla Espanol, no es por usted porrque no esta subtitulo o doblar en Ingles.

So, to skip to the punchline, when you try to remove the metal tray, you can't, since the sticks aren't straight, and aren't all slanted in the same direction. Pulling out the tray ends up dislodging all of the popsicles at the same time. It breaks some, and it's an enormous hassle.

It is not to be mistaken for the extremely rugged aluminum cases that retail for several hundred dollars, but it wasn't designed to compete in that market. Rather, this is a relatively low priced case that will give good service when handled with reasonable care. The case comes with both diced foam (easily separated by hand, no knives or scissors required) as well as adjustable dividers; you can even use both, have a portion of the case diced foam and a portion partioned with the dividers. I have six of these cases and keep my Hasselblads and Nikons in them.

He never confessed to the crime, and on the contrary, tried to accuse Artemisia's father of having deflowered her, and to insist she had also written love letters to other men -- though she could barely write at the time. Artemisia testified repeatedly under oath and torture that she had been [raped] by Tassi. She described the event in explicit and graphic detail, and her own resistance to the point of wounding him with a knife.\\"I give the film two stars for being beautifully made, but the falsehood of the movie undermines the few good elements."},{"rating":"1","title":"CRAP!!","review":"This may well be the biggest waste of celluloid I've ever seen. Some reviewers have stated that although this film is historically inaccurate (that's putting it mildly) it's still an enjoyable story. Wrong! This is a pathetic, boring, trite and familiar scenario. Why base a story on a real person and then fill it with banalities? It reminds me of another bad French biopic \\"Mozart's Sister.\\" Artemisia was raped twice. Once by her teacher and again by the makers of this trash. Avoid at all costs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bummer.","review":"I've been doing a lot of research about the artist Artemisia Gentileschi, and this movie really doesn't fit the historical data that we do have about this amazing artist and woman.It's a beautiful movie, but the facts are just wrong, especially concerning her rape by her tutor, Agostino Tassi. It is unfortunate that the filmmakers chose to portray her in this light, because she was such an amazing, talented, and strong woman. This movie really dampens her strength and determination by making her into a seductress instead of a victim."},{"rating":"1","title":"AESTHETICLY PLEASING, BUT INACCURATE","review":"A typical paen of self-adoration that results when a film is made by artists, about artists, for artists. The title character's neurotically self-absorbed and abrasive behaviour is glorifed due to the fact that she's an artist and, being part of that group's self proclaimeded elite status, her actions are romanticized rather than receiving the contempt that such behaviour usually warrants. While this film is beautifully shot, it's more of a theoretical (or more accurately, mythological) ideal of the struggling artist held back by the lack of vision of those around them, rather than an attempt at accurrate biography. Among other things, the artist accused of raping her was actually around the same age as her father, but in the film he's a more agreeably youthful middle-aged man with somewhat attractive looks. Apparently artists, especially those who made this film, are like politicians in that they prefer what's useful to what's true."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wretched Tripe","review":"The first ten minutes into this movie I knew it was going ot be a bitter disappointment. Take a good look at the real Artemisia Gentileschi's self portrait - she does not look like an undernourished teenager. Take a good look at the actress they picked for this movie. Right. Not even close.Other reviewers have done a better job pointing out various other flaws - this was just the first one that offended me about this piece of trash of a movie.If you love the work of Artemisia Gentileschi, stay far away from this vile movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the true story...","review":"When this movie was first released, due to the outcry from the feminist and art history communities, Miramax had to remove their claim that it was \\"the true story of the first female painter in art history.\\" Actually, it is practically a complete inversion of Artemisia Gentileschi's real story...she was in fact raped by Tassi (the 'love interest' in the movie) and maintained her stand *against* him even under torture (as is documented in the records of the trial). The film romanticizes and sexualizes her and their relationship to an almost soft-porn level while giving hardly any screen time to her actual work and using her paintings out of context...which is a shame, because the real story of this remarkable woman would have been just as dramatic if not more so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a true story","review":"I knew going in that this was not the true story of Artemisia Gentileschi, but I had to see it for myself. I can see why it was changed. The studio probably wanted a tragic love story to feed to a mass audience and didn't think they could handle the true story (which I think would have been just as tragic and more effective).I wouldn't waste a dime on this movie. Catch it on cable if you can (I saw it on a channel called 'True Stories', go figure). Changing the facts of the story do Artemisia's life and work a huge disservice. If you're reading this review, do a little research into what really happened, then watch the movie to see just how laughable it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful overacting","review":"While there were some redeeming qualities in this film, I was mostly struck by the painfully overly dramatic acting. I quit halfway through. I was disappointed in that because I love well-done foreign films about humane characters. This one failed, for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I've always had a passion for foreign movies. I'm also an artist, so I thought this movie would be perfect for me. I must say I'm really disappointed. The plot is totally weak, the characters are portrayed as superficial and the actors are not good at all. I must say I haven't seen such a bad movie in a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much less than I expected","review":"I have to agree with many of the other reviewers that the film's inaccuracies hurt it's credibility. I also found the overall film quality ( art direction, costumes, etc. ) to be good but not great. However, I enjoyed the depiction of the tools and techniques employed by painters of that era.But perhaps the most offensive aspect of this film is the way in which it demeans woman artists. As someone who graduated from art school in the 1970's, I can attest to the the almost total neglect paid to the accomplishments of woman artists prior to the 1960's. One of the few exceptions that comes to mind is Mary Cassatt; and what credit she has been afforded is unfairly stigmatized by her \\" woman's \\" subject matter.I bought this DVD because I'm a painter, and I had incorrectly assumed that this was going to be a more accurate telling of her remarkable life story. Frankly, I wish I had seen it first; I would have spent my money elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pornograpic and not suitable for class viewing","review":"I have done extensive research for years concerning Artemisia Gentileschi, and I am always looking for new material to share with my college students when I teach the Baroque period and the lack of women visible during that time.

Characters are disconcertingly one-dimensional. Dialogue could have been written in one's sleep; neither humor nor passion in evidence here. Nice (though not outstanding) cinematography; excessive use of bronze-tone filters. Really, if you want yet another feminist harangue, this is the movie for you... In a movie such as this, it would have been prudent at least -- at the end, as the credits rolled by? -- to have included full blown reproductions of the artist's works, which may have sparked some genuine interest in her as a person."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!!","review":"THE ONLY THING IN COMMON THIS HAS WITH THE BLAIR WITCH IS THE TITLE.

Watching this film is like being trapped in a room with the 10 most annoying people you know for 90 minutes. The characters are sub-stereotypical, patently fake and unbelievable. The most frustrating part of the film is the fact that there never seem to be less than four people talking at the same time throughout the whole thing. One girl can't stop smiling even when she is supposed to act afraid.

Just for the record, according to Einstein, nothing goes faster than the speed of light."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the price, even sans lecture material","review":"As others have said, this set, despite claiming to on the packaging, does not contain any lecture material. It is 5 discs, all between 70 and 77 minutes long, containing an excellent interview with Mr. Wilson. It ranges from his early years in New York, to Joyce, and on into conspiracy theories with tons of other of Bob's thoughts laced in between.If you're looking to get this set because of the lecture material, it's not here. Apparently it is intact in the cassette edition, if you can get your hands on that (according to another reviewer here). If, however, you're looking for a long, interesting, and amusing interview with Bob go ahead and pick this up.I hesitate to give this 5 stars only because it does not fulfill what its packaging says it includes. What is included, in my opinion, is excellent material."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book was great the Movie well.....","review":"The book was a great read but unfortunately the movie was a disappointment. I have expected the movie to be at the same lines as the book in the manners of suspense and thrill that were major driving elements in this masterpiece. Instead a caricature adaptation that spoiled the drama, adventure and more importantly the Reality which were felt through-out the book.

James Garner, in a brilliant performance, plays F. Ross Johnson, the CEO of RJR Nabisco who wants to take Nabisco private and be its majority owner.The movie does a nice job explaining the financial aspects of a LBO(Leveraged Buyout) on such a basic level that anyone can understand. Throughout the film the storyline flows quickly, although at times certain scenes were a little canned and the satire a bit corny.The backdrop of the movie is loaded with back and forth backstabbing, blatant greed, under the table dealing, and Jonathan Pryce's depiction of Henry Kravis, a Wall Street mover and shaker and corporate raider is outstanding.Of course by no means this work supersedes the book, but nevertheless you may find the effort quite entertaining.Over all, I really enjoyed this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Business with a sence of Humour","review":"Business with humour, nothing better. Great film that combines factually based 1980's greed with a humerous side.

The movie lacks that serious business and glamorous edge that the book brings out. The movie summarises the story and shreds it almost to pieces. The movie rushes through the story in mock-comedy fashion as if the whole shinding was an episode of a comedy series. The book is about the power, greed, bravado and glory that emanated from Wall Street in the roaring '80s and shook the entire financial and business world in that era - globally. The movie misses that point by light years. It's a childish and vindictive parody of a great story. It's also pretends to be a \\"Dummy's guide to LBO's in the 1980's\\" when characters explain the salient points of LBO's. I hope another director/producer team will give this another bash and bring to the screen a real powerful and moving story based on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie","review":"A deceased friend was the Square Dance caller in this movie and the movie was good-luv James Garner in anything!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Babarians At The Gate","review":"It took too long for this item to get to me even though I made an express shipping payment.

I can recall very few laughs in this film. The premise of the film is to highlight the greed of the 1980's, but the lesson is quite dated in the era of Enron and WorldCom. The greed here is apparent and at least honest and upfront, in contrast to the dishonesty and deception of some of the greed of the late 1990's. As for the message, I certainly don't think the shareholders of RJR Reynolds minded being courted so well. If I were a shareholder of a slumping company I'd be mighty grateful to live in a society where people have the freedom to pay whatever crazy price they want for my stock! James Garner is wonderful in this show, and the movie does a nice job of laying out the business concepts in terms your grandmother can understand.

Now I am going to go the German Amazon site and buy yhem. At that site, season 1 is really season from the NBC network. Season 2, is the syndicated start of the series. And so on. They also have 9 seasons released. And not to worry, I am going to buy a region free DVD player on Bay. It will be worth it in the long run.

The series has been altered.The series is indeed Baywatch, but they have taken out the opening song, \\"I'm Always Here.\\" and closing song \\"Current of Love\\" both which were sung by David Hasselhoff.I was looking forward to seeing this series again. But am disappointed that the music was tampered with. It's like taking the opening music out of the series CHiPs, or any other series that has it's signature opening.And, as stated by other people, the seasons are being released out of order. And there are episodes missing.If you want the series Baywatch, just to have it. Then get these. However, if you want the series in it's entirety, music included, then I would wait until they release the series correctly.They need to go back to the drawing board on this one. :("},{"rating":"2","title":"Baywatch","review":"This isn't the best season of Baywatch, but it is pretty good and I hope to see the rest of the seasons on DVD soon.

Is a complete season of Baywatch really Baywatch when the seasons are labeled incorrectly, the music and theme song have been changed and episodes are missing? I don't think so.Not only have the distributors done fans no favours but Amazon have incorrectly labeled the cast. On the Amazon website as part of advertising for Season 1 they have incorrectly labeled it. If you go by the cast that Amazon have put on, you would think that it WAS the real original Season 1, when we know it is not.The release in the UK, which is out now and the upcoming release in Australia on March 14th is the real deal. Season 1 is the real season 1 and all subsequent seasons are correct. There are NO episodes missing and the original music and theme song are intact. Might wanna try those regions to buy the real deal.AARON"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I thought this DVD series would have the full season of season one, but it didn't.

The new music is terrible - canned music that all sounds like the same song. Not even Hasselhoff sings, and he produced the show to begin with! I can live with a couple missing episodes, and a few music changes, but nearly ALL the music has changed, and very much for the worse. And, the quality of the video is not nearly as crisp as it should be, especially \\"Panic at Malibu Pier\\".

Conversely with this candy they would still not be a hazard to children of the appropriate age. Especially if they had experience with enough Legos to know the difference.That being said the quality is horrible. The bricks do not have holes on the bottom to allow for any connections. You open a package hoping to play with them only to be stopped dead in your tracks by their inability to link together.

When I was done I went to lower the head. I turned the crank and everything was fine until the head was about 2 inches from the base.

Firstly, the notes on the margins of this book made the reading dis-jointed and irritating, as if you were reading a magazine article and not a book. Secondly, the main narrative was disjointed as well, jumping back and forth in time as if building suspense in a detective story or some high-brow literature. Yet, this is meant to be a memoir of a Buddhist nun.Mmh, maybe this pretentious(?) writing-style has something to do with the motivation of the author to take ordination: At some point she confesses that one motivation for getting ordained was that it would later serve her as a good conversation starter at a cocktail party.

Doesn't she realize she's not the only black person living in Sunnyside--there was another black family living in Sunnyside at the same time when she was there. They made great strides in school sports.

The book is written in a quite awkward way, and not in a clear step by step sequence, suggesting the author assumes that the reader is well acquainted with the game. Saying that, Max Hardy is well versed in the intricacy of the game, providing a broad array of bidding conventions, many having an in depth description,evaluation and analysis, especially the 2/1.

J. D. Hillberry is a great author and gives practical advise on how to draw realistic textures. Ever since I read this book and applied the techniques in it, I've continuously improved my technique and ability to draw. Before, I was terrible at drawing faces and using tone, but after looking at his technique and applying it, I began to understand the process so well that I drew my first portrait (Captain Kirk) and everyone instantly recognized it.One of the best parts of the book is he explains in plain English what each tool is for and how to use it properly. His plainspoken tone is friendly and inviting, and makes you want to pick up a pencil or charcoal stick and try out the techniques for yourself.I highly recommend this book to anyone, novice or expert, because there are plenty of techniques in it that would be useful for any type of pencil artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most useful, and inspiring","review":"Of all the many \\"how to\\" art books I own, this is the one book I would grab if my house was on fire.

Imagine, pencils and paper; and that's it. Nothing could be simpler---or more complex. Mr. Hillbery opened my eyes to the incredible possibilities locked up in the most basic artistic tools. Now, after being led along by this wonderful book, I have found yet another creative outlet to fall in love with.

But, the overall enjoyment of the film was disrupted by lost connective, and/or buffering.

Yes, you can pick up some really hot stuff with this oven mitt, but there is also a good chance you'll drop some hot stuff as well. Unfortunately, the design of the mitt forces your thumb to be uncomfortably across from the rest of your fingers, not next to your fingers as it normally sits. This aspect along with the fact that the thumb and fingers are held in a rigid position make it difficult to pick up items, especially heavy items. I don't know about you, but something that makes it difficult to pick up hot, heavy items doesn't belong in my kitchen.

Give it a try and see how you like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Exciting","review":"I had to read this book for school, and I really liked it. It told a lot of the hardships that Tony and Cindy went through when they were lost. It also gave me some idea's about what to do if I am ever in that situation. It had some twists like when the snowmobilers came and past, not even seeing them. If I had been in that situation I would have been bored out of my mind, and scared out of my wits. I recommend this to anyone who likes stories about survival."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent educational tool !","review":"As a High School Physics Teacher I really recomend this video for the introduction of the scientific method.

I had my students watch it. The bad acting pained them. One asked: \\"What did we do to you that made you so angry that you forced us to watch that idiotic thing?\\" The problem was, I had assigned them to read the actual historical documents on the Galileo case BEFORE they watched the movie. So they saw all the historical absurdities at once. Bottom line: childish pratfalls, intellectually dishonest anti-religious bigotry, along with remarkably stupid historical inaccuracies. As an example of propaganda and bigotry, it's great. As history, well, put it this way: the Scottish accents in the movie \\"The 300\\" is closer to the truth of the Spartans than this boring drivel is to Galileo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Celtic with a twist!","review":"Le Vent du Nord is traditional Quebecois music - that is, Celtic with a certain something that, for me, is the spirit of Quebec. With the traditional foot-tapping accompanying every song, amazing multi-part harmony by well-developed male voices, Maudite Moisson ! is a must for anyone who enjoys music with great rhythm and lots of soul! My particular favorites are tracks 1 (Au Bord de la Fontaine), 5 (Chers Amis Buvons) and 7 (Le Moine Complaisant). Don't let the language stop you! All the songs are well-described in the libretto so that, although you may not understand every word, you understand the spirit behind the sound. This album gets the highest recommendation from this music-lover."},{"rating":"1","title":"the price does not match the one listed on the box","review":"I bought this item and gave it as a gift to my nephew.

I got it for my son when he was learning to tell time he was excited with the way they looked but then it made him hate telling time because he never got it right because of the design.

It seems to be geared toward generation x a bit (my generation) I could see older people feeling uncomfortable with some of Goetz' illustrations and his laid back writing style.I loved the quotes he included from Fenelon and others. I don't often read things from those old mystic thinkers - but some of what they had to say about suffering and quiet were so thought-provoking.

I think that this is a fun game. You get to play duckhunt, tanks, ping pong, find Mii, pool, Pose Mii, lazer hockey, fish, and race on a cow. The games are fun, but they get a little boring after you play them a hundred times. My favorites are duckhunt and find Mii. I recommend this game not only because it comes with a Wiimote, but because the game scan be fun if you get bored with the other Wii games that you have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the remote - but this isnt sports - but great for kids","review":"I agree with everything said before. Wii Play is not nearly as engaging as Wii Sports, but it's a fun addition for the family. If you have young kids its a great title. The Wii has been an excellent addition to our family activities. As far as this title, the Cow Jumping and Find Mii have been huge hits for the 5 year old. If you are looking for adult play, Sports is much much better. But for the kids, Wii Play is well worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"30 seconds of fun","review":"The joy of the game is to be able to beat young children who play it for the first time (then never play it with them again). You will be the Wii play master and they will never be able to take that back because everyone will agree that playing another game would be more fun. That is the beauty of this game.Don't buy unless you need a wii mote"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wii Remote is good except when playing using the cursor","review":"The wii remote is awesome... but the game mostly uses the cursor in the remote and that doesn't work. I only had one chance to play the game and afterwards the cursor stopped moving. It is very frustrating. I think overall the remote is good as long as you won't use it in games that uses the cursor.The games itself are quite forgetable and even for $9 it is not worth it. I would suggest just buying the remote and forget about the game included in the wii play."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"I am a new Wii user and bought this on the first day.

I bought it for Christmas with our Wii so we would have 2 controllers to pass back and forth. The extra $10 is worth it in my book. Us (the adults) went through all the games first - we enjoyed the target shooting game and the ping pong game - the others were either lame or too hard (we couldn't get the pool cue to do what we wanted). Then the kids played it - they are extremely good at the pool game!! So they are definately getting my $10 moneys worth out of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Game\\" is a waste..","review":"Getting the \\"free\\" Wii Controller is ok. The games are idiotic.

A few, like the ones involving your \\"Mii\\" are simplistic and really geared towards small children. The ping-pong game is a bit awkward to use.

This package is 44.99,free shipping and you get a fun,entertaining (free) game. For everyone bitching about how lame it is, just shut up already. The shooting and the tanks are great, tanks are fun and challenging and my only complaint with the shooting is it isn't longer. This is a fun game, and I wouldn't hesitate to buy this package again.

Honestly all it did was frustrate me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Family fun","review":"I bought my Wii for the family, we have family Wii (bowling) night once a week. As far as Wii play, well I needed extra controllers when I saw this, for the additional 10 dollars I think it is well worth it.

And yes my 15 yr old had fun too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth buying.","review":"If you need another remote, you may as well just pay a few extra bucks for this bundle. The games are OK, there are a few worth playing even after you have mastered them.You can always trade the game in at GameStop or some other place for more credit than the game costs, so we bought 3 to get up to 4 controllers, got $7 each for 2 of the games (+ a $10 bonus) and ended up with 3 controllers, the Wii Play game and a game we really liked.Hard to go wrong when it costs just a few dollars more than the remote itself. Sometimes you can even get it with free super saver shipping, which I don't see offered much for the remote alone..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much fun but worth the price diff over just remote.","review":"The games are not that good.

It is definately not worth buying. Only one fun game exists on the disk, and that is the shooting range. The rest of the game is quite terrible. It is better to just buy a lone Wii Remote. I do believe that Wii Play should only cost 45$, because I frankly don't believe that the game is worth 10$. If you are looking for mini-games, you should probably get Mario Party 8 or Wario Ware: Smooth Moves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the $10","review":"To me the game was not worth the $10.

The only game I thought was fun is the combat style tank game. Duck hunt is all right too. But if you need a remote, buy this bundle, because the game is worth the extra 10 bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh...","review":"I would have to agree with most of the reviews here.Here's the bottom line.If this was a standalone title without the WiiMote and was in the bargain bin for $10, I would have probably given it a shot anyway.At that price, I guess you're getting what you pay for.The ping pong game had alot of promise, but they spoiled it by not expanding the options. I mean, who cares about returning shots until you miss? That's a game?Billiards is alot of fun at first, but again, NO variety!One of the reasons Wii Sports is so much fun has to do with variety. If you get sick of the regular games, you have Training Mode, etc.Wii Play could have benefited from having more options and depth.With MP 8 coming out sometime this year, I needed another WiiMote anyway, so it's not a total loss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I looked so forward to it coming in the mail, and when I got it, I don't know I expected more, and better. The ping pong was very disappointing and I guess the tank game is OK. I have gotten the gold medals in most of the games in a day or two of playing. Overall, I was totally letdown."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth $10","review":"If you take the $40 controller out of the equation (this one doesn't even have a silicon grip), this game is $10... and still not worth it. It's a series of silly, slightly amusing mini-games that 'teach' you how to do certain movements with the controller. For example, twisting your wrist, or holding the controller like a traditional controller. Things that would take you about 2.1 second to master in a real game. Plus, I can't figure out how to save it and in order to play a game, I must play all the ones that precede it to unlock them. A waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pitiful!","review":"Saddest games possible? I would have been at the return counter if the remote and it's cover hadn't come with it.

I received this for christmas, mainly because my brother and I wanted to do multiplayer games on the Wii and this had a wiimote. My brother and I pop in the Wii, and start to play.

Buyer Beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If it didn't have the extra controller, no one would ever buy this game","review":"The game helps you learn to use the remote more effectively, but the games are fairly dull.

I got this for Christmas with my Wii, I don't know why because I didn't ask for it, I assume it was for the extra Controller. Whatever. This game sucks!!! It sure isn't worth $50. I've had more fun playing Wii Sports, the game that came with my Wii."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your $10","review":"If you like Wii Sports and think Wii Play is going to be similar, think again.

They are cutsie and do not have the competitiveness and group play that wii sports has. There really is no comparison. Knowing what I know now, I would save $10 and just buy the remote itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst game ever! Why Nintendo even bothered releasing it is beyond me.","review":"I got this for Christmas, because like many people, my mom thought that since she would be buying an extra remote for our new Wii system, the extra $10 for a game was a good deal. The reality is that the game isn't a game at all, it's a series of mini games designed as a tutorial that you must play one at a time and succeed in whatever the task is before the next can be unlocked. My mom and I each played Christmas day, but after that, the game has sat in its case never to see the light of day. Unless you think you'll really have a hard time learning how to move and control the Wii remote, don't bother with the pack, just buy the extra remote and put the money you'll save toward either a second Nunchuk or a different game."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a good game, I really like the ping pong and pool.","review":"Very nice game to play. I really enjoy the pool and ping pong on this game the shooting is also cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great way to learn controls!","review":"OK, so my last video game was Pong. It was very hypnotic, but this game sure doesn't put you in a coma! My husband and I have never had a (modern) video game system, so we had no idea what to do with all of those little buttons.

They all enjoyed WII play."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for a party!","review":"If you're relying on the Wii sports game for your party entertainment, this game'll add more joy and fun for you and your crowd. Priced $10 more than a standard Wii remote, the game is absolutely worth it. With games such as target shooting, fishing, table hockey, and this weird cow race, among others, you'll have plenty of fun with all ages. The table tennis game is too hard to enjoy due to the awkward motions required, but overall, it's still a 5-star product for sure! Batteries come included with the Wii remote by the way. No reason not to add this collection to your Wii games."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wii Play","review":"BEST game to start off with. First you get the 2nd controller that really is necessary for more then 2 people. THEN you get this fantastic collection of games that teach you how to use your remotes in different ways.

I was expecting this to be just as cool as Wii Sports. I pre-ordered this item and got it yesterday evening. I put it in and could not believe how bad this game was. You have to unlock the games one by one so you have to play a cheesy bad game just to get to another cheesy bad game. The only game remotely fun on it is the 9-ball pool. Everything else was really bad. If it wasn't for the Wiimote and the 9-ball pool this game would be returned. In my opinion, save your money!

We had decided to purchase a separate controller for $39 versus purchasing WiiPlay. Boy am I glad I did!! The game play on this has been well described already by Bipi101, so I won't redo the description. Needless to say, it didn't hold my attention or my five year old son. He was pretty disappointed with it. Wii Sports is much more fun and teaches you to use the remote just as well.My suggestion would be to purchase a second (or third etc) controller separately and use the extra $10 toward a Nunchuk. I suspect that most of the games here one won't play more than a few times while the Nunchuk will be used far more often."},{"rating":"1","title":"Solitaire Anyone","review":"I purchased this basically for the remote. The games are basically tutorials for the remote. Not much depth or replay value.

And it really is. It comes with 9 games, but they are created in a way of teaching, I mean, they were designed just like if they were your first Wii games, so they go through steps to teach you how to handle Wii remote. Games are also too basic in form and shape, too simple in colors and realism. In fact, from all 9 games I can say only two of them are funny, Shooting and Find Mii. All other games are simplified version of real games with lack of sophistication; Table Tennis, Tank, Laser Hockey, Billards and fishing are very bad. They just can be played three or four times, then you see they are too simple."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good deal and a fun game for the family","review":"Our family just got the Wii for Christmas this year as a gift from the family and this was the first game we bought. A big selling point is the free controller that comes with the game. I know it's not really free, but for the price of most games for any platform it basically makes it free.

However, I found the game boring and not even worth a second look. Ping pong? Air hockey? Really, Nintendo? The pool portion was sort of fun, but everything else is a throwback to something old (Duck Hunt, anyone?). For $10, I don't expect a lot, but I was expecting more than this. The freebie Link's Crossbow Training that comes with the gun is much more fun than this.All in all, you should buy this. It's only $10 extra, and different strokes.

They may have spent hundreds of thousands of dollar in development in upgrading some Atari style games to use the advanced Wii functionality, so I guessing they're trying to recoup some of that money. The games might be geared to just over toddler age fun games. Even my youngest daughter has lost interest.I would probably give this package a 4 star if they included it for free with the purchase of a remote. It's a door prize nothing more.The purchase of a remote is necessary maybe even three so you can have four players at once, but the addition of this Wii Play game does not add (much) value to the package.My advice: Pass on the game and just purchase the remote unless you have some under 7 children that need babysitting now and then, then it might come in handy (if you've found something else to hold your door open)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for young kids","review":"The games here are probably great for young kids but for adults, not really worth the extra money.

Unfortunately, the games makes you proceed through each one before unlocking the next game.Some are just boring like finding a Mii on the screen, or racing down a cow path. The fishing game is a joke, as is the ping pong which you have surprisingly little control over (very un-Wii like). The billiards is probably the most fun, but even that has only basic play-ability. The laser hockey was interesting and provides enough eye candy to maintain interest for awhile.The 'game' seems to be simply a demonstration of some of the things you can do with the Wii remote.

The games are interesting and sort of strange, but they're entertaining and my whole family can play it together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for the price","review":"The whole package was the same price as just the remote from Wlmart. So it was worth it. The games arent all that much fun...just ok"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun with Wii Play","review":"The main reason I bought this game was because it was a bargain with the Wii remote. My family and I have really enjoyed the games on the Wii Play. The pool game actually gives you the feeling that you are at a pool table. However, the most enjoyable game for us was the race game. I would recommend the Wii Play to anyone who is looking for a variety of fun games to play with the family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Free remote worth it.","review":"If you get the \\"free\\" remote with the game, it's worth it. None of the games are outstanding, but the matching game and cow racing game are fun for younger kids. For older players, the target practice and tank game are both enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wii Play","review":"If you're new with the Nintendo Wii and want to learn how to use the controllers like an artist you have to buy Wii Play. It's a simply set of 8 fun Minigames that allows you to use the control to the fullest. I think it's really simple the great part is that the game comes with an extra Wii Controller to play with your family or friends ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loads of Fun!","review":"I got the Wii game for my daughter for Christmas and the entire family has enjoyed it. I am glad that we got the extra remotes so that more than one person can play a game at one time. I highly recommend the Wii game and purchasing additional Wii Play remotes for multiple players!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Deal","review":"The games of WiiPlay are not quite as good as the original Wii Sports. However, this purchase is a good deal with the remote. Table tennis is relatively difficult to play, the racing cows and tank games are fun, as are the shooting and fishing, although these games are not very advanced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great addition to your Wii","review":"This is a great product to get if you need another contoller.

They are not very interesting. The only one I enjoyed off this game is the billiards game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can easily buy for extra remote","review":"Game is worth no more than $10.

There are so many things to do, I don't ever see myself getting bored."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh.","review":"Not a great game. Much preferred Wii sports that came with the console. The games weren't that fun and if I could do it again, I would just buy the remote and spend $10 on downloading some old NES games using Wii points."},{"rating":"1","title":"At least I got a Wii Remote with this product...","review":"Wii play is a set of nine mini games with a Wii Remote.This set of nine games to me, seemed like all the games that didn't make Wii Sports and they shoved it on a CD and packaged it with a Wii Remote as a consolation prize for buying this game.Most of the mini games in Wii Play are not fun, at least for me. I'm a college student. I think Wii play may be amusing for children under the ages of 13. I think this game could be fun at drinking parties for older people.For me, the only good thing that came out of this was that I got a Wii Remote and I only paid 10 extra dollars for the nine mini games since the remote retails for $40 anyways."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO DEAL AT ALL","review":"I played each of the games for about 5 minutes and have no desire to play them again.I would have been better off had I just bought the remote and saved $10, or spent the same amount and bought the blk MotionPlus remote as I've found the new sensor is improved."},{"rating":"1","title":"work only with NTSC mode","review":"I have tried to run it in my Wii console which i have purchased from Dubai, but it did not work,I discovered that there are 2 models of WII, one supports NTSC and the other is not (which i have)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't operate in the UK","review":"Bought this for a relative to bring over to us in the UK.

It is the worst game ever. The only reason this game would sell is because its bundled with the Wii Remote. With no Motion Plus, I think this game would tank the rating again. Sadly I had to give one star to provide my rating. I would give it -5 if I could. It is not even worth the effort to play any of these games. Why would anyone ever buy these when there are so many other good Wii games out there. Please choose wisely. Read more reviews and buy a game that will make you feel relaxed and enjoyabl instead of making you feel worse playing the game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work on UK Wii console","review":"After receiving this package, I was so excited cause I got it mainly for the remote but when trying to play the games the Wii console could not read the disc, such games should be international, now I got my console from UK I should only be buying games from UK..this doe not make any sense, now I'll go for crack to play all games !!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT SELL WITH AMAZON","review":"If you have stuff to sell do not do it on amazon or you better have a tracking number"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waiting for a new game","review":"I ordered this game for my children for Easter. It sounds like a great game and the extra remote will come in handy. Unfortunately, I cant' review the game because we have yet to see it. The game will not work in the Wii. I followed all the troubleshooting advice. Our Wii is not broken since it plays the other Wii games we have. I have called Nintendo and they have been very polite. They are sending a mailer for me to return the disc and will send me a new one. I am hoping I just got a bad disc and the new one will arrive so we can play the game. If anyone else has a problem I'd recommend calling Nintendo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Christmas Gift- Have Not Used Yet","review":"This is a Christmas Gift, have not used yet.

That's not worth $10 to me, since the controllers are fairly intuitive anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Video Game Purchase of my life","review":"OK, So I bought this game with the idea that I was buying a remote with an inexpensive game. And somehow this still qualifies as the worst video game purchase I have ever made; the games are short and boring. I played all 8 games thinking they were a warm up for the real game, and they ended up being the whole game, it took like 10 min. I played it once and I never played it again. I rather play solitaire on the computer than play this game even considering it comes with a remote it is still a rip off. Worst purchase I have ever made, don't make the same mistake as I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nintendo Wii Play","review":"I don't care what the other reviewers say - I like these games! I think it is a great price for what you get. Lots of different games plus the remote for a decent price. The games may not be as fancy as the others available but they are still fun to play."},{"rating":"1","title":"Game = $10 | Wiimote = $39.99 | Wii Play = $49.99... Why did I expect so much from the game?","review":"At first glance, the Wii Play seems extremely appealing as you get a Wii remote AND a game consisting 9 mini games. However, to my disappoint and to many others, the games are just not worth it. I'd sell back my Wii Play with the remote to just get back my money but it's too much of a hassle.If you want the Wii remote don't buy this. You'll just waste $10 that you can save to buy a good game rather than the 9 mini game junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"Go get a controller and save your $10 dollars for something that will provide more than 10 minutes of enjoyment. The games are simplistic and repetitive and, for $10 dollars, you can go buy a used GameCube game to play on the Wii."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO PLAY","review":"The games are poor, if you need an extra controler like I did, just buy one by itself and save $10 versus buying this bundle. The games are not worth $10."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wii Play & remote","review":"the remote is a must but the game is a bust. It's no wonder you get this game for a small amount extra with the Remote , BORING is the one word to use....save the little bit of money and just buy a remote."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent, but it could be more","review":"I've played this game now as a single player and as multiplayer. For some games multiplayer is more fun than single player, but I've got to admit that this was not at all what I was hoping for. It's a great deal, like everyone has said. If you need the extra remote it's worth it. I enjoy the fact that they're short games. If you don't have a whole lot of time, like you're heading off to class, then it's fun to play for a couple of minutes, but it certainly doesn't keep my attention as long as Wii Sports. Overall, great deal, decent play."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great item for beginners","review":"This product is great if you are new to WII. Especially if you need an extra remote. It has some fun games, at the same time teaches you how to use the remote. Each game gets you familiar with each of the functions of the remote. It tells you what you need to do and then you play the game. Once you have gone through and unlocked each of the games, you can go back and play any and all the games you want."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy it for the remote only","review":"I was looking to buy an extra remote for my wii and decided on buying this game as it comes with a controller as for almost the same price of a controller i was also getting a game. In the end when i played these games, they are trivial and unexciting. No one in my house enjoyed playing the games within this game and this game has never been played since the first day we played it.So my advice, buy it for the remote only as it cant hurt to have extra games, who knows some kids may like them :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money for a Nunchuk","review":"this is the sort of game that should come free with the Wii (built onto the wii sports disk) to use before you play Wii Sports. They are very simple games and the feel more like a bunch of proof of concepts for how to use the wii mote. On a side note, I would have loved this game is was real nes style duck huntthe bottom line is save your money to get a nunchuk which you will need and use more then this game after playing it once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very fun","review":"Let me start off by saying I haven't come across another game for ten dollars (49.99 - 39.99 for wiimote = 10.00) that is as good as this.When I first played through the mini games I was disappointed, but after having some friends over these games turned out to be a lot of fun. Because some of the games are so simple I was even able to get my mother to join in on the fun.If you're planning on buying a wiimote be sure to pick up this combination, it is well worth the extra ten dollars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wii Play","review":"This is a fun and interactive game compliation that the whole family can enjoy. Lots of variety for 1 or 2 players, and it gets you off your couch and moving around. Not quite as refined as the Wii Sports package, but entertaining non the less. It has appeal for all ages and makes good use of the Wii controllers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only fun for little kids......","review":"I just got the Wii for Christmas and it came with this game. It was a great way to understand how the Wiimote works but got really old very quick. The only thing I thought was remotely cute was the cow racing and only for a little while. The fishing is absolutely pathetic but what do you want for a free addition to the Wii? The Wii Sports, now that is totally fun, I am so sore from batting, playing tennis and bowling! My suggestion is to only buy Wii Play for younger kids who need to learn to use the Wii remote. It will soon become boring to them too."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's alright","review":"... Not great games, but 1/4th the price of anything else, and fun enough. Good way to learn the game, and some of the minigames are great fun.... I really needed another controller, so it just made sense to get the package deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"antique gamer","review":"I', real gald I didn't pay anymore than $10.00, it's an allright game but not at all challanging and games too short and only 1-2 players. I agree it's sort of teaches the use of the remote but so does the Sports games that came with the Wii."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total waste of money","review":"First, don't let the overall rating for this game fool you. I admit that I am not a hardcore gamer, but I do like fun simple games. However, this game (or collection of games) is way too simple, in fact I feel as though I may have lost some of my IQ just playing this worthless game. I am ashamed to have this title in my game collection, what is worse is that I can't get rid of it unless I am prepared to lose at least half of what I paid for it! Virtually every game on this CD should be rated for age 6 and UNDER as not a single game even lives up to the game collection that comes with the Wii. The only reason I may keep this game is for the extra Wii remote since it would have cost me about what I paid for this game. In fact the only reason I rated this game with one star is because the rating system would allow for 0 or -10 stars.STEER CLEAR OF THIS GAME!! Anyone who tells you otherwise must either be high on crack or is trying to sell their copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"this game sucks.","review":"this game really really sucks. you could get a used copy of this game for about $6.00 ' it's not worth $6.OO if someone were to talk up this game and try and unload this game on me at a garage sale or something then I would kick him in the nuts.Wii Play with Wii RemoteWii Play [No Remote]"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Strong Consideration If You Need the Wiimote","review":"If the game came without the Wiimote, I wound't touch it with a ten foot pole. Amusing two-player games like Found Mii, Pool, Target Practice and Tanks are heaped in with a few mediocre or sometimes frustratingly difficult to control games like Fishing and Laser Hockey.I'd say it's well worth the $10 if you need the Wiimote, but temper your expectations before you buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wii Play games","review":"Thought it was a good idea to get this game pack with the extra remote. It turns out that the games included are not worth much more than the $5 extra you would spend to just order the remote by it's self."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better to just buy the remote...","review":"These games are okay for small children, but older kids and adults are not likely to play these more than once or twice. These games do not have the challenge and appeal of other Wii games. I bought Wii Play because I wanted the extra remote and thought it made sense to get Wii Play for only $10. If I had it to do over again, I would purchase the remote separately and use the $10 I saved to buy Wii Fit or one of the other great Wii games."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your $10","review":"I honestly thought, how could it be SO bad to justify saving the $10. Then I opened the box, and, after one play through, realized that I will never play this game again. It is so, so much worse than Wii Sports, so don't get your hopes up. Honestly, buy just a regular controller, and save your $10 for something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps Me Coming Back","review":"I received this as a gift and by far it's my favorite sports game I've ever played, on any system! :-) It's cartoony and just plain FUN!

We had a lot of fun every time we played it. I recommended it to kids around 6 like us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poorly designed games. Not worth the money","review":"I bought this combo for the extra Wii remote that came with it, and thought that the additional games for an extra 10~15 bucks (over the price of the Wii remote) would be a bonus. I have to say that I did not enjoy the games at all. First of all, you have to go through a series of games you may not have wanted to play before you can get to play the game you want to play. Secondly, the games themselves are very poorly designed and not too much fun at all.If you are looking to buy this product for the Wii remote, I would say save yourself the extra 10~15 dollars for the Wii Play and just get the Wii remote separately instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very little value beyond the remote.","review":"\\"Free\\" remote, but worthless game.

I thought it would be a good deal because its only ten dollars more than a remote. But i should have just bought a remote because the game that comes with it is not very good. Its only mini games that is not even worth eight bucks. It does not even save it after u beat it. U have to beat it over and over again which it is kind of a hard game so its gets really boring. Even on multiplayer. The only good thing about this is the remote that comes with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good deal","review":"We bought this because of the price. We knew we needed a 2nd remote for the Wii, and this was 10 dollars more than the cost of the remote alone. The games are very simple, and I think in a few more weeks -- maybe months -- the kids (8 and 10 yr old girls) will have gotten bored with them, but 10 dollars for several months worth of entertainment seems to be a pretty good deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only For Super Beginners","review":"The game is truly not a \\"game\\" at all.. it's like an electric version of an instruction manual for the remote control. It's really not very fun for very long. It's amusing for about 15 minutes, maybe 20, and then it's just... not. I ended up selling the game and keeping the remote. It's only really meant for beginners who can't figure out how to use the remote, in my opinion. It IS helpful in learning more about the remote, I agree, but I ended up getting this game days after I first started playing Wii, so it was a bit pointless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wii Play","review":"I basically bought this for the extra controller. I figured I might as well get more bang for the buck and get the game as well. But the game turned out to be more of a training video on how to use the controller better. It helped. Still, the extra contoller itself was greatly appreciated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just buy the remote - the game's not worth the extra $10","review":"I should have read the reviews of this product. If you need an extra remote just buy it, this game isn't worth and extra ten cents, much less ten dollars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time on this.","review":"I give this game one star for fun, because it is horrible and two stars overall, because you get a wii remote with it so you aren't wasting that much money if you buy it.Every game left me thinking \\"Why?\\" Why would anyone want to play this? I was looking forward to playing pool, but it was pretty terrible. I could go on a rant about all of the problems with the game play on this particular game alone.Pool aside, all of the games were terrible. There were really only two games that I actually enjoyed playing, and I really don't feel any desire to play either one of those a second time.If you are looking into getting this because \\"Hey, it's only 10 dollars more than getting a remote by itself!\\" My suggestion is to not waste the 10 dollars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for younger players","review":"If you are over 8yo and have any video game experience this game will be just too easy for you, but I have twin 4yo who are still learning how to control the wii remote and this package of mini games has helped quite a bit. As for an adult I would not consider it a game but more of a tutorial for anyone new to the Wii. It came with the controller which is what I was purchasing anyway for an additional $10 more, for us it was a good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wii Play","review":"Games are fun, more fun when two people play. Getting extra remote is a bonus as well as they are just as expensive as getting buying the remote separately and getting the game free.

An adult with competent game play skills can do it in maybe 30 minutes.The games are ok, short but ok. They are almost like teaser games for something larger. My kid enjoys them and that is all that mattered to me, it is her Wii.What I bought was a used version of the product for about a $12 savings and the remote I got from my seller was broken."},{"rating":"2","title":"A BANG FOR YOUR BUCK!","review":"A control by itself is $39.99 so for $10 more you get quite a few really fun games that you can play alone or with a partner. I especially love the Pool game. It is so realistic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worth it to get the extra remote","review":"I purchased the Wii on launch day and was unable to buy an extra remote. When I saw that Wii Play was being released, I decided to wait. My family loves Wii Sports and this sounded like even more fun. Not so much. The games are so basic they are easily conquered. I like the Find Mii game, but it isn't that exciting. This game is worth the extra $10 over the remote if you don't have one, but that is about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wii Play with Boring 2 player games","review":"I am not quite sure whether it was the fact the original games were just so great that came with the Wii, or it is just these games really really suck. I ultimately bought this pack because I needed another wii controller stat. Then I read the games and thought wow, those would be fun. I typically have at least 4 people at my house so having this pack of games which all of them are only 2 player is not any fun. I will be selling this game pack back to the store during my next trip. I will be keeping the wii controller though."},{"rating":"2","title":"WII Play Review","review":"This product was fun to play. I just wish you pick the game you want and not have to go through them all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wii Play review","review":"I purchased this item more for the extra remote and less for the games. I did enjoy the original Wii Play bundled games, with titles of Bowling, Golf, Boxing, etc., but thought this version was not nearly enjoyable. In fact, once I played each of the games once, it has sat on my shelf since. But, the controllers are worth the price of this bundle, especially if you are having a hard time locating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good games...only because you get a remote...","review":"Essentially the game costs ~$10 when you figure you are getting a ~$40 remote. I wouldn't spend $50 on the games, but with the remote it is a good value. Tanks is by far the best game...some of the other ones are not worth their space on the dvd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for little kids","review":"I enjoy tremendously the simple Tanks game (using the Nunchuck controller). My 4 year old daughter loves the cow racing game and the fishing.

It is fun to bring friends over and challenge each other."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun for the novice..good buy for extra remote.","review":"I just love the shooter game. Wii was my first time trying any gaming console I bought Wii play for the extra remote and it is worth every dime. As a novice, who needed to know how to use the remote I think it is a good buy. My daughter and I have great fun with Wii play particularly the shooter game and cow riding game. Enjoy it.. you can't lose even you buy it for the extra remote. We spend hours just trying to beat each other's scores."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun game!","review":"I really like the Mii game on this. The other games are okay but I will never get bored of the Mii game. I guess if you buy this, don't expect too much from it, but at least the extra wii remote is worth the cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just buy another remote and save the $10","review":"When my wife and I bought a Wii for our girls, we started to buy three extra remotes but noticed that this game was bundled with one. We decided for $10, we might as well give the game a try.In hindsight, I should have just bought the remote. The games are about as entertaining as 30-year-old console games. Don't waste even $10, it's not worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Need the extra controller but the game is just ok.","review":"First, you need to buy the second controller for the Wii. That's why I bought this. The price was right and I needed the extra controller. This package gives you so fun games to play as well, probably worth the extra to get them. I just wish you didn't have to \\"unlock\\" each game by finishing the one before it. Seems kind of silly to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, at least you're getting a controller","review":"Unfortunately I have to concur with many of the negative reviews here. With this game you're essentially paying for a controller and a shareware-quality game. I got it on sale for the same price as a controller, and so I consider the purchase worth it. Most the games are worthless and I was bored with them the first or second time playing them. The target shooting game provides some decent pick-up-and-get-going fun, and the cow racing is fun for the family or kids new to gaming, but overall there is no replay value here.If you need an extra controller this is a decent option, otherwise don't bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Favorite","review":"Green Mountain Sumatra K-Cups are a favorite for my morning brew.

The commentary is punctuated by Pro-Israeli pundits like Thomas Friedman and the whole dialogue mass is well kneeded by a 24 ct. Brandeis University (not surprising, eh?) Zionist. The most remarkable feature of the 59 min film is the fact that the state of Israeli is hardly mentioned. The true genesis of Middle Eastern malaise remains unmentioned."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY dated, wayyyyy to technical.","review":"THe book is first incredibly dated. THe projects and advice are ONLY good is you plan on hand making every single component including your crossovers. Basically the book should be called \\" how to build a system with no money after youve robbed radio shack.\\" Not a single chapter had any relevant information other than the technical basics.

It was with glee that I found this CD, at the bargain price of $10. Admittedly, the production is a bit rough, and the original film shows its student budget, but that is somehow fitting to the film. My only complaint is that they did not include the short \\"Hardware Wars\\" (a spoof of Star Wars, featuring an intergalactic steam iron and the heroic Fluke Starbucker, if I recollect correctly), which toured with Dark Star after HW's release in 1977; it made an inspired pairing. Oh well, I guess that 13 minutes of hilarity is available on its own DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Quite as humorous as I remembered, but still good.","review":"I bought this movie, because I was working on modern real-world weapons being developed and some of the things these weapons will do reminded me of this movie.

I shouldn't have. What I should have done was paid more attention to the reviews that stated that this film isn't for everyone. I would have saved myself some money.It looks like a low-budget (which I guess it is), amateurish film -- along the lines of the Blair Witch Project, which I didn't care for either. But heck, I liked that better than this. And yes, I realize they're two totally different genres.It's like watching a home made movie that maybe your uncle made while following someone around with his camcorder.I will admit that a few scenes made me smile simply because they made me think of the fun the actors and directors must have had making such a campy film.

I can seriously think of no redeeming value to this movie. In fact, I am sure that Carpenter and O'Bannon are quite ashamed of this black scar that lingers in their past. The unwitty dialogue tries to be clever all throughout the movie and is just sooo boring. The 'effects' don't exist, and the whole alien beach ball thing is just embarrasing. It's not funny - it is embarassing.

So what about an alien? It's a jumping orange beach ball with two legs that is filled with air. What I liked about the movie was the artificial intelligence. The talking computer on the board of the ship and the bombs. Yes, talking bombs. And the bomb #20 will be especially smart. The movie runs 1h:22mins.

Like George Lucas' debut THX-1138, it is a film that would be forgotten if the director had not gone onto bigger and better things. It might pass if you have a fetish for cheesy 70's sci-fi such as Soylent Green and Logan's Run. For the rest of us all I can say is give me a break. The talking voice is lifted straight from HAL in 2001. The effects are so terrible that its hard not to burst out laughing when one of the main characters have a dialogue and a fight with a beachball (!). Otherwise, it just seems as if everyone is stoned. I can forgive John Carpenter, because after all its just a student film and he went on to make Halloween, which is probably one of the best horror films of all times.

However, I was surprised by the script and subtle humor in the movie, and the small details and creative moviemaking used to make up for the low budget.It wasn't a perfect movie, but its freshness and creativity make up for its flaws. Obviously Carpenter, O'Bannon, etc., all went on to have great careers, and made some great movies.If you like \\"first movies\\", sci-fi, fantasy, horror, or any of the other work put out by the people involved in this movie, you should end up liking Dark Star.

The sets and special effects are cheap and I think that the editing could have been a bit tighter as some of the scenes go on too long (you don't need to experience monotony to get a sense of what the characters are going through).As mentioned by others it's a lengthened version of an original short film, and you get the feeling when watching it that the makers ran out of both ideas and money during this process.

The mammoths face the erosion of their habitat and gene pool, and encroachment by a group of brutal men."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea, horrible execution","review":"Excited by the premise, I was very disappointed by this book. The characters seemed to behave randomly, changing from one course of action to another without reason.

He provides her with everything she could possibly want, but she feels unfulfilled. He drives race cars and is involved in some shady car dealings. She paints naked men.When Val discovers her husband is having an affair, she has one for spite. They separate, hence the title \\"Separate Ways\\". Sybil Danning has a bit part as Mary, the girl who sells hot dogs. Val gets a job as a \\"Foxy Lady\\" cocktail waitress working for Jack Carter. The movie is rather lame and pointless, even in 1981.

My seven year old HP LaserJet 4L died and I did a lot of research before settling on the Brother unit. The set up is quick - it takes but minutes - and the printer has both great quality and the speed it promises.

We've replaced the high-yield toner every 2 months or so ($160), and we are on the 2nd drum replacement unit ($240), but quality remains excellent, speed is very good, noise is low, and no downtime has been needed except for routine cleaning.

I was really put off by it because the nursery rhymes are fairly skewed versions of the ones I learned as a child. Like for example, \\"Ring around the Rosie\\" sings \\"A-tishoo, A-tishoo\\" instead of \\"Ashes, Ashes, etc\\", which I find really bizarre and awkward to try and read. Plus, they are all cut really, really short, only a couple lines each, which I think ruins the whole point of a rhyme. These are hardly long enough to rhyme at all. The thing I liked about this book is that it is a board book, and it's small, so it's good to use with an infant. But for the sake of learning and hearing true and full-length nursery rhymes, I would go with \\"The Baby's Lap Book\\" by Kay Chorao (which was also recommended reading for young infants). It's not a board book, but it's hardbound, has a lot cuter illustrations, and the whole nursery rhymes are there! ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong, wrong, wrong","review":"We were given this book at our baby shower.

I expected that all performances on this DVD would be as creative as Irina's was, but I was completely wrong!Tarot cards can be very inspiring to dance to, but I assume that most of these so called artist didn't want to bother with cards meaning or choreography, as much as they bothered with costuming. The choice of music was very boring, too.The worst Tarot interpretation was the card called \\"Lovers\\". There are two parts on this DVD and both of them suck! It suppose to be belly dance, not salsa or jazz!Don't waste your money, just check the YouTube video of Irina, that's only performance worth watching on this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"This is the first time I do not like a Neon DVD it is just not worth it.

Don't waste your money like I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly and disappointing","review":"The ads and synopses for this really make it sound like some kind of slammin' bellydance extravaganza. It is not like that at all. It is a lot of falling leaves and people pretending to throw each other around.Don't get me wrong. The World Dance New York team is awesome. But I searched my heart and soul for something good to say about this DVD and all I came up with was \\"Some of the outfits are pretty.\\" The dances themselves are very boring and at times they even made me break into laughter.Also, the sound quality is quite poor.And as much as the goth dance was cool, the random breaking into Velvet Acid Christ music in the middle of this was just... funny. I mean, if you want comedy, by all means buy the DVD. Other than that... \\"Pretty outfits.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Bogus Reproduction","review":"I bought this in the expectation that it was a reproduction of an essay by Henry Wilberforce Clarke. It's clearly written by someone else (the author notes at one point that he/she is \\"indebted to H.

However, the book does contain many good illustrations (100 photos, 16 color plates).Particularly notable are the line drawings of the tattooing on the male body from the 2nd Pazyryk kurgan, and the color plates showing schematic reconstructions of Scythian horse trappings. Of course, the tattoo information is now available on the web, and I suspect that the horse trappings are also available elsewhere..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good info, but poorly researched","review":"I have to agree with the other reviewer that Rolle has not seemed to really have studied the topic well. This is a good source of information for those interested in the ancient horse-archer cultures but please don't take it as the final word. Tamara Talbot Rice's book from the 50s on the Scythians is a much better account, if you can track it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"overly belabored writing, predictable characters/development","review":"That just about sums it up. I'd rather read other equally (if not more) verbose writers such as Tad Williams and Stephen R. Donaldson. After half of \\"Curse of the Mistwraith,\\" I started skimming to get the gist of the action rather than be bogged down by the language. I find the word \\"inveigle\\" especially annoying now, after so many uses of it -- spoken by the characters, no less!Usually I follow the good fantasy/sci-fi series (like her collaborations with Feist) to the bitter end, but this one just has not been worth the time or money -- if you really want to check it out, get it from your library instead, if you can find it. We all know what's going to happen in the end, and I find myself not caring how it gets there in the next 5 or 6 books that the author promises."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go Cinci!","review":"Our latest addition to our living room wall.. looks amazing.

The first batch of cupcakes I made using 1/2 tsp...you couldn't not even taste the flavor or peach. I made a second batch with 1 tsp (all that was left in this little dram). There are a hint of flavor, and that was it. No one who at them, could tell what the flavor was, but that there was something trying to be there. I really wanted to make light peach cupcakes, without the weight and density of adding real fruit, but I think that is what I have to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it !!","review":"I just love this little sprayer. It is working great for both my indoor and outdoor plants. It sprays a perfect mist and is just perfect for carrying around."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perfect Sprayer!","review":"Considering it's modest price tag at only $20, this little sprayer is a very high-quality item, and it works superbly. It holds half a gallon of liquid, only needs to be pumped up by the comfortable-to-use hand pump on top about 30 times to pressurize it, and you're then ready to spray anything from a stream to an extremely fine atomized mist via the easily adjustable nozzle. It also comes with an extension that can be easily attached to make the nozzle stretch out to about two feet from your hand as you hold the device, making it even more comfortable to spray from awkward or far-away positions. I can honestly say I like EVERYTHING about this little sprayer - it's quality, ergonomic design, ease of use, low price, etc. - and can heartily recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"easy sprayer","review":"I got this to spray my roses after it rains to prevent black spot.

The nozzle tip can be pointed in any direction, up, down left, right, and the nozzle tube extends from 12\\" to 24\\". It adjusts from an atomized mist to a steady stream. The instructions tell you to pump it 30 strokes. When the nozzle is loosened to a stream, it shoots a continuous horizontal stream well over twenty feet. It seems a little pricey, but it is well worth every penny spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solo 2 liter Pump Sprayer","review":"I received the Solo 2-Liter Pump Sprayer promptly and in good condition. I've used the sprayer several times, and it works well. The extension wand and tiltable spray head are real assets - particularly when trying to spray the undersides of leaves. This sprayer costs more than some other similarly sized sprayers, but given the quality (very good) and versatility, I believe it is a very good value. The only negative comment I have is that I wish the mouth of the sprayer were wider to facilitate easy transfer of materials into the sprayer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really a Pleasure to Use","review":"I bought two models, the Solo 420 2-Liter and the 418 1-Liter. The 2 liter model has a long wand, about 14 inches; this is very good if you are watering a collection of plants on a table & need to maneuver among them. The 1 liter version is more compact. Both have enough range where you can form a tight jet & water plants from several feet away, if access is awkward. Other than that, and the different volumes, they are pretty much identical.Both models are well constructed and seem to be built to last. The pump action and spray valve are very smooth; the nozzle spray pattern is adjustable. The nozzle has a sort of cone-like baffle surrounding it, which seems to help direct the water exactly where you want it. Importantly, there is no drip once you close the valve.What was once a chore with a watering can is now a lot more pleasant..."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Their Best","review":"Queen of Connemara and Mary Ellen Carter are just two of the wonderful tracks on this, the last joint album by Tommy Makem and Liam Clancy.

It is very easy to read, however every sentence has a much deeper meaning. Contrary to wide spread belief that \\"everyone can achieve everything\\" this book infers that every person has a mission to fulfil in his life. Their personal goals are interrelated with devine providence.The story of three young men who left their province for the capital, they were to fulfil their destinies that they were not aware of. This book may read like a fairy tale with hidden depths and with new meanings appearing each time. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS is thrash metal.","review":"Imagine in your mind Metallica making decent music again. Well, that is not in your mind, it is \\"Of One Blood\\" by Shadows Fall! Brian Fair is one of the best singers in all of metal. He can do screams that scare you, he can sing as good as Bruce Dickinson, he's that good. Just listen to the song \\"Of One Blood\\" to get a taste of Shadows Fall and the rest of the album is a trip into the world of great music. If you like this, check out these guys' latest \\"The Art Of Balance\\" for more of the same. Oh yeah, this is NOT death metal. Death metal is traditionally faster and less melodic.

These guys are awesome in concert, everyone who like metal should see them. S.F. has a unique guitar style, blended with pounding bass, and deep vocals. If you like metallica, and you like slipknot/pantera or anyone like them, you will absolutely love these guys. Visit their site at shadowsfall.com for tour dates and info. I got this CD in the beginning of 2001, and I still love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"This is the album that made Shadows Fall one of my favorite bands.

I listen to this all the time, and then I just saw them live with Damageplan on the Devastation Across the Nation Tour...... UNBELIEVABLE!!! I was right up front, which was even better. They were awesome live, just as good as Lamb of God, Slipknot, Devildriver, and Slayer (To name a few). Some great songs on this album are Crushing Belial, Of One Blood, The First Noble Truth, Fleshold (My personal favorite), and Serenity. I really like the Death vocals done by the gutairists, they add some good variety to the songs, but Brian Fair is awesome all on his own. Buy this album if you can find it (it is pretty hard to find), along with The Art of Balance and The War Within if you don't already own them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shadows Fall = True Metal","review":"OK I am a big fan of shadows fall and i think this is a great album but being objective, shadows fall show us how to make the NWOAHM, i can't give them 5 stars because sometimes brian fair abuse of excecive screams and this is not a death metal album, but the guitars mat and jon sounds very acoplated and powerfull.

I bought season 2 only to be dissappointed. Not only are the seasons or episodes not in sequence but that the original music has been replaced. The opening theme song has been changed to some slow boring song that does not match up with the action of the credits. Season 2 episodes of this DVD are actually season 3 and then you get 2 episodes of the 1989 original which should be in the season 1 DVD. I won't be wasting any more of my money until this problem is corrected and the show is put back to it's orginal form."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baywatch - season 2","review":"Baywatch - season 2 is a good series about lifeguards and has good stories and cast.

The music is the first disappointment, and this is not season 2. The episodes are mixed in with a later season. For reasons like this one, I really try to get DVD's from the library. I am so glad I didn't buy this. The picture quality is good to me. Maybe because I am older than when the show originally aired, the show seems slow to me. I have found this with some of the shows I actually bought, like the Dukes of Hazard and Greatest American Hero. They just aren't the same. I rate Baywatch as a 1 because of the changing of the music and because the shows seem like they are in random order."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baywatch - Season 2 DVD","review":"The DVD was shipped very quickly.

The fact that the show is from the 90's isn't an excuse - I've bought DVDs of show from the 60's [some of them \\"colorized\\" B&W;], and they look much better. I agree with all the criticisms about the theme - even if they couldn't get the rights to the original theme, they still could have found something much better.Hopefully when they release the other seasons they'll do a much better job."},{"rating":"1","title":"The big cheat","review":"Don't get me wrong. I love BAywatch, but I simply can't watch the series on dvd. I feel like I just threw money away, like being cheated on. The theme song has been altered, as have the end credits. And as if that wasn't enough, many of the music clips during the episodes, have other songs. It simply doesn't work, as I've come to love the music montages. I want the true show on dvd, with the original music and montages. If shipping to the US weren't so expensive, I'd ship the three season I have straight back to Fremantle. This is not what I paid for. I guess I'll have to buy the German version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full of Feeling","review":"This album has an incredible amount of emotion poured into it. While listening to this album (especially the first 6 songs) you'll feel as if you've been allowed to peek into the hearts of the songs' writers.

You'll re-live losing your first love, the heartbreak of rejection, and the joy of a newfound love. I highly recommend this album to anyone wanting to reminisce about the past and experience these highs and lows all over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"The book did not draw my interest at all and really only felt like I was being tortured trying to read it. I forced myself to read through the whole book hoping that eventually I would find something of value that would then hold my attention but that wasn't the case. The author's words a lot of the time were just \\"mumbo jumbo\\" put together. You do get a little history on Lolita Lebron but you might as well go on Wikipedia which will give you more: in the author's words, she didn't know her grandmother well. Also it was only at the end that I realized why the book was titled \\"A Message from God in the Atomic Age\\" due to the fact that there was no mention earlier in the book and personally not knowing the history of Lolita Lebron.

Yes, its representatives believe that its programs are the best. Many business professionals believe totally in what they sell.

I felt I was right there with the characters, experiencing life as they did. I was sorry to see the story end as I wanted to follow the characters into the next chapter of their lives.I'm curious why a major publishing company hasn't come a-calling.

I hadn't seen it since it appeared on Bravo in the 1980s, so I was very excited when I recently bought it at half price during a Criterion Collection sale. The early scenes of Pip's extraordinary encounter with the prisoner Magwich, family life with his shrewish sister and gentle Joe, and Pip's visits to see Miss Havisham and Estella still grab me in my movie bones. Lean's incredible facility for atmosphere in the foggy English moors, the rotting ship hulks, the graveyard, and Miss Havisham's dreary mansion are still magical. But when Pip grows up, moves to London, and becomes John Mills, the atmosphere recedes, the delightful performance by the actor playing young Pip is of course gone, and Pip's foppish attempts at social climbing are almost too embarrassing to watch. However it's still a great half a movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done classic adaptation of Dickens","review":"This is a well done classic adaptation of Dickens' novel, relatively close to the source (especially when compared to so many other abysmally fantastical 'adaptations'...). The only glaring aberration is the very ending - yes, it makes it 'happy', but in doing so it completely distorts Dickens' vision. While it is disappointing, it does not completely invalidate what comes before...Wonderful black and white cinematography - much to keep an eye on here. Some aspects of the film craft and acting are noticeably dated, but these things do not detract fatally.The Criterion transfer to DVD is quite impressive. Very nicely done, with only one or two imperfections - which by the way are imperfections of the 35mm print, and not of the transfer. For a film of this age, it looks wonderful.If this film is important to you, this is the edition to have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Item received was 3rd-party generic","review":"Item received was a 3rd-party generic and not the Panasonic OEM specified in the listing, which seems to becoming all-to-common place anymore on Amzn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kindle Version","review":"My thoughts on James Joyce tend to vacillate depending on my mood.

They were pulling off Crimson material as well as Belew's solo stuff.Belew played with the verve as if he were in a coliseum with 50,000 screaming fans.During the set the bassist broke a string and while she changed it, Belew went into a solo version of \\"Within You Without You\\" that was mind-blowing.

Then, something happened. The heroine began to act like an idiot. She blames herself for not loving her husband--but he never courted her, was off in Africa or Greece or in the midst of an intrigue. Then she falls in love with him after he dies--neurotic. THEN she ignores the clues from one man and accepts the worst about a man she has no reason NOT to believe and trapses of to Africa with (SPOILER!) the bad guy. WHY didn't she go to Greece as he husband suggested? Never answered. She had little motive for much of what she did, just bounced around from place to place. I really wanted to love this series because I adore historical suspense, but I don't want to spend more money to be so disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really difficult to get through","review":"I thought I would enjoy this book but I found myself skipping and skimming pages just to get it over with. The writing is repetitive and all the characters are impossible to relate to. I would recommend picking up any of Deanna Raybourn's books instead of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Implausible and Inconsistent","review":"If you want to read a romance novel, not a mystery, then you may enjoy this book more than I did. The plot and its resolution defy logic. Worse, the heroine seems to jump back and forth between the centuries in her acceptance and rejection of cultural norms for women. Sometimes she is a Victorian romantic, yet at other times she is a woman of the 21st century in her opinions, decisions, and ideas. It was terribly inconsistent. I know complex characters are unpredictable but this character as well as the storyline just didn't add up for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland and forgettable","review":"I read the Deanna Raybourn books immediately before this one, and Ms. Alexander's effort pales in comparison. Her protagonist is obnoxious with her self-centered musings and deliberate offensiveness. The surrounding characters are one-dimensional and cliched. The villains are easily identified early on. Yet somehow I was compelled to continue reading, so I gave it two stars instead of one. Read Silent in the Grave and Silent in the Sanctuary for a far more interesting take on Victorian society."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be misled; \\"A Novel of Suspense\\" it is not.","review":"I'm amazed at the number of 5 star reviews this novel has received. I can only surmise that these are romanace novel readers as this story really fell short for me. On the cover, under the title, it says \\"A Novel of Suspense.\\" For at least the first half of the book, I couldn't find a lick of suspense. Then when you finally get too some mystery, it's lame, poorly conceived, and, well, lame. The ending is anti-climatic and rather cliche, I think. I would probably give this 2 and 1/2 stars, but since I couldn't, 2 it is. The writing is decent, but the story is disappointing. If you like fluffy romance novels where the heroine is both unbelieveably gorgeous and witty (and always right) and the men dashing, you might like it though."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the dullest books I've ever read","review":"I can't believe how many good reviews I've read. I feel like I read a completely different book. The plot moved like molasses; the characters, and the heroine in particular, were excrutiatingly bland.

No thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of mystery and romance","review":"Lady Emily series what a great read. I'm so glad a friend recommended this series to me. The settings are unique and the personalities well drawn out. Read all the Lady Emily Series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite and predictable","review":"This reads like the work of an amateur novelist who has spent too much time reading Jane Austen and is obviously in love with her own heroine. The pseudo-Victorian writing style and the main character's supposed wit, charm and progressive thinking are very stilted and unbelievable; all of the supporting characters are uninteresting, one-dimensional stock figures; and the \\"mystery\\" itself is implausible and laughably developed. One thing I did enjoy was the inclusion of 19th-century museums and academia, although it was somewhat awkwardly played out, so one extra star for that. On the whole, the entire book is so cliched and formulaic that I actually found myself enjoying how bad it was. This is a good book to read if you're looking for something silly - not in content but in execution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was so excited about reading this book because of the great reviews. I was so disappointed. The heroine was annoying and the \\"intrique\\" wasn't compelling at all.If you're looking for a well-written historical romance, try anything by Madeline Hunter or Lisa Kleypas."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Very Silly Book","review":"I thought that maybe this book would be a much of a fun romp as Deanna Raybourne's Lady Julia books, but frankly I just wanted to spit on this book after finishing it. I gave the book two stars because the plot moves along briskly, but that's about the only positive thing I can say about it. The main character, Emily, is not believable either as a British person (the author is American), or as a historical character. She comes across as a silly, immature girl (who is supposedly the most beautiful, fabulous, and generally attractive girl in the entire world, plus super, super smart)who while not obsessing about her wardrobe gets together with her girlfriends and solves a mystery. I think the author meant to portray Emily as a proto-feminist, but that really falls flat. Maybe a fun read if you're a tweenie, but for me it just seemed shallow and silly, and full of endless whining about Victorian mourning clothes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"A good story in cozy mode.

The concept of a widow falling in love with her husband after he dies is a little weird but I decided to read the book anyway. I have read the \\"glowing\\" reviews on this site several times to inspire me to continue reading the book. Alll to no avail. For the life of me, I cannot see why so many people find this book fascinating. It is boring; it doesn't grip the attention of this reader; Lady Emily is very dull (and so are her \\"friends\\"); there doesn't seem to be a plot. To be frank, I don't think I will finish this novel nor read any more of those written by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down!","review":"It's so exciting when you find a book that is part of a series that you love.

But I'm very glad I took it, because I thoroughly enjoyed this book.

I look forward to more books by Ms. Alexander, particularly those featuring Emily, the headstrong, yet thoroughly charming, heroine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanted to like it","review":"I hate when I have high expecations of a book and get disappointed. It dragged, it was transparent and frankly...boring. I read it to the end even though I pretty much knew from the start who was the evil doer and that drives me nuts. More romance than suspense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"In this book, Lady Emily tries to unravel the mystery surrounding her husband's death on safari in Africa. Ms. Alexander writes that she was interested in portraying the intellectual awakening of a Victorian gentlewoman, while creating characters who were true to their times. Unfortunately, Lady Emily's intellectual excursions stall the narrative and prevent it from developing much suspense. For a woman who is supposed to be clever, Lady Emily often behaves in ways that are tiresomely stupid. And the experienced reader can tell from the first pages which of Lady Emily's gentlemen friends should be trusted and which are trying to deceive her. Even as a romance novel, this book fails to create a romantic hero who truly seems capable of engaging the heroine's heart -- he is just a pretty face."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whirlwind of Victorian Suspense","review":"The subtitle \\"A Novel of Suspense\\" is certainly no lie here. This delightfully Victorian novel whisks the reader into the world of Lady Emily Ashton. Lady Emily is rich, beautiful, and fiercely independent. Her journey takes the reader from London to Paris to Greece, and gives us lively characters and a suspenseful story to intrigue us. It is truly enjoyable to follow Lady Emily as she discovers some wonderful, some starling facts about her dead husband, Philip Ashton, whom she barely knew before he passed away and attempts to discern the puzzle he left behind. The only thing lacking in this book would be in the character of Colin Hargreaves. Although he is a handsome, intelligent man, his character is not as strong as one would hope the suitor of Lady Emily might be. This is altogether an enjoyable book, and the next in the Lady Emily series is definitely on my reading list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet book","review":"It is a sweet story about a woman who loses her husband, whom she is not really in love with.

While I like the look and the fact that it's made of wood, we've had two problems. First, the top of the toy - the red ball - does not screw onto the stand. Hence, it's hard to put aside or away neatly; as soon as it's disturbed, it easily falls and everything comes undone. With a little training, you get used to always picking it up from the base. The real problem is that the pole that holds the rings and is affixed to the base broke! It is held on by some sort of elastic/string device, and it snapped apart from the base. It's so inexpensive that it's not worth the effort to send it back. I may try to screw it together. Most likely, we'll just a buy a different brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 2 and 3 year olds still play with this!","review":"This wooden toy is wonderfully sturdy and colorful, and has retained the attention of my two toddlers for years! The rings are dyed, so there is no chipping paint. The stick is connected to the base with a cloth colored elastic band (hidden inside), so it's less likely to break if a child steps on it or falls on it. We have not had any issues with the band wearing out. This was an exceptionally well-executed toy by Plan Toys.One word of caution: Do be aware that the red wooden ball on top is a danger if thrown. It took a bit of modeling before I convinced my 2 and 3 year old that this was not a ball for throwing. Every now and again, the ball still \\"makes a bad choice\\" and has to be placed in timeout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for young babies","review":"I read all the reviews saying the Plan Toy Stacking Ring was small, but I didn't expect it to be THIS small. It's like a miniature stacking ring. My baby is 7 months and putting all his toys in his mouth, so I liked that it was made of wood and safe dyes. However, being that it is made of wood, most of the rings have wood grains that are not sanded down completely smooth. It's rough around the edges, and can even scratch delicate baby skin and lips. I'm putting this toy away until he's able to play with it without putting in his mouth."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not so sure about this.","review":"This book started out really good then went downhill after 100 pages (about).I just couldn't stick to reading it.

At first I thought it would be your typical \\"chick\\" type book... but it was not at all!!! At the risk of sounding cliche', I must say this book tells a wonderful and inspiring story of love, personal growth, and following your dreams. The NYC references were so fun to read, having lived in NYC myself. The story itself holds a great, positive message, and an interesting twist at the end. I REALLY HOPE to see this come out in a movie! I highly recommend this book!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Written","review":"A book with such a simple theme shouldn't be hard to follow, and yet this book digresses on nearly every page with flashbacks galore.

The storyline is great with tons of hilarous New York details thrown in. You really want these characters to work out their lives and have Lorraine turn into a true princess.

When my husband walked in today and saw me pull it out of the box he actually commented that it was the ugliest purse he had ever seen. For him to comment on something he thought was a woman's accessory item, it has to be pretty darn ugly. The dots aren't white either; they're light pink, just in case anyone is wondering. I'm not sure why the title says they're white when they obviously aren't. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because you can easily fit a lunch...and dinner... in the bag. I guess it will come in handy when I have to bring tupperware lunches (but I usually don't need a bag for a tupperware...).

I usually end up taking my water bottle in hand because my lunch barely fits in the bag.

According to my ruler (a standard, U.S. 12\\"), the bag is 9\\" x 4.5\\" x 7\\". This is significantly smaller than advertised. Why would they not list the actual dimensions? Many food containers are smaller than the bag that I received, so, despite the attractive design, it is not all that useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this bag, but pink dots, not white","review":"I ordered this bag for my daughter and she loved it. She was looking for something to carry her bento lunches in. I liked it so much I ordered one for myself in black. The only thing I would say about it is that the dots on the bag are not white as described, but a light pink. When I looked at the picture on Amazon again after it arived at the house, it appears that the dots are the pink-ish color in their picture. It is a very cute bag, feels like it is nice quality materials, and it's a nice size. Finally!! A stylish lunch bag! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I bought this for my daughter for school and it is very large.

It looks so cute in person. The size of a medium purse.

So cute I'd use as a purse!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall good lunch bag","review":"Really like the look of this bag. Wish it was more functional. If it was a little bigger or the bag would allow for a little give. I usually use pyrex for my lunch and snacks so I have some difficulty with fitting other than the small 1-2 cup containers in it. Using the smaller ones, can usually fit four but then no room for an ice pack. It does the job for getting items to the office but if I need to use it for the day, can't pack much with the need for ice packs."},{"rating":"2","title":"lunch bag envy","review":"My wife has had so many positive comments about her lunch bag! she loves it, it is high quality, and I recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works ok-- too big to use for daily lunch","review":"It's a decent enough bag-- works as advertised more or less. Put it in the refrigerator for a few minutes to get it cold and it will keep your lunch moderately cold. The only real downsize is that it's very large-- far too big to simply bring your lunch into work every day. It's more for bringing a week's worth of lunches into work. I'm sure that works for some folks, but it wasn't for my wife, so we sent it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fashionable Lunch Bag","review":"The Sachi Fashion Insulate Lunch Bag, Black Quilted was exactly what I needed. It doesn't look like I'm off to class in grade school and the insulation makes carrying food in fluctuating weather an ease.

It is a great purchase and good value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I love this bag! I have to admit, I bought it to \\"cheat\\".

It is so cute and nice and big to fit those big tupperware containers in it. I love the little mesh pocket that is on the inside for utensils. I also really like the front and side pockets so I can put all my work stuff in there like my badge, chapstick, and phone. The only thing I don't like is the long shoulder strap, I think how they placed it isn't that cute, and looks kinda goofy. They have it connecting to the rings for the wrist/hand handles. I think it would have looked better with two rings on the small sides of the bag. But that is just me. Overall a super cute lunch box that my mom is super jealous of ;) Looks like a cute purse instead of the standard boxy lunch box."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice little bag","review":"This is a well-constructed lunch bag.

It would be nice of it were wider on the bottom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute but Too Small!","review":"Yes, the bag is very cute, but what good is it when you can't fit much in it? I have other Sachi bags that I carry every day. This one gets zero use because I can't fit anything more than a sandwich and a small bottle of water in it. There's no room for tupperware items. Even a banana gets smooshed. I would say... don't bother with this bag, and look for one of their larger models."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big enough!","review":"I was a bit wary reading how some people thought this wasn't big enough. Well, they must be eating too much or packing all 3 meals! I think it's a bit too big actually. Perfect for storage containers. For a sandwich and chips and drink, you have lots of room. I try to have it double as a purse on those days. ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"This lunch bag is exactly what I was looking for. It's cute and holds a lot of stuff.

There are enough color and fabric choices to please everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow waters","review":"A great idea: to base a project around a liquid water theme in an ambient genre. I didn't know what to expect but I expected more than this. Uninspired hollow mechanical flowing & dripping hydro-sounds with sophomoric reprocessed background electronica leave you thirsty for more.

Buck hunted from the time the aircraft landed until he took off again; something like 6 weeks. The thing that struck me the most was the fact that he didn't do a thing that I couldn't do, and I found that very compelling. I am almost 54, and I could do that. A step slower perhaps, but I could do it. The folks who have reviewed this video and feel like there is not enough hunting have missed the point. This video is all hunting, and very little killing. Hunting is a process and the end result is a successful kill. The kill is a very small part of the hunt, and the really fun part is being out there for the hunt. Buck did it right and I can't wait to see the \\"1000 Miles Alone\\" video!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I really wanted to like it...","review":"The previous reviews had me believe that this movie would be full of great scenery (no real hunting) and great photography of Alaska. The photography is only slightly better then a home movie. A lot of out of focus shots, and he shakes a lot too. A tripod would of helped! I would not buy this movie if I had the opportunity to view it first. I wanted to like it .... but it was not well filmed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just What I Needed!!","review":"I said a prayer two days ago, and asked for a book that explained anatomy in simple terms that I understand, and then, I walked into the college bookstore and saw this. First of all, ANYTHING by Mosby would be purchased by me, and this is no exception! Now, this is a small, compact book that you can carry anywhere, to the supermarket, on the train, even to class rather than the large textbooks that are also needed. While much more of the information may be in the text, this is a great supplement, because anything that you need to add, there is room on many of the pages to include your own notes.

At best, this product might be worth $20! The motor is very weak -does not have a lot of power, especially when the battery is low.

Was the surrender and capture - at the war's end - of the U-234 another attempt to do just that?It's hard to say and the author provides absolutely no documentation to support a word of his theory.

Ellis provides ample texture and tangential history to flesh out the timelines. Following the royal lines brings focus to a lot of the loose ends and myths that have plagued my grasp of Irish history.

A little slow in the middle but still very, very good. This is a different book for Georgette Heyer. More true to life than many of her romances so it has sad moments. But it ends happily and is a beautiful love story. In a lot of ways it's much better literature than most of her romances. Georgette Heyer once again shows her amazing ability to master any genre. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Getting there","review":"In this accomplished novel Georgette Heyer displays some of the qualities which she later displayed in her acclaimed Regency stories. She paints the painful transition from pre WWI to post war England with a poignancy which rings exceptionally true, probably because she lived through that period, and yet she manages to bring to life a number of joyous and vibrant characters and to bring the book to a triumphant conclusion."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good find","review":"This is a very good read if you can find it.

He offers several far out theories on Ruess' disappearance, but nothing useful except for the names of several persons who might have absconded with Ruess' possessions but never capitalized on them.

The unit does what it says and if you read the manual you will not have one problem at all.

I have checked many different options, I read the reviews on all kinda different systems and decided to get this one. Not to offend anyone, but this is by far the easiest system to program and install. I mean they go step by step on what to do and how to do it, you just can't go wrong. I don't see anyone not being able to get it all togiether, it is easy. The motion detectors are very sensitive and can go off the second you are in the view (from accross the living room) I am impressed. I don't have any false alarms. I have even bought more door/window sensors and one more motion sensor (total of 8 door/window sensors and 2 motion sensors) I was able to program them to the main unit and they work just fine. I strongly recommand this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to set-up.

Based on interviews, the book is peppered with quotes. This is not a fawning fan's account, although Parker is a fan he tells the story straight and shows the often negative ugly side of Rollins, his insight into the man and the music scene surrounding him can border on profound. A lot of time and detail is spent on the Black Flag years and reveals the personalities of the other band members making this a great companion to \\"Get In The Van\\", [a collection of photographs and Rollin's journal entries of those years]. Surprises are revealed, like a brief period of heavy LSD use by the straight-edge Rollins. If you ever wondered what made Rollins the unique intense person he is, this book will answer a lot of questions. A worthy often brilliant account of the early hardcore scene and its most fascinating survivor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerhouse of a Bio","review":"James Parker's biography of Rollins is incredibly informative. We follow Henry's odyssey from DC to LA, and from the primal brutality of Black Flag to the more sophisticated dynamics of the spoken word scene. Rollins emerges as an intense and challenging man (though he does sometimes resemble David Lynch's comic-strip \\"The Angriest Dog in the World\\"). From the bloody stage to the bedside reading, this book's got it all --a must for any true Rollins fan. The best part: hearing about those salad days of punk, when it was a community, not a commodity."},{"rating":"2","title":"I put it down several times ....","review":"... but only to get up and slip another Black Flag cd into the stereo. This is a barnstormingly passionate celebration of music, so visceral you feel you're in the scummy clubs being battered by the serious sounds. Some of the writing is great, some is ludicrously florid, most of it is both. I had a great time."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book should be subtitled: A biography of Black Flag","review":"I bought this book thinking I would get more insight into Henry Rollins, not just a history of the DC punk scene, followed by a detailed history of Black Flag. There is very little said in this book about Rollins that a fan doesn't already know from attending his spoken word shows. You get about 20-30 pages of the time period covering 1961 to 1980, then ~230 pages covering 1980-1986, with the chapter last of the book glossing over 1986-1998. I felt the book rambled along at times and I was tempted to toss it aside. I thought after reading the other reviews that this book was going to be so much better than it was. The bottom line: I would spend my money on another Rollins spoken word DVD instead of buying this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"turned off!","review":"This could have been pure class but the book tripped up and fell flat on its face. Basically this is a ask-peole-who-say-they-know-rollins-biography. Seems the people who were asked were from pre-Black Flag days and I would doubt if Rollins associates with them any more. The only cool moments were the drop-rollins-in-it parts about the man rolling around on the floor on glass shards and taking some dodgy chemicals cunningly stored in an eye-drops bottle... A part from that, there are no kicking-ass moments here. Unless you like the tedium of hearing the ins and outs of the long gone DC punk scene don't buy this. Instead, for some night-churning, fist clenching, manic depression, buy Black Coffee Blues (Part one) or Solipsist!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Screen Poker - Big Fun","review":"This game is fun-fun-fun.

It allows you to let a big win ride on the next hand, but if you lose that hand, the game doesn't subtract the loss from your point total. It also awards 100 bonus points after three consecutive wins, which happens more often than you might think; plus, if you win the next hand after that, you get 100 more bonus points, and so on as long as you keep winning. These two factors make it way too easy to rack up points, and that takes most of the fun out of playing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bigger than I thought","review":"They are indeed pretty big. Make sure to pay attention to dimensions posted in the listing. You might not necessarry want something this large on your desktop.

Defintely better than those little Amazon shipping cardboard boxes I used in their place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite as advertized","review":"Best I can tell these are just pressed wood..not a high quality material. Also, if you look at the photo, you'll see 'pin legs' to isolate the speaker/stand from the desk or table. Those were not included although the holes for them are there. They did send some rubber feet..adhesive but will peal off. The edges of almost every component have been damaged or discolored.One of the legs of each unit has a channel for the speaker wire. That maybe would be okay if you were driving regular speakers. But if you're using powered speakers you're out of luck. The hole in the bottom plate is too small to put an xlr or even an rca connector through and of course you couldn't thread it through the channel anyway since they are wire stapled.They work and I'll keep and use them but don't expect much for quality or accuracy.

Instead, I put a different head off an old desk lamp on this arm and discarded the original head to try and make use of at least part of this thing.You'd be better off to find an old Vemco (VemcoLite, made in the USA). You'll pay more ($100-150) for a used lamp that's 20 years old but if you can find a nice one you'll be far ahead.

I was looking for, and found, music that fuses western \\"rock\\" with Indian instruments and tempo. The music is great, though sometimes it definitely lets you know it was recorded in the mid-80s (think: drum machine).Batish really excels where the music begins to depart from the standard western rock tempo and moves into Indian beats and rhythms but just stopping short of ragas.One negative comment: the recording sound level leaves a bit to be desired. In fact, on one or two songs the overall input/output goes down so much that you think it's just fading to the end of the song, but then keeps going. It's as if someone were trying to compensate for the natural crescendos in the music by decreasing the input levels. This is why the album got only four stars. Perhaps Batish will one day remaster the album and address this.All in all, if you're looking to explore this medium, buy this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lose your Love Handles","review":"Mr. Shilstone became famous for training atheletes and in particular helping them GAIN weight.

Unfortunately, this was not an upgrade and more unfortunately, I gave my old Immersion blender away so now I am stuck with a weak sleek version. The handheld blender cannot make smoothies like my old one did and just chops the fruits and veggies instead of pureeing them. I can hear the motor struggling to do what my old version just did with ease. It is nice to have the whisk attachment but I really just wish I had my old handheld blender and bought a separate whisk which would have been much cheaper.

I feel like it is advertised as something that works great for a variety of tasks. This is not that product. It works pretty good as an immersion blender, but does get hot after a bit of use. The whisk attachment is extremely flimsy and is only good for light blending, nothing thick like cookie dough.

Lots of '80's power ballads and silly pantomime by the lead had me thinking \\"School of Rock\\". Perhaps just taking a little bit from that nostalgic rock formula in a \\"Guitar Hero\\" world.George Lopez plays a great Federal Agent and has one of the funniest lines near the beginning of the movie. Christopher Walken is always funny when he plays the menacing bad guy with a sense of humor, combining his work on \\"True Romance\\" and \\"Envy\\" to create a very funny character. Patton Oswald has a funny bit part, and is one of the funniest parts of the movie.It's a good movie and will bring chuckles to those who are open to silly laughs.

I was hoping that it would at least be enjoyable, but it almost is a waste of time. This is definitely one of those movies where the best scenes are shown in the trailers. So, if you have seen the trailers, you have seen the best parts of the movie. The rest of the movie is a thing where you smile at best, there never is a bust-a-gut laughing moment. Such a sad thing to admit, because I love Christopher Walken as an actor. He is always interesting to watch, but even he is kind of dull in Balls of Fury.

The plot, which is barely worth detailing here, involves a has-been table tennis champion (Dan Fogler) hired by the F.B.I. to infiltrate a ping pong tournament (a literal \\"death match\\") being hosted by a notorious underworld kingpin (played to the hilt by the one and only Christopher Walken). George Lopez, James Hong, and Diedrich Bader (\\"The Drew Carey Show\\") round out the likable cast.Despite a handful of laugh-out-loud moments and an air of genuine sweetness, there's no compelling reason to recommend \\"Balls of Fury,\\" aside from Walken\`s campy performance.

It would probably help if you were drunk or stoned while you watch this film I'm guessing. Pretty much if you seen the trailers on TV advertising this film, you've seen the best of it. Too bad it's PG-13, Cathy Shim is captivating but only a little because of the PG-13 limitations.

Instead, seriously consider the city maps by Berndtson. I have used their maps in several European cities, they are a lot larger though still, when folded, as compact as the Streetwise one, they are easy to use, well-marked and detailed, and also laminated (the Streetwise map is laminated too, but that does not make up for its other probelms.)I have also used Hammond city maps in Europe and found them quite good too.

If they would have come out now, they would have taken over the planet. They were definitely a band before their time. Scene Creamers feature two members from The Make-Up: Ian Svenonius and Michelle Mae. They recently played in American without much advance warning. Ian Svenonius is the most talented white soul man who could share a stage with James Brown. There have been other fakers like James Chance, but Ian is the real deal.

Don't see how this could be water proof if you can feel the wind thru the stitching holes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazingly sharp","review":"Until recently, I used a fancy German stainless steel paring knife. It used to work OK but in the past few years, it refused to stay sharp. It was never sharp enough, even though I'd frequently use a sharpening steel on it. I even had it professionally sharpened, but it quickly got dull again. Because I used it often, this got frustrating (and dull knives are dangerous), so I looked for an alternative.This Kyocera ceramic knife is amazingly sharp. It easily slices a tomato without having to poke the skin first (good thing, because the knife has a blunt tip). It even cuts through banana peels from the outside (I cut them up before composting). It lets me make thinner slices and handles well. The blade already has some minor staining (not a problem with stainless steel), and as others have pointed out, it's not to be used to smash garlic, but those are minor points. It cuts very well, and that's what a knife is for. Kudos, Kyocera!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic knife, best ceramic out there!","review":"This is my second ceramic knife. First one (generic brand) is comparatively dull, and gets little use.This one is like a razor! And has stayed like this for over a year! It really is shockingly sharp.

Highly recommended, you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Sharp","review":"I won't go near this thing (not even to wash it) but my husband says it's the best knife ever for everything."},{"rating":"1","title":"head set","review":"This headset is garbage.

The price seems to have doubled and the quality halved. I can hear other callers crystal clear. The problem is this: they keep saying, \\"What? What? I can't hear you.

We knew of Haba because of a wooden block set we had bought my daughter, so we expected this product to be high-quality. We were not disappointed.This toy is beautifully made and safe, unlike all the toxic plastic junk that is on the market nowadays. The colors are bright and the large, smooth wooden beads are the perfect size for grasping. Our son loves to shake it around and the noise it makes is actually pretty pleasing. He loves to look at it, pass it from hand to hand, and, of course, chew on it. Yes, it's pricier than your average plastic baby toy, but see my above comment about the nature of these toys. The true test, though, is what the baby thinks, and this one is one of his favorites. We like it so much that I plan on purchasing more of these for some expectant friends and relatives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paint comes off big time","review":"I try to buy wooden/European made toys for my baby to avoid all the toxic junk out there.

Yes, I know the paint is supposed to be non-toxic, but what kind of quality is it, anyway? This is something I would expect from cheap Chinese-made junk, not from expensive toys made by a supposedly reputable German company. I had the same problem with Haba's Kringelring.

Lie to Me is loosely based on the real life work of psychologist Paul Ekman. I studied some of Ekman's work and read one of his books. I believe this show is very interesting and as true as it can be to deception expert training. I loved the real life footage they show from time to time to mirror the actor's micro-expression. Fascinating work. This show is a mix of fiction and non-fiction and it's quite a nice break from \\"reality\\" TV."},{"rating":"2","title":"An original and clever series","review":"This is the best new crime procedural series to come along in years! Tim Roth is great as a specialist in body language, helping to solve crimes simply by watching how people react and talk. The crimes themselves are interesting too, with some clever plot twists included. The main characters are engaging and interact well. My one tiny complaint is that at times I have trouble understanding Tim Roth because of his accent, but that is very minor. I can't wait for the DVD, and I hope it will include some interesting background on the science of body language."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a powerful and interesting show.","review":"I LOVE watching this show. There are several reasons I watch it, but I will disclaim that I am a mystery/thriller junkie. However, this show is not your average Mystery show. The \\"mystery\\" lies in human nature. THAT is the real reason that this show is so popular and also so powerful. It opens one eyes to fact that we all lie but the reasons why and the way we do it can be life or death depending on the situation, SINCE not all lies are \\"LITTLE\\", some are powerful lies that seem little to us but can be a Huge deal to someone else. AND this television show deals with the biggest way we all lie, our body language/facial expressions. YES, that is the how we give away our dishonesty most of the time, more by what we do and how we look when we do it than anything we say."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm hooked","review":"I've just watched 4 episodes so far but I'm addicted.

Ekman is considered as one of the 100 most eminent psychologists of the last century. He proved what Darwin claimed centuries ago by studying several year tribes in Papua New Guinea: facial expressions associated with some emotions are basic or biologically universal to all humans (source: Wikipedia).In the special feature, Dr. Ekman says something I can support 100%: the series explains many important aspects of human emotions in a couple of seconds while it takes you hours to understand it while reading a book. The makers of Lie to Me did an outstanding job in explaining microexpressions to the audience (including those who had never heard of it)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Series Lie to Me","review":"I love, love this series.

Try me!","review":"The truth appears no matter you avoid to show it. Based on Paul Ekman's works this first season was an exceptional release that shocked the audiences. First at all, Cal Lightman's enigmatic and overwhelming personality captures the whole attention, his role as investigator, his problematic relationship with his daughter, his affectice relations with his ex as well the rest of the cast who feels for him a visible admiration and encountered emotions.Dislike the other competition series, you won't be forced to watch violent scenes and repeated scripts of rape, murder or great heists.

If you like the show (as many do) you will be fine with the DVD. I was referred to this item because I had gotten the Mentalist. This show is much more over the top with the references to reading expressions etc which is all the ability the main character needs to figure things out so the plot feels to me more like a succession of tricks than actual plot. I find the main character annoying, and the rivalry between the main character and the \\"natural\\" untrained character trite.

Glad I didn't pay a lot for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as Swimming","review":"This book was not nearly as good as her first novel, Swimming. While I was captivated by the first part of the novel, the second half fell flat as the characters did not develop any further. I felt that the explanations were unsatisfactory and did not feel a level of completeness or understanding that I was looking for."},{"rating":"2","title":"well done, but a bit repetitive","review":"I enjoyed this read a lot (after a slow start) but I was slightly disappointed to see Hershon revisit the same exact territory she dealt with in Swimming. Superficial details have changed, but she follows the same formula: a main character's life is defined by a family trauma from years ago, she searches for an estranged brother- who she has an intense, near obsessive love for- in order to find out \\"what really happened\\", and once she finds closure, she is finally able to become emotionally available and present in her own life. It worked, but for anyone who read her first book, it will no doubt feel familliar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay outside of this one","review":"I plodded along, trying to get interested, but quit half way through. I simply didn't like any of these people. The author couldn't make up her mind whose POV to use, her own or Alice's. In one scene, Alice is hiding from everyone else at the picnic, but she still hears conversations, while the people she's observing are from another pov (the author's). Also a mess of pronoun confusion: \\"her\\" and \\"his\\" and \\"their\\" could mean any one of several people within a sentence or paragraph."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little Tykes Piano","review":"Not what I expected. Much too small for an eleven month old. The piano doesn't make a sound unless you pound the keys hard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple but fun!","review":"My son received two different piano-type toys at the same time, this and an alligator-shaped xylophone. Although he's not thrilled with the alligator, he loves this toy! From 9 months on, he has sat next to his little piano and banged away at it, often for 10 minutes or more at a time. His older sister (age 10) has kept him entertained with it even longer, as she's tried to show him how to play individual notes. There are only two disappointing aspects to this toy. First, I wish there were more notes (6 to 8 would be great). Second, since my son learned to stand and walk, he has taken to using this toy as a step-stool so now we have to keep it put away unless he's specifically sitting down to play with it. For babies who aren't standing yet, I must say this is a great, basic toy that will keep them entertained while giving them the fun of making music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple, But Good","review":"When my now 4yo son was only 2, we used this toy for more than just a musical toy. He of course loved to bang on the keys and hear his creations but we also used it for color recognition. We would call out the color and he would tap the key of that color. It helped him learn those four colors! I think it is a simple toy but it really is a good one. My 18 month old now loves playing with it and is starting to be able to recognize the colors on it, too! Good investment if you are looking for a fun toy for your baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy, small babies will enjoy","review":"I haven't actually purchased this toy but my 6-month old daugther plays with it a lot at daycare. It seems to be her favorite toy there and I often leave her in the morning banging on the four keys too busy to notice anything else. It is a great early piano as it is easy to manipulate; the keys are wide enough for babies who are still working on hand coordination to target specific keys. Given that my baby loves it so much, I would give this toy five stars. I have come to the conclusion that baby reactions are the best way to evaluate any toys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for our 9 month old","review":"We got this toy for our 9 month old, who really lights up when music is turned out. She has loved it since the moment we got it out of the box. It doesn't bother her that there are only 4 keys, and since we couldn't find the 8 key piano, this is just fine. It's really lightweight and super-durable. She can toss it around and tries to bite it, but it keeps on playing. I'm especially happy to have a toy that doesn't require batteries. Since this is our first child, we hope to keep it around for many years to come!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Total junk","review":"Total junk.

But I would have paid alot more knowing how much my almost 9-month old son enjoys this.

If you believe that your child may be suffering from Autism, you OWE it to your child to read this book. If your pediatrician trys to discourage you, DO NOT LISTEN.

It truly has been a life saver for my family.The book is extremely well written and despite the material, Karyn makes it enjoyable to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"science for the real world","review":"Quite frankly, this book is a marvel. It is not about a Ph.D. thesis on autism, nor about advertising the one or other \\"solution\\" to the problem. It is not about expensive therapies, or \\"miracle drugs\\". It is about understanding. It is about everybody's autistic child, and helping to understand the possible and scientifically detectable biochemical problems such a child might carry deep inside, hidden behind all those well known symptoms that have been described so eloquently in so many books before. It is not meant to be the holy bible in autism research. But it is about rational approaches, and yes, science, and here most importantly about fairly affordable possible solutions. Both of which are for the real world. Now nobody can say he or she didn't know. A book like this on autism has been long overdue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This book was informative and inspiring. A great resource for parents and caregivers exploring GF and DF diets.

More than this it helped me understand better the resources available to my son, and where to start looking for ways to help. I strongly recommend this book to anyone recently diagnosed and needing information. This may not be the cure all for Autism, but it sure gives us the chance to TRY to DO something to fight it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Truth Has Been Revealed!","review":"The information this book provided has changed my entire outlook on ASD's.

We had participated in the tests and investigations trying to isolate and identify the developmental delays in his growth. With this book I felt the kindred frustration trying to understand my child's problem, and anxiety over his future. More important than sympathetic experiences, she writes as a guide and a tutor for a parent's quest to help attack the problems and causes of autism.This is a wonderful book, well-written, and an excellant introduction into many of the complicated and controversial issues associated with autism and the research identifying the possible causes of this spectrum of disorders.I strongly recommend Karyn Seroussi's book for all parents facing the trials of raising a child diagnosed with autism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another book I didn't understand","review":"This is just another book that I didn't understand. I read part of it and just gave up. Trying to unravel this book was crazy. I have a child with autism and have NEVER really done any research. I just don't think that way. I am more of a follower than a leader. I usually listen to what others are doing and try that. If I hear about something else I try that instead. I haven't found the right fit yet. But maybe someday I will."},{"rating":"1","title":"Primary focus is diet and food allergies","review":"This book starts out as an interesting study of autism and one mother's struggle but very quickly deteriorates wholly into food allergies and diet as a cure. Read this book only if you are interested in these issues - not if you are interested in autism in general."},{"rating":"1","title":"author somewhat arrogant","review":"I agree with a few other reviewers who said she insisted the diet was a cure all for autism. She did mention ABA therapy but only slightly. She also came across rather arrogant in her views that if parents do not try this diet they have failed their child. I admit the diet does help but it is not a gauratee for every child. This author over emphasizes diet and under emphasizes therapy. What helps as much, if not more so, is lots of therapy, early intervention and the somewhat tedious but effective ABA therapy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this book!","review":"...I think every pediatrician in the world should be made to read this incredible book before telling one more parent that their child's autism can't be cured. It CAN! And every parent of an autistic child should read this book before another unecessary day of suffering goes by.There's no drug company that can get rich from this because there's no \\"miracle drug\\" involved, so you're not seeing it promoted. Ms. Seroussi has figured out how to rid a child of this nightmare just by changing his diet. This is nothing short of miraculous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learning trouble, mild PDD and even whinning children","review":"This book answered so many questions I had about children that would not be considered even remotely autistic. It has helped solve so many behavioral problems with my children. Whinning has disappeared, maturity levels have increased, and a generel \\"brain fog\\" has lifted.When I first picked the book up, I was prepared to force myself to \\"get through it\\". I do not enjoy reading clinical material. This book was not what I expected at all. It was actually a real page turner! I had trouble putting it down at night because I was so excited about what I find on the next page.If your child falls anywhere on the spectrum, from AD(H)D to PDD or autism, this in an extremely valuable book.

It looks like someone used free clipart and a home computer to put together the video. The counting portion is confusing.

But I wanted to go on the cheaper end to found this item to fight fine lines as well moisturize and protect. This eye cream doesn't absorb as well as I had hoped. Also, it has a little tint, that minimally helps to cover up under eye circles. The downside to this cream is sometimes during warmer weather, it will bunch up and leave behind creases beneath your eyes. To me, it's a light weight under eye concealer (try to use a primer first).

I have to admit I am disappointed. The cream has tiny bits of silica, which gives it a sheen to skin when applied.

The mind-numbing detail and philosophical navel-gazing killed any interest I brought to the table.For a good example of my perception of the problem, read the excerpt available in 'search inside the book,' which features page 1 of Chapter 1, Mourning.

Roman Holiday is the movie that started it all for Hepburn, and you'll see why. This is one of those movies that you can just escape in... it brings you into a fun, safe, playful world. Hepburn and Peck are a perfect romantic match in this classic movie. I whole heartedly recommend this film to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Two Great Stars","review":"Two great stars in a Wilder movie that is a Classic. Gregory peck told Wilder that she should have star billing just under him vice co-star status as she would probably win a Oscar. Audrey Hepburn won an Oscar in her first role. You must see this movie to feel the love they shared in \\"The Roman Holiday\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh&Cry","review":"I love this movie.

This is a feel good movie with Audrey Hepburn in her first staring role."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic","review":"THis movie is a classic. It may be a little slow for modern movie goers but if youstick with it you get t aweet love story that has no happy ending and the lesson that sometimes duty is more important than oneself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic romantic comedy even if you're not into classics","review":"I'm not a huge fan of classic movies, can take them or leave them, but came across this one night late and Audrey's brightness (that woman had screen presence) caught my eye. Ended up staying up to watch it and have since bought the VHS and now the dvd to show others.Point being, this is an excellent comedy and in my opinion Audrey's best work. Breakfast at Tiffany's gets more attention, but in my opinion this movie is where Ms. Hepburn REALLY shined. It's a cute romance, much comedy and excellent acting. Guaranteed, you won't dislike this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real Roman Holiday","review":"This romance-comedy story is by far the most romantic and classic fairy tale I have ever seen. It is delightful and delicate as a flower. Beautiful scenes. When are they going to release it in color and dvd? Audrey and Gregory have the magical chemistry that makes this movie everyone's favorite.A must to see and treasure by young and old audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, but why full screen?","review":"I love this movie, and that's why I was disappointed when I went to watch it and found that it was in full screen format.I suppose it's my fault for not looking carefully enough at the info here, but I assumed that the \\"Special Collector's Edition\\" would be in widescreen - special editions are almost always in widescreen (at least, I've never found or bought one that wasn't).And what would possess them to chop off part of the screen for a film that has such excellent cinematography of Rome? The movie begs to be in theatrical form.OK, I'm done whining. Just know that if you buy this version, it's full screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This is a classic movie, and I'm so glad I own it now (: it arrived on time, in mint condition.

This film encouraged my uncle to become a reporter!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun classic","review":"This movie is about a princess on a good will tour who has had enough pomp and decides to escape her responsibilities and rigid schedule to see and experience for herself how the common people live. My favorite scene in the movie is when Gregory Peck puts his hand inside the Mouth of Truth [...] and pretends he can't get it out. According to Hollywood legend, he really fooled and frightened Audrey, but they kept it in the movie.Wonderful, bittersweet ending. I enjoy and prefer watching onscreen characters take \\"the high road\\" instead of cheating or searching for loopholes. Refreshing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Roman Holiday","review":"Just what my wife wanted!, Don't have anything else to say, except that this is what my wife wanted, so I bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"All in all, a bittersweet romance classic.","review":"By far, \\"Roman Holiday\\" is the most romantic comedy and unlike any movie of its kind that I have seen, even today. The wonderful casts and the ironic plot are a topper. Gregory Peck was charming; and no one can forget Audrey Hepburn who was lovelier than spring when she smiles, but winter when she cried. When Gregory Peck lifted Audrey Hepburn from the fountain -- I said, \\"Let the adventures begin.\\" And the movie proved itself. I sort of cursed William Wyler, the brilliant director, for chosen the bitter ending instead of a happy ending, but later on I kind of understand why he did what he had to. There's no getting around this movie. \\"Roman Holiday\\" is the best of the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"WRONG INFORMATION","review":"I ordered this version because in Amazon it specifies that it has English and Spanish subtitles. Wrong. I had to open it since it only specified English subtitles in the dvd package, and correct, it doesn't have them in Spanish. Now I can't return it since it's open. I needed it that way for my 70 years old uncle, he wanted it for Christmas. I have to look for it again, pay more, and maybe order more dvds to get free shipping.Roman Holiday"},{"rating":"2","title":"Most enjoyable.....","review":"I am quickly becoming a fan of Audrey's.

A lovely story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Barber Cuts In.","review":"When your feeling down and you don't know what to watch, put this film in your video. It will make you laugh, it will make you cry, but most of all you'll have a warm content feeling inside. I can't believe there could be a better pairing than Hepburn & Peck. They play their respective parts perfectly and most all, they're totally believable. This story has charm, this film has panache, the set design and costume design are second to none. Please watch it with delight, this is undoubtly my number one all time romance.

Simply that you will allow yourself to be carried away to a simpler more serene time of movie making magic. I watched this film years ago, yet when I finally got to visit the eternal city of Rome myself, I sought out the Mouth of Truth shown in the movie, so that I could reenact with my wife the moment between Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck. Call me a Sap, but I love these old Hollywood Gems that leave that happy, yet melancholy feeling deep within you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Princess Audrey","review":"On the back cover it has a wonderful quote showing how much Audrey's character, Princess Ann, was a Cinderella.\\"At midnight, I'll turn into a pumpkin and drive away in my glass slipper.\\"Her \\"slipper\\" being the 1948 Fiat 500 B 'Topolino'. Having everyone jammed inside this was quite funny. Especially seeing tall Gregory Peck go inside this small little car. The movieWhen In Romemust have been inspired because they did the same thing.Audrey Hepburn really did deserve this award. I thought she performed quite well as the Princess who just wanted a normal life.I very much recommend this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"The strainer arrived with the smaller holes at the bottom of the strainer sealed. I had to open them with an awl. And the larger drain slots along the sides are *way* too big. Most pasta flows right through the side.

Here are some of its many shortcomings: 1. There are NO instructions, and NO HELP FILES, (your only recourse is to navigate the hard-to-use Veritas web site) 2. It does not remember what files you backed-up, so you have to go through the laborious process of selecting what files to back-up EACH TIME you use the program), 3. There is no way to back-up only those files that have recently changed (incremental); this makes it impractical to use as a daily backup. 4. You have no control over compression, 5. Technical Support at Veritas is pay-as-you-go. 6. There is no way to display what files you have backed-up. This program makes clunky old Microsoft Backup look like a jewel."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING -","review":"This product does NOT allow you to transfer the system back-up from one hard-drive to another (you will get an error message when you try).If you buy a Hewlett-Packard burner with this back-up software because you have to replace a bad hard-drive on a lap-top (as I did), you're in for a very unpleasant surprise. The manufacturer doesn't trumpet this limitation, and even the people over at HP tech seemed unaware of it. Brilliant. And, by the way the overall documentation provided by these people really is shameful, even by this industry's abysmal standards."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far my favorite of her albums","review":"Rokia is an incredible artist.

Nice quiet toy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Smaller than you Think but a great toy.","review":"I purchased this toy for my nephew who is 5 months old. It is very well made and brightly colored. The only gripe I have is that the toy is much smaller than I originally thought. It is no bigger than the palm of my hand. I thought it would be bigger than that. After finding that it was smaller than I expected I questioned the price, but the quality is excellent so I am happy with it. These make better stocking stuffers for Christmas than an actual \\"big gift\\" for a child."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple Yet Fun","review":"My 8 month old daughter likes to teethe on this toy. She hasn't figured out how to manipulate it into different shapes / patterns yet. My husband and I have probably played with it more than her. I think the interest will come with age. It is not made in China so we feel a little better about it being used as a teether."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Baby Fun","review":"I bought this toy for my 6 month old daughter. It is a great product she loves the colors and the noises she can make when she shakes it. It is even fun for the parents.I am just so glad I could find a toy not made in China. I did hear a rumor that some toys that are marked \\"made in Germany\\" can be products that were actually in China. I am just going to trust that they weren't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Want to like it... but it pinches!","review":"I bought this about a month ago for my 4 month old to teeth on. It's cool looking and well-made. However, out of curiosity I nibbled on it with my lips to see what it felt like to my baby, and it pinched my lip between the triangles. I really wanted to love this since it was pricey and so cute, however I don't need to aggravate my teething baby with something that's supposed to soothe her. Oh well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paint comes off","review":"This toy has been in our home for only a couple of months and after minimal play (because our then 7 month old was never very interested in it), the blue paint is already coming off. We stopped letting our baby play with the toy because our 3 year old niece got her finger stuck in it and started crying hysterically within 1 minute of starting to play with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute","review":"Cute for any art fanatics. They come with fun facts about each artist, but the figurines are VERY small. I don't take them out of the case because I think I'll lose them, they're so small! Because of the size, they might be a tad over priced, but overall very original, so I like them."},{"rating":"2","title":"My son loves this video.","review":"My savante, peacenik kid made me watch it. I must admit, a little riveting. I even stayed awake and learned something. Good stuff. I might even have to admit I am a little hooked! I am more Noah's Ark than all this, but it was definitely a cool, educational show. I think it is well worth purchasing."},{"rating":"2","title":"they sound good too","review":"This is a short little book but it has been tremendously useful for me. Most arpeggios books focus on one-note-per-string arpeggios or fixed position arpeggios. All of the arpeggios found here move horizontally across the fretboard in repeating patterns, making them easier to incorporate into your playing and much more useful during improvisation. I rely on these arpeggios all the time. This is a great book.I also want to add that the arpeggios in this book are all alternate picked. I've come across some arpeggio books that rely heavily on legato techniques."},{"rating":"1","title":"great video but","review":"This video is amazing but don't pay 125 for it!

This cd is chock full of that. But I am really dissapointed with the song lengths, I like my trance songs to last a minimum of 6 minutes, 8 minutes being better. But on this cd, most of the songs are under 4 minutes!! So just as I am starting to really get into a song, it's over. I feel like this is more like a sample cd then a real one. I don't think I will buy Best of Trance cd's again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Female Vocalist Trance at its most tasteful","review":"If you're into solid trance with killer bass and great vocals(is it really trance if it's vocal??) then this cd is perfect for your taste. Awesome songs from the likes of 4 strings, etc. This is the best vocal trance you can get your hands on. I'm not big into vocal crowned songs, but this cd entices me greatly and i have got to give it a very good rating. Drawbacks are, as other reviews will tell you, some cheese when it came to the vocals, but the rest of the beats and overall performance of the album is great(skip the opera trance, it's murder to even listen to hear class culture mixed with high energy club culture- it's like mixing a bad drink of fine wine and red bull)but enjoy the rest of this delightful cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pop candy, lack of creativity and depth","review":"The short lenghts of the tracks, the silly lyrics, the oversymplified melodic hooks. It is just a bunch of easy NRJ radio recepies. This is not Trance, it is pop electronica for teenagers. I expect Trance to take my hand and make me dream, take me somewhere. This cd just bores me with its over-used tracks with easy remixes. I was expecting fruit nectar and I end up with diluted kool-aid. Just leave it for the kids, it is still a good alternative for Jessica Simpson :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ick","review":"Just like the other two, this feeds the MTV generation their trance through a straw.

The playset doesn't offer much to do. There aren't many accessories, certainly not enough to pretend cooking, which we thought was the point of a kitchen playset. You get a couple pots and ladles but nothing to put inside the pots.2. The playset needs to include more characters. You get Remy the rat. That's it. So, you playtime consists of Remy wandering around an empty kitchen (no food) and nobody else around.A playset should include enough items to make it fun by itself.

No thanx, man.I don't care if you are a goth, horror buff, OR artsy-fartsy film maker hopeful. It sucked no matter how you slice it. This film (or was it two? Aw who cares) should have been left in the vault.The only good part was the half naked \\"Redemtion Films\\" vampire chicks, who sort of did the horror host trip at the beginning.I don't know, maybe if you \\"dropped\\" first you might get what's going on, but even having read the books, it was too ambiguous for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"rip off","review":"I bought a CARS hotwheel at Target for $3.99.

The author mearley asserts something and then asserts another based on the previous assertion - which is fine, I suppose, if you already agree with his viewpoint before you started reading the material.

She was trying to be responsible in the beginning of the book but as you read farther into it she chose to make choices that weren't in her best interests. She was taking care of more than herself throughout the entire book but many times she didn't show us that. I believe that it shows us again that teenagers are not responsible enough to be parents. I also found that this book was a challenge to read. I was often having to turn the page back to see if I had missed something, only to find out that I didn't and the plot had just changed. I didn't like that. The one thing that I did like was how she felt equal with everyone, not more superior than another race."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfection - What's it really like?","review":"Finally a book that dares to discuss what being an object is like.

This indepth look at what a man of intellignce went through as a object is wonderfully frank, sweet, unusual, hopefull and well worth a read. Nervous envious types should open their minds and let this experience overwelm them.

The author has an entertainingstyle, and he does give us somewhat of a personal glimpseinto thelife of the rich and famous. He most certainly has a long list of names. That the author's life seemed a wasteland of superficialvalues, encounters and self hatred was a bit on the depressing side.

In fact, it deals with such a broad selection of family and personal issues, there's something here that will touch almost everyone. I felt that parts of the story were written about me and I believe that most readers will experience this same feeling. The events are very troubling and this book puts you on the spot, requiring you to deal with them and where we're going as a society.Meals served up by Del Vecchio (I think this is his 4th book) are not fast food. But, when you get up from the table, you feel full, satisfied and as if you've just experienced a new cuisine. Sticking with the metaphor, the story repeats on you. The issues and choices will continue to haunt you for a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cumbersome...","review":"This book should have been much better considering it's plot deals with some very timely issues, namely race relations, teen violence and alienation, corporate downsizing, etc.Unfortunately, the book is poorly written and verbose, with pages and pages of the main protagonist's stream of consciousness and flashback monologues that fail to advance the plot. At times it seems the author couldn't decide what kind of novel he wanted to write, and resorted to throwing in as many contemporary issues and concerns and literary techniques and devices as he could think of.While there are some positives, including interesting characterizations of some of the protagonists, overall the novel gives the impression that the author bit off more than he could chew."},{"rating":"2","title":"AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!","review":"Marvin Red Post Super Fast Out of Control! is a realistic fiction book by Mr. Louis Sachar.

If you support Obama, then you will enjoy the book and continue to support him.On another note, he talks about the centralization of the American Political System, which falls in line with the continued centralization of power in America. What Obama fails to realize about centralized power is that it (almost always) equals tyranny.When reading this book, you almost get the sense that Obama was certain he would be the next president of the United States.

I had not decided who to vote for in 2008, and now I am positive that I am not voting for Obama. Other reviews were encouraged or inspired or thought the tone was hopeful. I do not agree. I thought it was a lot of rambling about everything that's wrong with America with the occasional self-congratulatory pot shot at a former running opponent or journalist thrown in. His solutions tend to be written in terms of what repulicans want to do or tried to do and why he disagrees. One positive -- the writing is very candid. I was actually kind of surprised that a presidential hopeful would reveal this much in print. You can at least get a very clear view of who he thought he was when he wrote this book -- which leads me to point out another surprise of mine, why aren't his opponents using more of the stuff in this book against him?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Too early to tell....","review":"Perhaps it is too early to begin thinking about 2008 (after all, 2007 hasn't even started), but there is no doubt that Obama will be a powerful force in politics, whether he decides he wants to run for president or not.The most appealing aspect of the book is that he seems like a moderate, and at times, he even leaves room for the fact that his views have not been fully developed. I think that in this era of polarizing views and the entire \\"your either with us or against us\\" movement in politics, this book is a breath of fresh air - air for the hope that lives inside us all.

It was my second Obama book. It was very readable, entertaining and people-pleasing. I don't think his messages have much to say to seniors or baby-boomers. He should be a youth counselor and mentor, not president.After his book signing, as I waited for my ride home, I watched for an hour as people met Mr. Obama to get their book signed. With \\"young\\" people under 40-ish, he was animated, smiling, pouring on the charm. With folks over 40-ish, he appeared bored and had nothing much to say to them.

I was not ultimately left with much of an impression that he can lead our country and represent the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Audacity of this Guy Taking Your Money","review":"This book is nothing more than an obvious attempt at riding the political fence. Obama has dozens of idealistic views such as empathy for all and health care for everyone -- yet no plans or even realisitic ideas as to the implication of these ideals.

I didn't, however, expect to like it as thoroughly as I did! Despite a little bit slow beginning, the book drew me in with fascination as Obama used various bits of American history and constitutional law to not only help us understand various issues, but also to educate us about the basics of our society. It was written with just enough technical information to make it thought provoking and not mind numbing.I was also pleasantly surprised with the way Obama tries to present both sides of the picture. It's still obvious that he leans a bit more liberal, but he's very moderate in many things and seems to try to balance his arguments. It's sad when we're so used to complete and total name bashing that it's shocking when someone behaves responsibly even in book form. I definitely came out of this book more enlightened than I went in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bob Hollander's Review of \\"The Audacity of Hope: Thoughts on Reclaiming the American Dream\\"","review":"Well written.

So state power is growing at the expense of corporations.But that's not socialism. Socialism rests on a firm theoretical bedrock: the abolition of private property. I haven't heard anyone this side of Barney Frank calling for any such thing. What is happening now-and Newsweek is honest enough to say so down in the body of the article-is an expansion of the state's role, an increase in public/private joint ventures and partnerships, and much more state regulation of business.

A tradition based on the simple idea, that we have a stake in each other, and that what binds us together is greater than what drives us apart.And that if enough people believe in the truth of that proposition - and act on it - we might not solve every problem, but we can get something meaningful done.___The remainder of the book is as impressive as this introduction.

When John Paul 1st died, my hope for a more just church and a better world died with him. In my mind, Obama brings him back to life.

Regardless of your social, economic, or political beliefs, he has altered the way many think of a presidential candidate. In \\"The Audacity of Hope\\" Barack catalogs his rise to become the presumptive nominee of the Democrat Party. He explains each step by organizing categories such as, our constitution, faith, opportunity, politics, and family. He presents and explains his beliefs on many important issues that face modern voters. He recalls his failures, elucidates the present, and sets his future goals. \\"The Audacity of Hope\\" is all that it claims to be (do not expect a numbered game plan to solve war and global poverty). The nostalgia and love of his family members alongside politics is interesting to read of and I recommend this book to both Democrats and Republicans. It will help you become more knowledgeable of Barack's plans or prepare you to defend your own. Plus, his writing is as moving as his speeches can be!Thanks for reading,C.K."},{"rating":"2","title":"the voice of our next president?","review":"Barack Obama has written an accessible autobiography and political manifesto. He has taken care to organize it so as to present his political argument on the eve of his run for president. That is the main problem with the book: its main purpose is to support his political campaign. As a result, we get neither a satisfying presentation of his life story nor his political argument, but a little of both.Perpahs that is the best way to make a book like this widely accessible.

Still, Obama's dual purposes in authorship dilute both his narrative and his argument.I voted for him anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Obama for President","review":"What a great way to get to know our polititians.

Instead he ponders the meanings of the events in his life and attempts to learn and grow from them. ...Very smart.I also especially appreciated reading about life on the inside in Washington.

His book isnt about trying to create an image for himself as a presidential candidate(as he now is), its about his personal views on everything from \\"how we should interpret the intent of the Founding Fathers\\" to how he feels we can bring our nation to a better place.

Can any Christian recite passage from Koran with Arabic? That has Obama done in a interview with New York Times in 2006. Don't believe this man. He is only a fake.

It ranges very widely and shows both his varied background and his erudition. A fine book by a very intelligent young man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uplifting Read","review":"What ever ones persuasion in the political arena, Barrack Obama has captured the essence of an uplifting attitude. It is hard to find yourself remaining on neutral ground. We have to hope that this essence of optimism is not wrung out of his being, and that in some form or another he becomes an important part of American political history.Another enjoyable read when one wants a bit of relaxation, is FLYING NORTH SOUTH EAST AND WEST, which proves that, like Obama, it is still possible to succeed in this country regardless of humble beginnings.Flying North South East and West: Arctic to the Sahara"},{"rating":"2","title":"Obama's book is must read","review":"Senator Obama's book is a highly literate, immensely honest account of his life, his hopes for America, and a view of the world, which is broad and challenging. Further, he presents his experience as a politician in such an honest, candid way that inspires trust. I can't say that about many politicians--ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring","review":"While I'm not one to write book reviews, I thought enough of this book to write one for it. I enjoy reading non-fiction, and this book was no exception. It let the reader know the Senator's views on many subjects, subjects that are not easily looked upon in a \\"for or against\\" kind of way (as most subject matter SHOULD BE in politics). I found parts of this book to be somewhat dry, but for the most part it was an enjoyable read. I have also read Senator Obama's \\"Dreams from my Father\\" and found that one enjoyable as well, but it is much more of an autobiography than this book, which is more of a \\"user's guide to Barack Obama\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"First time I've felt optomism/hope for the future of our country","review":"I recently turned 18 so this will be the first time I'm able to vote, but I have payed a lot of attention to politics since Gore lost in 2000.

This book is extremely well written and gives me hope for the future of the country and the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"A political book, to be sure, but an inspiring and thoughtful one","review":"I'm a Republican but I voted for Obama partly as a result of reading this book. There's a core of sincerity and humility that threads its way through it that makes you feel intimately connected with Senator Obama even if you disagree with his positions (which I often do). It felt like talking to a reasonable, respectful person on \\"the other side\\" who is willing and even eager to discuss politics in a constructive and positive way."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Audacity","review":"The book that catapulted Barack Obama to power, this work is important in several respects to the present American. In this work, Obama explains his core philosophies. This being said, the informed voter can gain a keep insight into Obama morally as well as politically through the Audacity of Hope. Politics aside, the book is well-written and easy to read, which is what this review is, at its core, about. Does it represent something transformative? Probably not, as reality is always different than ideology, but it is still important to read such a book with importance to the current President of the United States."},{"rating":"1","title":"Racism at it's hightest!!!!!","review":"It was not that well written.

Great insight into his views that do not have a lot of value."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good book","review":"This was a good, informative book on Barack Obama's personal beliefs as well as his political philosophies. Each chapter starts with a life experience that lets you know where he is coming from on each government issue that he discusses. I'm not sure how interesting it would be for someone who already has some knowledge of Obama's ideals becuase it doesn't seem like he is saying anything too earth-shattering.Another interesting thing is that his sincerity comes across the same way on paper that it does when you listen to him on tv, especially when he discusses issues of faith and morality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audacity of vapour","review":"This book is, basically, a collection of feel-good platitudes. I didn't find any serious discussion or analysis of the causes of the current problems facing America. This is not surprising, giving the author's glaring ignorance in economics and history. The author ostensibly calls for a change, but if one actually thinks about how that change is going to be implemented, it is still the same old American Socialism.If you care for the truth, this one is not for you; on the other hand, I'd recommend it heartily if you feel threatened by the winds of change. Everything's going to be ok, really. We just need to believe really really hard that the nanny State will be nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quotations from Chairman Barack","review":"This book is not written by a human being, it is written by a politician running for office, afraid of offending swing voters by actually standing for something definite (other than being elected). One gets the impression that Chairman BHO learned all his lessons in flipfloppery, feel-good piffle and general all-around wishy-washiness by sitting at the feet of Mitt Romney. That God (or the next best thing, whichever comes first) should have learned all his tricks from the Devil should come as no surprise.

I was bored silly. Occasionally, he would say something that I thought was interesting. It took me forever to get through it.

For me, it was generally a lot of propoganda, and I voted President Barack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Audaciously excellent book!","review":"I loved this book, shows how thoughtful and intelligent Barack is.

People of all parties should read this book, as Senator Obama speaks truth and intelligence and I feel has the makings of a great President.

He is the real deal and THE MAN in my opinion to lead this country in a better direction."},{"rating":"2","title":"An old woman's comments","review":"This young man is perceptive and mature in his outlook, is self-revealing about his life, and writes beautifully.

I hope to live long enough to see him in that office."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Renewal of the American Spirit","review":"This is truly a moving and inspirational book. The faith and hope embodied in this young man (but \\"old soul\\") gives me hope for our nation's future. I don't think I've felt the call to idealism and patriotism Senator Obama evokes so strongly since the days of Robert Kennedy. In this age of extremes to the right and left he shows the path of the quiet majority who want a return to civility and the high road in politics and the policies of our country.

I was soured on him when he won a Nobel Peace Prize just for being elected. I never understood why so many people who actually did something for the world were passed over and he got an award for basically running for president without yet acomplishing anything. I have to wonder if they had waited if he would still receive the award today. Well I am getting off on a tangent. That being said, I still gave the book an open minded read. What is in it is most of his catch phrases from speeches. I was hoping there would be some backing and research for his views but that was completely absent. As another reviewer said \\"it is a mile wide and an inch deep intellectually speaking.\\"That is my opinion too."},{"rating":"1","title":"propaganda","review":"I just finished reading this book today. It seems to me that the book lacks any real subject matter that you can lean on to say \\"hey, this Obama stands for ____\\".

This is a great strategy to get Obama'a face out in the view of the masses, but I do not recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must read","review":"The President-Elect is much more than his 'supporters' might lead you to believe. An insightful man with a balanced and reasonable approach to many issues. This book should be read by all Americans to get a feel for the man who will next guide this country.

Now that he is the presumptive Democratic Party candidate for the U.S. President, I thought it was time I read something about him. This book didn't tell me anything.He is the champion of writing super long run-on sentences. You get done reading one and you have no idea what he just said. Some sentences take up an entire paragraph! He tries to dumb down the use of big words but it is just the sentence structure that made the book totally unreadable for me. He brings up some interesting questions about our culture in general, about the two party political system, about religion, etc. but he makes no attempt at providing any answers. Now obviously this book was written before he got into any Presidential campaign, but if he was asking these questions back then, why did'nt he provide any solutions in his primary platform? One has to wonder if this guy is all talk and no action???

It has honesty, compassion, political views, values, family, passion, religion, and simple straight talk.

The fact is, he's a by-product of Chicago machine politics who brags about his experience as a \\"community organizer\\" (wow, he organized the slums) who is in over his head.

I'm very disappointed in Amazon for false advertising.In addition, I called customer service to inquire about this and the call was equally as disappointing. The call came from over the internet and had a very poor connection. I could barely understand the customer service person. I think from what I could make out, the customer service person recommended that I reorder the products and have them shipped express.

There are clips of the paintings from the book (and many others), which I had not seen in decades.Tudor describes her outlook on life, art, and raising children. Many of her real life experiences find their way into her stories, in one fashion or another. She also recounts the almost-fantasy world of her own happy childhood.Some may feel that her pastimes and lifestyle border on the rediculous if not the edge of senility.

Now I am a HUGE fan of the music. Since I own Buddha Bar 4-and love it- I took a chance on this CD since it is from the same label and it is FANTASTIC! The first disc is amazingly mellow; definitely perfect for any dinner party or when you just want to relax to some great music. It is reminiscent of NORAH JONES' CD!!!!! Mellow & stylistic. The second disc is more upbeat and definitely more global in its sound. I swear when I listen with my eyes closed I am whisked away !

It was amusing and quirky at that price. At $10, there are much better deals for quality tuning, like the Sony and Panasonic pocket am/fm radios. Oddly enough, the build quality was OK, the tuning bezel was very stable, and the earphones were OK for the cost, driven with mono sound across both L/R, which is fine. The fm tuning was wide and not very sensitive. The AFC grabbed some station on most of the dial, but they hogged. Sound was ~OK, better with $20 headphones. On AM, there were a few fat dial-hogging locals (tuning bandwidth issue), and a weird squeeling-birdie sound around distant stations. You could tune those in extremely tight range with a lot of tweeking. Night AM was a crazy jungle. There is a lot of promise in the contruction and tuning mechanics, but the tuner circuits are buggy. I liked the pendant-hanging mode, once I shortened the cord a bit w/ a figure 8 knot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jwin Mini","review":"Bought this to take to the gym to use on the closed circuit TVs there.

The caller ID is displayed on an unlit LCD display, making it impossible to read in anything but bright daylight. After having the phone exchanged, the replacement was only marginally better, but it failed to recognize the base unit after 60 days of use.

A Song for Arbonne is no different in that aspect. I don't want to give away the plot line because I know I couldn't do him justice, so let me just say that anyone who like history, fantasy or romance (in the literary sense, not the bodice ripper sense) should give this one a try. And once you've read Arbonne, you should check out his other books. No other author writes such amazing and believable characters and his settings are always rich and well described. All I can say is that you should read his books."},{"rating":"2","title":"I read my eyes out","review":"A bitterly triumphant tale of love, hate, and nobility of spirit. This is a beautifully woven novel that defines the bounds of true patriotism in a historically accurate setting, where the true of heart manage to prevail, but with staggering losses-a truth that the kitsch of most fantasy novels ignores completely. Do not allow this novel to be darkened by the shadow of the award-winning Tigana, either: the emotions are just as strongly felt and the political themes just as relevant. In the end, simply an engaging novel that I failed to put aside until sleep claimed me in the larger hours of the morning.

This book has great fight scenes; interesting discussions, often quite humourous, making me laugh aloud; and much more... This book climaxes with a battle at the end, then the all the twists of the plot comes into place and you find yourself in a rush of emotions. I thought about what you have read and I whispered 'Wow'. And that is the only way to describe it. This is possibly Kay's best work, on a level to match Tolkien, Weis and Hickman, Brooks, Goodkind, and all the top fantasy authors and the authors of any other genre very easily, and this work surpasses all but a few books, not just in the fantasy world, but in all literature..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Read!","review":"This is a fantastic read just as all his books are.

Not enough wonder or plot; it's more like a Historical epic; I never liked any of his characters and he meanders too much on the prose for my tastes; a lot of people love him though; if you loved LOTR then you may very well like this one . . . while I can appreciate his style, he isn't for me; if his pacing was faster, there would have been promise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully Written and Better to Listen To","review":"A Song for Arbonne is beautifully written and compelling. As all of Mr Kay's books, it takes you away from your mundane life while still addressing important human questions.I would recommend the audio book read by Euen Morton. Although it took about an hour to get used to Mr Morton's higher pitched voice, his reading was stirring when required and lulling when needed. To me, Kay's language is better in the audio where the repetitions are dramatic.Loved this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fights, Love, War & Music !","review":"Guy Gavriel Kay here reaches new heights of eleqouence in prose and poetry.Simply put, he manages to introduce you to characters who show that all sides in love and war are much more complex than we'd like to think them - and he teaches you sympathy and interest for everyone involved - the \\"good guys\\" and the \\"bad\\".He shows both the darkness and the light in love and hate - and how closely to two are linked.If you like romances,Kay shows you love scences and love stories that are much more than \\"thrustings\\" in the dark. If you like battle-adventure stories, and are fond of Tolkein, you enjoy some great fight scenes that show not only great action, but great emotion.More depth than Goodkind - try it for an exciting and romantic read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"blew me away","review":"I discovered this book--dog-eared, dirty--in a used book store, and knew I had to have it.

Not only is the music of astoundingly variable musical quality (ranging from rather strong to unbelievably weak), but more significantly, the Ukrainian singers (both in choral and solo selections) have absolutely horrific English diction. This is not an issue for the few selections in Latin, but the majority of the works are choral or solo pieces in English by American composers, and the performances are both unintelligible and extremely unsatisfying. (The instrumental and orchestral playing is fine; some of the tracks are purely instrumental.)ERM has generally done quite well in its extensive \\"Masterworks of the New Era\\" series (though the music also varies widely in quality).

It is not only heat resistent, like pyrex, but also resistent to huge changes in temperature (you can take it from the freezer and put it on the stove without fear of breakage.) This is just crockery, which is why so many reviewers have complained that pieces arrived broken. In contrast, real pyroceram Corningware was virtually indestructable.

The older pieces I have say Corning Ware on it, were made in USA, and look like milk glass, thinner than this new, heavy white stoneware.The name on the box says Corning Ware, a name you can trust, but its not the special tempered glassware I thought I was buying.

I've been using it to clean my tub for the past two years and I've been very pleased with the results. You'll notice quickly that this cleaner is a liquid. There's no foaming action, there are no scrubbing bubbles. But despite that it cleans, and it cleans well. This is not a harsh cleaner- it's not going to eat the finish off your tub (thankfully). But it works- it removes stains and soap scum, and leaves a shiny, clean finish behind. And perhaps the best thing about it is the scent. Most bathroom cleaners have a strong bleach or ammonia odor, but not this one- it smells pleasantly of mint. One caveat- as this is not a bleach-based product, I don't think it would do much to whiten the grout between tiles, but for regular cleaning, it's a pleasure to use, and leaves a beautiful scent behind.

This is just the decades old MBO (Management by Objective) for Human Services, and does not expand the science of evaluation.

I can't believe he didn't get an Oscar nom out of this. Occasionally the film hits a lull but when it's on it burns hot, with a totally mesmerizing script; and what a voice the man has, damn. The flashback scenes with him in full afro curls are amazing, replete with a dated, 70's look. The thing is, this film needs a SPECIAL EDITION - the print needs to be cleaned up and remastered. A commentary with Stone and / or Bogosian would only make it even better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Petrivaz","review":"Based on a play by himself Eric Bogosian, drives us into the world of the lost souls of the night.

It's not in the fleshing out to fill almost two hours. It's the incredibly bad accents and characterization attempts by the callers. Every one of them sounds like a escapee from a high school production with even the dumbest morons having to mouth pre-meditated, and literate dialogue.

Well, this book is great because it will often jog my memory of those upper-level classes that require skill and detail---BEYOND just inking a rubber stamp and slapping the design on paper.In order to create a card or picture with color and texture, it's good to know the techniques shown by Ms. Curry in this book.

On a personal level I am the mother of a VCFS child, and am acquanted with 100's of other VCFS parents, nearly all of whom use sign WITH GREAT SUCCESS with our children.I would not recommend this book to anyone who is a layperson in speech pathology. I would not recommend it to anyone who has a child that is non verbal as a result of anything other than a cleft palate.

When the power goes out, even for a second, you have to pull the power cord out and remove the backup battery to get it working again, erasing all your messages and settings - so much for having a backup battery!

I usually lend books I've purchased to friends but am too embarrassed to pass this wimp along; in fact I was debating on whether to pitch it vs. put it in my Goodwill basket until I saw that some other readers did actually enjoy it.As with actors trying to save a poor movie, I felt sorry for the characters trying to come alive in this dreadful story, and I will never read about diaries, loons or heart transplants again without blushing, they were so badly abused.

Not to mention the same 10-20 pages of polital Tri-State ramblings that occur in every single novel in this series. All in all I paid for about 20 pages worth of good action in this horrible novel.

Either end the series or treat your audience with some respect and write something decent, Mr Johnstone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time to end the series???","review":"This book seems to be little more than to bridge the gap between his last book, and the next in the series. Mr. Johnstone again resorts to taking entire sections from his earlier books, and quoting them verbatim - this time with the pretext of the villian studying the writings of a war correspondent. Although I enjoyed this series, it has become clear to me that Mr. Johnstone is tiring of writing it. Each new book has less action, and more \\"flashbacks\\". In my opinion, he should finally put an end to this series - as he recently did to the \\"Eagles\\" western series, though it was much shorter than this one.If you're collecting the series, go ahead and get this book.

I felt maistakes were made in the area of weapons, locations, and attitudes of people at some locations mentioned. Also the price of the books and not being able to find some of the books. Think goodness for Kindel, Nook, etc. Johnstone is a very good writer, has his own style, which is good, but a Louis Lamour he's not.

The story holds up, with an ending that, although not entirely effective, makes a point and should make you think. Makes you feel for the girl. Being the '80s, of course there's gore and nudity and, being Italian, a little more nudity and gore. The viewer isn't quite sure who the killer really is at times. The duck-quack voice of the killer may make some people laugh or put them off from this film, and one or two of the gore sequences may offend some, but what do you expect from this type of film?The blu-ray is miles above the DVD in quality and there's more picture included in the frame. I thought some of the flesh tones were a little bright, but I'm not sure if that's supposed to be that way since the other colors looks fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blu-Ray is top notch!","review":"This Blu-Ray looks great for a 30 year old exploitation film. New York City circa 1980 was never looked sleazier and Blue Underground's transfer looks great. The video looks like a 35mm print, complete with a bit of grain and lots of detail. In other words, it's near perfect for what it is.....The extras are minor but a nice addition.The film....love it, hate it, laugh at it....Personally, I feel it's Fulci goofing on Dario Argento. Argento's films have pretty lighting and make murder look artistic. With \\"New York Ripper\\" Fulci serves up sleazy characters, gaudy lighting and makes violence look gruesome and horrible. There's also the quacking, Donald Duck-voiced killer, another poke at giallo convention that typically has a raspy voiced killer making threatening phone calls.It's 2nd tier Fulci, but definitely worth a look if you have the stomach for it or are a fan of Euro-cult and exploitation films."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vicious and intense","review":"OK - Everyone's heard about this one, claimed by many to be Fulci's grimmest hour etc. However, upon actually viewing it, I was very suprised to find a film that, whilst certainly containing much sadistic violence and gore, is well-made and quite realistic. Fucli's idea of merging the lines between a horror and thriller film have paid dividends in this movie.It is intense, sometimes not easy to watch and the last victim is litterally slashed to ribbons (including eyes). However, the plot does make sense, it has reasonable acting and the re-mastered release available now, is simply top-notch.If you want a ride into hell and back, then let Lucio Fulci take you deep into the nightmarish world of a downtrodden New York, with a vicious serial killer on the loose.One of the only films I've seen that virtually deserves its reputation as a shocking, sadistic and quite disturbing movie.You have be warned!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Butchering a masterpiece (and not in a good way)","review":"Do not buy! This distribution company's name says it all. Shameless. They completely mutilate the coolest scene in the movie by removing the mutilation. I bought this to replace a dvd copy I used to have and that included the razor nipple scene in its entirety and was much cheaper. To think that this company tries to claim this \\"the most complete\\" version of New York Ripper available today is inconceivable to me. Maybe in the UK. Which is a place I just decided I will never set foot in. This is my favorite Fulci movie. Fulci is my favorite director. If I can't return this blu ray I'll take it out in the street and burn it.

Based on a 1987 science fiction bestseller (in Japan; it was never published in the US), Yukikaze tells the story of a war fought between mankind and a mysterious alien race known only as JAM. The battles take place on a faraway planet called Fairy (accessible via a strange cloud near the Ross Ice Shelf in Antarctica). While the war has been going on for over thirty years, the majority of the population on Earth believes the JAM threat is just an urban legend.The intense action scenes are balanced with a focus on the characters.

The poems celebrate the significance of the empty, the significance of the impossible desire, the significance of endless misery, unmitigated pain, and this thing here. There are somewhat successful poems about unsuccessful living, but all these poems drain the spirit. They soak the soul in unreality. This is a book of poems that reveals itself in self-inflicted, unconscious, emotional pain."},{"rating":"1","title":"you get what you pay for","review":"I didn't use this right away so it was out of warranty when the tape player broke after very limited use.

Not only were they dry, but they were too cold and calculated in their advice for getting in to the top schools.The Guide to Getting In, however, is completely different. It was written by a group of funny and talented Harvard undergrads (actually from the same group that writes Let's Go, I think). They tell you all the important facts you need to know to get through the admissions process, but in a way that is enjoyable to read. I actually found myself laughing out loud during certain chapters, which is pretty impressive for a college admissions book.My only criticism would be that it lacks some of the admissions office inside info that a few other books offer.

The disappointment came from the thin writing -- from a writer who has had such a rich a varied background. Endless repetitions of phrases (He said he was there and not there; he said I was his wife; I felt no guilt). Repetitions of situations, so on. This is a 20 page monologue carried on 20 times -- and with none of the details that one would like to hear from this very accomplished writer.What was it like working at the New Yorker all those years? What was it like to interview and work with people like John Huston, Francois Truffaut, Charlie Chaplin, Oona O'Neil, Frederico Fellini, so on.This book, this writer, needed an editor if anyone did.But a sequel would be welcome by me -- one that tells the other Lillian Ross story/memoir.

This album was released on RSO in 1977 and was drowned in the UK punk expectoration. It has long been unavailable on CD and although individual tracks have been included on various compilations it is a serious omission from the Clark canon. Real Clark devotees should not miss this.

When I was first diagnosed with depression, I didn't understand a lot about it. This book really helped me to understand what was going on with me emotionally and understand what was chemically going on in my body. When the authors say they understand where you're at, they really do! They've been there too. From a Christian perspective, this book is very bibically based. It is the best book I've found on depression yet, at least from a Christian perspective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book On Conquering Depression Out There","review":"First I'd like to say that if I could give more than 5 stars, I would for this book. This book is a wonderful book on how to conquer depression, an illness that has plagued me for over 9 years. It is written by two professionals who both are strong Christians and both have suffered from depression which makes you know they understand what you are going through and there is hope. I also appreciated the fact that I didn't have to sift through what I felt was Scriptural and what I felt wasn't as this book is very Biblically based and glorifies God throughout the whole book.

I plugged one end into the lighter and the other end into the phone. The phone started charging and all seemed good until I picked up the phone. As soon as I did the piece that connects to the phone fell apart. I tried to put the pieces back together, but they would not stay together and everytime I picked up the phone it fell apart again.

The Shins perform an \\"unplugged\\" version of We Will Become Silhouettes and the last track, Such Great Heights is performed by Iron And Wine - most notably played in a recent M&M;'s \\"kaleidoscope\\" commercial...very slow & pokey folky with just acoustic guitars and vocals.Very worthy of the $4 price tag!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap, slip and slde product!","review":"I bought this item, hoping for a soft seat as my last toilet seat was, and this one not only does not have enough padding and sinks all the way down to the base below, but it also slips and slides on the toilet, despite numerous attempts on my part to retighten the plastic bolts that came with the seat.

It is not a *Lois and Clark* novel: if you're looking for Lois and Clark interaction you won't get it. There is a vaguely interesting story about Superman assisting with a natural disaster in Eastern Europe, while Lois is depicted missing Clark and unaware of where he is. The plot around substandard building work which causes collapses in Metropolis is interesting, and of course seeing Lois depicted as a hero makes a pleasant change. But why on earth does Cherryh make Lois visit Lex in prison? And why do we only get a page or so of very unsatisfying L&C interaction right at the end, since the story takes place shortly after their engagement.If you're looking for an interesting story with plenty of L&C interaction, you'd be better saving your money and visiting the fanfiction archive on the Internet."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a give-or-take if you read fanfic.","review":"I am an avid fan of Lois & Clark (or is that rabid?

Clark/Superman has more interaction with a grandmother from somewhere in the Caucasus than with his new fiancee! It's very frustrating, and if I were Lois, (which I wish I were) I'd be veeery angry.

Amazon tells me the problem is \\"more widespread than they thought\\", and are unable to replace with good set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good at any level.....","review":"I attempted to watch this series when it originally aired on ABC but was unable to continue past the second episode. Why? The acting was bad, the scipt contrived, and the whole idea of trying to remake a classic series redundant.The fact that the person who wrote for this series also wrote for some X Files episodes is ironic considering that Chris Carter, the creator of the X Files, stated that the original Night Stalker was an inspiration. This series attempted to be like the X Files by being 'mysterious' and totally reworking the original Night Stalker series, but it failed due to bad casting, writing and a main storyline that nobody really cared about.Do yourself a favor and watch the original series. There is a reason why this show got cancelled as fast as it did."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Show That Never Really Got It's Chance","review":"I was a big fan of this series and couldn't believe it was cancelled before it was allowed time to find an audience. Not a hero from the 70's, Stuart Townsend is a contemporary Kolchak, a reporter tortured by unanswered questions about his wife's death and determined to discover the truth. Definitely for adults, with plenty of graphic violence and psychological games.Normally a show isn't available on DVD unless it ran multiple seasons, or at least one complete season. This two-disc set contains all ten episodes of the series that were produced, including several never broadcast, plus a nice featurette and scripts outlining where the series would have gone had it been given the chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"If only they hadn't called it Night Stalker","review":"This is actually a very good show for those who like Medium, Supernatural, American Gothic, etc. More serious than Supernatural, but not as ponderous as X-Files, the show has its own mythology that builds from episode to episode as we learn more about the characters and their pasts. That said, this show really has nothing to do with the original Kolchak. In the original, each show stood on its own with nothing to do with the other shows and Kolchak was deliberately unhip and alone. By calling this show the Night Stalker instead of just coming up with a new title, the show created too many expectations based on nostalgia which probably helped doom it. The DVDs are available very cheaply used, so if you have any interest in the above listed shows, you should give this a try and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a DVD!!","review":"I cannot believe that they put this lame series out on DVD and yet so many great series have never be done in DVD (such as WKRP).This series was X-Files part 2. However, the stories were disjointed. The acting was horrible, and the characters had no personality. Can you imagine? Carl Kolchak without personality?Any resemblance with \\"The Night Stalker\\" with Darren McGavin is purely coincidental. Essentially, they used the title and character names but nothing else resembles the real Night Stalker. What this series is, is a lot of hip-moody music, dark shadowing lighting, popular dizzying camera cuts, and very lame stories.I cannot imagine they were able to fill a single DVD with episodes since the series was (rightfully) canned early on."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst TV show ever?","review":"In my opinion, this is absolutely the worst remake of a television series ever done.I don't know what Mr. Spotnitz was thinking on this baby, but he should retire and live off his X-Files and Millenium residuals, because this turkey is the worst show ever.If you are into collecting the worst of the worst, then this one is for you.Otherwise, save your money and catch Darren McGavin in the original tv series on dvd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific show -Bad Network","review":"I never really watched the original, but was addicted to this very intense remake, very well done. Stuart Townsend was Great, as was Gabrielle Union. I was so upset at the network when the show was cancelled. If they were going to cancel it- so be it, but to yank it off the air in the middle of a two parter was just mean. They never did show the conclusion. I could not believe it, I kept it on my Tivo for months hoping they would run the conclusion to a very compelling story. Now I can buy it and finally see how the story arc ends"},{"rating":"1","title":"A good show - but not the Night Stalker I remember","review":"Perhaps naming this new program \\"The Night Stalker\\" was a disservice that contributed to the program being cancelled after the first season. Those of us who remember the classic old series starring Darren McGavin are likely to be disappointed. I know I was. The bumbling nature of the original Kolchak character was part of the show's charm. He stumbled into supernatural situations and just barely pulled through each episode with his life.If the new show had aired under a different name I think it would have been a great success. The program delves into some creepy stuff - and as some other reviewers have mentioned it has definite \\"X-Files\\" overtones. I was disappointed that it wasn't the \\"old\\" Night Stalker, but enjoyed it enough to add it to my video collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a great show wasted on ABC","review":"I really enjoyed this show. it was getting better and better every episode. I think people were too busy holding on to the past to give the show a chance. when I finally saw the orignal I couldn't believe people had the berve to whine about the new one. I don't dislike the original but it was corny. It had a nice campy feel. the newer was darker and more interesting and I like shows with story arcs.I can't wait for this to get on DVD although I downloaded some episodes but I was sad that ABC didn't bother to cultivate the show. hopefully after it airs on SCif-fi Cahnnel it will get the following it deserves and maybe we'll get a movie out of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good series that was canceled to early","review":"The Night Stalker was a very good series that was canceled before it could really reach its prime. It is a supernatural show similar in theme to the X-Files about a man searching for answers about his wife's murder. Most of the episodes are episodic with the main theme kind of tying them together.Overall, the problems with the Night Stalker has to do with its untimely demise. The show didn't have time to resolve anything with the main theme. Another thing is that it doesn't really go into detail what allows some of the themes to occur. You just accept them at face value. This might have been a larger problem if the show hadn't been so enjoyable.Overall, I would say that this is a very good show that was canceled to early. It would have been nice to have some things resolved."},{"rating":"2","title":"a pleasant diversion into the surreal...","review":"definitely more palatable than the endless, tedious and unimaginative police dramas which saturate and nauseate primetime television...not to mention the complete capitulation of the networks toward reality programming...This short-winded series casts a shadow all its own. It delivers genuine creepiness and chilling pyschological ruminations against dark, brooding sets. That it does'nt resemble the \\"McGavinish\\" seventies series is perhaps a good thing.

The original 1965 movie offers a \\"over-the-top\\" performance by Joan Crawford (No \\"wire hangers\\" in this flick!) and a great shower scene that would make Alfred Hitchcock proud. The leading girls lack acting skills but that makes this movie all the better. William Castle delivers a creepy, suspenseful, and wicked story that sadly doesn't deliver at the very end.

It gives demonstrations of several moves on the floor, with the ball, and with the bands, but does not include and instructor led workout. It gives an example &quot;good beginner&quot; workout, but you need to be familiar enough with the moves to create and perform it on your own.

Otherwise, you're stuck with great equipment and absolutely nothing to do with it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Pilates Kit, Exercise Ball and Bands !!","review":"I really like the Ball and the Bands in this kit. It is a good value getting everything for one price. The video is great and educational and step by step in showing you how to do each of the moves, first on a mat, then with a band, and finally with the ball. After you go through each exercise once, they give you a list of a good 20 min beginner workout and the video is over. The instructions are clear and slow enough to follow for a beginner I am now looking for a video that has an actual workout to do now that I know most of the moves. Overall I LOVE this product, I just wish it had an actual workout included on the video provided. But for a first time Pilates doer, like I am, it is an excellent source of instruction/information. It tells you how to stretch and breathe also. Now to get going!! ** A tip, You will want an exercise mat to workout on, the floor gets hard when doing the floor exercises."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inside of the heart of a played female","review":"Boooooooooring! Homechick tripped me out, sharing her lewd fantasies with the world. It was plain to me that Pac used her as a distraction while behind bars. If she wasn't beautiful he wouldn't have given her and her letter the time of day. And his constant requests for more pictures...what do you think he was doing with them??? Why didn't he try to make something happen with her upon his release? In the media I've heard about his relationship with Jada and even Keshia is mentioned. But no word of any Angela. She was straight up used and played. Maybe she thought having \\"exclusive\\" Tupac letters made her special but the book only served to bring to light how foolish she was."},{"rating":"2","title":"We LOVE you TUPAC!","review":"I would like to thank Angela for allowing us (the readers) inside the intimate relationship that she shared with Tupac. With each letter I felt the sincerity of Tupac's words. Even though many reviewers felt she got played, I didn't feel that AT ALL! He was honest and upfront with her. Initially, she didn't set out to fall for him. BUT, who can blame her?? I was mushy after reading every letter. So many WISH they could have shared a little piece of Pac. Angela had more than a little piece of him... she had his mind. Who cares if it was temporary?Angela, thank you sooo much for sharing."}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:x},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:W,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},D={class:"card-container"},O=["disabled"],B={key:0},N={key:1};function M(a,e,n,u,r,s){const c=y("PoemCard");return o(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",D,[(o(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(o(),p(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(o(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(o(),i("span",N,"Loading...")):(o(),i("span",B,"See more"))],8,O)):b("",!0)])}const H=d(C,[["render",M],["__scopeId","data-v-91ebb7f2"]]),G=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/21.md","filePath":"library/21.md"}'),j={name:"library/21.md"},L=Object.assign(j,{setup(a){return(e,n)=>(o(),i("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{G as __pageData,L as default};
