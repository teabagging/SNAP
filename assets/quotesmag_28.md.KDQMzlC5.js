I sharpened about ten pencils with the first one (excellent sharpening while it lasted), and something \\"let go\\" inside. The motor ran but the rotating blade had no more power - as soon as I pressed the pencil into the blade it would stop turning while the motor continued running freely.I unwrapped the second sharpener to see if it would hold up better. Again, after about 10 pencils, exactly the same thing happened.When I disassembled one of them to analyze the failure, I discovered that a crucial area of the plastic gear that drives the blade mechanism was stripped away so that the gear was spinning practically freely. It was unable to drive the blade mechanism with any significant strength.Conclusion: This product is potentially an excellent pencil sharpener but it has a major design weakness in its drive train. I only put one star on this review because zero stars is not available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after three months","review":"The sharpener worked fine for a while, then it started making a terrible noise and grining the wood, but not shrpening...not having saved the box or paperwork, I threw it out.

Plus the fact they couldn't get permission to use DM music in the video.. I find it VERY hard to watch a documentary of music and NOT hear one song from Depeche Mode. In the very beginning of the DVD you get a line \\"This DVD contains NO MUSIC from Depeche Mode\\" When they talk about a particular song, like Photographic, you would expect to hear a small clip of it, not another song from some band you never hear of?

Avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for High School Students","review":"If you want your high school students to watch a biography of Ernest Hemingway, do not choose this one. It will put them to sleep. I showed it to my freshman and quickly realized the error of my ways. I have never seen the students so disinterested. This biography is for viewers who already have a basic knowledge of Hemingway's life and the times in which he lived. Most of the allusions to other writers and books went over their heads. Additionally, the mood of the piece is somber and sad--it didn't seem to capture Hemingway's spirit. Trust me on this one--unless you have a group of serious, mature students who already know the main details of his Hemingway's life, don't buy it for the classroom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sketchy at best","review":"I'm no Hemingway expert, so I watched this for an overview. However, it's not particularly well done, gets off to a very boring start and is handicapped by absolutely nothing from Hemingway himself except some audio of a speech for the Nobel prize. We see bits and pieces from the mostly awful movies made from his books and short stories, but we don't get a good sense of much, except that he was an expert at boiling things down. That we are told repeatedly here. The section on his Cuba years is probably best, and I appreciated the interviews with screenwriter Peter Viertell, but the others interviewed aren't very good, including his son and sister. I'm sure there are better short documentaries out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome introduction to the sky","review":"This is a user's manual to the sky.

All other aspects of this thing are down right dangerous. I don't know who allowed this thing to be made. In order to use half the tools you have to hold a very small and sharp blade and twist.

Thing is I cant get it to open bottles. I don't know how hard you have to do it, but seeing as how there is a knife pushing into my thumb, I cant apply any more pressure without cutting myself. I wanted a compact opener, but it doesn't work. If you need a tiny knife or screwdriver then here ya go. I guess its great if you want to fumble with your keys to stab someone, but only with a little knife so that they learn their lesson."},{"rating":"1","title":"More dangerous than useful","review":"The most useful part of the tool is the phillips screwdriver, something not found in many pocket knifes - but to use it, you must open (and grasp) the very sharp blade.

Don't buy it.","review":"I bought this key several months ago and was quite happy with it. The blade is sharp, it turns smoothly, everything was as advertised. However I will say that using the knife can get awkward, as there isn't a great place to hold it... I did manage to avoid cutting myself though.Sadly, it recently begun falling apart. It started when I used the screwdriver on a fairly loose screw and one tine snapped off. Then, it kinda started to slide around without locking (when I bought it it would lock at three different angles). It would occasionally fall off my keychain and finally it completely broke one day just from sitting in my pocket.I am disappoint.TL;DR: It works well but breaks easily. Not worth $10."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a good IDEA, but...","review":"Having all these tools on you keychain sounds pretty awesome. I was really psyched to get this in the mail. The problems started when I actually tried to use any of these tools. The screwdrivers are too small to really work on anything except the loosest screws. If you really want to put any pressure on the screws, too, do you know what the \\"screwdriver\\" handle is? It's the double knife. Trust me, you don't want to grip the knife blades too hard. The bottle opener? It's a nice addition, I guess. Also this hooks on your keychain in a very stupid way, and I can see it just falling off one day never to be seen again. Not much of a loss, though. The only great thing about this is it's a nice way to carry a concealed knife on your person. It's truly the only reason I keep it around.WATCH OUT, I'LL CUT YOU!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good in theory, bad in practice","review":"I am a big fan of another Swiss Tech tool, the Micro-Plus 8-in-1. It is a great tool. Unbelievably usable for its size. So when I saw this tool, I immediately ordered it. Unfortunately, the Utili-key was a big disappointment.The tool is difficult to open, requiring substantial pressure on the 2 arms. This would not normally be an issue; however, one arm of the tool is a razor sharp knife. One slip would cause a nasty cut. After a couple of near misses, I threw the tool away. Having a tool that fits on a key chain would be great. Having one that requires you to risk bodily harm is not good.Buy a Micro-Plus 8-in-1 instead! It is a little bit bigger than the Utili-key, but it is much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent in a pinch","review":"If you're finding that your keyring is just a growing mass of metal, yet you want to carry a pocket knife, this is just the item for you. The Utili-key helps me to open packages and tighten odd screws here and there.

Since I have studied the \\"occult\\" for many years why not add a dictionary on the subject to my library? Unfortunately this book was written and published by people who are ignorant of the occult and deem anything not Christian to be \\"dangerous\\". The publisher boasts: \\"More than 700 articles describe the beliefs, practices, people and organizations that form a powerful opposition to the Christian faith.\\" Let the buyer beware! If you wish to promote ignorance, then this book is for you. If you are looking for a non-biased study, don't waste your money.

I thought at first it would take some time but after about 10 minutes of doing some simple table top shots, I got the hang of it.The mount provided on this lens fit perfectly on the Sony Alpha A100.

However, it is clearly designed with texting in mind and because I text an average of 30 or 40 messages daily it appealed to me for having a QWERTY keyboard and a dictation feature for hands-free. The QWERTY is good, the dictation is okay, but the storage for text messages is absolutely unacceptable. Once my inbox reaches about 45 messages it is full! What gives! My last phone--a mid-grade Motorola--would store hundreds of text messages. Some of those (and we all know this) can be of sentimental value. I am seriously frustrated that I will now have to prioritize which love note is more important than another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Headed back to the store!","review":"Have had this phone for about 2 weeks now.

But when it goes off in the vehicle (ringer, alarm, etc) I miss it because it is so low. My KRZR (which I will go back to) was plenty loud enough. I got the Samsung as a gift from my wife.

We know other people who have this phone and they experience the same problems.It doesn't really matter if the phone is high tech or has great features if it consistently drops calls. I am very unsatisfied with this phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I bought this phone because I wanted the Querty keyboard for sending e-mail. It is a poor compromise between a Blackberry and a good cell phone. The reception is very poor. While I get service most places I go, it is very hard to hear what people are saying. The clarity of sound is MUCH better on the other phones my husband and kids use. The other challenge is finding the numbers to dial the phone. If you, like me, are of reading-glasses age, you will have to dial the phone by memory of the number locations rather than by sight because the number keys, embedded sideways in the keyboard, are so tiny. Finally, I find that while I can read my e-mail fairly well on the phone (I use Yahoo via the Verizon Mobile Web), sending e-mail is much more challenging. As soon as my service contract runs out I will be replacing this phone with a Blackberry so that I can truly have e-mail on the go and decent cell phone service at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Absolutely the best phone I've ever had!!! I have rather large hands, but the keyboard is still easy to use. I get lots of looks while typing messages, especially from the younger crowd who are really into texting.I questioned my purchase because I don't use text messaging too frequently -- until I found out about Google SMS. Basically, you send key phrases like the name of a business or directions or flight information to the address \\"46657\\" (which spells GOOGL on a phone keypad) and Google replies with results. Now I use text messaging all the time!I love it!Update 12/12/2008: I dropped this phone in a river while fishing and killed it. I liked it so much I got another one even though I was offered a great deal on a different phone.Update 10/12/2009: Still loving it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best highlighters around","review":"I first used these highlighters in college years ago and was instantly hooked. Now I pretty much refuse to use anything else. They are bright, barely smudge, and come in colors I can't find anywhere else. My only complaint would be that they don't last as long as some other highlighters. But it's not a huge difference, so I'll continue to purchase these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Highlighters with a long life!!","review":"I am a teacher at an elementary school and I like these Zazzle highlighters very much. I personally consider them THE BEST. The very first set I purchased, I used each color multiply times a day and they have lasted me for 2+ years. I just purchased 2 new sets and there is still a touch of ink in the tubes of the older set. They do not dry out quickly like other name brand highlighters. If you are careful and do not press down hard when you use them, the tips do not break down & the ink comes out minimial and does not run. To use them properly, simply highlight or press ever-so-lightly. Not much effort at all. Of course, in any liquid-filled product, you must replace the cap each time or the tip will dry out, briefly, depending on how long the cap was left off. A good shake or a slight touch of water will bring them bring them back to life. They are great highlighters with a long life!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"These highlighters come in pretty colors, but even without much pressure, so much liquid comes out while you're highlighting that it pools and dries very slowly. I ended up having to sit in class with paper towels to soak up any extra liquid, smudging a lot of the highlights in the process, and therefore having the product defeat it's purpose. This happened to me with all the highlighters in the pack, so it wasn't just one defective highlighter. Stay away from them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not the product I received.","review":"I ordered these highlighters and although I received these colors, the highlighters I ordered were zazzle and the quality is terrible.

Here a summary of the problems it causes.Boot the PC up one day, and for some unknown reason, KB & mouse are not detected; you have to power down everything, crawl behind your PC, and switch the USB port the KVM plus your KB & mouse into (this KVM converts your PS/2 KB & mouse signals to USB...and therein lies, I believe, to key to it's problems). This problem happens fairly often, such as just about any time you attach a new USB device to your PC; when you reboot, KB & mouse don't work anymore. Also, don't try to connect a USB multi-format media card reader or USB hub; it simply won't work at all with those connected, even after switching USB jacks and rebooting.In short...spend the extra money and buy some other, ANY other, multi-head KVM!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This DVD DOES NOT have Ballet and Opera as it claims","review":"This DVD calims it has bonus of \\"....with The Viena State and Volksoper Ballet...\\" and it has a sticker on the front of the DVD claiming the same.

It was such a surpise to me because the main reson I bought this DVD instead of its CD version of the concert is that I really like the Ballet (from the live - broadcast on new year's concert).I like products of this recording company \\"Deutsche Grammophon\\" and I have many CD collections from this company.

Luckily I got this CD for a ridiculously low price so I can just tell myself I got what I paid for.The songs aren't very original - they don't tend to go anywhere exciting, and the production is also very flat which doesn't help matters. I won't even get started on the slower, ballad tracks. I've heard these guys being compared to Stratovarius which I think is the equivalent of stepping on Stratovarius' nuts and spitting in their beer. There, I said it.There is a glint of hope on this album that these guys might have what it takes to differentiate themselves in the future and possibly even build on some of their less crappy qualities.

A good amount of characters to choose from.2. The story mode is pretty long.3. Plenty of mini games.4. The combat is pretty much the same as Budokai 3 except a few things are missing.5. You can customize the power of your character.Cons:1. They replaced the versus mode with arcade mode so you have no control over which characters you fight.2. Loading screens take forever it seems.3. Their is no shortcut from the main menu to let you customize your characters (you have to go into training mode and go through all the loading and other stuff).Overall it was a great game to buy for the PSP the graphics are a little crappy but you cant really expect much from a hand held game. Half the time you don't really recognize the graphics because you are just trying to win the battle you are in.

The metal is a little thicker than a soda can but not as thick as a soup can. The pencil size selector on the front is also made of very thin metal and feels like it will fall off soon. But the biggest problem with this sharpener is that it sharpens pencils to such a very sharp point that the lead breaks too easily when my children try to write with it.(young children need more of a blunt tip) Then when you resharpen your pencil, it will grind down about an inch and a half before you get to the new lead. The second huge problem is that it doesn't sharpen evenly and the wood ends up down by the tip. I always have to break some of the wood off with my fingernail so my kids can write with it.I know people are more likely to write a review if they are disappointed than happy with a product so I don't put too much stock in the negative reviews.

I used it for my classroom, so it saw a lot of use! It was quick, sharpened well, and only I operated it. It worked from April until the next December and then it suddenly died! It was past its warranty and return date, so I wasted a large sum of money on a pencil sharpener."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not durable","review":"This sharpener worked fine for a few months of light use, but it recently stopped sharpening. I opened it up and discovered that the sharpening \\"blade\\" had moved out of position so it was not contacting the pencils. I couldn't figure out a way to correct this, so it's now unusable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Panasonic Pencil Sharpener","review":"Panasonic KP380-BK Classic Electric Pencil Sharpener, Black, One UnitAfter reading rave reviews of this pencil sharpener, I purchased one for my classroom. It does sharpen pencils extremely well. However, it requires a sophisticated touch while sharpening. Students cannot just jam a pencil in; sharpen it, pull it out and use it. They need to use some finesse while doing this basic classroom function since the motor lacks decent torque (power). Too much pressure, and the unit binds up and stalls. I haven't met too many twelve-year olds with the patience to use this unit well. I, on the other hand, correct their papers with exquisitely pointed instruments quietly honed at my desk. They must continue to use the large, loud, clunky, blue devices situated around my room that meet their needs, minimally."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can always count on Panasonic","review":"I already have a panasonic pencil sharpener. It is at least 15 years old and works great. I need a pencil sharpener for my woodworking shop so we decided to purchase a new one for our office and I would take the \\"old\\" one.

I have had a lot of different sharpeners in my life and this is the very best one. The point is wonderfully sharp, it is never off center, it is rather quiet (not like some of the growling monstrosities I have owned) and the little suction cups allow you to have one-handed sharpening. I am very satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kids afforded a short life for this sharpener","review":"I have a dead KP-380 pencil sharpener. We guess we've had this sharpener a grand total of two, maybe three months. We bought it at the beginning of the 09 shool year, sharpened 50-100 penciles (yes we emptied the shaving tray), and that was it. I took it apart today and found no voltage across the contacts. The wires trace back to separate locations on the main board (no voltage there either). I suspect the transformer is shorted. It was plugged into a power strip with surge protection. Could have been lightning, but the other components plugged into the strip are all OK. Quality seems OK, no pencil dust in the motor compartment. We're stepping up to an industrial strength sharpener."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great every time","review":"I have tried 2 other electric pencil sharpeners and 1 wall mounted manual one in the past 2 years.

I've purchased and returned two others but I'm definitely keeping this one. The other sharpeners were noisy, had weak motors, cut slowly and were just plain awkward to use, but the Panasonic KP-380 is a fantastic product.This sharpener is quiet, powerful and has sharp blades that cut smoothly and quickly. The blades automatically pull away from the pencil when sharpening is complete. The shavings container is of adequate size. There are three small rubber suction cups on the bottom that hold the sharpener firmly in place. Five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a sharpener that works...","review":"After buying two other sharpeners from Office Max, I finally found one that sharpens the WHOLE pencil.

Based on my experience with my friend's B&D iron (a different model though), I was hoping to replicate the same experience. After bringing it home and filling it with tap water, I tried to iron a 100% cotton shirt but, it simply did not iron. The wrinkles would not go away even after applying massive amounts of steam, maximizing the heat setting, ironing slowly with increased downward force... nothing would get the wrinkles out. I finally gave up after 10 minutes. Its going back."},{"rating":"1","title":"First impressions can be deceiving - only lasted a few years","review":"We bought the iron in 2003 or 2004 and today it produces no heat at all.

From more widely known facts, such as who the first man to play Bond was; to more obscure bits of information, such as the domestic and international grosses of all the Bond films; a true Bond fan is sure to spend hours delving into all the little quirks and idiosyncrasies that make agent 007 such an icon to so many.If there is one drawback to the book, it is that the book is an encyclopedia, and so it is presented in that form... alphabetical order, brief articles on many different entries... so the book tends to be somewhat of a tedious read at times. I would certainly not recommend it to someone who doesn't love Bond movies, but if you do, it is an absolute requirement to finish any Bond collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"He Does His Homework for JAMES BOND","review":"Steven Jay Rubin has been long underrated as a James Bond enthusiast and seeker of fact on the subject in my opinion. He has always gone to great lengths to obtain accurate information for his published writings.If you are looking solely for photographs go elsewhere. If you want factual objective information based on exhausted research, this is the book for you. He does his homework.I highly recommend this book.I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Bond Book Yet","review":"Steven Jay Rubin does an outstanding job of gathering everything there is to know(and there is everything) about james bond. The content, in depth reports, behind the scenes pictures, and format really make this one of the best sources of information for James Bond movies anywhere. It gets you envolved with these movies wether you are a casual or hard-core fan. The information in this book is genuine, and very interesting. It is obvious that a lot of time and effort was put into this, and I like the results. I would recomend this to anyone, wether a Bond fan, or just a movie fan in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bondage gone mad !!!!!!!!!","review":"This is nothing short of a fantastic work of Rubin's dealing in great detail with everybody's favourite agent. The sheer comprehensiveness of the book and the fact that Rubin produces tasty morcels of information that any bond fan would relish, makes it a five star book. Particularly interesting are the character and actor profiles but basically it is possible to find an entry on any given bond-related subject within this book. On the whole magnificent !!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"this is ovverated and not very good","review":"The idea of this book is a great one. There is allot of good information. The problem is that the author puts his own personal opinions in it. It ruins it. After reading it, it sounded like the author had a personal vendatta against roger moore.

Forget this one. there are plenty of really good books about bond out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this garbage!","review":"This is definitly not the \\"complete Bond film book\\", It's rather the most unfinished I've ever seen.

But it was very disappointing. The all black and white pictures look old and some have bad quality. You may think that of course a picture form the movie Goldfinger must look old because it's a movie from the early sixties but, you know what I mean. I have seen pictures from Thunderball and other movies in full color and look spectacular but not in this book.

I expected it to last several years. It worked very well for about 18 months. Then it just made a loud grinding noise when a pencil was inserted.Because I am somewhat mechanically inclined, I opened up the sharpener to figure out how to fix it.

The gear that drives the cutters is made of plastic. Over time, the plastic gear cracks and renders the sharpener usesless. The motor will run forever, but because of the broken plastic gear, the machine will not work. There are no replacement parts for this malfunction. A machine of this cost (approx. $130) should have better workmanship and available replacement parts. It is a pencil sharpener. The gears should be made of metal rather than plastic. However, then it would last too long, and Elmers would not be able to sell you another. I have had three of these machines break in the exact same place.

We've had a number of these sharpeners in the elementary school where I work, and they are awesome. Especially if you've never used a shapener that cost of $18.95. But it will break or wear out or whatever goes wrong inside. It's really frustrating to have the greatest pencil sharpener in the world quit on you. Without notice. I have mixed feelings about buying this one. I wouldn't mind a $18.95 sharpener breaking down on me near as much as having a $135 sharpener break down on me.

I consider myself to be in good shape, do work-out videos- TurboJam, Bikini Body, etc. This one is by far the most challenging workout I've done.The combination of cardio and weights is great and it really pushes you to excel and get your heart rate up.The only thing I didn't like was that the filming of it once in a while changes so that it's almost like the camera is shooting at a slight angle.Recommend for sure-"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ultimate Fat Burn purchased on Amazon","review":"I received this DVD in record time and used it the same day. I just love it. It is quite a work out, but I felt really good after. If there is a con to this it is all the advertising before the work out starts. You can't fast forward to the workout either. I feel if I'm paying for the work out DVD I shouldn't have to waste my time with advertising, I want to get right to it. I highly recommend this work out DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Challenge Whatsoever.","review":"Personally I think this workout is worthless - there is nothing difficult about it and I didn't even break a sweat. My mom tried this workout as well and said the same thing. While the instruction is fine and Amy Dixon is a decent instructor, if you're looking for a challenge, this isn't the DVD for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workout!!","review":"I love this workout. This is the 1st Women's Health DVD I bought and I wasn't disappointed. I have never been big into weights, always focusing on the cardio instead. I like how you alternate between weights and cardio during the 1/2 hour. I also like how easy the moves were and how well Amy Dixon explains them. I hate it when I buy a cardio DVD to try and the moves are too complicated and by the time you realize you aren't sweating because you can't keep up, you have wasted your time and then don't get in a good calorie burn for the day. Nothing is more frustrating to a morning exerciser than that! Getting up early for no sweat! I also like how the woman doing the DVD are all different shapes and sizes. No one is perfect and it's really encouraging to see that in a fitness DVD. Worth the money!! I use this over and over!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my Favorites","review":"Really fun workout - Amy Dixon is fun, does really well on queing and is the only DVD where I felt the endorphins kick in. Its difficult and I'd say for advanced cardio exercise, but one can work up to the full intensity. Just a lot of fun, a great workout. I'd recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that useful","review":"How to Fight Cancer & WinNice stories, some good recipes.Not useful for non-small cancer.I could have spent my time better than reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the paper it's printed on","review":"As a cancer patient, I had great hopes when I ordered this book.

However! There are some questionable methods, and alternative treatments described which may or may not be helpful. Possibly I have not used a system fully or accurately, and should not speak to the effectiveness of these treatments, but my final reaction has been that there are no guarantees, that there are treatment centers which may just be taking the money of desperate people unable to give them the cure they seek. Each person must find the right help, choose the right treatments, and ultimately put their trust in God for the outcome.

All the beats and his flow just sound so tired and weak. Sounds like he was going for a real poppy sound on a lot of this or something. It reminds me of Eminem's 'Encore' album the way his whole sound just completely fell off. I thought of giving him two stars for at least attempting something new with the weird 'Beach Chair' beat, but honestly, I'd rather listen to generic street rap than this weak stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"the world has gone mad","review":"Please stop the madness and the hype. Jay Z, Jigga, Shawn C. whatever moniker you choose to address him by - should have stayed in retirement. He missed with this one and tried to compensate with an entourage of A list producers. The heart and soul (i.e. passion) is clearly missing.\\"I am the Michael Jordan of record'an\\" - \\"Show Me What Ya Got\\". This is just one of countless examples of how lame and cliche this return from retirement is. Does anybody remember when MJ came out of retirment? What he was like with the Wizards? nuff said.If this CD - ironically titled Kingdom Come is all J has... God help hiphop. Resurrect a real emcee to do the thang."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry Jay...","review":"This is by far his worst album. He's great lyrically, but the beats do no match up at all. Sad that Jay left us with a classic, The Black Album, and comes back with this. The best track he's made this year is on the Nas album, Hip Hop Is Dead. What a shame though...I'm a big Jigga fan but this album was a letdown.To all the people who like this album, you are out of your mind...this isnt what Jigga's full potential is."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE RETIRE","review":"Hip Hop is dead. What does that mean? You know Run DMC thought the same about hip hop when 2pac and BIG ran the show. Its not dead its just changing. I look at what Jay and Nas doing is as wanting rappers to be like them. Well that aint happenin. Rappers have realized that when you be yourself and be comfortable with being yourself then thats when your career will take off. For example look at TI, Lil Wayne, Jeezy, The Game, 50 Cent(even though I dont care for his music), Jim Jones, and the garbage D4L type groups. These guys are successful because they do what works for them. Its kind of a major statement to say \\"the game needs me\\". No the game doesn't, you need the game Jay. My advise is go retire again, he is a much better business man than he is a rapper(can you believe that I once was a fan lol)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jay-Z can do no wrong","review":"Jay-Z has gotten a lot of flack for this album, but I still like it. It's definately not his best, but still great. Jay-Z is constantly reinventing himself, and this is a great example of this. People expect this album to be another Reasonable Doubt, but thats not realistic. Jay-Z is no longer on the corner selling drugs or whatever hustle he was doing in Brooklyn. He is now in his thirties and working corporate America, so it only make sense that lyrics reflects his life. I have to say, Jay-Z is the only rapper that can make a whole album about the rich lifestyle and make it this good. This is an album for hip-hop fans, not rap fans. Rapfans just want to hear about guns, sex, money and drugs. Hip-hop fans understand that the music is a reflection life. Maybe i'm just being bias because Jay-Z can do no wrong in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful production squashed this one.","review":"I like Jay-Z, don't get me wrong. I think his rhymes are great, his ideas are always interesting. But this album is awful.As an audio engineer, I can hear that there are some interesting samples going on in these tracks, but when it comes down to it, the mix and mastering are what killed this record. The mix is terrible. I have a lot of respect for Dre, but I think this album proves that he needs to stick to beats and that mixing is just simply not his thing.Listen to the Black Album, then put this one in. The BA sounds really great, at least for a hip hop record, while this one is thin, overcompressed, and not even the bass hits you hard! You would think at least that would be right.Maybe the next time he retires we'll get a better record..."},{"rating":"2","title":"hip-hop is back","review":"It's not my favorite Jay-Z album, but it is one of the hottest CDs out right now compared to all the dirty south, candy beats, so called crunk hip-hop that's dominating the charts right now. I do have some fav's already on the album like, \\"Oh my God\\", but I'm always against a collab with a girlfriend. He should have left Beyonce to do her own thing. Overall, it's a good CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"remember \\"the wizards\\"?","review":"This album reminds me of jordans 2nd comeback. It's full of watered down commercial crap. If this is what he has to offer music wise, he should stick to his presidential duties. I could expect this kind of lackluster pop rap from some 18 yr old up & commer. Jay has already proven himself as a platinum selling artist, so ther was no reason for him to \\"dumb\\" down his lyrics & use \\"cookie cutter\\" beats. Even the dre tracks sound like subpar detox rejects.

So they're supposed to all rap about the same things regardless of the life they live at the time right? Great idea!!

That way they can keep the hip hop culture in the NWA days and never move the culture on to anything else! YES! Trash Jay when he gets thoughtful! Don't buy anything unless it's GANSTA! And outlaw Outkast, Lupe, Mos Def, Common, and Talib while your at it!How dare an accomplished rapper try to break the mold of what popular rap can be and make uplifting songs like Beach Chair!! But then again I'm white. What do I know about sarcasm?Make it rain!! Bump some thoughtful music like \\"Na Na NaNa Na\\" or \\"Air Force Ones\\"!

HE HAS GROWN UP AND HE IS TALKING ABOUT GROWN UP THINGS AND EXPERIENCES THAT HE HAS GONE THRU UP TO THIS POINT. THIS IS JUST MY OPINION. I LIKE THE ALBUM AND I THINK THAT IT IS A GREAT PIECE OF WORK.

I enjoy the artistry and flair that comes to the musical experience of his music but this album just touches you in ways that I do not think the previous ones do. Ups and downs and laughs and frowns this one is stupendous with a lot of heart. I hope he goes out on top or plays in some action hero movie, because I do not think it gets much better than this.

His formula of succes is put a mean beat together and talk about what he has and can buy. Lyrcially he was smashed by NAS and Eminem the later on his own album Blueprint and I would love to put a few others against and watch him die a slow death Common, Tali, Dead Prez, Dre 3000 (pre Speaker Box era) Don't get me wrong he has songs that I like but greatest Rapper...NOT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did HOVA mention Myspace in a song??","review":"...Because i think he mentioned that he didn't have a myspace in a song.

I ripped the album from a friend, planning to buy it if i enjoyed it, but this album didn't last for two hours on my hard drive. Unlike HOVA's earlier productions, the beats in this album overpower the rapping...Oftentimes the tracks seem too busy, with crowded samples and fairly uninteresting beats behind Jay (Even Dre's!) Even when the beat isn't dominant and obnoxious, Jay's rhymes (although they are still better than most radio rap) just have no lasing value...this album is without a \\"99 Problems\\", \\"Big Pimpin\\", or \\"Takeover\\"...I can't seem to remember a single hook or chorus.With any luck, this album will mark Jay's retirement.

Then he raps about having good credit. He raps about having good credit, and credit cards.

Chris Martin's track is boring as well. Jay Z likes to Compare himself to Michael Jordan, well on this Album he is Like Michael Jordan era with the Washington Wizards without Phil&Scottie on the Exercise Bike with the Blown out Knee. it's not good at all. The Camel had his run and now it's back to the Dessert. cliched Production as well. just a going through the motions. this is what happens when you can almost put out anything&it will go Platinum.

When I heard Jay-Z was making a new album, I was psyched. Now I'm disappointed. Jay's lyrics are lazy, the beats are dull, and the songs are boring. If Jay was going to put out something this bad, he should have stayed retired. Well I guess all the time off the mike got to him. Not only is this the worst Jay-Z album ever but it's also one of the year's worst albums. If your a Jay fan, stick to Reasonable Doubt, The Blueprint, and the Black Album.

Better luck next time Jigga man."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best B-side albums","review":"Inherently b-side albums are a hodge-podge of songs that really weren't meant to go together, and quite often the songs never made it to any album for good reason.

I thought the cd sounded over produced, and it didn't even have a slight punk rock sound. This cd was not pop punk, it was really just pop. If you are thinking about listening to MxPx for the first time, this is NOT the cd to start off with.

I would rahter have this book than all of the other materials I have read on elk in the last 20 years. WvZ takes a solid, practical approach to the subject. He is clearly an intelligent, experienced and ethical elk hunter. He is especially strong on the shooting, shot placement and equipment aspects. Any new elk hunter will be well prepared if he/she studies this book in advance. The advanced hunter will also get some good ideas and a worthwhile refresher. I review this volume before every elk hunt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Becoming the Elk Expert","review":"To the best of my knowledge, this book is a better choice thansome other items with which I am familiar. For example, I likethis book better than \\"Elk and Elk Hunting : Your Practical Guideto Fundamentals and Fine Points,\\" by Hartt Wixon, Hartt Wixom.Still, the author's approach is too narrow. The book leaves outmany interesting questions, which logically come to my mind when Ithink of elks and elk hunting. Specifically, strategy treatment isa weak point of the book.On the other hand, book has some attractive features, such ascertain aesthetic appeal and pleasantly surprising extensivecoverage of weapons & other arm related questions.Nevertheless, there are so many better ways to spend you time andmoney that you should carefully consider these other optionsbefore buying the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grace Cathedral Concert","review":"If you like the Afro/Cuban jazz sound performed inside a hugh cathedral, then this is the disk for you.

The mystery section is excellent and well done. It gives great examples, describes the genre elements necessary to a mystery, goes through various subgenres, and gives examples.Suspense/Thriller: Then I get to this section. Suspense and thriller are done together, with the focus on suspense. Where I got excellent examples of mysteries, for Thriller, I got \\"once upon a time\\" fairy tale stuff. Little was discussed about core elements of a thriller, no real examples given, and only a few subgenres were even mentioned--one of which, even at the time of this book's publication--is no longer selling well (techno). The section made me wonder if the author actually read any Thrillers.So for Mystery writers, it gets 3 stars; for Thrillers, I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous book!","review":"I read this book twice in a row just so I could fully absorb the lessons put forth by the author. I cannot recommend this book highly enough. Granted, it's geared towards mystery and suspense writers, but anyone interested in writing can pick up lessons from this book.

If you want to write a mystery or suspense novel, you owe it to yourself to read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Belongs on any Novelist's Shelf","review":"Despite its unfortunate title, this book is a gem. Carolyn Wheat presents straightforward descriptions of the mystery and suspense genres and gives writers succinct overviews of the arcs and story line patterns for each. The text is tightly written without the tonnage of repetition and filler seen in many writing how-to books. Wheat gives us loads of helpful tips along the way, some casually dropped that should be marked with your bright yellow highlighter and re-read several times. I would have given it five stars except for the last 25 pages which seemed unnecessary and more about the general novel-writing process.

I wanted a basic sharpener for my elementary aged kids. We use a lot of pencils! This works great, we've never had a problem. The motor is fine, the pencils come out with perfect points and stores a lot of shavings. I guess I wasn't expecting a lot when I bought this and am therefore, pleased. The four stars is only because the hole is small and cannot fit those big, fat pencils but I knew it when I bought it. I've never had any trouble putting a regular pencil in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only works for high quality pencils...","review":"The best thing I can say is that it's nice and heavy and has a large shavings compartment.Our kids get lots of pencils which have either poor quality wood or have ornamental covering on them which means you have some sort of thin plastic cover on the pencil instead of just paint.This pencil sharpener does not sharpen them very well. It either stalls out or struggles to give you a lopsided lead which you can barely write with.It works well for higher quality and more conventional pencils, though it does seem underpowered at times.The only consolation I have is that it was about ten bucks after rebate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one!","review":"This sharpener is not worth the money. I just bought it today and after attempting to sharpen 3 different pencils decided to give up and return it to Staples. None of the pencils went into the sharpener smoothly, and the end result in two out of the three cases were pencils with sharpened wood but no point. The motor seemed to be struggling from the getgo. I should have read reviews ahead of time and just gone with a Panasonic. It would have saved me a trip to the store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"Can't even give this one away! Had the same one for years (don't even remember the brand) but decided to get a new one because it seemed to be struggling to sharpen my pencils. I picked up what I thought would be a good one because of the brand and because it was at Staples. I thought I just didn't know how to use it at first because it ate my pencils! I tried to slow down my entry into the sharpening hole but the pencil would flop around and leave one side of wood. It sharpens REALLY sharp so that the point will break off. Maybe if I was a draftsman or something that might work but I only want a nice sharp pencil to make my grocery lists! I'm looking for something better on Amazon (should have gone to read the reviews there first!). Tried to give this away to some family members, some who are teachers, but after they saw how it works they said they'd rather use the old fashion crank type. Surely there's a better electric one out there. I know I had one. But I sent it to the Thrift Shop!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must use good pencils!","review":"I have had this pencil sharpener for over 2 years and it works great on good pencils. I have found that the cheaper the pencil, the worse it performs. I started to buy only Ticonderga pencils a year ago and I have had no problems with its performance. The good pencils also hold their point and erasers longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wobbly sharpener, uneven points","review":"Avoid this sharpener. The plastic mounts that hold the cutter shaft in place are too weak and flexible, and the cutter assembly is not well balanced. This allows the cutters to wobble inside the housing, which makes the sharpener cut unevenly. You get a point that is off-center, half exposed lead and half wood. You have to keep rotating your pencil and jabbing it in to even things out, grinding away half of it in the process. If you want to sharpen a pencil with an X-Acto product, I'd suggest one of their scalpel knives and a steady hand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sharpener doesn't sharpen","review":"This pencil sharpener destroys pencils and does not sharpen straight. It cuts off center missing the lead. the motor struggles, and one ends up with just a broken stub or wood. It eats the pencil rapidly.

Playing the CD on my laptop, I was disappointed with the overall sound quality. The music and lyrics are all clear enough, so there's no problem with that. To me it just sounded a bit more hollow than other live albums I've listened to. A minor quibble, worth only half star deduction really."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Trip","review":"Unlike other Dover books, this text does not require an extensive background in math and fluency in the language of proofs. It is, as the title suggests, a delightful excursion through number theory that will ignite your interest in the subject and move you to further study.I found the author's annotations helpful and I did not mind the occasional use of British vernacular. At many points in the text, Ogilvy & Anderson prompt the reader to pursue a question on their own, rather than walk through a full proof or explanation. This may seem abrupt, but it keeps the text focused and leaves the reader wanting to know more about number theory.I hope Dover continues to reach out to a general audience with books like this. It condenses a difficult subject into everyday language without condescending to the reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"A popular math book, so no math required","review":"This is not a math book from the point of learning number theory. It is a popular math book which gives a reader some basic understanding of a little bit of number theory.The audience for this book are laypeople and the examples and subject matter is very casual.For those who enjoy popular math books I have a warning: with the current explosion of popular math books you will probably have seen most of this material.Math people will not find anything in this book, but hey it is a nice easy read for the casual reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Journey","review":"This is a reprint of one of the books that most inspiredmy interest in mathematics as a boy.

I especially like the aspect of the Pre-Messiah society. Where they still depend on blood sacrifice to cover sins, and where they eagerly await the messiah. You don't see it as much in this book as in Fusion Fire, but it's definitely there. Kathy Tyers does an excellent job of portraying the greatness, and different aspects of God through her books. I have found the Firebird trilogy (books 1 & 2 at least) to be very thought provoking, as well as well-written. Some christian books are quite poorly written, or not properly proof-read. A disappointing reality. Firebird is one of the best books I've ever read.

Almost as soon as I started reading it, I fell in love with it. The writing just drew me in.

The book was already in poor condition, so I decided to buy a brand new copy of it. Haven't read it a third time yet, but I plan to.I rarely read books more than once. The Firebird Trilogy is one of the few exceptions. I highly recommend this book.My only disappointment is that I can't get this trilogy in ebook format."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Wary! This is a Religious Re-Write of the Original Sci-Fi","review":"I very much enjoyed the original 1987 mass-market version of Firebird and the later Fusion Fire, then published by Bantom Books Spectra. I purchased the Firebird Trilogy published by Bethany House believing it to include the same earlier editions along with the long awaited third volume and snatched it up. However, I am disappointed with the new religious version. I liked the strong Firebird from before, but now she is recast into a weaker, less focused, less driven woman whom I find less interesting.This new version is not bad, but definitely not what I was expecting. I don't know if this was a marketing ploy, but usually when an author re-writes ('improves') a book, it is a selling point and thus emphasized on the cover (new and improved, author's preferred edition, etc). It is interesting that it wasn't labelled so in this case.Know what you are buying!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I got lost","review":"I was lost from the beginning.All the outer space terminology was too much.I like a book that can catch me from the start and this book definately had me frustated 10 chapter into it.

Despite the fact that many of these acts would be considered failures, they obviously mean or have meant something to someone. Not everyone in this book can be considered a true unknown, but it would take a knowledgable person indeed to have heard of a few of them. One of my favorites is a fifteen year old kid named Joe Docko. Joe's band, the Mystic Tide, is one of the bands whose songs have been included on the cd that comes inside the back cover. \\"Frustration\\" is one of the great undiscovered moments in garage rock history, and Joe Docko tossed out the original masters because he didn't think anyone would care.

However, it is a miserable pencil sharpener for those who care about a perfectly sharpened pencil. It's slow, noisy, and the \\"auto-stop\\" feature is practically non-existent. The only way you know when your pencil has been completely sharpened is when you remove it from the sharpener and look at the point... again and again.Instead, you might want to look into any of the Panasonic electric sharpeners. I own two, and they are perfect -- the auto-stop really works, they're fast, and they produce the most perfect points from any sharpener I've ever seen. I wanted to like the Boston sharpener, but it just didn't happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing","review":"this sharpener struggles to sharpen a pencil. it's slow, it's noisy and it does only a mediocre job. this sharpener is a result of the corporate world's desire to find a way to make something cheaper. \\"let's make it cheaper, sell if for the same price, and thereby make more money.\\" it's a downward spiral. every company tries to make a cheaper product than the competition and pretty soon it is impossible to find a pencil sharpener that _really_ works. that's just the way the world works today, i guess.

I have contacted the company several times. No response. In a futile attempt to have the sharpeners repaired or replaced, my students wrote letters to the company.

It then gradually gets worse and worse and finally gives up the ghost around spring break. Our team al had this sharpener. Every single one broke down. They are no good, period.X-Acto sells replacement blades, but they cost north of $20 -- with shipping, that's nearly $75 annually for a shoddy sharpener.I now haunt garage and estate sales, looking for 30- or 40-year old models.

Being a science teacher, I tried to take it apart and modify it to work, but it was not \\"fixable\\" (all the other teachers sent me theirs to fix too).

I bought this sharpener, hoping it would last at least for one year. When I first used it, you can tell that the machine feels very delicate and cheap already but it did sharpen very sharp. It's barely been about 3 weeks since I bought it and just yesterday, I was putting a pencil in and it just stopped sharpening. The machine was still on and working with the sounds noticeable but it just didn't sharpen the pencil anymore. I was so mad. I am also not into taking my time to write a review for any product but it was a waste of money so I wanted to get the word out. Don't buy this cheap sharpener. It was about $85 at office depot but it's not What u pay for. It's a very cheap quality and won't last for not even a month.

It worked for the first year because I sharpened all pencils and treated it with kid gloves. It worked, but the sharpening was not symmetrical and usually required another try because the lead was not exposed all round the pencil. At the beginning of the next year, I decided to allow the students to use it. Within a month, it no longer worked. Finding no suitable alternative, I purchased another. For three months, it performed as poorly as the first one originally had, then broke down completely. It does not live up to the manufacturer's claims. In other words, look elsewhere for a good heavy-duty electric pencil sharpener."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great while it lasted","review":"I bought this item a couple of years ago for my classroom. Only I, the teacher, was allowed to touch it, since it was so expensive. I was very persnickety about it, and never used it to sharpen pencils with plastic coatings. Despite my fanaticism and care, the sharpener only lasted about four months. The cheap (but loud) model I used before is still going strong. Don't waste your money on this fancy but unreliable model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works great for 3 months","review":"I was so happy when I got this pencil sharpener. I looked high and low for a sharpener with a quiet motor and high volume capacity. I did not want my classroom disturbed by the constant sound of the sharpener. When the sharpener arrived it was super quiet and sharpened well. That was three months ago. Three months of classroom use has turned this sharpener into a loud, slow operating sharpener. Depending on the pencil, some students have to stand and sharpen for over a MINUTE!! I have decided to purchase a cheaper electric and also purchase about ten of the cheap hand held plastic sharpeners. I would caution anyone considering dropping fifty dollars of their own money on this sharpener. I regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works well...at first.","review":"Rarely do I write reviews for products, but I wanted to make sure that all the other teachers out there steer clear of this sharpener.

Works great out of the box but after a few months(really...months!?!) of everyday use it's production starts to decline rapidly. The sharpener sharpens off-center and will often break the lead.

HA!! Too funny. This sharpener is poorly designed with plastic gears at an angle that causes the shavings to get packed into them. That is why it sharpens off center all the time. It is always getting jammed. I have taken it apart several times to diagnose and repair it for my wife. Why don't they make metal gears at a down angle from them?

The motor is easily overloaded with very slight pressure and often grabs hold of the pencil and starts it spinning,,(this is not for a youngster or classroom), and finally and most importantly to me, it does not sharpen pencils evenly. The wood on one side of the pencil will be within a millimeter of the pencil point. The 6 hole gray wheel does not securely locate itself into place, this allows the pencil to wobble in place while being sharpened, hence the useless point. A complete waste of money in my opinion.

I teach first grade and I don't let my students use the pencil sharpener--I sharpen their pencils for them. I would use it only 3 times a week. With that in mind, this pencil sharpener only had about 60 uses before it died. Furthermore, when in use, the pencil shavings would come out of the top of the cup, even though the cup was securely in place. It is this type of quality that makes my blood boil as I purchased this sharpener with my own money to make my job easier.December of 2010: I have since gotten another one of these sharpeners and it quit working as well (for about 3 hours and then suddenly it started working again). The shavings still come out the top of the cup even with it securely in place. I will continue to use this until it stops working and then will look for a different brand.

The only reason I got the last one was because the store offered a replacement insurance for an extra five bucks. When the sharpener wore out after 3 months, the store said the manufacturer's warranty (2 year) took precedence. Their process of replacement is not worth the time, and do I really want another one anyway???My first grade teaching partner has had the exact same experience with these.

They break, they chew through pencils (esp the office max/office depot kind, which are cheapest, we know!), and they don't stop when the pencil is sharp, so kids just keep jamming the pencils in! The multiple holes for different sizes seemed nice, but kids turn it and then try to sharpen a standards size pencil with the largest hole and end up breaking chunks of pencil off in the grinder.

I have cleaned it many times trying to discover if there's something stuck inside, but no. It's free of obstructions.

The second one lasted about a year and a half. The company replaced it for free after I complained. The replacement lasted only a few months. They all had the same problem.

My search continues for a good, quiet, strong, RELIABLE sharpener. My Panasonic has been going for four years, but when it's tired, it just quits. It gets tired after about four student pencils.

Wonderful, powerful songs retell the story of the men and women of the Civil War. Inspired by actual letters and speeches of the day, the music and lyrics offer the listener a sense of the deep emotions felt by the authors.

I fell in love with it and purchased the complete work. I love its mix of country, light rock, ballads and gospel to tell the very human, yet tragic, story of the Civil War. The quotes by Lincoln, Joshua Chamberlain and others are well-chosen and professionally performed. It has the right ingredients of sadness, joy, humor and insight. Listeners can't help but be drawn in to sense the full range of human emotion that is a by-product on any war. Frank Wildhorn's music has touched my heart and soul with The Civil War. I have been listening to it for months and have yet to grow tired of this wonderful work. Sadly, the show was on Broadway for only 63 days. I hope the show goes on tour. It is one I wouldn't want to miss. I highly recommend The Civil War."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good thing to buy if you're a Wildhorn fan...","review":"I bought this concept album of Wildhorn's latest Broadway show (OBCR as yet unreleased) and it really let me down.

It is somewhat true to what one would expect from the creator of The Scarlet Pimpernel and Jekyl and Hyde but mostly it is a completely independent experience. My biggest complaint was that I am not a country music fan and Civil War is full of it. All in all I would say this is a stirring, unique and surprising oratorio from Frank Wildhorn who shows some greater depth in research yet lesser depth in composition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please tour the country again!!!!","review":"I saw the play in Pgh. several yrs. ago and bought both cds.

Pray for peace!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Songs organized around a theme do not a musical make","review":"Pretty songs, beautifully sung. But there's no narrative, no progression, no climax. Frank Wildhorn writes great pop tunes, but not musicals. Wish he'd give himself a crash course on dramatic structure -- hole up and watch and LISTEN to the musicals of Rodgers & Hammerstein and Lerner & Loewe and Frank Loesser and gain an understanding that a song should take a character to the next level. It's a nice album, though -- easy listening. But doesn't give you those chills down the spine that a great original cast recording of a truly great musical PLAY will."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very, very disappointing....","review":"I honestly thought that Frank Wildhorn could do much better (after Jekyll & Hyde etc.). I expected something much more of something with such a moving theme. All this 'musical' is is a bunch of pop stars singing (and I use the term losely) some less than average songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"What album have you been listening?","review":"The album I heard heard contained bad rock, phony gospel and banal lyrics. Wildhorn could write decent songs if he took a contemporary setting. They didnt sing rock in the nineteenth century. He also should reread his junior high history book to get a better perspective on the war. It wasn't only to free the slaves!The show opened and closed immediately- I can see why!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No wonder the Brits dominate musical theater","review":"The problem with this show and its accompanying recording is not its lack of narrative sructure - many a brilliant piece of theater has thrived by shedding the conventions of traditional storytelling (Cabaret, Sunday in the Park with George, Company). The problem, quite frankly, is that Wildhorn's compositions are banal and not the least bit challenging. We could forgive such Superbowl half-time show nonsense as 'By the Sword' if it dealt with love and loss in a college dormitory; as an anthem about a potent passage of American history, it's a flat-out joke.Could the man have devised a less subtle approach? Could his music more closely resemble a rejected segment from the 'America Sings' ride at Disneyland?Could I be more disappointed with the state of American musical theater? Save us, Sondheim; save us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frank Wildhorn is the master of cliche.","review":"The works of Frank Wildhorn are absolutely awful. Think of a corny cliche, and Frank Wildhorn will have it in his lyrics. The music is also cliched. It all sounds the same.

It is a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment to anyone who's seen the broadway show","review":"The Broadway cast for this show was awesome. There are some included on the CD (e.g.-Michael Lanning, and \\"Broadway All Stars\\"), but Hootie sings one of Keith Byron Kirk's songs (his best was excluded from the album), and quite honestly massacres it. Kirk has an incredible voice that demands to be heard, and cannot on this album. Plus Bebe Winans, who is an excellent gospel singer, sings a gospel song, \\"River Jordan\\", which was sung unbelievable well (and in my opinion better) by the Broadway cast member. Travis Tritt (not in the Broadway version) does an excellent job on \\"The Day the Sun Stood Still\\", and Michael Lanning is excellent on the songs he sings, both on this album and in the play. In addition, the songs sung by the Broadway All Stars, especially \\"By the Sword/Sons of Dixie\\" were well done. Overall a disappointment. If Atlantic had a clue, they would have recorded the original cast."},{"rating":"2","title":"AS GOOD AS LES MSERABLES, REALLY BEAUTIFUL.","review":"Frank Wildhorn writes beautiful music.This is an excellent musical and worth seeing and listening to. It goes through our tragic Civil War using letters and songs. Forget what the critics said(they said the same thing about Les Miz and look how great that is.)

I was hooked. And, when I say 'hooked', I mean I went out searching for this soundtrack (and they happened at to have a copy at our local music store), and tried to find out as much as I could about the cast and the show. Sadly, the show had closed already (and it would be a few years before I was able to travel to New York City anyway), and I would never get a chance to see it. Still, the CD is amazing. Through the songs, the listeners can feel the sadness and strife of the time. I just wish I had had a chance to see the play."},{"rating":"2","title":"I CAN'T BELIEVE IT CLOSED!","review":"I feel so fortunate to have seen it in Houston and in New York, as well as having heard the authors speak of their research and the great respect they felt toward the letters they read, the photographs they saw and the battlefields they visited. The show was so very well received by those who actually saw it. The critics didn't help; but in trying to understand it, I could only think that tourists in New York want to be entertained by something light and funny. Who knows? I am so glad I have the CD, and I only hope there is some kind of life to the show in the future. The best part of the CD over the New York show, was the deletion of I NEVER KNEW HIS NAME from the the finished product. I can hardly wait for the show in progress, HAVANA, written for Wildhorn's wife, Linda Eder. I understand this will be on a much lighter note."},{"rating":"2","title":"The music of The Civil War had me on my feet!","review":"On my honeymoon to see the \\"classic\\" Broadway shows in NYC, I happened into The Civil War while it was in previews.

I am not a civil war buff nor do I call myself a music know-it-all but this music is moving and inspirational. The many, varied well known artists only add to the ambiance- out of many walks of life do we share the history of the civil war- it is one of those historical events that bring us all together. I'll listen to this often."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Good","review":"Being both a musical theater fan and an obsessive Civil War nut, I loved seeing the two combined in this great album. I've got to admit, I was a little put off when I saw that they had Hootie and the Blowfish, Travis Tritt, and a dozen other pop artists masquerading as historical figures, but the whole thing works surprisingly well. The music is closer to stuff you'd here on your local pop or country radio station than stuff you'd hear a bunch of Union Army personnel humming around a nineteenth century campfire, but it's very moving at times, and even funny at other times. And the lyrics are awesome! I can really tell the writers did their homework on this. Most of these songs were copied, almost verbatim, from old Civil War era letters and speeches. Bottom line is, this music is beautiful, and you might even learn a few things while you're listening to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good marker - Read my low ink trick","review":"I like these... it's hard to find red or orange markers for books with the right size chisel edge and only in either color.

I found these on amazon and using my Prime mebership, received them within 2 days. The color is just as promised from other reviews - crayon yellow. For the price, these cannot be beat! Since today is my first day using the Berol ones, I cannot comment on how long they will last...but who cares because I have 12 of them!

I relatively smooth when you highlight and comes with a chisel tip. Even though it is not stated anti-smear or has smear-gaurd like Sharpie, it doesn't smear my writing or documents. The only issue that I have with this type of highlighter is that it is not bright as I want it to be. Other highlighters are bright and yellow while these are more yellow to orange mixed.

It did just an average job on both carpets and hard surfaces (tile floors). More disappointing was the quality of workmanship. We only used it occassionally, and tried to follow all instructions, however it literally fell apart while my wife was using it. The various plastic clips, attachements, etc. would regularly come off while in use. Even though it only received light usage, the motor got hot enough to melt the plastic motor mounts rendering the front rotating brush useless. Eventually, the motor literally went up in smoke.

Its ability to suck up the water is fair and the carpet needs almost a day to completely air dry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Apartment","review":"This vacuum was extremely well priced. It has a small load capacity (about half the size) which means lots of emptying while cleaning. However, it has the motorized brushes, which are amazing.

I had a few requirements: we have a small townhouse, so I didn't want a hulking machine, I wanted to be able to comfortably carry and maneuver it at 6+-months pregnant, and I wanted to be able to store it easily. The Bissell 2090 fit the bill. The assembly was a piece of cake, it's easier to carry up the stairs than one of my kids, and it'll get the job done in a jiffy. It doesn't seem great at stain remover, but I also didn't bother to pretreat, so I don't know that I can fault the machine for that.

Considering I am very particular and difficult to please, that is high praise! I read all of the reviews before buying and I'd give it 4.5 stars. I'd say 5 stars, but the small water tank is a bit of a drawback. I have spent a lot of time refilling the tank while cleaning all of the carpets in my home. Otherwise, this machine is wonderful. I have cream-colored carpets, a boyfriend who never wipes his feet, and 3 cats. My carpets had not been cleaned in 2 years. Last time I rented a Rug Doctor and was surprised at how many of the stains it did not remove. This machine took out the old stains and the new ones as well. It was very easy to assemble and so lightweight. I purchased the Bissell 2x fiber cleansing formula (WalMart) and it worked great, although for the worst stains I used a stonger mix of solution than recommended.

I really like this cleaner, it overall does a pretty good job, though I had some pet stains on light carpet that it did not fully remove the stain, even after pre-treating the stain. So I give this a 4/5 for that reason alone.

I'm hard headed I guess it took me that many times to learn there is NO customer service. The directions must be viewed under a microscope and still don't help.

It cleans up her accidents very nicely and easily. She's got an infection so she's having lots of accidents. I keep the machine loaded and ready to go and it makes cleaning a breeze.The only negative thing I have to say about it is that the clips which hold the dirty water container in place are flimsy and can be difficult to get into place. If you don't get them snapped in place just right, the machine doesn't work right and you usually can't tell until you are in the middle of using it. They will often pop off entirely while I am trying to get them snapped down on the container. It's frustrating, but overall I am very pleased with this machine.

Unfortunately, many well-meaning 20 somethings have tried to implement Harris' backward approach to dating and its resulted in young adults who don't have good relationship skills. The best way to get to know another person is on a one-on-one date. Women don't respect 25 year old men who ask them on group dates or try and pretend that a visit to a coffee shop- where she pays for her own beverage- counts as a real date. Dating isn't sinful. People are sinful when they take advantage of each other."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong premise, wrong conclusion","review":"Harris seems to have a great heart and passion in this book. Unfortunately, when one writes from a wrong foundation of both biblical and personal contexts, one always arrives at the wrong conclusion. Biblically, Harris butchers texts...personally, he had bad dating experiences, thus dating is bad. Dating - this is a word...courtship - this is a word. Between these two, is there a more godly word? He says courtship. Chapter and verse for support? None. Let God's perspective on relationships be our basis and not someone who is speaking from the context of bad dating experiences.

Now here I am, 25 years old and just learning how to pursue a woman for a relationship. This book has created an environment in churches where men literally try to figure out if they want to marry a woman before they ask them out to dinner or even coffee. Women in churches are frustrated because they never get asked out by Christian men who are searching for a spouse before they even spend two hours alone with a woman and find out more about her one-on-one. I sympathize with the female reviewer that said this book ruined her life. It is THAT BAD. Do yourself a favor and don't read it. Having sex before marriage is clearly sinful, but the implication that it is wrong to go to dinner with someone of the opposite sex with the intention of getting to know them better is absurdity at its finest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"This was a great and easy read.

Recreational dating has hurt far too many people. More than that, it is really preparation for divorce - learning how to deal with broken relationships instead of learning how to stay committed, even when things get tough. The whole issue is boiled down to two factors - am I honouring God in my relationship and am I honouring my Christian brother or sister?

Take the insights and apply them as the Holy Spirit directs you. I CAN tell you from experience that the students that I have worked with, who HAVE applied many or MOST of these principles, have had much more successful relationships than the ones who did not. I admittedly had written this book of as bunk for many years until I read through and realized that there was a deep regret for not having realized these truths earlier.A great book, to be applied by each reader as it fits his/her own situation.

Most of the people that gave Harris a negative review found one example or even one statement that they did not like. If you get the general point of the book, that you should put God first and develop a strong relationship with Him, and devote the time that you are single to serve him, then you will love this book. I suspect that most people read the title and begin reading the book, wanting to hate it. AND THEY DO!!! Its easy to hate a book that tells you to put your human wants and desires second to God and His plan for you!!!

I read this when I was much much younger and thought it was fantastic. After 10 plus years have past I have a very different point of view. I believe Pastor Harris needs to take responsibility for the advice that he gives out. Quite simply, it's books like these which impede Christian relationships from ever starting. Relying on the message of this book some have kissed dating goodbye before they ever really started. I say you should give dating a fair chance and then decide for yourself.

But I think it is very extreme and would be hard to implement in normal life; furthermore, I believe that the goal of his theory on dating (honoring God in relationships, forming a foundation for healthy and holy marriages) can be attained through other, less drastic methods. But it is an interesting read and it might be helpful to understand his point of view."},{"rating":"1","title":"watch out","review":"I very much recommend \\"Boundaries in Dating\\" by Cloud and Townsend if you are considering getting \\"I kissed dating goodbye.\\" Cloud and Townsend take a responsible approach to dating, show how to avoid the pitfalls, and express valid concerns about the 'kissed dating goodbye' book.

It choked on those annoying plastic-covered pencils, so we taught the kids to remove the plastic before sharpening. It sharpened unevenly after the first month or two. It got slower and louder gradually until it finally just stopped spinning entirely. Exploratory disassembly showed no obvious problems, so probably the motor failed. To the dump it goes, and we'll have to find something new that teachers rate well. Maybe we'll just go back to the manual sharpeners..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Bad Design","review":"Is it no longer possible to find a good electric pencil sharpener? I'm starting to think so. After buying and discarding several, I bought this \\"heavy-duty sharpener\\", but it's a piece of junk just like the others I've bought recently. The sharpening mechanism is way off-center. You can grind up the whole pencil and never get a good point. Every pencil comes out with a heavy slab of wood on one side, making it necessary to finish the job with a knife. Based on my experience, this product is good for nothing other than grinding pencils into sawdust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk!! Poor plastic internal gears","review":"This product is complete JUNK. It should be banned. Negative comments abound here, but there are so few electrics anymore people are desparate. Internal gears are VERY FLIMSY PLASTIC that destroy each other. I took mine apart when it died and the problem is obvious: extremely poor quality parts!! It is built to fail!

Certain Staples and Office Depot brand pencils don't work that well with this. Others work fine, very tempramental machine. I had another Exacto that I bought before this one that still works fine.

I initially found it to be great. Certainly much better than the other electric pencil sharpener that many other teachers at my school have. But it stopped working recently. I thought it was jammed so I brought it home in order to take it apart and fix it. What I found was the central part that rotates was broken. Why? Because it is made of plastic. Several other internal parts are plastic as well. This machine is designed to break. It lasted for one school year, which is pretty good for a relatively cheap sharpener.

Literally three days later, the motor seized up and ceased to do anything but make noise.I attempted to fix it following the instructions for removing blockages on X-Acto's website, but the inside was pristine and undamaged, and I could not find any blockages.DickBlick happily sent a free replacement. I was particularly careful with this one, making sure that only writing pencils were used in it. Two weeks later, the same problem occurred.

Very poor quality. It worked well for about a month; it then began to get really loud and fail to sharpen the pencils.

Unfortunately, it failed after only a few years of very moderate home use. I took it apart and discovered the motor has cheap plastic bearings. Once the rotor started bouncing against the stator, it wasn't long before the slip exceeded the ability to generate torque."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk!","review":"I bought this just a few months ago and it has already gone kaput. It was great while it worked. Super-quick motor sharpened the pencil in seconds to a point so sharp, you could use it as a deadly weapon. Now all it does is buzz. The motor no longer runs. I don't know about you, but at 30 bucks this is one expensive pencil sharpener that should last at least a year. I have owned two electric pencil sharpeners in the past three years, both of which have died after regular use.

The depth adjuster is not designed correctly and will not hold the stapler far enough away from the material. If you always want to drive 1/16th under the surface, this is a good stapler. But, if you want to drive just flush or just to the surface, you will have to put a spacer under the foot. I tried another Hitachi, and it had the same defect.

It really is best when you are stuck and looking for another direction to try out, it will motivate you with words such as \\"Movement\\", \\"Humanity\\" Cartoon\\" and other small suggestions of how to change the look of what you're working on.

If I had to name one downside to this book, it would be that the answers to the exercises are not listed in the back of the book as they are in many practice books. But overall, I can't say enough good things about this book. It has helped me with my Kanji tremendously!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Part 2 of a great series!","review":"This is part 2 of the Basic Kanji Book, and contains 249 characters, bringing the total for the two books up to 500. This volume is even better than the first because the Kanji are more advanced, and there is a minimal amount of English. All of the instructions are written in Japanese, and the only English you see is when they are translating new words.If you are uncomfortable with the idea of having to know how to read a lot of Japanese in order to be able to understand this book, make sure you get volume 1 and work through that. Otherwise you might have a hard time getting the most out of this book.This is the best book you can get for learning how to read, write, and understand Kanji. It also teaches you how to read train schedules, how to use a Kanji to Japanese dictionary, and how to fill in a form.Once you are done with this book, you'll find yourself understanding a lot more about Japanese and Kanji."},{"rating":"2","title":"Basic Kanji Book, Vol. 1 & 2 by Kano, Chieko","review":"The best workbooks for learning Kanji! The books focus on writing and the use of kanji in common Japanese words. It's a very practical approach and makes use of two of the senses for retention, tactile and sight. They are an excellent start for the enthusiastic Japanese student."},{"rating":"1","title":"His father must own a record company...","review":"Talk about unimaginative! \\"Whole Lot Of Things\\" shocked me with its poor rip-off of Jane's Addiction's \\"Been Caught Stealing\\".I know that's it's common and popular thses days for hip-hoppers to take successful rock melodies (as opposed to samples)and incorporate them into their own work. I haven't heard an example that I've enjoyed so far, but I'm not against the practive.My own private demo tapes are way better than this junk- and take a look at that price! I couldn't give it away... On the other hand, I'm sure Mr. Rusiak is a very nice boy and if you like his music there's nothing wrong with you- except that you should try some other music.

Yes it is","review":"Hoping that some of the uproar over editing this book caused CMX to rethink their standing about the edits in this book... and sad to see that nothing has changed.If you are at all interested in reading \\"100% pure manga\\" then CMX is not the outlet for you. Do not buy this for yourself or as a gift, you are wasting your money. It is censored, edited and removed of meaningful context. You will find it difficult to understand the story or the character's motivations. Do not buy this even as a curiousity, because it will only encourage CMX to continue to release censored, edited work that is unfit for their blurb of \\"100% Pure Manga\\"That blurb is clearly advertising misrepresentation, and CMX should be called on it. The contents within are assuredly not \\"100%\\", more like 65%... and for $10 of my hard-earned cash, if it's not \\"100%\\" then it gets a 0% from me. I wish I could give this title ZERO stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"One single squashed votive for $4.99??","review":"I couldn't find anywhere in the description that this was only one single votive, which came to me squashed on both sides.

It is not sexy enough to attract jiggle fans and it is not barbed enough satire to actually explore this \\"genre\\" of cultural exploitation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep Looking","review":"Don't bother with this pencil sharpener. It doesn't sharpen evenly (i.e. half the circumference of the sharpened graphite will still be covered by wood) and there's no auto-stop feature, despite what other reviewers may say. This thing will definitely eat pencils until they are gone.I couldn't even get a good sharp point on pencils most of the time; usually the very tip is broken and squared off.The 10-year warranty is great but I can't imagine ten years of crummy pencils. I'll probably switch back to Panasonic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sharpener doesn't last","review":"I am a first-grade teacher, and choose to sharpen student pencils to save time. I am having problems with this sharpener. It seems to bind up and stop sharpening unless I have the pencil in just the right place. It started out working well, but it hasn't lasted. I have had it just over 6 weeks. I thought this one was supposed to be the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst pencil sharpener ever","review":"I am an 4th grade teacher and this sharpener is the worst one i have ever used. It makes a terribly loud horrible noise, it breaks all of my pencil's tips and above all, it barely sharpens anything!! I am going out of my mind and wish I could find a good one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sharpens great for the price","review":"We have only had this pencil sharpener for a few months but so far we really like it. We homeschool and use the sharpener several times daily and the pencils are nice and sharp. You can tell when the pencil is sharp so it doesn't keep eating the pencil."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to snuff","review":"This pencil sharpener was FABULOUS when I first got it. After a short while, maybe a month, it only worked properly with \\"good\\" pencils (i.e. Ticonderoga. It did NOT sharpen those gummy pretty pencils, nor office depot/ office max pencils). Now it rarely works at all. Admittedly, I use a pencil sharpener a lot. I am a teacher and this is my 5th electric sharpener in two years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing product","review":"I have bought these from Office Depot before with 2-year service plans because being a teacher, I knew I was going to need it.

It is so helpful to understand why some issues are so challenging at this age and to get ideas for what to do!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Tasty Granola Choice","review":"I've enjoyed this cereal for several years since I was introduced to it by my sister-in-law in Lubbock, Texas. It is rich and satisfying but not a dieter's delight as 1 serving of 2/3 cup has 240 calories, 8 grams of fat, 2.5 grams of saturated fat, 13grams of sugar, 4 grams of protein, and 3 grams of dietary fiber.Both the nutrition facts and the excellent taste reveal this is hearty granola cereal with lots of flavor and energy. After discovering it in Lubbock, Texas I was able to get it at my local grocery store with no problem. I'm looking at a box that I just bought it at a local grocery store where it cost me $2.59. I must confess I'm put off by the phenomenal price being charged here and although I recommend the cereal for those not counting calories, I suspect most of us can get it at a lot lower price."},{"rating":"1","title":"You've Got to Be Kidding....Right??","review":"I just purchased this disc....ok, Rex Rideout is generally considerred a \\"good\\" producer.

He has composed for Marion Meadows, Najee and especially Will Downing and the late George Howard. This could be one project where his concept fell flat.

Highly Recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool effect, but cumbersome to use","review":"This is a really cool product for the effect it achieves. I don't use it a lot, as it's a unique effect that doesn't lend itself to every situation.

It addressed issues of growing up and right and wrong with a comical twist.

So I went back into Amazon to see if any season offered sub-titles, and lo-and-behold, the description of Season Two said, \\"Sub-titled\\". Hallelulia! (Look and see for yourselves.) So I ordered it, greatly anticipating its arrival, for it's a wonderful, clean, family show, and the star, Stephen Collins, is my 2nd cousin! It arrived today. I eagerly tore off the envelope & put on disc one; clicked on \\"set-up\\", but the only option was for AUDIO languages, English or French! NO SUB-TITLES! The Amazon description therefore is not true!!! So if you need subtitles, don't buy any of the 7th Heaven seasons, unless you don't mind not understanding much of the dialogue. I have checked out the other seasons, finding that none of them offer sub-titles. No use to me, therefore."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great show!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"My family loved this one, too!!

And With Roky's Old Drummer!","review":"Its amazing to hear Sal singing again and with the amazing Freddie Krc on drums, who also played with Roky Erickson in the Explosives back in the 80's! I think Freddie is America's Dave Mattacks,they sound so similar.What has Sal done to his voice though? He is weezing along like Dylan? Sal was never an Eric Burdon, so I was surprised to hear how raspy he has become. There are lots of good songs on this though and Sal's new vocal sound really works on most of them. If you are a Brummels fan, buy this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A new experience of piano collection","review":"I have the piano collection for FFVIII, FFX and just added FFX-2 to my collections. This is a different piano collection from what I owned. Most of the tracks focus on the parts raterh than melody so it's bit hard to recognize the soundtracks. However, the arrangement and the performance is excellent, full of emotions. These are masterpieces of FF music industry.There are 12 tracks of which there are 2 version of eternity which are fabulous. Never know that this sond can be arranged in these ways.The musician involved are Noriko Matsueda, Takahito Eguchi, Hiroko Kokubu, Masahiro Sayama and Febian Reza Pane.Tracklist:01 - Seal of the Wind ~The Three Trails~02 - Yuna's Ballad03 - Paine's Theme04 - Creature Creation05 - The Calm Lands06 - Zanarkand Ruins07 - Akagi Team08 - Nightmare in the Den09 - Demise10 - 1000 Words11 - Epilogue ~Reunion~12 - Eternity ~Memories of Lightwaves~This collection is different and you would expect surprises. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasant surprise!","review":"This album is remarkable not only in performance, but also in the quality of arrangement from such a risqué game album. At the first wind of this recording, most of the gaming community was stunned. The soundtrack from which this collection derives is so unpleasing that it might take several aspirin to finish it. The tracks from the Original Soundtrack were so non-musical, that we were left in disbelief that piano arrangements could be made. However, we were proved wrong upon hearing this masterpiece of piano arrangement.These arrangements vary from calm and flowing music to music so loud that piano strings are forced to break. On the seventh piece, \\"Party\\", the end climax is really amplified by the breaking of an A string in the piano.This album has some jazz improvisation and some fully structured piano arrangement. These styles complement each other beautifully in this surprisingly listenable album."},{"rating":"1","title":"it's ok","review":"Its ok I could barely hear few songs when I'm using my headphones.

The helpful instructions say \\"connect it to the headset or adapter, and in no time your device is fully charged and ready to go.\\"What it doesn't say or indicate anywhere is that it only works with the badly designed adapter that you plug it into when at home and not at all with the headset itself which has no place to plug the charger into. So, since you only get one of these things when you get the headset you have to choose which place to charge the headset. Or, if you're like me and the badly designed tines broke on your adapter you are simply out of luck.D- for designF for marketing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caution!","review":"I was suspicious of the ridiculously low prices from the 3rd-party vendors, and ordered this unit from Amazon instead. The unit arrived packaged in a small clear plastic bag, with a stapled paperboard top and a computer-printed adhesive label stating that it was for the Cardo 500. However the unit actually inside the bag was NOT the one pictured, and definitely NOT for the Cardo 500.The connector on the unit looked vaguely familiar, so before I started the return-process, I checked it out with a Cardo 700 that I had loaned to my brother. Sure enough, it fit the 700, so I gave it to him instead of returning it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charger","review":"I purchased this for a friend of mine and she loves it.

Other reviews praised them. I experienced this same problem with them working for a short period of time. I followed the instructions exactly, charged for three days, they worked after that for about a week. The light that it did produce during that week of working was very, very week. Nothing that would make me feel any safer or secure. I would not be able to identify anyone in that light. Than after a full week of sun, it just stopped working. I would caution anyone away from these lights. You are better off paying for a $14 light at a hardware store and an electrician to run power. You basically come out at the same price.

For the most part, however, the selections are trite and formulaic. I wrote my piece as a novice, and was utterly surprised at its acceptance. It's clearly a first-attempt, and not improved by the editor's inexplicable decision to remove whole transition paragraphs. The volumes prior to this particular one had originality; it seems Monteleone chose more by personal taste in this one than by innovation. Instead of groundbreaking new talent and short horror fiction, we're left instead with ill-presented pulp. At least the purchasers of the paperback version won't be paying the $65 price of the slipcovered hardbound limited edition. Obviously a work indicative of waning interest and/or capability on the part of the editor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pablum for the Horror-Challenged","review":"I read this anthology a few years ago, and even know of someone with (GAH!) the limited edition hardcopy. The best thing about that edition is the sturdy dustjacket, and the purchasers of the paperback version don't even get that. The stories seem to have been chosen with an eye toward convoluted vocabulary rather than plot or originality. They certainly *sound* as though they should be horrifying. Unfortunately, the only suspense involved is in how long the genre can support itself with potboilers like this anthology being pushed as cutting-edge. Staring at the crevices in tree bark would provide more thrills and surprises, and circumvent the whole process of creating this pulp waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate it","review":"This pencil sharpener does not have a reliable auto-stop feature like most electric sharpeners. The pencils come out bizarrely sharp and pointy, which causes the lead to break immediately. It also does not sharpen evenly, so part of the wood is at the tip along with the lead. Also, the sharpener jams a lot. I HATE this pencil sharpener. I really should send it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pencil sharpener","review":"I wanted a sharpener that had two cutting discs. The single disc leaves the back side of the pencil with wood on the back half. This caused me to sharpen the pencil more ofter.

The X_ACTO 1031 is the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceptive labeling","review":"I ordered this product from Buy.com via Amazon, because the ad had it labeled as a Hunt product, and said nothing about X-Acto. This was after reading the Amazon reviews, of which several said the similar product by X-Acto was inferior, but sharpener by Hunt was good. However, they sent me the X-Acto product called the XLR, #1818. Notice that the picture of the product doesn't say X-Acto on the front, but the real thing they send you does. So both Amazon and Buy.com are selling the same product, but Buy.com's is deceptively labelled as Hunt. And the product box also says \\"by Boston\\", but the bottom says distributed by Elmer's Products, Made in China. What nonsense! I'm going to give the product a try, but am not pleased with how it's handled."},{"rating":"1","title":"READ THE BOOK","review":"The pagan warrior from Jordan has not read the book, or he would realize that it says exactly what he says -- and it does not present the house of Sa'ud as the only face of Islam.

The book has been attacked by Western Islamophobes for its manifest sympathy for Islam."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simplistic, Naive","review":"The author of this book is a neo-conservative so-called expert on Islam. He doesn't speak or read Arabic. He is not a Middle East scholar. Rather than explore the complexities of Middle Eastern history or Islam, he has decided to focus on a narrow brand of Islamic fundamentalism to show how Islam is a threat to the west.Does this sound familiar?

He blithely ignores the genocide represented by the Turkish devshirme system -- the \\"Blood Levy\\" of Christian boys kidnapped into the Janissary Corps -- and pretends that the murderous darkness of Ottoman misrule was somehow enlightened (and the resistance to it, notably by Balkan Christians, condemnable).

No wonder the Wahhabis today stand as the backbone of terrorism allowing and financing and planning shedding the blood of Muslims and other innocent people. Their well known history of terrorism as documented in Fitnatul Wahhabiyyah by the mufti of Makkah, Sheikh Ahmad Zayni Dahlan, and their current assassinations and contravention is due to their ill belief that all are blasphemers save themselves.

I have only had it once, which is enough for anyone. I can't help but believe that such a negative, bitter attitude as in this book is not going to help anyone. I bought it, read it and destroyed it. A vitamin/antioxidant regime is what appears to have brought about my 98% recovery. Once I got my body and mind on the right track it came swiftly. While I remained negative and self-pitying, I stayed ill. I had Polio and this is worse in my opinion. It is a miserable illness and when ill you need positive support and a positive outlook. This book provided neither."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than useless","review":"When my daughter was diagnosed with Bell's Palsy, I went out on the net looking for information, and I ordered this book immediately, hoping to have something helpful to give her. When it arrived, I read it in 20 min (that's how little it has in it) and was appalled at the very negative and one-sided view it gave. 80% of BP victims recover completely in 3 weeks to 3 months, yet the 3 case histories he gave were all among the worst of the remaining 20%. There's nothing good here that you can't get from one click on the net, and there is a tremendous amount of discouragement contained in these few pages.I did NOT give this book to my daughter.

I don't doubt the accuracy of the \\"tortured soul\\" treatment the author pursues or the facts of the predicaments Sellers found himself in throughout his life. Failed projects and marriages, poor health and financial woes are on the record. The few instances of joyful periods the author provides though, including examples of sublime artistic creation, are brief and quickly segue into a dismal perspective of their futility. Doesn't seem to me an authentic or rounded depiction of a life, rather a oddly slanted portrayal of a most interesting performer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good addition to The Firm series","review":"This is a very good workout for most intermediate and advanced levels. There's a lot of variety within the routines and the instructor is consistently adding in new moves as the cardio sections progress. The Firm has definitely come a long way since its first workout videos released in the late 80's.The routines here are effective, challenging and varied. However, I would not recommend this workout to someone who is still a beginner. I do wish there was better cuing and instruction in some of the sections. Occasionally the instructor does seem to run ahead without always verbally giving the viewer directions. Although after doing this workout several times, most viewers will probably start remembering the routine a bit more. If you're looking to add a new challenging and interesting workout dvd to your collection, I recommend giving this a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fit Mom","review":"I was a big fan of the Firm in the 90s. This DVD did not stand up to the Firm of almost 16 years earlier. I was really disappointed. I found the moves to be unnecessarily complicated & difficult to pick up. The instructor was off cue & difficult to follow. Lousy camera angles & cheap in overall production. The background instructors seem as if they were doing the DVD for the first time. The master instructor, Rebekah Sturkie didn't stop talking for even a second. I was really hoping to love this DVD. It obviously fell short of my expectations.I also bought Tight Buns & Killer Legs. Hopefully that will be a much better program."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am lost!!!!","review":"I found this workout to be a big letdown; perhaps becuase I am not a cardio type of person. I prefer tonning exercises. One of the things that disappointes me in this video is that the instrucor does not emphasize breathing in any moment. I also found that Rebekah's instruction lacks momentum. In other words she does not cue us into the next move. The video is annoying because I never know what do next as she steps from one excercise to another without warning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Results, yes - Fun, yes","review":"As an upper-intermediate to advanced home workout buff, I love this. I have used this three times, and I have to say my shoulders are sore each time in a good way. The cardio is great as well.. I can see how it may not be too challenging for others, but if you amp up the energy and add more bounce it can be. The instructor is great to work out with, and as for those who say that the cueing is bad.. just do the workout a few times and you will be able to catch on, the moves are really not that complex.. they are just interesting and different. This one is now the highlight of my 5 day workout week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Fast, Not Enough Instruction","review":"This is the second The Firm video I purchased, and I ended up giving it to a friend. I have Allison's Ultimate Fat Burning Workout and I thought it was awesome! I was sorely dissapointed in the Total Body Time Crunch Video- First of all, the instructor didn't cue very well, spoke to quickly, and by the time I figured out what I was supposed to be doing she had moved on to the next move. Secondly, when I did pause the DVD to get in the right position for the move (which I had to do every 2 seconds it seemed), the move wasn't challenging. I would not recommend for someone that likes intermediate/advanced and medium/high impact cardio with weight training. Womens Health's Amy Dixon is a better alternative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good DVD","review":"I love Rebekah (b/c I'm OCD about \\"making sides even\\"), so I fell in love w/ her right away.

The instructor doesn't take a breath and drived me crazy. I am fit and in my early 20s. I have been a gymnast (and gymnastics coach), dancer, tennis player, and cheerleader and I couldn't follow this women. My mom bought the DVD and got frustrated with it and passed it on to me. I stuck with it once and when it got too akward I would just add a jog or run. I thought the moves were too forced and didn't give as good of burn and intensity as my other workout DVDs. She was very into adding on and changing it up and never stuck with one move for very long. I would recommend the Women's Health: The Wedding Workout and The Biggest Loser Workout: Cardio Max. Those both include weights in the work out and are much more customizable to your needs and provided me with a better and more enjoyable workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"my new favorite workout dvd","review":"i absolutely love this workout. the cues are right on throughout the whole thing. great workout, tough, yet easy to follow, and i am no fitness guru. it takes about 3 times to really get the hang of it, but after that, it is no problem. some tough cardio and plyometrics, but you feel great when you're done. i highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kick Butt Awesome Workout!","review":"I have been doing the FIRM for several years and usually go for the one hour DVDs. However, I needed something I could do at lunch since my schedule has changed a bit. The good news is my offce has a space with workout equipment and a TV & DVD player so I thought I would take advantage at lunch. However, I needed something shorter than 1 hour. This work out is an all over body toner with aerobics and in 45 minutes you have received the full benefit of a one hour work out. It is amazing how the time flies. It is fun, versatile and no muscle is left out of this compact, efficient workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two stars is generous...","review":"Staring at the TV scratching your head while the instructor calls out a series of moves at breakneck speed with no breakdown beforehand is just not an effective workout. I have four dance workout dvds, all of which are much easier to follow than this thing. Maybe after 20 or 30 times watching it I might get the steps down. But then again, why would I want to bother? Stepford wives have more personality than the instructor and demonstrators on this video. This is my first Firm video, so maybe the blandness is a trait of the brand? Hope not. I just found Rebekah really irritating (sorry) and got sick of hearing her say the same things over and over. The only reason I'm giving this 2 stars instead of 1 is that the weight intervals were not as bad as the cardio, but I'd still take any of my other dvds ahead of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad instruction","review":"I got this as a Christmas present. I have been through many workout dvds and this is the worst. The workout was led by a poor instructor. No warm up session provided. Also basic steps of the workout routine were not properly showed. It will not work for beginner. The instructor assumed that audience knows her routine, so she just kept on changing move. It is hard to follow her moves and very frustrating. I would not recommend this workout to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great video, awesome results!","review":"This video can be a tad challenging, not in terms of over-exertion, but in terms of quick changes, but the results are worth it. I have been doing this for around four mnths now, and it was a gift from my sister at Christmas, and I am now more toned at 36 then I was at 26. It is not too high impact, but delivers a massive sweat. You don't need tons of equipment and space, either. I strongly recommend you use this to get in shape for the summer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"favorite dvd by Rebekah","review":"I am a new firm fan, having found their dvds within the last 6 months and overall, they are my favorite work outs to do. This is my favorite dvd by Rebekah. I agree with the other reviewer that sometimes it is a little hard to follow - particularly the 2nd cardio routine - but I have done it two times now and it was much easier the 2nd time. I took dancing for years as a kid and pick up choreography pretty quickly - if I mess up, I am still burning calories and who will know? What I like is that she does different exercises in different combinations, particularly for the lower body and thighs. When you do the ham and abduct - it is really tough but in a good way. She also has you do bridges with one leg lifted - I have never seen that and it works! If you can be a little patient with learning the steps, I think you will really like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I saw results after just TWO workouts!","review":"I love this workout! Rebekah Sturkie has a positive, gentle and encouraging spirit, which I love and the training routine is amazingly effective. My clothes began fitting looser and my husband commented that I looked leaner after only the SECOND workout! I am now a FIRM believer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much time wasted","review":"I bought this video based on the many positive reviews. It's not bad... IF you have a LOT of extra time to learn the moves. Generally I can keep up with changes... but not so many, so quickly. I like more of a 'lets get down to business' kind of workout. In the time it takes to learn the moves and her timing I could have had a few good workouts. If you want to just get to work, and not have a bunch of fru-fru moves to learn before hand, this isn't a dvd for you. If you like lots of changes, and can keep up, go ahead. I'm sure once you get the hang of it, it's probably pretty good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Body Frustration","review":"I'd used videos from The Firm before and read good reviews about this particular one, so was excited when it arrived in the mail. Maybe the trick is to use it many times, but my first run through was a real disappointment. The choreography is so complex that I spent half the time exasperated, trying to figure out what the instructor was doing. Funny thing was, even she and her \\"co-teachers\\" seemed lost or confused at points. If I had a few workout sessions (or other time in my life) to spend trying to get the choreography down, this might turn out to be a good video. But I don't.

In the Cd booklet Sizzla writes, \\"I have put my heart and soul into writing these songs, truly this album is really the beginning of another era for me.\\" I hope this is true. That voice of his is a gift from above. The lyrics of this album transcend the last couple of albums.Best songs in my opinion: 'Haven't I Told You'(sweet, smooth sound), 'Jah Works'(nice beat, conscious lyrics), 'Ain't That Nice'(raw emotion, upful energy), 'Jah Love' (you will feel this one), 'When Nature Calls' (fresh sound), 'One in My Life'."},{"rating":"2","title":"get use to it","review":"Everyone gets too caught up in Sizzla. When he drops an album, it isn't in accordance with another album, yet the comparisons continue. Life is a great album. The stand out track that hit me first was Marijuana. Explicit yet simple lyrics always do it. When Nature Calls and Jah Works are also very tight tracks. On a whole the album is hot. Jah Knows Best, Speak Of Jah, Stay Focus, Red Alert, and now Life, also there was an underground album Good Morning; they are all very different and unique in their OWN way. Regardless of who produces it, its quality music that no other artist can match. I personally don't know what people are listening to, but I hear lyrics and songs from him that are just as good as songs from Black Woman & Child and Praise Ye Jah.

No recirculate mode (to recirculate water when adding chemicals; chemicals if not dissolved will trap in the filter elements and cause early wear) - must use plumbing to create a recirculate feature. Filters efficiently. In use for about a month. Maintenance of this unit looks extremely simpler than the Lomart filter I had previously. The Lomart had several different mode selections which were convenient (filter, backwash, rinse, recirculate, close), but with that came more gaskets and washers that need replacing when maintaining the unit. The Hayward has one locking ring with one bolt. The Lomart had about 20 sets of nuts, washers and screws (when pressure was built inside, you could see the plastic cap rise between the screw positions; the plastic I guess was too thin). With the Hayward \\"bumping\\" the unit between backwashes seem to work and reduces the need to backwash thus saving water."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perflex perfection","review":"I received the ec40ac in good shape and had it installed in about an hour including a run to the nearby pool store for some fittings. If you use the flow regulator a good tip is to purchase a short 1.5 inch npt thread coupler and install that first with the flow regulator tightening until the flow regulator seats fully. Then thread your hose fitting on the short adapter. This allows you to angle the 90 deg fitting any direction you want and also fully seats the flow regulator disk. My 24 ft round above ground pool was foggy when I opened it up and it cleared up after about 3 hours. Much better filter than my old doughboy filter with 20 sq ft filter area rathe than 12.5 from the doughboy. Had the Hayward in Fla years ago and loved it. Still feel the same about this new one.

This film could have been done a thousand times better. It feels rushed, the actors aren't very good at portraying the band members, and it is just horribly disappointing. Steve Clark's ultimate and untimely death receives barely a mention at the end of the film, a fault I personally can't see as excusable. This band is legend.

The locking mechanism will work fine but now I am going to the hardware store TWICE for these -- once to purchase a narrower screwdriver, and now once to get replacement screws.

This set is designed to be less wide than most 32\\" sets so it fit perfectly into my cabinet. Delivery was great. The scheduling was easy and two guys delivered it into the house and down the stairs (this baby is heavy).Be sure you can use the DVI interface for input to this TV. When I first hooked it up to my high definition cable box via component video the HD channels were a little wavy around the edges. Not bad, but noticable. Once I purchased a DVI cable (100 bucks!) and hooked it up via DVI the picture on this set was pefect. Looks fantastic.One thing to watch out for is that the only S-Video input is on the side and if you have the set in a cabinet you can't access it."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful picture, great price, can't save settings","review":"The price is right, the picture is beautiful, and the cabinet itself is attractive.

No picture, no sound, no nothing.A call to Samsung resulted in immediately getting a local repair facility's name and phone number, only to have the information rescinded when they realized I had an HDTV product. Instead I was told I would receive a \\"higher level\\" of service, and an agent would contact me within 2 days. Well, it has been 5 days, three calls by me, and no calls from Samsung. An E-Mail to Amazon requesting assistance in obtaining support yielded a short note suggesting I \\"check the troubleshooting portion of the manual\\", then call Samsung.Gee thanks, Amazon.If this ever gets resolved, I'll post the results, but for now I'd suggest avoiding this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Needs more content!","review":"This DVD is similar to the NFL version.

Alot of stars and their moments could of been added. Nevertheless, it's a great DVD to have. I'm a big Mario Lemieux fan, and to see him fight his illness and regain the MVP was awesome.

Unfortunately, not only did I not come close to the taste of Mrs. Field cookies, the finished products were either too dense or burned at the bottom. The cooking time instructed in the book is way too long, and the readers are misled into creaming the batter at medium speed, which I eventually found out in another cookbook causes the cookies to puff and fall as they bake. I also discovered upon further experimentation that the temperature recommended for baking the cookies are not high enough, thus causing the cookies to spread. This cookbook is completely furstrating and should not be recommended to aspiring bakers.

Still, these later recordings made for Peter Gabriel's Real world label have a charm all their own, particularly the acoustic tracks that open the album, which have a relaxed, what's-the-hurry feel reminiscent of Bahamian troubadour Joseph Spence. There's a similar oddball sense of humor, as Rogie indulges in glib, absurdist flights of fancy as on \\"Woman To Woman (Nor Weight Me Lek Dat),\\" sung in a playful pidgin English. The record goes on into more fully arranged Afropop tune, which are also quite pleasant, but it's the bluesy acoustic stuff at the start that's really unique."},{"rating":"2","title":"Im using these for a cake topper for my sons birthday party.

But not this one. My eight-year-old daughter and I were so disappointed after we finished this book, it's totally not what we expected; we don't see any light at all.It looks the author was trying to tell us some things, such as memories, true emotions and animals can't be locked up forever. The message seems profound, but the way it delivered was lack of light. The worst part which I cannot bear is the ending -- the tiger is dead. And all characters don't seem to have a happier life. Nothing interesting. Nothing exciting. Nothing hopeful. I find myself ended up with a heavy heart:-(Also, there're other issues in the book, such as. The way to deal with bullies. Fighting at school.

While he drones on and on in a mesmerizing monotone that gives the distinct impression that he'd rather be somewhere else, your attention wanders to anything but the wonderful story he's reading. There is no emotion or character whatsoever. Character's lines that should be emotional and heartfelt are instead read with whimsy, as though he wasn't even paying attention to the story he was reading. If you want to enjoy this story, skip the audio version and read the book for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Work of Art","review":"The Tiger Rising is an incredible book! I read it to my daughters and we just couldn't stop reading. It is a simple tale about sadness and anger, losing those we love most, finding beauty in simple things and the sublime in everything, and most of all it is about the way that friendship can take you by suprise and become the most important asset you'll ever have.Kate Dicamillo is a superior storyteller. She weaves a web of intricate relationships and presents characters that walk on the outside of the box. She gives us strong girls and gentle boys and makes the \\"outcast\\" just as human as any of us. The Tiger Rising (as well as Because of Winn-Dixie, which you must read as well!) are spectacular books for children and adults alike. They speak to us in the language we all understand, emotion.

Very depressing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Tiger Rising","review":"I thought this book was adventurous, exciting, and full of suspense. I would recommend this from grades 3-7 because it is an easy book to read, but is also very exciting and all-around great. I thought this book was a page-turner because whenever I read one page I always wanted to turn the page to see what would happen next to Rob and Sistine and to the tiger.

Her use of the word \\"Damn\\" is extremely inappropriate considering this book is being read by children. \\"Darn\\" would have worked equally well.

I mean, look! It has a girl (Sistine) riding on a tiger with a boy (Rob) watching from behind. However, I later found out that the girl did not get a chance to even TOUCH the tiger, and I learned a new lesson: no books should ever be judged on its cover.The main character, Rob, describes his mind as a suitcase, holding all the emotions he suffered and keeping it shut close. After his mom's death, he managed to keep the suitcase tight closed, so he lived a dull, non-emotional life without any tears, that is, until this moment. The moment is when his dad shoots a tiger which he have set free. The story is short, only a day-reader. But its raw tension is deep, making me to stand up and read it until I was finished. I felt a lot of unspeakable feelings, sorrows, thrill, and desperations all mixed up. It was a jolly experience for me, also making me remember the tragedies of my true self."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much too simple","review":"The writing was not at all what I had expected it to be from all of the quotes on the book's cover and back.

A little, hopefully subtle, horn blowing always happens in sales books, but usually the self-promotion at least alternates with the sales ideas you bought it for. Not in this book. The coverage Who Dares Sells is shallow and contains no new, or even uncommon, information. ... I kept thinking I would get to some good ides eventually, so I kept reading. I'll save you the time. Avoid the book. There's a reason that there are no testimonials on the exterior, the book doesn't warrant any. If absolutes, generalities, and the occasional inane motivational song from the author are your bag, maybe check it out, maybe. If you've found that kind of advice as worthless in sales as I have, find another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Honestly, I did enjoy a few poems, but on the whole, even as a poetry lover, I'd have to rate this book as awful. About half of the poems are simply dedicated to Biondic's bitterness towards Christianity. It's really sad and also the majority of the poems are just simple rhymes - mostly on the level of what a five to ten year old child could write. There's not much skill to these poems at all - and there's definitely not much substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's NOT As Advertised","review":"I picked this title because its subtitle is \\"developing your intuitive genius\\" and the cover promises readers will \\"discover how to use your intuition to improve your physical, emotional, and relationship health\\" but in fact the VAST majority of the book is autobiographical. This is not a self-help book for anyone but the author. A far more accurate subtitle would be \\"one woman's journey\\" because the advice was slim, and applicable only to the author and a few of her circle of friends. Which reminds me, she's a bit of a name-dropper. Bottom line: pick it up from the library before you waste your money; I rather doubt it's what you'll expect- or want - to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, an explanation!","review":"I love Dr. Mona Lisa's work and listen to her on Hay House Radio. Use her books for reference along with Dr. Christiane Northrups' books. Mine are on the shelf next to psychology, anatomy, & physiology texts, nutrition, and spiritual books. The New Feminine Brain is sourcebook about brain functioning, gender, behavior, female and male hormones, family dynamics, medication, therapy models, and so on. You get the picture. There are fascinating case studies in TNFB. This is not a book you sit down to entertain yourself with, ie it is not \\" a little light reading.\\" Use the book to look up what you, or your client, or a family member's issue might be.

But those of us with extensive CD collections (like those of us with vinyl collections) still appreciate the jukebox feature of this player. I especially like the random play feature, where any cut on one of 300 CD's can play. The sound quality is also better than my previous Sony player. Also, the Sony tended to not play some CD's; this so far has not been a problem with the Pioneer. I did like the feature on the Sony that would identify the artist and CD title as the CD played. The Pioneer does not have this feature, so it is sometimes hard to tell who the artist is that is playing. I hope the Pioneer lasts for a while, because I don't think that this product type is being made any more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great except CD Text (vs Sony CDPCX355)","review":"This is a great product, as you can see from the other reviews. I chose the Pioneer instead of Sony's 300 disk version because of the reviews about the better quality of the Pioneer.My parents have the Sony CDPCX355. The one down side to the Pioneer that the Sony has better is the CD text feature. With the Pioneer, I don't have a single CD where the \\"CD text\\" is read and displayed. The Sony does a much better job of reading and displaying the titles and artists from CDs. Also the Sony has a keyboard port so you can plug in a keyboard and edit disk information manually (a very nice feature). Also, the Sony's display has a seperate line for CD text where the Pioneer replaces track information with the text. Because of this (I assume) the Sony displays the CD's text much more quickly (the Pioneer's manual says its displays the text after 5 seconds).For both players, I have a hard copy of CD locations so the CD text is no big deal but it is something to consider."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pioneer PD-F1009 301-Disc Changer","review":"I bought The Pioneer PD-F1009 301-Disc Changer as a replacement for a Pioneer unit that held 100 Cd's.

It is two volume edtion, so make sure you get both volumes if you are looking for a complete collection of Sherlock Holmes. The print is kind of small, but as a mid 20 young adult.

There is not a full page of text anywhere in the book. There are many lovely quotes from famous people about the joys of company and some tongue-in-cheek suggestions for getting rid of guests who have over stayed their welcome, \\"flip the breaker switch\\".

I understand it's out of print now, but do your self a favor and order a used copy, it will give you hours of pleasure. Other reviews will tell you a little of the story line so I won't repeat them, but I will say that Janet Morris has you bouncing back & forth thoughout the book on just who the hero to Shebat really is. Surprisingly you will not find out until the last two pages of the book; then you'll need to go back and check a few of your facts to see how you could have missed it so long.

Just received this set with 5 missing dvds(The Barkleys of Broadway, Shall We Dance, Swing Time, Follow the Fleet, and Top Hat). Just told by customer service I will have to wait one to three weeks just for availability of a replacement. Customer service is sorry about the inconvenience. Amazon is obviously not too concerned this problem continues to occur. I told my husband we shouldn't order this set based on the posted customer reviews but he insisted we try. Well, this is the proverbial \\"I told you so\\". My loss hopefully your gain in wisdom. Now I have no guarantee the next set will be complete. I asked customer service to open the set and look inside each dvd case prior to mailing. I hope they comply. Seems to be a gamble.

The problem -- The Barkleys of Broadway disc was flawed. The two most dramatic scenes in the movie were garbled. I have watched, and enjoyed all the other DVDs except The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle and they were all fine. I enjoyed the dance numbers in The Barkleys, but sure would like to know what happened in the missing scenes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beetle Buggin","review":"Beetle Buggin is a really fun game, because you get to do five different events. Quick Race mode is fun at first, but it gets old after a while. Beetle Challenge is the most difficult, and yet the most fun. Buggy and Speed are my two favorite events, because you get to race people. Monster and Jump are the hardest because you have to race against the clock in Monster and in Jump you have to get a certain distance. this is a good game with very good graphics and fun gameplay an music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why would you even go to this page?","review":"decent graphics...ok game i played the demo about 4 or 5 times....would only pay about 19 bucks for the full version....gamplay is well..... ok...but sheesh it slides a little to much..no real control of the vehicles..good amount of variety..monster truck...jumps...bla bla...but never really gives you the feeling of racing...or for that matter driving a bug...i know it may not claim to be a sim..but hey..nowdays simulation is best...if i want cars that are defying gravity and when on mud it feels lick the slickest ice..i would buy a dang console ...i have a computer....graphics are ok..still feels cartoony like most all other games...we are along way from photo realizm....sound..well its ok..nothing spectacular...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfying food for koi & Goldfish","review":"Good Satisfying food for Koi & Goldfish.

This CD I bought just to have something to practice to, but found later that it was overall very good music in general. The only fly in the ointment is that the violin soloist who appears in two or three of the tracks is awful. They are so far out of tune that those tracks are painfully difficult to listen to, and the solo is so loud it obscures the beat. Excising those tracks, however, the CD is still of a decent length and contains very good music, especially for ballroom dancers looking for music to practice to that reflects accurately what they will get at an IDSA competition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Convicting!","review":"If my wife and I had not been against abortion, and the clinics that provide these services, this book would have convicted us of it! Carol Everett showed the reader of the immoral and even illegal practices of falsifying pregnacy reports to con young, and sometimes not so young women, into obtaining an abortion; killing of babies that managed to be born alive in the late tri-mester and dumping them into dumpsters, and falsifying medical reports with the hospital to avoid legal consequences for their mistakes during the abortion. She tells of how she \\"sold\\" abortions to women with the added pressure of \\"it will cost you more the longer you wait.\\" Carol Everett has shown the deception of a multi-million dollar industry to the general public in the hopes that women will try alternates to abortion, like adoption or even keeping their child.

If the phrase 'single piece' is your way of discribing just the bowl then say 'just bowl no lid'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spend your bucks elsewhere","review":"We have had the opposite experience than the other reviews. Our horse bucks too easily. Even on the least sensitive setting the horse will buck at the slightest touch. It is very frustrating for my kids. I think that they attempted to play it twice and quickly got annoyed. It was impossible for them to push the horse down into position. An adult had to do it ever so slightly so that the horse wouldn't immediately buck.Very annoying and a major waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"just adding another bad review to the pile","review":"The only time this thing ever bucked was when my kid forced it too. No matter what the level setting 1-3 (3 being the hardest) it was beaten EVERY TIME.Also there were times when it was very difficult to get the saddle to stay on. Save your money and avoid. I am not sure how Hasbro can sell such a piece of junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Does Buck if Assembled Correctly","review":"I was ready to return this game due to it not bucking.

I enjoy playing it too, now that I found what I was doing wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT like the old days!","review":"Well, my father-in-law bought Buckaroo for his third birthday at the endof October. Both myself and my wife remebered Buckaroo from our childhood and thought it would be a good present. How wrong we were. Any one of the three sensitivity setings results in the mule bucking at the merest hint of the saddle being put on, let alone any of the items. If Hasbro have any respect for its customers, they'll get this problem sorted and swap the mules over. It definately wasn't this rubbish with the original less complicated 1970s version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor purchase","review":"I wished I had read the reviews for this toy before purchasing. My three daughters (9,6,3) have wanted this game for some time and here we are at the holidays with plenty of family game time, I purchased this game with thoughts of fun running through my head. We piled the \\"gear\\" time and time again with no success in getting the mule to buck. My daughters just turned to bucking the mule for laughs but I will be returning the toy asap for a refund and purchasing another game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I have not written a review before but this toy was so disappointing I had to save others from making the same mistake I did. Our Buckaroo will buck sometimes but it takes at least 10 tries to get his back feet down to play the game. It is something only an adult with just the right touch can do. Very frustrating for everyone. Please do not waste your money on this toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money!","review":"My five year old daughter picked out this toy with her Grandmother. The commerical had her hooked! We got it home and soon found out it was not all it was cracked up to be. We could never get the horse to buck. We tried all three levels and still could not get the thing to move. The most frustrating part is the \\"hooks\\" on the saddle are not long enough so a majority of the parts will not stay on the hooks. I don't know if our game was broken and it should move with only a couple pieces on it, but it definately is NOT worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh","review":"My 4 year old son had been wanting this for months and finally got it for his birthday. It seems we also have the problem of it being way too sensitive, so half the time, as soon as we try to put one piece on, it bucks. Gets old pretty quickly. It does make us jump and laugh, though. But I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Other side of the coin (but still a piece of junk)","review":"We got this for our daughter when she was 6 and she was so excited. While so many said it never bucks, ours bucked if you breathed on it. The first time we set it up, she was just about to put a piece on, hadn't even gotten within 3 inches and it bucks - Loudly. It scared her, but we tried it again, this time with my husband doing it. He barely touched it when it bucked. This happened repeatedly, it was no fun at all because no one could ever get anything on the horse before it was bucking. It wasn't all that easy to reset into the starting position either. What a waste, this game is a stinker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buckaroo won't buck","review":"We got this game as a gift and the tension was high as we loaded buckaroo with more an more items. Finally we ran out of items and he still didn't buck. We tried increasing the sensitivity, but it still didn't work. We threw out the toy. It is in a landfill or has been burned for electricity by now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't buck. Didn't hit the mark w/ this one.","review":"I wanted to love this. I bought Buckaroo for my son's cowboy birthday for a relaxing activity on the picnic table between pony rides but it was just a prop. A big disappointment. They can load and unload and reload w/out it ever bucking once. Waste of Money. If they can improve it, I'd buy it again though. It just needs tweaking, more sensitivity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kickin' your dollars out the window","review":"1.)

Most said that Buckaroo wouldn't buck no matter how heavy the load or how sensitive the game setting. I should have listened. This game was on clearance for around $5, so I figured what the heck? Well, five bucks down the drain and one worthless game later, I've learned my lesson. Buckaroo doesn't buck unless your 3-year-old drop kicks him across the living room. My son spent over 30 min. loading Buckaroo up with the included \\"supplies\\", and then he threw in some HotWheels and Thomas trains to boot. No bucking. I gave it 3 stars for durability only...after being kicked across the room several times, Buckaroo is still in one piece. Don't waste even $1 on this one... :("},{"rating":"1","title":"If 0 were a rating...","review":"this Buckaroo toy would have the big goose egg for a rating. I laughed when I saw the \\"stinkaroo\\" comment in another review, because I was thinking the same thing when it was such a huge disappointment in our house. Everyone is right: the saddle doesn't stay on, and we put every piece of the toy together it still doesn't buck. This toy is a major drag.

We were all so excited to try it out but boy what a dumb, frustrating game. Neat idea...but doesn't work right. I thought the idea of having 3 levels was good, but for us, no matter what level of sensitivity you set in on, it will not buck at all. My daughter is not even 4 yet, and every time..she gets every piece on the horse and it still doesn't buck. She has to press on the rear of it to make it work. This game was such a disappointment and I really would NOT reccommend it to anyone. I wish I could have tried it out first. Also, the saddle is hard to get on for a younger child and it doesn't stay on well either. Bummer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"I've never written a review before, but now feel obligated to save kids from the dissapointment they will be sure to get from this game. No matter the level, it does not buck. I want to know if they ever tested this toy before they marketed it. And if they did, on who? Also the saddle doesn't stay on. It's a horrible disapointment. Too Bad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNKAROO!!!","review":"Don't waste your money (at least $15.99 + tax) on this game which should have been named JUNKAROO...My 5 yr. old son received this for Easter, and even he said this game is a \\"joke\\" and a piece of \\"junk\\"...he is a total game lover, has been wanting this thing since after Christmas, and is sorely disappointed in it, as well as me and his father. It might be better suited for a 2 or 3 yr. old, but watch out for the smaller parts, w/ younger ones. A 5 yr. old is way beyond this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"We got this game for Christmas and thought that it would bring alot of fun and challenge. There is definitely no challenge to it. I agree with some of the other reviewers in that the horse never bucks regardless of level. Unless you press it as hard as you can to make it buck. Too easy to put stuff on and no fun in the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment; Too far from the classics we know and love","review":"I must say, I just received this CD today and if you are expecting the classics, you will be disappointed. The melody, speed, words etc are quite different from the classical songs we all know. They advertise the cd as \\"Old Favourites with a New Twist\\", but I found the twist a bit too far from the original versions. This is not the type of CD you can put on for your child to help him learn the words of the songs.

Does Ms. Walker really believe that white men are responsible for all suffering and that, left to themselves, women of color would live an idyllic existence with a complete lack of conflict? Unfortunately, the book's flaws go well beyond the weak concept. Again and again she presents characters not so much telling their stories as reciting them. These passages of woe upon woe, apparently intended to stir compassion and admiration, merely leave one with the impression of having read a summary of a week's events on a soap opera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Information Overload","review":"This book is very well written, and increadibly deep. I think its topics have made me think a lot more seriously about our world and the \\"society\\" in which I live. Alice Walker is a wonderful writer who captivates me with her eloquent writing and her straightfowardness (is that a word?)...yet...(you knew this was coming) she completely overloads me with ideas in this book. I have a hard time keeping straight who is who because many charcacters are covered in depth, and then, wham!, their chapter ends! It is turning out to be great though, and I definitley recomend this, especially to men!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixed feelings","review":"I would be the first to praise Alice Walker's skill as a story teller, and her prose always entertains me and makes me think. That's why I gave this book the stars I gave it. I don't mind the 'out there' spirituality. I don't buy it, but I have no deep gripe against it either. What I find depressing and surprisingly childish about this book is the implied contention that if women of color ran the world, everything would be good and just. The simple truth of humanity is that it is power that corrupts, not whiteness or gender. If women of color ruled the world instead of white men, they would simply become the newest oppressors, in my opinion. I keep trying to enjoy Alice Walker's books for more than their style and skillful prose, but the message of reverse racism is still there. I am white, but I am not evil/privileged/pathetic/racist/oppressive/smug/whatever. If I were, I would not keep trying to read Alice Walker. I wish she would open her mind to that possibility."},{"rating":"2","title":"A magical novel with layers of meaning.","review":"The characters and images shared my dreams long after I finished the story.

Perhaps this sorry excuse for a book would have been more acceptable if it had not blatantly attacked the male race and traditionalists. Instead, \\"Temple of My Familiar\\" becomes a haven for witchcraft, sex, abuse and moral degradation.

It is the kind of work that should be read only after reading an Introduction by a literary scholar. What is the Temple of My Familiar? At one point there is a reference to a \\"familiar\\" which is some kind of bird. The bird is put in various confinements and breaks out of each and finally flies away. Does the bird represent humanity, African-Americans, or what? There is no real plot to the book, just a series of stories about three couples.

Also being only one player makes it even better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glory to the bard from Belfast","review":"Hinton is appreciative of Van, unlike some other books about him. He rightly sees Van as a modern day bard, giving a sympathetic understanding of his songs.Unfortunately there are many digressions which refer to other performers not relevant to Van Morrison, but they are mentioned simply because their music was around at the same time.A lot of space is given to describing live performances, which means little to those of us who were not there.The bibliography and discography are good. Worth a read for Van fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing!","review":"When I first saw the commercial, I thought it was going to be really good. Then I saw the show and it was a shame. It's just a cheap imatation of Kenan and Kel. Except they have better morals, they don't have an ugly guy on the show who cannot sing.The producers act like since Drake is cute (yeah, right) he'll always do better than is clumsy stepbrother. They have all these annoying assumptions that get on my nerves. Also, I hate the way Megan always gets away with things, too.The storylines are bad. The characters are bad and not funny. The voices are bad. Don't buy the DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-written and executed.","review":"Personally, I enjoy the Drake & Josh tv show immensely. It is surprisingly witty and funny, not something someone older would expect from Nickelodeon. I, myself (an 18 year old) enjoy the show immensely along with some of my friends of the same age. This show is perfect for someone who is looking for a tv show that doesn't rely on crude humor in order to get laughs. It's funny and lighthearted. An enjoyable experience for all ages.This specific product though, while capturing the show itself is somewhat limiting in the fact that it is only 2 episodes.If you like the show you would love to own these two episodes, specially since the pilot is rarely aired on tv. Personally, I own it, and I find myself watching the episodes over and over again.Honestly, the one problem with this product is that it just makes you wish for more episodes."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not the Canterbury Tales!","review":"This is a retelling of the Canterbury Tales, very simplified...in some cases leaving out the best parts!

I found this book to be impossible to read. It is highly mathematical, poorly laid out, written in a very heavy, formal style and focuses entirely on human health risk, which is not apparent from the book title.I also know that some of the analyses that were performed in the book, and models Dr Cox created, have turned out to be extremely dubious, if not simply wrong.I am afraid that I cannot recommend this book at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fun","review":"This DVD is so much fun.

Otherwise, he wouldn't have included activites like no. 3.8 \\"Crossnumber Puzzle\\". This is nothing but a crossword puzzle using numbers. No equations even used to create those numbers! Pitiful. Passing out worksheets like this is exactly what doesn't motivate kids to be lifelong learners in various subject areas. A MUCH, MUCH better book is \\"Clock Watchers: Six Steps to Motivating and Engaging Disengaged Students Across Content Areas.\\" I'm ordering extras of that one today to place in our professional libraries.

On Tuesday...You can find some of the better, older 25005 style Sharpie Accent highlighters at nearly bankrupted office supply houses in boxes of a dozen.

I'm not even sure what the old style tip was called - the blunt, flat but cut-on-an-angle Sharpie Highlighters. About a year ago (or so) they switched over to a chisel tip and IMO this was a disastrous move (I take my highlighting seriously). I can not find the old style tips anywhere! The problem with the chisel tips is that you cannot get a strong, thick, consistent line of ink across a whole line. So you have to go back and re-do it. Sometimes again- just to get a neat line. Now that bookmakers are cheaping out on paper (even hardcovers), this means there's bleed through to the other side of the page.Sharpie- please bring back the old style tips! At least make them available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Now what I expected at all ...","review":"These markers are WAY darker than the ones I usually get, in fact you could almost use them to redact text and keep anyone from reading it. Maybe they're ancient and gone bad or something, but even the outer shell is much darker. Avoid these like the plague and stick to the light yellow ones you grab at WalMart even though this looks like a good price. It's a total waste of my money and I'll never buy another one I don't get locally so returning a dark one isn't a hassle. Could it be a vendor who is unloading old stock?

Wet.","review":"I have some other sharpie highlighters that I love (these ones:Sharpie Accent Tank-Style Highlighters, 4 Fluorescent Yellow Highlighters (25164PP)), and I wish I had just bought more of those. I've been very disappointed with these highlighters. They are a very orange-y yellow, and not the traditional pure, bright yellow that I expect from a yellow highlighter. Also, they make the page really wet. Maybe the ink doesn't dry as fast, or it comes out more heavily, or something. I'm not sure what it is, but pages with heavy highlighting from these pens look wrinkled--almost water damaged. I would not buy these again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Fluorescent - VERY DISPLEASED !!!","review":"I ordered a box of these from Amazon. These are dull pink, not Fluorescent at all. VERY DISPLEASED with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cannot highlight textbook easily","review":"These used to work great on textbooks, for highlighting a whole row of text (not just underline, but solidly through the text). But after the chisel tip, it is too wide to highlight a row of text. Using the side of the tip, then it is too thin. The old style of these highlighters didn't have the chisel tip, and the side of the tip is just perfect for textbooks. Now I have to use the pen-style liquid accent highlighters ( [...] ), and they run out very quickly, and they cost one dollar each, instead of 59 or 69 cents big ones which could last several time longer than the pen-style ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"crapsolutely horrible","review":"I actually spent money on this CD!!

Kinda jumped on the pop-metalcore bandwagon to a degree, and they're on a major label now so the glossy soulless production is to be expected. It's so sickening the way metal is being portayed by little bitch bands like this, draining it of all it's intensity to appeal to the mainstream emo crowd, while still trying to hold onto metal credibility. Turning screamy vocals into something that doesn't represent intensity or aggression anymore, just another way to conform to a pop template. This is disgraceful.

Its fairly well organized and displays limited technical merit explaining interface and concepts. However, it dwells far too long on step by step directions for operations anyone who isnt lobotomized could figure out with minimal instruction. The illustrations and cd-rom are a joke. Family reunion textures? Most of the pages are filled with unnecessarily oversized images. The cover image is completely unrelated to the content. I would be ASHAMED to waste paper and ink publishing this book at its retail price. If I had paid anywhere near retail I'd be demanding a refund. Its not worth the cost of shipping unless you are an ABSOLUTE BEGINNER. It serves its purpose as a simple introduction/review of concepts nothing more.

I expected to like it on some level after watching the amusing trailer, but I didn't expect to love it. It's sort of a spoof of Carrie, consistently charming and funny. The performances are all good across the board. Well, good for a low-budget horror-comedy anyway. As Phyllis the overweight girl bullied by beauty queen contestants, Rhona Brody gives a performance that could give been nominated for an Academy Award if they ever started nominating cheesy b-movies. But my favorite performer was Jim Boggess as Betty Prudish, the snooty beauty pageant consultant. He gives a wonderful, campy performance as a woman who is brought to the boiling point as she watches all of her beauty queens die. Beauty Queen Butcher is a great movie for people who would rather watch a silly fun movie than whatever it is that professional critics are giving good reviews to these days. It's for people like me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT FOR 8100","review":"The title explains itself, it didn't work for my phone so if you have an 8100 don't buy it.

Not garishly green, but... green. Sufficiently, magnanimously green. Handy for outlining or, in a pinch, as a doorstop.

I gave it a 1-star because it was at least green.I know what fluorescent green looks like; I've used them for years to highlight my programs, but despite the labeling, they are just plain simple green... no bright, neon, leaps out at you green. And they are so dark they interfer with the underlieing text.First the marker makers stopped making true fluorescent ORANGE, a really useful marker, replacing it with something more a \\"dull pumpkin\\", now the fluorescent GREEN is going too??

This book neither wanders nor loses its track. It is a forensic examination of the life of Jacques de Molay which, because of the lack of much documentary evidence, widens its examination to include the times and other personalities to get a sense of what is possible and normal for a man the period. Wherever possible, though, all conclusions and inferences are drawn from primary sources and original rather than second hand material. It is refreshing to see the French tradition, as opposed to the Anglo-German interpretation, of the Templars, their Order and final days. This is perhaps not a book for the average reader but for a medieval scholar it is invaluable reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS CD [IS BAD]!!!!!!!","review":"This is a bad tribute to a diva!

Glenn Smith makes us think -- about how we truly got here and how to get out. Smith shows how modern campaign practices -- the politics of deceit from the title -- corrode the system and rob us of our freedoms. To overcome the far right, Smith says progressives should quit trying to fight a war under rules written by the right. Instead, we should turn to the Net and grassroots organizing to reach out to the millions of non-voting Americans who can ultimately turn the tide.

Yes this is the entire album of \\"P.D.\\" (no bonus songs) but it is \\"remastered\\". All the songs are the same but they have been remastered. Some songs have a slight differance in them than the original, like \\"Estoy Aqui\\" for example: in \\"Coleccion de Oro\\" Estoy Aqui has a percusion added to it like bongos and in the original it doesnt. Thats what makes this disc different than the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"What A Major Rip Off","review":"Hello Amazon,I purchased this album years ago and decided to write a review all these years later there is no difference between this album and Pies Descalzos. This CD is for special markets there is no difference in the music don't believe all the hype of remastered music. This listing for $170 is price gouging at its best. Buyer-beware rather than spending your money on this Gold Collection edition buy the original it is just as good. For everyone who doesn't know Shakira's career all of her records were re-released and re-mastered following her 2002 world wide hit Whenever,Wherever. This album was re-released in the United States only on January 25, 2002.

However, the quality of the construction is awful! -- a few wire staples is the sum total of the joinery. If you put more than a few CD's in it, it WILL fall apart.

I work as a speech language pathologist in an elementary school with children pre-k to 3rd grade. I allow my students to play on the computer as a reward. They all enjoy playing the games but it takes so long to get through one game and if you exit your progress is not saved and you have to start over from the beginning. I often times will quickly finish the game for them to they can play a different game. I will get frustrated myself with the length. The game does have a chart that keeps track of the percentages for correct answers. This is great except for the color matching game. How can you keep a percent of correct guesses on a matching game. It is impossible for the student to get 100% or even 90% as you don't know where the colors are to begin with. Good learning overall but to long for a child's patience or even mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Big Love\\" is a Big Snooze!","review":"I enjoy female-narrated comic novels... but it seems like the narrator of \\"The Big Love\\" is trying too hard to be some rambling Woody Allen type. But without the genuine depth or the humor.I probably would have liked the novel much better if the narrator explored her religious views and obsessions in way more depth. It would have been nice to have genuinely learned something new about one's religion (instead of simply being reminded all the time that the character is \\"neurotic\\" and prudish... okay, we get it already!)Then again, the publisher and author were probably worried that they would scare off the\\"Chick-Lit-Summer-Reading Crowd\\"... oh no!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Big Love is reall they big bore","review":"OMG!

What tripe!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Would you like some cheese with that whine?","review":"Thank god this was a short novel because if the whining and psychobabble BS was longer than this, I might have not pushed through to the end. I was hoping the characters would develop and there would be substance and depth to each of them but clearly Sarah Dunn is incapable of that. It's also important for readers to note that this is her first novel (as stated in the book) or else I might be less forgiving. This novel was a poor first attempt at writing and I'm surprised that any publisher bothered to take it. It was a very \\"woe is me\\" approach to life and love and it made me want to pull my hair out. She makes Alison sound so pitiful and there's not enough about Tom for character development to even really hate him or understand him, or why she loves him. Boring book that shows the amateurishness of the author."},{"rating":"2","title":"just \\"ok\\" - a quick read","review":"I agree with fuzzy ear's review below.

The narrator rambles to no end, which got increasingly old. I found myself skipping her big long philosophical stories while trying to find the depth in this book. There really isn't any.

Blah."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jennifer Weiner [...] - except not as good !","review":"This is the story of Alison who gets dumped by her boyfriend just before a dinner party to go back to his ex who he's had an affair with for months. This story was so disappointing: it's like Dunn took the same ideas as Jennifer Weiner's Good In Bed, i.e. being dumped, religion, pregnancy, friends, etc, but the end result is disappointing. The heroin is a girl who goes on and on about being an Evangelical Christian (who cares?), how she slept with few men, etc. This story is not realistic, it's not that funny, and the heroin is disappointing. If you want the real thing, read Jennifer Weiner, but not Dunn, sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really wanted to like this book but...","review":"I bought this book partly because of the quote about it being like a Sex and the City highlights reel and how funny it was. I'm sorry, but where is the funny parts in this book because I found none. Now I'm a huge fan of Sex and the City and I have laughed quite a bit at it even if I have seen the episode 5 times but not once did I laugh or found anything remotely funny in this book. I think that Sarah Dunn is just trying too hard to be hip but it just doesn't work. The main character, Alison, got on my nerves after awhile. All she seem to do was complain and go on and on about her Christian backround. After awhile, I felt like telling her to shut up because noone really cares. The whole book was a complete letdown and I had to fight to finish it. I would avoid this one if you are looking for a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The big \\"eh\\"","review":"This novel is easy to read and even a bit amusing in parts, but it is lacking description, or any real character development, and the plot is predictable and mediocre. There's a big marketing push for the book, but it's really not worth the hype.For good women's fiction, check out Sarah Salway, Kathleen Tessario, and Lisa Jewell. Those women know how to write great stories and write them beautifully."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nearly as good as promised","review":"This book is not great, really not great. It is decent, but not nearly what I was expecting. The cover says that it is a highlight reel from Sex and the City, one of my very favorite shows, but it was so opposite of SaTC, that I can't even understand the comparison. The main character doesn't live in NYC, and doesn't write a column about sex, but does write a column. It's about a girl, one who hates her evangelical Christian background, so she has sex with a couple guys, but it isn't about loving the man, it's about wanting not to be a Christian. I finished it to find out what ends up happening, but I was REALLY dissapointed. Don't but this if you are looking for a fun read or if you don't hate evangelical Christians."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable and not very convincing","review":"The heroine of this novel is supposed to have grown up as a fundamentalist Christian. I didn't believe that for a moment. Now she's a hip columnist in an alternative Philadelphia newspaper writing about her love life with Tom.Tom leaves a dinner party to buy some mustard and doesn't return. He's been humping a former lover for the past five months. Then Allison, our heroine, meets Henry, her new boss. Also hanging around is Matt, a colleague with a serious crush on her.So, will Allison find love with Tom, or Henry or Matt? Or perhaps none of the above.Since none of the characters was drawn convincingly I didn't care.

I read this book because it was recommened by an author I really like, Emily Giffin. This book was horrible. I kept reading on because I thought if Emily Giffin liked it, surely it was going to get better. The author went on and on about nonsense. Mid way through the book I began skipping paragrahs, and found I missed none of the story line. I should have known from the first few chapters, it was not going to be worth my time. I couldn't identify with, love, or hate any of the characters. There was no WOW in the book, no climax. It was the author's first book, perhaps she'll do better with time. However, I don't plan on looking for a novel by her in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total waste of my time","review":"There was no actually romance in this book or even comedy. It was completely boring. There were a lot of thinking and self talking, which at times put me to sleep. The only good thing about this book was that the heroine wasn't as stupid as I thought she was. She woke up in the end. Thank God! I thought I was going to have to write a hate letter to this author for creating such a dumb and desperate character."},{"rating":"1","title":"All Around BAD","review":"This author lacked the fundamental skills of story-telling and character development. Out of the several characters that was introduced there wasn't one character that was likable, especially the main character. The point of the tangents she goes into is to give you insight on her personality and emotions, but it failed to make the character likable. In order for a reader/audience to sympathize with the main character, she has to be likable or at least if she doesn't start out likable, she has to have redeemable qualities. It would be more enjoyable to follow Alison as she develops her character arc, but in this book the character arc is force-fed to you. The author had to tell you that she learned something and that her perspective has changed, but doesn't give you the satisfaction of embarking on the journey along with Alison. In this case, breaking the show-not-tell rule just doesn't work. I was completely disappointed and this book was definitely not a pleasurable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an actual review of the dvd, not shipping stories.....","review":"Excellent!

Weights are needed for the cardio and pilates workouts. They advise 2 or 3 pounds, but you can also use a heavier weight. If you use a heavier weight, Chris Freytag advises that you will fatigue. She gives good advise and shows \\"how to\\" thru out the workouts that a beginner or an advanced exerciser can use. Because the workouts are in 10 minute segments, you don't get bored and things are definitely moving."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"This a a good workout when you don't have a lot of time. It targets areas that you may normally miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps its promise!","review":"Do all three of these toning/cardio segments and you'll feel it in your muscles and see it in the results! I love the Pilates segment the best but it's the cardio one that does indeed fatigue the muscles just enough to tell you it's working. The kickboxing segment is just fun! At first I did them separately, but together they are very effective. In all honesty, you need to do a variety of workouts (and eat properly) to get \\"BIG Weight Loss,\\" but adding one of these segments to another cardio workout or doing all of them should work for most folks! I look forward to doing these workouts! If you're older (nearly 60) like me, stick to 2-3 pound weights."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I have several Prevention DVDs, and I like them, but I didn't like this one. Even though I am an advanced excersiser, I am 43 years old, and throwing weights around at the speed shown on this dvd is a good way to get hurt. The whole thing seems disjointed to me, and I thought it was dumb to put the Pilates section in the middle. Who wants to stop and take their shoes off, and then put them back on again? There are a lot better dvd's out there that accomplish the same thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, difficult workout","review":"This is one of Prevention's harder workouts. Its shorter too, maybe cause it's more difficult, they shortened it.Theres a warm up and cool down. Then it's broken into 3 sections. The first is cardio sculpt. This is what I found difficult. Chris recommends 2-3 lbs weights due to its intensity. You do multiple squats, plies and lunges with the weights at a faster pace. Some of the moves I can use 4 or 5 lbs, but some, even the 2 or 3 hurt my arms alot.The second 10 min. is milder aerobics and abs. Nothing hard here. But the ab workout is really good and you'll feel it.The last 10 min is kickboxing. It gets pretty intense at the end. Very good and very rythmic.I think it should be longer, cause it's shorter than the other prevention dvds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing New!","review":"Besides the fact that this is totally overpriced, there is nothing in this workbook that I have not read before.

I didn't need a VCR-DVD combo unit (because I already have a DVD player), so I looked for a single VCR unit. The only Panasonic one I could find was the PV-V4525S model. I have had it for 4 weeks, and it performs very well. No problems setting it up and using it (because it is almost identical to my old unit). The pictures are sharp and clear. The only negative to the unit is that you can only program 8 shows at a time - i.e. it is the same as my old unit. If I get another 6 years worth out of it, I will be happy. (Why didn't I buy a DVD recorder? - because I have some old tapes that I want to watch again.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value for the price.","review":"Satisfied with the recorder.

I am convinced that every VCR out there today is nothing but junk. I have gone through three VCRs in the past 18 months. My first VCR when they first came out lasted 14 years! The fast forward and reverse are a joke. Can't stop the tape anywhere near where you want it to. In the past few weeks it no longer rewinds completely to the beginning, and programs recorded get extreme distortion and loud humming. Even a new tape does not help. Warranty is 1 year parts and 90 days labor. No one would return this for repair after 90 days and pay more for labor than the unit is worth. How do you find a decent VCR? I noticed Wal*Mart quit selling Sanyo VCRs.

All of these markers are nice and bright, except for the green, which was dark, but that actually works just fine for me. Some people don't like wide brushes on highlighters, but I prefer to only take one stroke, so these do a great job. Also, they're just generally huge markers, so they last forever, as long as you don't leave the cap off, in which case the large brush will dry out quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do modern re-mastered tracks have to be so compressed?","review":"I have to turn down the music so that I can listen.

I bought it to cut fimo clay canes with, and one one hand, the blades are nice and sharp. They pass through the canes really easily. On the other hand, the handle does not hold the blade in securely. The blade shifts when any real pressure is applied, which makes it hard to do neat slices, and makes the knives useless to me. And yes, I've tried tightening the handle, to no avail.

Sharpie has always been a quality brand and these highlighters are just a testimony of that. Each of the colors work well for me without being TOO bright or too heavy. I especially enjoy the clear tube because you can watch the ink level and it is easy to see which color you need. However, I do wish that the liquid ink was a bit more controlled and consistent. At times, even at the same level of pressure, the ink will flow a bit heavy. This does not happen often, in fact, it is pretty rare but, it still happens. With that being said, these highlighters, as usual, are a great buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only highlighter I use","review":"I use a lot of highlighters, I even have different uses for different colors and shades. About 3 years ago I came across these highlighters in a retail store and didn't purchase them as they were more then I typically pay for highlighters and my normal highlighters worked fine. One week I decided to \\"splurge\\" and spend the extra 60 cents (or however much it was). I have found these to be far better then any other type of highlighter that I have tried. These work much better in every way. The lids do fit on tight, but A) I like that of any pen/marker and B) if they didn't and the cap came off in your pocket, you would probably need to replace that piece of clothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but expensive","review":"If you are paying sticker for these, they are an expensive set of highlighters. That said, they're also some of the best highlighters you can buy.The amount of fluid in the pen is substantially less than it could potentially hold. I'd imagine ink is cheap, so the only reason for this is to reduce the lifespan of the product forcing you to buy more.On the plus side, the pen highlights well, and consistently. The visible fluid reservoir allows you to see how much (or little) life the pen has left.I'd purchase again, especially if on sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Runs Out Too Quickly","review":"The ink is really vibrant and the tip is a good size for text books, but seriously one of these doesn't last me more than 3 days of average reading. I would estimate I go through 100 pages before the marker gives out.

Arendt wasn't a feminist. She would had no symphathies with such the movement as presently constituted. Dietz reads Arendt through the lens of gender reinterpretation. As such, she misses, for example, Arendt's critical thought regarding the faculty of action. One wonders whether Dietz even read or cares about Arendt. This book looks like Dietz uses Arendt's name, and badly distorts her views, in order to further a left-wing political agenda."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to Use","review":"Although the steel case certainly provides an extra level of protection for your CDs, I found this product extremely difficult to use. The primary problem is that it doesn't lie flat when opened, which means that it is very difficult to browse through your collection of CDs. This also means that it takes two hands to put in or take out a CD -- one to hold open the page you are working with and the other to slide the CD in or out. Not a very good design.Unless you are planning on dropping bricks directly on your CD case, a soft-sided CD wallet like the TW-24 from Case Logic is much easier to use and probably provides 95% of the same protection."},{"rating":"2","title":"cheep armor for your expensive disks","review":"I have been using one of these I picked up in a local Staples to carry a collection of playstation disks when we travel.

My car is a 2004 Honda Element with OEM stereo. The first notable thing was my radio no longer had close to the volume it had before the install. Second, when receiving an incoming call, the radio would not mute completely, resulting in me having to turn down the radio. Third, my music would be incredibly bassy, and no amount of adjustment could compensate. The installer tried to trouble-shoot the problem, install a relay to shut down the radio when calls come in, and made calls to Parrot tech support, which gave them no solution to the problem. I had it removed from my car and ended up eating the install fee.

Sure beats the price of a ticket in CA for driving and talking on the phone plus it's really easy to use. I'd buy this thing and use it even if talking and driving on the phone weren't illegal. If you just want to make and receive calls in your car and don't want much hassle and don't like the ones you have to charge and snap into your car then get this thing. The call quality is great too. It does take a little work to install if you do it yourself. I have always bought the appropriate Quick Connect harness for my vehicle so I don't have to cut / splice any of my vehicles wires. My third one only took 30 minutes to put in but the first one was a little confusing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Phone compatibility is pretty spotty; firmware upgrade very difficult","review":"Before you buy this, make sure your phone is compatible with this unit, by checking out [...]! From personal (frustrating) experience, this phone worked with a Blackberry Bold 9000 and a Nokia 7020, but refused to pair with a Sony Ericsson TM506 and a Samsung Gravity 2 (SGH-T469). Installation was a pain, since the wiring had a loose pin somewhere, and the device would stop powering up if the wiring moved at all. If a firmware upgrade is needed, you either need a serial cable that only dealers have, or you need to disassemble your car to get the brains out of wherever you installed it, and ship it off to Parrot - if they ever respond to your requests. I wanted a simple, but reliable unit for my mom's car - and while this unit is simple, it is far from reliable. Good idea, poor execution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bluetooth Car Kit","review":"I installed the Parrot Evolution in my wife car over 4 years ago and it sounds as good as the day I installed it.

My loves that fact that when she receives a call the radio audio will stop and the speakers in the doors will play the ringer and when she answers the call the calling parties audio is routed to those speakers. Everybody she has talked to on it are amazed at how well the call sounds.The other great feature is the privacy mode of this car kit. When we are traveling and my wife's boss calls the rest of us in the car don't need to hear about my wife's next job, she presses the green button while on the the call and the car kit switches the audio to her phone.Overall I would buy another Parrot product again after this great experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"HiI have bought it for my wife's car - Brand new Honda CR-V.

Willie singing \\"sitting in limbo\\", Kris \\"here comes that rainbow again\\" & his song about Sam Peckinpah, BillyJoe \\"live forever\\" etc etcThey've also omitted a lot of amusing banter.This could have been one of the BEST in the series but it's turned out far less than it should have been"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"None of the guys really sang anything.

This has happened endlessly with both of the dispensers we bought. Second, the soap shoots out horizontally, not down as one would expect. So until you get used to placing your hand in front of, rather than under, the spout, you get soap all over your clothes. This is especially disconcerting when you have guests, who invariably exit the bathroom with a wet streak down their pants. Finally, the cap sticks in the down position. We would never buy this product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty but fragile","review":"Love the look, but it stopped working within a Month of daily use ... not worth the price"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great practical joke...","review":"Another review caught this point, but I wanted to emphasize it: The first time you use this dispenser you're almost guaranteed to get soap on your clothing. It shoots foam out horizontally right over your hand, missing it entirely, until you get used to the nozzle's odd placement.I bought it for the main bathroom, but instead it's relegated to the master bath where guests won't spray themselves with soap.On the other hand, if you WANT to spray your guests with soap, this one works GREAT!Mine hasn't started sticking like others' have, possibly because I super-dilute the soap. No more than 1/4\\" of Dr. Bronner's, and fill the rest with water, works great. But only if you like spraying the soap all over the place. YMMV."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product bad company","review":"I purchased 2 dumbbells and only received one. The company then said it didn't have a second dumbell. I then called power block to see if they would do anything about the company representing their product. They made a few calls and got no where. They then sold me a second power block dumbell at a lower price and because they made this accomodation I purchased a send produt with the price difference. The powerblock system and company is outstanding (5 stars) but the company representing the product on Amazon (1/2 star). Almost turned me off from buying any other products from Amazon but good experiences out way this very bad one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Smarter Dumbbell","review":"Powerblocks are very ingenious, instead of having a bunch of dumbbells lying around taking up space, you have a pair that you select the weight you want. At first glance the square design seems a little odd, but have no fear they are very functional and comfortable. The price does seem high, but if you were to buy all the dumbbells powerblocks replaces you would spend more. Don't be fooled by imitations, powerblocks are the original and the best. They are also \\"Made In The USA\\" which is nice to see nowadays. A few things to be aware of. The blocks need to be on a flat level surface to properly insert the pins. If you have extra cash they do sell a stand. Before you invest make sure you choose the right model, think of future expansion as far as weight goes. Not all models are expandable. All in all I'm very happy with the Poweblocks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it with one exception","review":"This is a great product. It takes up so little room and is very versatile. I've had no problems changing the weights quickly with one exception. Since the 2 1/2 lb weights are ballasts inside, it takes too long for me to change them while watching an exercise dvd. Had I realized this, I would have initially purchased the set that ranges from 3 - 24 lbs each."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"Exactly what I wanted. Found that I really need 2.5 pound increments. Changing in 2.5 pound increments during a super set takes a couple of steps, but at least this product gives you the options. If I was using 5 pound increments, this product would be ideal. Construction is good. I expect to be using these for years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumbbells are Not as described, flimsy only 10-50 lbs","review":"I just received these dumbbells today. I am familiar with another powerblock set which I use every week with my trainer. My husband and I decided to get serious and purchased our own set.I was very disappointed that the pin seems very flimsy. It is hard to get in to the slots and I doubt it would last several months, or even weeks. The (smaller) 3-21lbs set I train with has a metal pin, this one is PLASTIC! The real problem, however, is that the item description is wrong. The weights run 10-50 lbs not 2.5 to 50 lbs!The dumbbells are clearly marked 10lbs and up... Not sure what the issue here is!!FYI, the 2.5 lb jumps are via two metal rods that you have to insert or remove to get the smaller jumps. Cumbersome and possibly a klutz accident waiting to happen. I'm a klutz- if I keep these, they will fall on my toe, no question.Buyer beware!

It's fairly awful arena-rock splooge, the kind that makes Boston look subtle. Four musicians from some of the greatest rock bands of the 70s trying to cash in on the 80s pop/rock circus. Trust me people, Wetton, Downes, Palmer, and Howe are far, far better players than this swill indicates, and they've played on far better material. Still, if you have a Spinal Tap-like love for silly-ass overblown rock, there's some fun poop on this collection. Hey, you get all their first three albums! Woo hoo! Only for masochists like me and 12-year olds (or people who never got past age 12) who actually take this crap seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak And Uninteresting","review":"Asia is just another lame wimp rock band from the early eighties. While their contemporaries like Journey and Foreinger sometimes rocked out, Asia never did. It's sickening. Heat Of the Moment is the only thing anywhere near decent the band ever did. The singer can't sing, the musicians can't play. I just can't stand this kind of music. Maybe it's just me, but a bunch of 4-year olds playing with pots and pans would sound better than this. If you think they are hard rock, they most certainly are not. They are hardly even rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT'S ABOUT TIME!!!!!","review":"Asia deserved this along time ago. At least Geffen got with the program for the most part. All the songs are here. NO EDITS!!!The only complaint I have is the remastering. For some reason the higher frequency range was muted and the reverb was increased. The drum sound isn't nearly as clear or balanced as it could have been and the vocals tend to sound like they were done in a big hall. The HDCD version available as an import is far superior in sound and includes a miniture Album replica for the packaging. I have to say ASTRA sounds much better as does \\"Daylight\\" from the ALPHA sessions. FOUR 1/2 STARSBTW if you like YES 90125 check out the HDCD import version. It totally rocks!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ATTENTION TO DETAIL IS HORRIBLE","review":"While I love ASIA, the re-master of these CDs was done VERY UN-PROFESSIONALLY.First off, listen to HERE COMES THE FEELING... MASSIVE TAPE DROPOUTS!!! Also, many of the tracks (especially ASTRA) have clicks and pops throughout. Compare to original release! How could anybody doing the remaster have let this go? These are SUPPOSED to be DEFINITIVE releases and I would have expected MORE coming from UNIVERSAL.Secondly, all should have been THREE seperate CDs rather than TWO. This CHANGES the FLOW of the ALBUMS. They fade out quicker than the original albums and the flow from the original CDs is now gone. Instead of CRAMMING everything onto 2 CDs, they should have maintained the integrity of the original CDs and remastered each one seperately."},{"rating":"2","title":"Asia: one of the true rock bands of the 80's","review":"Admist the pop and new wave revolution, Asia emerged from great bands, Yes and ELP. Asia incorparates the feeling of such bands while giving a flavor of the time. Giving their music a much more upbeat pop feel. If you like Boston, Foreigner, or Journey, I would definately take a look at Asia.As far as this 2CD set is concerned. Some of the tracks are not nearly cleaned up as much as the could of been. If you aren't a big fan of Asia I'd recommend this CD; however, if you are a fan and own most of Asia's Albums don't bother, nothing special here worth the extra money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get this set - get the \\"Gold\\" 2-disc anthology instead!","review":"This set has poor sound quality.

The 2-DiscGoldcollection is the exact number of songs in the exact order and the remastering is superb."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"I love watching someone get crossed up, but this video isn't really about that. I thought I was going to get a highlight reel of ankle breaking moves: what I got was a boring video. At least half of the video is a biography of the player they are going to highlight, w/ much if it just being praise from other players. No real meat. And hell, I know about these guys, if I wanted bios on them, that's what I would have bought.The other half is about people getting beaten off the dribble, but rare are the footage of actual slick moves, and guys left stumbling or confused. Watching a player weave through defenders, is not breaking ankles. I wanted more shoots of moves like when Dwyane Wade crossed up Eric Snow so bad he fell down.

Anticipating a cross-country trip during Summer 2000, I ordered it to help plan that trip. Unfortunately, it did not prove very useful. Although it covers the whole US, the information is typically too sketchy to be of use. Hotel descriptions, for example, typically consist of nothing more than name, address, and phone number. At best, there is a rudimentary indication of amenities using letter codes, although many listings lack them. In some cases, the listing does not even include an address or merely includes a PO Box. Based on the listings for Southern California, the part of the country I know best, some of the information is incomplete or inaccurate. In listing California dog parks (pp. 231-32), for example, Walters omits two well-known Los Angeles parks. In sum, not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"out of time","review":"I have no received the books.

Pretty much seemed like a depressing catalog of every wrong done to kids since the dark ages, and it's apparent that we're heading back to that in some degree. Any point to reading this harbinger of doom? Better that I spend the time playing Scrabble with my kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"A novel that evokes Bonnie & Clyde","review":"After the death of his parents, a young, naive Sonny LaSalle gives up his education and career potential to follow his uncles' life of armed robbery and ensuing violence. When a bank robbery goes awry, Sonny is sent to prison. Though he gets a second chance, he never considers a lawful existence. He embraces his uncles' criminal code of conduct without question. He attaches himself to an abused woman he meets by chance. Though a likable character, Sonny achieves his limited emotional fulfillment from sexuality and violence.This is a well written novel, reminiscent of Bonnie & Clyde. It is a study in loyalty and morality (or lack thereof) in the wilds of Texas and Louisiana in the late 1920s. It was a solid read, albeit one that was at times a bit depressing. Blake doesn't celebrate the violence - he reports it in writing that is crisp and spare, and develops characters that live on, long after the book is closed."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"Angele Dubeau is a great violinist, La Pietra are the cream of the crop of Canada's female (or male for that matter)musicians.

This thing is already outdated. A few restaurants have been out of business since the books publishing (not Chowhound's fault), key restaurants have been left out or miscategorized and the format of the book is like a Mr. Magoo tour of SF. What gives? I was really excited about this book. I love Chowhound.com but I can't with good conscience recommend this ten car pileup of a guide book. The only reason to buy it is to help out Chowhound...but honestly, just donate money to them. I can't believe that I'm saying this but I'd rather use a Zagat. Oh well."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to love it...","review":"I really wanted to love this book from Chowhound. Unfortunately, I found, like many others, that it:1 - is very poorly organized2 - seems to be written for the express use of chowhound.com regulars (typical users won't understand the arcane structure).3 - is a fine resource for people dining alone, but not particularly helpful as a guide for those people looking for a true city dining guide. It focuses on very narrow niches, but doesn't provide guidance on the dishes that are NOT the pinnacle dishes at a restaurant.Chowhound, the website, is a great resource. Keep hitting the \\"print\\" button on your computer to store the tips that are relevant and interesting for you -- there is no reason to purchase a book with outdated information, poor organization, and a general disdain for anyone NOT planning their trip to San Francisco around food."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dora tv","review":"I bought this item for my girls for christmas, and the dvd player on it just stopped today.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Keep My Interest","review":"The book seemed at first like it was going to be a very interesting paranormal story. It had some promising elements in it. But, after awhile it just petered out for me. How many times can they watch \\"Viola\\" die?

By the end of the book I was pretty much just skimming."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like trite, predictable romance, you will love it","review":"I admit I'm not generally a romance reader but good ghost stories are rare so I was willing to try it. But after reading \\"Eve pursed her lips\\" for the 20th time in the first few chapters, I started laughing out loud. I figured out the outcome by the second chapter. The rest was just opportunity for the protagonist and her true love to fight and almost get together (basically every romance novel's theme).If you're looking for a scary ghost story, skip this. If you're looking for sentimental, somewhat erotic romance, this is the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"B-O-R-I-N-G!","review":"I could not get into this book at all...and I LOVE the paranormal romance genre.

I was very anticipatory about this video. I like the actress for the most part and her body type is a lot like mine so I thought it would be a great challenge. The shorter workouts are not challenging in the least. The longer one is but only with and overkill on abs which seemed misbalanced, again, the rest is just like...\\"Are we working out or just watching you tippy toe around and giggle and make personal/unprofessional comments when you feel like it?\\" I felt she presented herself in the wrong light also for a video aimed at a Gaiam workout.

There are so many errors (not just typographical or grammatical, but within the actual questions and answers themselves) that you end up second-guessing everything- both the book and your own conclusions.It is a travesty for this book to even be in publication- people preparing for the GRE need resources that they can trust.

The movie is good if your looking for something that uses the actual play. Great for school stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kenneth Branagh is on an ego trip","review":"Kenneth Branagh's Shakespearean productions have always been perilously chaotic and extravagant, but in this one he's finally gone off the deep end, a hodgepodge of politically correct casting (black hero, white heroine) set in Nineteenth Century Japan, which doesn't even make a stab at historical authenticity. The Bard's beautiful language takes a backseat to a trendy concern for oriental exotica that would gag a maggot. Branagh's delirious intoxication with multiculturalism is pure self-indulgence. In the first ten minutes of the movie, there's a Kabuki play, a Ninja-style attack, a kung fu bout and a sumo wrestling match. Has Branagh gone completely nuts? This isn't homage to Shakespeare, it's a desecration. The worst thing about Branagh's contempt for historical verisimilitude is that it makes a mockery of Shakespeare's painstaking calibration of character to time and place. The liberal critics at the NY Times will go gaga over this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC","review":"Has a nice Asian setting, integration of different races, and a wonderful and new interpretation.

This isn't a movie, it's a series of vaguely related and largely incoherent scenes--David Lynch on a bad day after seeing The Mikado. Kevin Kline shamelessly recycles his \\"Bottom\\" from A Midsummer Night's Dream, Brian Blessed is alternatively melancholy for no reason (as the bad duke) and pompous to no purpose (as the good duke). I've read the play many times, and only that allowed me to figure out what was going on--nobody else with whom I saw the movie could tell who was who or what was happening. Even the much-praised cinematography left me cold--this is Shakespeare, not National Geographic. If Ken B. would recognize that he is a very skilled actor and stager of Shakespeare, and stop trying to remake Shakespeare into Fellini, he might again produce the powerfully minimalist work (e.g. Henry V and Much Ado) that made him famous.

He started the show before I returned and that was where we went wrong. When I turned off the shower all I could hear was mongo sobbing and glass breaking. I quickly dressed myself and ran out to see what was going on. He is photophobic, so much so, that even the word throws him into a talespin which he can't get out of. He threw my sofa out of the window, broke my table and both the tv and dvd player. He even rode over each of the disks with his rascal grinding them into my carpet. When it was.

It is the only TV series, outside of random shows on the DIY Network or Cooking Channel, that my husband enjoyed watching with me. We became so addicted we'd watch 4-5 episodes in a row after our kids went to bed.

But while there are double entendres ricocheting off the chandeliers, Mae is always clad, and promises more than she really delivers. She's something of a two-timer, maybe even a five-timer, but you don't hold it against her as she says what needs to be said at the moment. Counterfeiters, white slavers, and jailbreakers round out some of the extra-Mae activities.Watch this funny movie--she may have done him wrong, but she'll serve you right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mae West at Her Pre-Code Best","review":"Her first starring vehicle, Mae West's \\"She Done Him Wrong\\" (1933) ignited the box office and helped save Paramount from bankruptcy. An entertaining Bowery melodrama with plenty of iconic one-liners and a valuable early role for Cary Grant. The inimitable Mae sings \\"Frankie and Johnny\\" like nobody.

I'm so glad new generations will get to watch her work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unfortunately, a Famous Quote Is Missing","review":"I eagerly watched the new DVD release of \\"She Done Him Wrong\\" which is one of Mae West's best films, and contains some of her best dialogue. One famous quote from this film \\"Is that a gun in your pocket, or are you just happy to see me\\" must have been excised from the print used for the DVD transfer. I'm surprised that Universal would use a source that has been edited. Aside from that, it's great to have this classic to view. Just wish it was all there."},{"rating":"1","title":"West is wonderful--the transfer terrible....","review":"I am a huge Mae West fan and collector of almost 3 decades (now that stung!) and this is a GREAT film. However....once again, nothing has been cleaned up or remastered. In fact, it is so grainy, I almost think the VHS release is better. This is good to have simply for the sake of \\"preservation\\" instead of relying on VHS, and because Mae West is always a total joy. But don't expect anything new or exciting, such as QUALITY. I'm pretty sure Universal has enough dough to have done a little something with this. Mae West's films are GEMS! They deserve the same treatment (to be cleaned up and have an excellent transfer), like so many great old films have when released on DVD. As it stands, no Mae West films have been remastered (with the exception of 'Myra Breckenridge').As I said before, with Mae West, you can't go wrong! But with Universal...well..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Utah's Green River","review":"A very good book.

She has worn them for less than a month and they have pretty much fallen apart - the fabric has frayed, the elastic has broken (no longer stretches), and all of the leather is terribly scuffed. They look worse then a cheap pair of Target shoes after 6 months of wear - but were 3X more expensive.The Stride Rites I purchased on the same day and have been worn at the same frequency are still near new!"},{"rating":"2","title":"mellow yellow","review":"This is when the Flaming Lips get mellow and into the Uk top of the Pops (bless them for I love them). Fight Test is a good start and Yoshimi is quite pleasant but... and, yes there is a but, this album is so mellow it makes you feel like a marshmallow. This is not Rock 'n' Roll anymore. Now! there's a lot of humour in it (e.g. \\"Are You a Hypnotist?\\",or is it just me?) and that's good (thank G for that). There is still something missing though... Try it anyway, you might like it. Marshmallows are lovely... and the Flaming lips are great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Epochal","review":"This magnificent cd has received condign praises that surpass even the unparalled greatness of The Soft Bulletin. As this band progresses through its notable career, my appreciation for them augments as I hear each new recording. This disc is no exception. Although I thouroughly enjoyed The Soft Bulletin, I think Yoshimi is far more of a ground-breaking masterpiece then their previous effort. Each song propels itself through your ears in an unnerving manner that draws you in and bewitches you like very few cds I've heard. Every track is captivating, and there isn't one letdown on the whole cd. Fight Test, Yoshimi Battles The Pink Robots Pt. 1, Are You A Hypnotist??, and Do You Realize?? are sure to thrive forever in the archives of historical, profound music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressed and beyond","review":"I am hard to impress musically, If you like PF, Porc.

Commercial to a point, but then again, it's hooks are not of the radio material type. I might even name my next pet after it. Yoshimi"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots","review":"Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots being the Flaming Lips 10th studio album and their 2002 is a mix of alternative rock, space rock and psychedelic pop. The critics gave the album high marks and Allmusic, NME and Rolling Stone all wrote positive reviews. The booklet has some weird art but having psychadelic elements this fits well with with this genre of music. All lyrics are included but not a list of whom plays what. 4/5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Album Since Sgt. Peppers","review":"The creativity is beyond.... and no George Martin. And, most of it doesn't hurt my ears... The less I say the better, just buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tender tweakings","review":"With the exception of a few meandering segments in its latter half, Yoshimi remains the pinnacle of Lip's art-vs-commerce dichotomy. All the organic electronica steering these proceedings seemed more forced initially than what the years have kindly bestowed- providing incisively produced, and of course heartfelt written, melodies that stick."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Fool You","review":"This record stinks. And that doesn't surprise me, because the Lips have always been a pretty weak band -- an uncomfortable (and artistically false, I should add) mixture of bong-fed ambition and palpable self-consciousness. Although even I have to admit that they've done a fairly good job (up until this fiasco, of course) of, um, rising above (covering up?) their shortcomings in the past -- this is my way of saying that The Soft Bulletin is a pretty cool record. But ...Pink Robots is not. And I think you can safely bet your last roach that their next record won't be great, either. The men behind the curtain have been exposed as giggling entertainers (at best), but not artists."},{"rating":"1","title":"theyre like evil robots dude","review":"wow, brilliant idea. this is what happens when you run out of ideas. there is not one interesting melody on this album. no effort was put into this. anyone can sit down with the right electronic equipment and make these sounds and overdub meaningless words without melody. these tunes are completely lifeless and the concept.. what concept? robots? there is no concept. this album is a farce. ...The only tune here with a melody is the 1st track, after that this album meanders into complete boredom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yoshimi Record Damage","review":"My first Yoshimi record was sent in a box about two inches too small, not only was the case damaged but the record itself was warped. I voiced my concerns and ordered a replacement. The replacement was shipped in the same size box and was also warped. Customer service was less than helpful and I'm still disappointed I wasted my time and money in the whole ordeal. Buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did they sell out or just want to show off their skills as musicians?","review":"Okay, I admit that I shouldn't have jumped to hasty conclusions before giving an album a thorough listen. If I had the opportunity to change my vote, I'd give this one 2 stars. The only song I actually like on this album is \\"Fight Test.\\" I have listened to the others, and they seem to be structured in a way to occupy an unnecessarily long period of time, and don't go anywhere. The Lips used to rock much harder for one, but becoming mellow does not necessarily degrade the quality of music. It just does not seem to match within their realm, and they need to simply stick with what they do best. Every album they've released from the time they started until Clouds Taste Metallic is worth a listen, hell I'd even get Zaireeka over this one. I have a slight hint of faith left that they can revert back to their rock alternative roots, at least somewhat if not totally."},{"rating":"2","title":"Album of the Year","review":"This is incredible stuff. Complex, intricate, human, humorous, astounding. Do yourself a huge favor and buy this album post haste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Otherworldly.","review":"There has been hype about this album for awhile now, and for the most part I think it's justified. Comparisons to \\"Radiohead\\", \\"Wilco\\", and \\"Beck\\" are understandable. It's mostly just pleasing alt-rock, with just enough blips and beeps to make you feel like you're floating through space. The singers voice helps achieve that illusion as well. To simplify, it makes you happy. Not every track is a winner, but as a whole, it's pretty amazing. The better tracks here are \\"Flight Test\\", \\"Ego Tripping At The Gates Of Hell\\", and \\"Do You Realize?\\", which was recently used in a commercial for VH-1, and includes the thought-provoking line \\"Do You Realize that everyone you know, someday will die\\". Maybe it's not so happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm so emotional...","review":"No that's not it. This damn album is that beautiful. The Soft Bulletin is even more so. But my first experience with The Flaming Lips was from a skateboarding DVD (Hot Chocolate Tour Documentary). While listening I thought wow this stuff is different and what a lyrical concept (Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots). I know myself that good-when I listen to mearly a sound sample on Amazon and the music of that 30 second sample moves me so much that I waste no time on clicking the purchase button. Thats when I know I've made a great and wise purchse as well as knowing I've fallen in love with a new album."},{"rating":"2","title":"own with pride.","review":"this is something you should be proud to own. when people come over you should stand very near this cd. you should point at it and say, \\"Look, i have this cd.\\" do that, and all your friends will think that you're cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"this album definately isnt for everyone. but if you have trouble finding anything good on the radio and/or you are a flaming lips fan you should check this one out. you can listen to the entire cd on their website www.flaminglips.com before you buy it to decide if its right for you. another thing i have seen many comparisons to other bands and genres.this is not anything like trip hop.it is not like Radiohead or Bjork either, to me anyway. Although those bands are great. Flaming Lips are beyond classifications. the only reason i gave this four is because five stars is given out too much"},{"rating":"2","title":"Vinyl arrived warped","review":"The Pros: The package came in a timely manner, and was very easy to open, thanks to amazon. Every song on the album is great (which is why I decided to order the vinyl).The Cons: Unfortunately, the vinyl came very warped. I don't know if it happened during transport or what, but it is warped visually. It is still playable, but the tone arm travels about .5-.75 inches vertically when it plays the warped section. It isn't so bad that the needle jumps, but I can hear a slight slur. For this reason I cannot give this the 5 star rating I'd like to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Borrowed Tunes","review":"Other reviewers have pointed out that the first track pretty much borrows its melody straight from Cat Steven's \\"Father & Son\\". No one, however, seems to have mentioned that the only other track with a discernable melody to it , Track 3, lifts it's tune straight from the the 70s America hit \\"I Need You\\". Other than that, a lot of uninteresting studio sound effects & competely inane lyrics amount to nothing too significant going on here. Although I like experimental, trippy, psychadelic-type music, this one misses the mark. Syd Barret they are not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yoshimi Battles The Pink Robots","review":"I just want to start by mentioning that I'm still incredibly impressed with the band for creating incredibly unique music after doing so for 20 years. It's always something strange with every new album and, for that matter, every live show. But honestly, I've never really been a huge Lips fan, and Yoshimi was no exception. The album begins with \\"Fight Test,\\" which is possibly my favorite song by the band, and soon after there's \\"Yoshimi Battles The Pink Robots, Pt. 1,\\" but that's really all I could stay awake for. The rest of the album is just strange sounds and Wayne Coyne's tired, melancholy voice singing about robots and magicians and other strange things. I respect them for being weird and doing their own thing, but this album just wasn't for me. It seems to be the band's most popular album, so I still recommend that you give it a listen. Just don't blame me if you hate it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Golden","review":"That's what this CD is. I bought it as an impulse buy, not really sure what to think of the Flaming Lips, other than that they were eccentric. I popped it into my CD player, and it hasn't left it.The execution of this CD is flawless. Some argue that \\"Yoshimi battles the Pink Robots, pt. 2\\" is the only poor track on this CD. I disagree. This song is just so different, it doesn't really fit the scheme of the album. The title track is perfect, almost pop-like (definately could get played on the radio) and it's companion is the converse, a rock-like track laden with screaming (is it the robots? Yoshimi? either way, it's flippin' awesome)The other songs are perfect as well. My favorite is \\"All we have is Now\\" but the obvious gem from the CD, \\"Do you Realize?\\" (which could pass as a cut song from The Soft Bulletin) is great too.The reviewers who don't give high marks to this don't understand or haven't listened to it enough.Do yourself a favor, buy this CD now. Be a convert like me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flaming Lips Fall A Long Way From Their Golden Age","review":"It's sad to say, but although the Flaming Lips last 2 regular length albums are very Dreamy, Echoey, and Well-produced, they fall far short of the southern-noise rock gold that encompassed albums like Clouds Taste Metalic, Hit To Death In The Future Head, Transmissions From The Satelite Heart, and In A Priest Driven Ambulance. Through sharpening up their studio finesse, it seems they may have lost touch with that simple, grungy, happy/sad sound that so many had come to love. This album isn't a BAD album per se,it soars in production, but falls flat on its face in plain old fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Flaming Lips just keep outdoing themselves.","review":"As a general rule, each Flaming Lips album has been exponentially better than the last. After the unbelievable Soft Bulletin, I didn't think it was possible for music to get any better. Somehow, the Flaming Lips pulled it off. Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots is the best thing I've ever heard. It completely trounces every other piece of music, ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff","review":"I dont want to give this 5 stars, because as people have said before there are alot better things out there. But heres the difference between this and some of my other 4 star albums. This one id say a little over half the songs i really like, worthy of a five star label. But a few of the songs are entirely disposal, and im especially mad about the last song. Thats no way to end an album. But since we all have cd players with a skip button, you should buy this album, and then listen to it once and youll know which ones to skip."},{"rating":"2","title":"the ultimate impression","review":"let me start by saying this album is amazing. i feel blessed to have found it. television and radio fell short of delivery. i was lucky enough to catch beck this past halloween at the beacon theatre. the flaming lips were his opening act AND his band and i was completely blown away...the beautiful things they did to my ears and eyes. i went home immediately to put this cd in heavy rotation burning copies for all of my friends as well. nothing but rave reviews thus far*"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kinda boring","review":"Most of this album just feels like left overs from the soft bulletin record to me. There is a few decent tracks on this album but nothing really notable. Alot of random studio effects and alot of [...] that just sounds like filler. The Soft Bulletin is far and away a better record along with most of all the previous Flaming Lips albums. If you are new to the Lips I highly suggest starting somewhere else."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most OVERRATED release of the past few years!","review":"This release is WAY overrated IMHO! The music is very cartoonish, with an overabundance of overproduction and ultra-cheesy sound effects! My final analyis is that Coyne and co. perhaps didn't think the music would stand on its own, so they threw in the extra electronica to provide 'icing on the rotting cake'. I want my money back!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget it.","review":"New to the Flaming Lips. Don't waste your time with effort.Sounds like Neil Young in his Trans stage."},{"rating":"1","title":"So what's the fuzz about?","review":"I was expecting a great and innovative CD (also thanks to the usual enthusiastic reviews on amazon, which I'll learn not to read anymore!)but I was sadly disappointed. I agree with one reviewer before me who said that the first song is \\"Father and Son\\" by Cat Stevens without the credits, the rest is a band that tries to make something new but really does not manage to! All in all it's not a bad record, just useless. A mix between some electronic music, plus some 70s rock whithout much musical inspiration. Not to mention the lyrics, a 5 years old kid could probably write better stuff. If you write stupid lyrics it does not necessarily mean you're so smart and unconventional, sometimes you just look like a stupid!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A late review","review":"I know this album has been out for a while but thought I would drop a review anyway.

This catchy little jingle was running through my head for about a week before I decided that I had to know more about the artist and the rest of this CD. Without really knowing about the rest of the songs on the album, I put my order in Amazon. When I got the CD, I was pleasantly surprised, although it took a little while to get used to it. As someone without any other experience with the Flaming Lips, the music sounds very experimental, with a lot of electronic synthesizers taking the forefront numerous times. At first, I didn't like the CD much...but with repeated listenings, this CD has begun to grow on me, and I can't seem to go for a few days without giving it a spin."},{"rating":"2","title":"love","review":"i absolutely love this album. true, the lips aren't really reinventing themselves with this one, but don't let anyone tell you it's not a fun choice for the summer. *sigh* i love wayne coyne."},{"rating":"2","title":"An absolute must-have record","review":"This is one of the greatest albums of all time. If you're new to the Flaming Lips, you're going to read a lot of fan reviews telling you to buy some of the \\"older stuff\\", but this album is really the Lips first masterpiece. A lot of their older stuff is pretty experimental and, frankly, difficult to listen to. Every band has to have a small group of older fans that get bitter at some point because their favorite band suddenly becomes successful and everyone starts to take notice. The Lips have been working very hard at what they do since the 1980's. I'm glad they're on a major label with lots of tour and promotion support because their music should be heard around the world. It's great stuff, and I hope they continue to win over new fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good, slightly overhyped","review":"I got this CD hearing the amazing praise this band was recieving. I figured it would have to be a pop gem to keep up with everything thats said about it. Its not. Its a good Cd, don't get me wrong, but it isn't as incredible as some seem to think. There are some amazing tracks on this Cd (\\"do you realize\\", for example) but others, like \\"yoshimi battles the pink robots part 2\\" are definately not(the afformentioned song was just the sound of a crowd moaning and grunting to guitar riffs). This CD remains good, just not as good as everyone would have you believe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Different ..... Very Good","review":"This is a fresh new sound. Yes, you could call it a little oddball, a little eccentric, a little of the normal curve, but GOSH DARNIT, it's inventive, creative and different that the mainstream stuff. In some ways it's like taking a fresh breath of life, energizing musical interests...etc. The first track and the title tracks are the best.I'll have to check out more of the Flaming Lips..they are quite astounding. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Class Act","review":"On SOFT BULLETIN, The Lips' (gorgeous) music always seemed to be in a tug-of-war with their 8th-grade-poetry-journal-lyrics. So I love YOSHIMI, because on this CD The Lips' words have finally mutated into something stupid enough to be cute: A rock opera about a female robot-warrior. What weighed them down before sets them free, and they fly to alt-rock heaven on doofus wings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Fridman Masterpiece","review":"Producer Dave Fridman continues to make the most interesting sounding records of our time. To recap, the beauty of Mercury Rev's \\"Deserter's Songs\\" was followed by the brilliant Lips album \\"The Soft Bulletin\\". Then Mr. Fridman follows that with Mercury Rev's amazing follow up \\"All Is Dream\\", and now, The Flaming Lips have returned with another brilliant album, \\"Yoshimi Battles The Pink Robots\\". This album grooves a little more that \\"Bulletin\\" and is a brilliant and worthy follow up. Fans of \\"The Soft Bulletin\\" need not hesitate in purchasing this album. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lips Never Disappoint","review":"This is an amazing album that tells a beautiful, and enthralling story from the genius minds of The Flaming Lips. I have listened to it for years and still to this day appreciate every minute of the album.

No other serious contenders!","review":"Murray Street is just Sonic Youth lite. Beck's Sea Change is the dullest thing since sliced blah. Yoshimi is however insanely brilliant. A unique sound, thoughtful lyrical expression & something mysterious about it. Headphones recommended for full multilayered sound absorption. Other reviews can give you the basic idea but I just want to give props in particular to rarely mentioned ALL WE HAVE IS NOW near the end of the album, about meeting up with a future version of yrself, all ethereal bliss. For all the critical praise The Soft Bulletin got I believe Yoshimi takes it further, both more accessible & more odd. Warning: does not contain any loud guitar sounds, if you need them get Hit To Death or Transmissions or the Acid box set. Bless Wayne & co for sharing these fabulous & unforgettable sounds with us. I'm very curious where they can go further after this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their headphone album","review":"A concept album about a Japanese girl battling pink robots. Whatever you are on, Wayne Coyne, pass it this way!Seriously, this is a great album. While it doesn't reach the peaks of their previous album (the superb Soft bulletin), this expands on the thematic nature of that record into their first concept album. When most people hear the phrase concept album, a certain word springs to mind. Pretension. And there's no doubt that this is a pretentious album, but it's a great pretentious album.Opener Fight test (which \\"borrows\\" its tune from the classic Cat Stevens song Father and son) sets the scene. The theme only really runs over the 2 semi-title tracks where Wayne Coyne sings that Yoshimi is going to battle the pink robots, and then she battles them. The rest of the album is just a headtrip of mellow spaced out numbers.A great album to chill out to, even if it lacks the depth of The soft bulletin."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece of Epic Proportions!","review":"I am a person who respects the opinions and feelings of others.

I guess in keeping with its theme, the flaming lips decided to make these songs sound like something off of the intro or credits to a bad anime cartoon series.. thats about how awkward a lot of these songs come off to me. And yeah, the singers voice is kind of whiny too, like a lot of other people have already mentioned. Maybe their other stuff is better, but its all way too girly for me. It lacks the genuine melancholy and transcendent feeling of a lot of other electronic music you could be listening to today."},{"rating":"1","title":"indie-boys do a mediocre job of trying to be trip-hop","review":"I really don't understand why this album gets so much hype. It seems like the people that rave about this album only listen to indie-rock and love what the Lips have done with this one. Well guess what? There are at least a hundred other people out there doing this kind of music only better. The people that rave about this album probably have no clue because these other artists are in the \\"Techno\\" section of their favorite record store. I'd avoid this [...]. To sum up- \\"Yoshimi\\" is boring and really cheesy at times. There's one song where everytime the guy sings the word \\"Future\\" they make it sound like he's in a 1960's sci-fi flick. The digital/analog effects aren't enhancing the songs, they're overdone."},{"rating":"1","title":"HUGELY overrated.","review":"It may reflect on me in a bad way, but I totally didn't get this record. I know the album has received just the best reviews from numerous reputable sources, many of whom I trust wholeheartedly.The reviews here on Amazon.com echo those I've read in more traditional print media outlets.But I just couldn't get through this album. It was boring and unappealing and uninteresting. Maybe it's me though...I see that many other reviewers have had to \\"go back\\" to the album to discover its' charms, but I just can't do it...I LOOOOOVE the title though...I'm the kind of music fan who's ridiculously optimistic.

This album is probably one of the greatest Flaming Lips albums ever. Although it's weaker than The Soft Bulletin in my opinion it is still unbelievably amazing.

Beautiful, hypnotic, ear-opening, and grand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not quite as good for me...","review":"as the Soft Bulletin.Production-wise, its a fantastic album. I tend to differe where some have made their opinions before. If anything holds the Lips back from being the band of all bands, its their lyrics. Musically, they can slay anyone else out there right now.Whgat is different here is that they've seemed to use a few more electronica sounds than in the past, but don't fre: those big drum and drippy bass is still present. The one thing I do notice is that the guitar isn't as important as an instrument on this album as its been in the past. I hope that this is not a sign of things to come.Nonetheless, its a very enjoyable, playful disc. Even if its not The Soft Bulletin, a very good Lips album is still a great album compared to the rest of the derivative crap that is coming out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yoshimi fights, Yoshimi wins!","review":"This is the album that turned sparked my interest in music so much, my CD collection has quadrupled in size since '03. Despite having a couple average tracks, I still gove this album 5 stars, The best songs are just that good, and the rest are still enjoyable listens. Theres nothing else out there quite like the sound of Wayne's voice next to those pshycadelic sounds and electronic noises. The concept of a Japanese woman fighting pink robots does sound juvenile to the un-initiated, but its actually quite brillinat. Ive never tired of playing this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am NEVER getting rid of this album!","review":"I think that, like some other reviewers, this album took me a while to get used to. But after a few listenings, the songs have become some of my favorites. The quality of the lyrics rivals Robert Hunter at his best, and the instrumentals are new and creative without being too wierd.

I enjoyed the history of how this restaurant came into existence and how Eric Ripert came to becoming the chef. I was drawn to this book because of my interest in cooking fish, a food that I think is more difficult than its other meat counterparts. I've been of the belief if you could cook fish and do it well, you could just about cook anything.

I have no issue with getting what I ordered. I like Clubman; I currently use the bay rum. I thought I would try this because I like the smell of vanillla. Man..this smells like 3 in one oil.

Smells nice, rolls on easy.I do notice that my post shave routine is soothed by using aftershave to ease the nicks and such. I have recently switched over to Double Edge safety razor on the toss away multiple head shavers. The DE Safety razors are very sharp, and nicks now occur, were they were seldom on the duller toss aways. So a good after shaved seemed a worthy product to try, and it works.

I am working on my own modifications to the filter as this is unacceptable.The flow is great with the bypass device in place so it is not the valve.

She bears her soul in this album and you can feel what she's sayin every note. Problem is...I wouldnt have even know about her. Luckily my Rhapsody is fixed at the hip-hop and neosoul radio stations. We know how the industry works and I hope not to see her fall off because of poor marketing...Other than that, excellent Work Lina"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't get any better!!","review":"This CD is hot!!!! I've bought it the day it was released and have been playing it from start to finish non-stop since. I've been a huge fan since her first album and this one is just like it, but her trademark sound is updated. She deserves to be put out there for the world to hear. She is too damn good a artist not to be. I'm a Lina fan for life. My favorites are:Come To Mama: (I have this song on repeat daily. It's hot and I love the lyrics...real sexy)Hope, Wish, & Pray: (Just love the beat)Smooth: (just like the title, it's just smooth and beautiful)On My Own (very uplifting)I AmFlyStory GoesThe whole thing is fire.

Join the movement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"This CD has surprised me beyond words. I heard one song and took a risk in picking it up. Lina's smooth as silk vocals, sexy beats and catchy hooks make this one of the best song compilations I have heard in a while. Definitely down-tempo with an Ella Fitzgerald meets Morcheeba sound, songs like \\"My Fix\\", \\"Come to Mama\\" and \\"Fly\\" shine on this refreshing CD. It's not often that an artist comes along with an album without any filler music whatsoever, and that is what Lina has managed to pull off with \\"The Inner Beauty Movement.\\" I hope to hear more from this talented artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sounds more like trip-hop","review":"Fell in love with her voice and her albums. I wouldn't put her in R&B though, it's way more like trip-hop. She uses all the elements I hear with artists like Esthero, Morcheeba and Sneaker Pimps. I only use then for genre comparsion, she is much better than say Morcheeba who can be uneven in quality. Try her and you'll fall in love too."},{"rating":"2","title":"TALK ABOUT IMPROVING ON YOUR DEBUT!","review":"This CD is off the hook AND chain and anything else you can name!

Until then I will continue my search of old bookshops."},{"rating":"1","title":"strange and fascinating-boring and naive","review":"I read this book a couple of years ago, lead on by HP lovecrafts recommendation. It features one of the most bizarre and fascinating fantastic visions of mankind in an apocalyptic future, millions and millions of years from now. In that area the fiction works. The trouble is all the other components. The author has tried to concoct a love-story of some kind, that unfortunately turns out to be one of the worst I have ever encountered. Unbearably romantic in the worst sense, full of clichés... whatever, you name it. But all in all, if you are a serious dark-fantasy-fanatic, this one might still be worth some while."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as easy as it sounds","review":"I bought this dvd based on what great customer reviews it had but was very disappointed. I am new to exercise and found this dvd much too hard to follow. Although I like her perkiness she moves too quickly without explaining well enough what you are supposed to be doing. I spent most of my time jumping around not quite sure what I was supposed to be doing. The only part I could really keep up with was upper body. Although I think this would be a good video for someone already experienced with an exercise program definitly not for a beginner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just okay","review":"I was disappointed in this dvd. I like the upper body and lower body segment. However, the \\"techno\\" music is annoying and the studio where the video is shot is unappealing to me. An \\"abs\\" section would have been nice since it is supposedly a \\"total workout\\". I have bought many many work out videos and I have a pet peeve about them - when you have a cardio section you need to show the instructors legs. You don't need a close up of her face while she is instructing- you need to see what she is doing. Needless to say this dvd shows the instructor talking away from the waist up during challenging cardio steps. I will use it for the arms and lower body but that's it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Refreshing!!","review":"This video is really great for beginners and intermediates. The 10 minutes workouts of each section (cardio, upper body, lower body, and stretch) are just enough to make you keep going and not want to quit. Good work out for a tight schedule!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense 10 min!","review":"I really love this workout! It can be broken down in to a 10 min workout, or you can do all the segments if you have more time. It's to the point, intense, and Amy Dixon is motivating without being too chatty or annoying. I love that she does the workouts right along with the back-up girls. Great for when you don't have time for a full workout, but don't want to feel guilty by blowing off exercise. I mean, who doesn't have at least 10 min to spare?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout!","review":"Amy Dixon is amazing! This workout is wonderful! It's divided into four 10-minute workouts - a warm-up, lower body, upper body, and a cool down. The warmup is lots of kickboxing and the cooldown is a lot of balance work. This DVD definitely makes you sweat, and is a great addition!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Big surprise!","review":"I was so surprised by the effectiveness of this workout! I have some other workout videos that are similar in that there are several ten-minute segments, but I haven't been happy with all of them. This one is definitely my favorite!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Total Body Workout","review":"This is one of the best workouts I've purchased in a while. Amy is a great instructor and gives excellent cueing through out the workout. You start off with a cardio section that gets the heart pumping. This is a nice segment using simple to follow moves that are still challenging. The next section is lower body and you get a nice variation that challenges your large muscle groups. The following segment is upper body and this moves quickly but is very effective in getting in a great 10 minute segment to challenge your upper body. The last segment is balance and stretch and this is my favorite. She uses yoga moves that are doable and still a challenge, you feel it and know you are getting a great stretch in. The bonus ab segment is just as great and all total this is a great 50 minute workout to do as a whole. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a nice balanced workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect, exactly what I was looking for.....","review":"I love everything about this dvd. It's simple, quick, not so easy...but that's exactly what I wanted. Something that I will feel in the morning. The dvd menu allows you to pick which part of your body you want to focus on, so far I've only chosen the lower body and for that they suggest you use two 3 pound weights. I have two 10 pound weights instead. If you desire to do more then 10 minutes you can always replay the routine or move on to another routine that focuses on another part of the body. I am not extremely overweight. I just have 10-15 lbs that I would like to shed and I also desire to tone up and this dvd is perfect. Also, the lady that directs the workouts isn't annoying at all and there's nothing cheesy about the workouts or the people in the dvd....like many workouts out there that tend to look really ridiculous and outdated. The routines are easy but very effective. Overall, I think this is the only workout dvd that I will need."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Workout","review":"If you currently have WH Ultimate Fat Burn and are worried that Total Workout in 10 is the same workout, it's not. The routines and combinations are diverse enough that you're not following the same workout on a different DVD. I like the fact that you have the option of doing 4 ten minute segments or one pre-built workout that combines all four routines. It's lots of fun and not too difficult, so I recommend it to people who are just starting to workout. The flexibility segment incorporates a few yoga moves which I really like. And there is also an abdominal routine as a bonus segment, but you need a stability ball. I consider myself as having an intermediate fitness level, so the only downside is that I don't feel 10 minutes is really enough time to get a good workout. So I'm probably only going to recommend the per-built workout which guides you through all 4 routines as one workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good exercise video","review":"Not for an absolute beginner or someone totally out of shape. She starts with 10 minutes of aerobics, then 10 minutes of lower body, 10 minutes of upper body then 10 minutes of stretching and flexibility. There is also a bonus 10 minutes using an exercise ball. The instructor Amy Dixon is cute and perky and slightly irritating like most of them are. It is a good workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"not for a complete beginner","review":"great video but had me really breathing hard in the 10min aerobic section. you can follow the low impact person, which i will do next time. otherwise, great format and looking forward to doing more. oh--i believe you need handweights for the upper body part."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite","review":"I have two of her videos and this one is my favorite. You can actually follow her and get a great workout. Sometimes I'm on this internet when I should be exercising and I love the fact that it's in 10 minute segments...but once I start I usually go thru all segments because I can. She gets your heartrate up and then lowers it before you finish. I'm over 50 and over weight so I think it's a good exercise video for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dixon Rocks","review":"This video is excellent. It is challenging and motivating. The music isn't too annoying like most exercise videos, and Amy Dixon is a great instructor. I will absolutely buy her other videos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, convenient workout.","review":"This is a very good exercise DVD. The segments are short and effective --the arm work out is great and I really like the cardio portion too. It's fast paced but the moves are pretty simple so you don't get lost. And really, at about 10 minutes each, it's hard to make excuses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ideal for those who \\"don't have time\\"","review":"Until this video, I didn't work out in the mornings, but I bought this video and every morning I thought \\"it's just ten minutes.\\" Ten minutes worked it's way to forty minutes and I hardly notice a difference in time but I notice a major difference in the way I look and feel. The arm and leg work outs are amazing and the bonus core workout is one of the best I've tried(but you need a stability ball for it). After doing just ten minutes a few mornings, even when I'm strapped for time I want to do more.

If my trip involved going it alone to smaller Polish towns I would have been very lonely but could have survived. Luckily my trip was only 4 days total in Warsaw and didn't have much need for Polish. But I earned MAJOR brownie points with cashiers, wait staff and seminar attendees for the fundamental Polish that learned from this one introductory CDROM."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely worth watching","review":"ootpath is a great under rated movie in bollywood. It borrows a little from Sean Penn movie State of Grace. It even borrows from an older Mahesh Bhatt movie with Akshay Kumar. Cant remember the name of the previous film it copied. Footpath is a far better version with great acting and plot. This is the debut of Emraan Hasmi and he has done a fantastic job playing the bullied little brother. Rahul Dev delivers a strong performance and suits the character. Aftab is decent compared to his other films. Bipasa Basu is ermm well cant think o what to say. She looks sexy and id like to get naughty with her. The other actress is pretty. It has a nice song and it is definitely worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Viva La C.P. Ripley","review":"Ripley's writings on contemporary Cuba brings the reader to the hearts and minds of the Cuban people and culture. Through his eyes we experience the warmth, beauty and guile of the characters. Our senses are inundated with his descriptive prose of everyday life in Cuba. The main thing I take from this reading is that we the people of the United States have been deprived of access to an extraordinary culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"An author you just want to smack in the head...","review":"It is hard to put one's finger on just what it is about this guy that is so damn annoying. Maybe it's the way he spouts off \\"facts\\" about Cuba that would appear to have been gleaned from Reader's Digest. Maybe it is the way he reminds one of that pesky \\"authority\\" sitting next to you on an international flight who deems it his responsibility to enlighten everyone else in coach. Or maybe it is just that he appears to be so damn american. Whatever it is, it is creepy. Pick it up at your library and give it a quick read some afternoon, but only after you have read works by more credible authors. There are scores out there with more credibility on this subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"CRYSTAL","review":"THIS TISSUE COVER IS BEAUTIFUL.

I think this dvd is great for any F&S fan. If you haven't seen the original series a few of these sketches will be new to you. There are no special features (just \\"Play\\" \\"Chapters\\" \\"Bio's\\"), but it's French and Saunders. I recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nasal...","review":"The instrumentation on this CD is wonderful, but I have to agree with the other reviewer that commented on Al-Jundi's voice. It can best be described as \\"nasal & droning\\". I thought that perhaps this is the way traditional Syrian songs are sung and tried to appreciate it for it's authenticity, but alas, the droning quality of the singer's voice doesn't change from song to song and it gets old quickly. Hossam Ramzy arranged the traditional songs and produced the CD. This lends credence and support to Zein Al-Jundi's effort, but the CD just does not have enough variety or vocal sophistication to keep one's interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunate mutilation of great traditional songs","review":"The musical background is well done but the singer's voice does not do justice to the great traditional songs from the Syrian musical heritage. I wish there were a way to filter out the singer's voice and enjoy the music. I will give away my CD if someone is willing to pay for the shipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very low quality for the price","review":"I had been wanting a House of Staunton chess set for years. I finally paid out the money and bought this set. When it arrived I was shocked to find that the base of the king did not contain a felt pad (or a leather one as advertised) - it was just a plug of lead with a rough surface. I couldn't even place it on my chess board for worry that I would scratch the board. In addition, one of the queens had a funky white discoloration on the base. I contacted House of Staunton and was made to feel guilty by their customer service. I had to send in pictures and make numerous phone calls before I could get them to agree to send replacement pieces...not the level of customer service that you would expect from a company that charges as much as they do for their products. I do not recommend purchasing this set or any other from this company."},{"rating":"2","title":"A handy guide to what makes software projects succeed","review":"Andrew Stellman and Jennifer Greene's Applied Software Project Management provides software engineers with a handy guide to what makes software projects succeed.

This covers every aspect of ski technique, and gives a person a lot to think about, and to apply to their own skiing. Very worth while book and I would definitely buy it if you are at least an intermediate skier. I don't think this is going to necessarily help a beginner, although, if they are hungry for knowledge it would be worth reading. Covers a lot of info on tuning, boot fitting, skis, etc.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Piece Of Crap Ever!","review":"This is the worst wrestling & commentary that I have ever seen and heard.

Good thing the promoter (Black) had porn money to make this crap cuz he couldnt earn a dime doing this legit.

I've read 2 of the books by Scott Kelby (Digital Photography and Digital Photography 2) and he recommended this book. Well, I had the chance to thumb through the book at a local photography exhibit and couldn't put it down. I love the simple guidelines mentioned, the beautiful photography, and the examples he gives to drive home his points. It had the same easy flow that I loved in Scott's books....with the emphasis on travel and nature photography that I was looking for. I've referred back to this book several times to brush up on different subject matter. This one will definitely stay in my reference arsenal."},{"rating":"2","title":"See the world through Mr. Sammon's eyes","review":"Not only a wonderful teacher, but also a real old fashioned adventurer who likes to see everything with his own eyes.

Excelent explanations, lot of things I would have never thought about, and, most of all, some very very good photos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Promotion vs photography","review":"I was surprised when the book was unwrapped that it was outdated and talked about using Elements 2. Throughout the CD's he kept reiterating as he did a procedure that if he was doing it for a client he would be more precise. His readers aren't worth precise? This was all done off the cuff with no outline or plan. He evidently feels he's good enough to be able to just \\"wing it.\\" Really Mr. Sammon you aren't. Teaching and writing are arts that require planning, precision, and commitment. Three items I found lacking in this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that good","review":"I have to agree with the negative reviews of this book. I've read through the \\"Captive Animals\\" lesson, and I don't want to read any more: the lessons aren't particularly helpful. The lack of shooting info for the sample pictures is disappointing. The Photoshop tips seem pointless unless you already know a LOT about Photoshop: even then, Photoshopers probably wouldn't get much out of them. The advice mentioned in other reviews (wear a hat, protect your camera from the elements) seems silly in a book like this.This book as well as others by the author are shrink wrapped in the bookstore: apparently it's to prevent potential buyers from previewing it and deciding to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!~!~","review":"I love this band and their songs. I heard them the first time when I went to Lymbyc Systym's gig in Brooklyn. Their songs made me feel like lazing on the grass on summer days while listening to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jay-Z is the MAN","review":"Very informative.

His final concert seemed to be energetic, I could feel it through my television."},{"rating":"2","title":"Performer At The Top.","review":"This show documents one of the finer performers in the rap world. While most of his contemporaries are busy fighting with each other, Jay just does his thing and blows them all away with pure talent. I notice another review here states that all rap music is garbage while ranting about it being done by a two year old. If you can find me a two year old capable of the wit and intelligence demonstrated here by Jay and his work I'll gladly buy your crappy Alyssa Milano movie. Jay is \\"the man\\", not you. Stop with the hating and try watching some real talent at work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I strongly disliked this dvd. Even with all the other talent on the disc it was terrible. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have","review":"This is a MUST HAVE for any Jay-Z fan. It features all of his hits and the guest appearances by other artists just sweetens the performances. You see a lot of the creative genius/madness behind the scenes and gives a peek at how much goes into making a tour (and music) happen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fade to Black","review":"Fade to Black to me is one of the best ever biographical movies. It deeply expresses amazing views,thoughts,and expressions of Jay Z's personal position on retiring. Far from being boring and dull, it brings life to how emotional and life changing events can affect ones decision on something as simple as retiring. To Jay it was more than that, it was like a thank you letter to all of the people, fans, whoever throughout his career helped him achieve his goal as a rapper. So to return the appreciation he searches for every element he can obtain to give back what we(people, fans) have gave to him. This movie is more than informative and interesting its like one of those good books you cant just put down! To me this is a must have. Thank you to Shawn Carter, Jay-Z, Young Hova, Iceberg Slim, etc.without you this would not be possible. Best rapper alive!SlongLenoir, NC"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful Christian and Bluegrass in one","review":"These are some fantastic singers on this album.

The shelf is sturdy and bins are light weight so dropping them doesn't injure little toes. For larger toys, I'd recommend something with larger bins."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The blouse part of this costume was definitely not very flattering and it fit horribly- very tight and not adjustable (should have used elastic). Honestly, I am very surprised this was said to fit up to a size 12.

I love watching the progression of Gene Colons work (under several different inkers) and the Jack Kirby drawn tales. Love the paper and coloring as well... thank you Marvel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Imperius Rex!","review":"This book reprints the first 18 stories from the Sub-Mariner series in Tales To Astonish, plus Namor's appearance in Daredevil #7 which directly lead into the series. One missing story that should be here is the Iron Man story from Tales Of Suspense #80, which is the first part of a two part Sub-Mariner vs Iron Man battle that concluded in Tales To Astonish #82. Most of the book is taken up by an extended serial, complete with cliffhangers, where Krang takes over Atlantis and Namor fights to get his throne back. Very good Silver Age comics in a high quality hardcover book with good paper."},{"rating":"1","title":"DLO Action Jacket for Zen Vision M","review":"I bought my action jacket about two weeks ago for my Zen. I have other DLO jackets for other products and was always really happy with them. The performance of the jacket is fine...but I was unhappy when I took the jacket off my player and found deep and irreparable scratches and grooves on the front of my shiny new player. For some reason, the laminate protecting the screen is extended down to the button area and is stitched in a thick line that is now permanently etched into the front of all the buttons on my player. Not really good testing or thinking on the part of DLO."},{"rating":"1","title":"Joining the chorus of \\"Boooo!!!\\"","review":"I'm puzzled as to how this product made it past QA testing. It's unbelievable that the product testing group forced this \\"jacket\\" on a Creative Zen, played with it and thought \\"Hey! It's good to go!\\"This thing should be renamed the \\"DLO Strait Jacket\\". As others have mentioned, this case is a half size too small. In order to make it tolerable and allow my Zen to function, I had to: 1) cut the material at the top of the case where the power button is, so that it had some free play to stretch front-to-back; and 2) work the center of the case by inserting my hand to stretch out the width and depth so that the case could slide onto the Zen without constantly pressing the buttons.It's one thing for users to modify a product to make it better; it's another when users have to modify it to make it functional. If the price on this product dropped below $10, I'd say yeah, ok. But as-is, you should avoid it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would rate zero stars if possible","review":"As has been said the jacket it so tight that mine actually constantly caused the bottom two control buttons to be depressed rendering the Zen unusable.Power button is totally in accessible.

This thing is extremely poorly designed. That said I bought this at Best Buy and am stuck with it. The problems that I had with this thing were the beginnings of scratches on my screen and having no cutout for the power button. So I bought myself a screen protector and cut a hole in the top of this jacket. Not particularly attractive but I made the best out of a bad situation. The armband is terrible (it doesn't fit!) but the belt clip is nice. I'll use it around the house but might use something prettier for venturing outdoors!"},{"rating":"1","title":"would have none if it was offered.....","review":"ditto for everything that's written below. i purchased this item and returned it today. best thing about the item is the packaging it comes in allows you to return it without a restocking fee as it just snaps open and close. very disappointed.again the cons:1. fits so snug that it keeps buttons pushed down not allowing you to do much of anything.2. there's not a cut out for the power button on top making it almost impossible to turn off.3. it's pretty expensive at 25-35 to have all these pitfalls."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT for 60 GB and bairly for 30 GB","review":"ok for starters i have a friend that purchased one of these nice skins for their 30GB Zen. They said it worked fine once it got streach out. The same can not be said for the 60GB version of the Zen. If anyone manufactor in their right mind could please stop smoking crack for a second and please post, note, whatever, to make a mark that if it fits a 30GB or a 60GB. i have searched many websites with no success.In short not for the 60GB buttons are mashed down no matter how you streach it. broke mine trying >< can't use it to weight lift like i wanted now."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm hoping to return it","review":"I spent a day messing about with this jacket feeling like I was the idiot.

I am returning this now. I hope that Beast Buy will accept it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Wonderful","review":"When I bought my Creative Zen 30 GM, this was the only case available. I am extremely unhappy w/ this case. It is extremely difficult to get the player out of the case. It is difficult to turn on the player, b/c the top is not open to slide the on/off button. The design of the case has left a permanent scratch on my player where the stitching goes around the slide button. It traps dust and dirt in between the clear case which creates scratches on the screen. Not a good case at all and should be discontinued."},{"rating":"1","title":"Panasonic DVD-S29S DVD Player","review":"I had this item for 28 days and it stopped working. By the time I was able to contact the seller it was the 32nd day. As there is only a 30 day warrantee they would not exchange it, but advised to go to the manufacture. The manufacture charges more then the unit to fix it.This is a cheep item, I would not advise buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid budget player!","review":"I am an avid movie watcher. You probably are too if you are reading reviews on DVD players. I bought this unit a little over a week ago and so far have had no complaints. Everything I have thrown at it has played with no problem. This includes burned DVD's and the like. The player itself has a nice sleek like, with blue text and red icons on the display for what type of mode or type of disc you are viewing. As mentioned in other reviews, the remote can have a bit of a learning curve, with its myriad of buttons and modes. However, by using the manual and some experimentation, I found the added features of the player to be very useful. Obviously, I haven't had it long, but I am looking forward to many hours of use.I highly recommend this player to anyone who is looking to spend under 100 dollars and get a solid player. I only give it 4 stars because I haven't had it for very long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plays all","review":"I don't know why some other reviewer had an issue with playing home-made dvds.

The fact that the Panasonic played DVD-RAM was appealing, as was the price and the wonderful reviews on Amazon and elsewhere. Little did I know that the Panasonic cannot play homemade DVD's that are recorded on another brand's recorder. My 2-year old Zenith had no trouble playing my homemade DVD's, but the Panasonic froze up.After reading the manual, testing the unit, and looking on Panasonic's website, I finally called the service line. They informed me DVD's recorded on anything but Panasonic recorders would not play properly.If you have no intention of playing homemade DVD's, this may still be a good player for you. I personally think this is an absurd limitation, and it should have been listed in their product specs and manual (which I read before purchasing). I guess \\"standardization\\" is not a priority with Panasonic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finicky about damaged DVDs","review":"I don't have anything to add that other reviews haven't already stated, except that my unit seems to be finicky about playing DVDs that are scratched or damaged. I get alot of my DVDs from NetFlix. In the two months I've had this player I've encountered three DVDs it wouldn't play--one wouldn't play at all and the other two started skipping halfway through the movie. With two out of the three I was able to play them successfully in my computer's DVD drive. Previous to this I owned a cheap-o Wal-Mart DVD player (Emerson, I think) and it never refused to play a DVD.In short, I'm very happy with the features and performance of this DVD player, but wish it wasn't so intolerant of slightly scratched DVDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"King of Queens Season 9","review":"Had to continue to complete the series- endless entertainment!

Ace Digital Photo sent an e-mail stating that there was a $5.00 balance and that I should call a certain number. I called the number it was out of service. About five days ago, I sent an e-mail to Ace Digital Photo through the link provided by Amazon. They haven't bothered to respond.

This is without a doubt the best NFL highlight DVD I've ever bought. Each section deals with a different subject. My personal favorite is \\"Intimidators\\" which deals with the meanest, baddest, hardest hitting players of all time making some of the meanest, baddest, hardest hits of all time. For a real treat watch Bednarik take Gifford's head off in slow mo.As a BALTIMORE Colt fan it was great to see the bits on Mackey, Moore, Unitas, etc. The clip of Mackey running over 10 guys on the way to the end zone is included here and I've only seen that on 1 other DVD. The clips of Sayers are priceless but all the great running backs are here. There's also a great part where they ask players to name the best play of their careers and then show those plays in slow mo. If there is an NFL films worthy of 5 stars this is it."},{"rating":"2","title":"NFL History","review":"Wow. If you like football and want to learn a lot, get this DVD.

It also is more princessy/fairytail looking then I thought it would be, an aesthetic I was trying to avoid. If you want to compare the color of the tulle, the light pink bridal tulle at Joanne's Fabric Store is the exact same color (I had some tulle rounds leftover from the baby shower). The third layer of fabric behind the 2 tiered layers of tulle is also a matching light pink cotton/muslin. I tried to see if the color of the crib skirt would change having a white or cream piece of fabric behind the tulle, but both colors made little difference, just a smidgen lighter, but the purple is still there.

I had such high hopes with this one. I'm a huge fan of the Western, and the spaghetti Western is one of my favorites. Reading the synopsis, I couldn't wait to get into this one. It started out good, with Joseph Cotton and his family slaughtering the Union soldiers, then it just fizzled from there. To me, it borrowed too much from Django; like Sergio Corbucci couldn't think of anything else and decided to add another coffin. If you're looking for something like Hellbenders to watch for the first time, I highly recommend Django or Keoma. Other reviewers will tell you Keoma has a really bad score, but you get used to it and it's a really cool movie, as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another One Bites The Dust","review":"A lot of the plot devices are a little too convenient and dialogue often comes off kind of and stagey and over-enunciated, but if you can see past that, The Hellbenders takes a few less than likable characters on some occasionally unexpected turns and may be enjoyable for its 1967 spaghetti western vibe. By the end of the movie I felt it had fairly captured something unique in Western poetic pathos. Thus a 4 instead of 3-star rating. I deliberated, beleive me.This movie is one step up from B western movie fare, but only a step - still, fans of the era might find it worthwhile.Set just after the civil war, a murderous ex-confederate general and his sons assault and steal a large sum of money from the cavalry in order to re-start the Southern war effort against the Yanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reason to go on!","review":"After attending Lenten sessions with Madeleine at the Cathedral, I began reading her four-part autobiography.

I placed one on each side of my lower spine and, again, got the relief I was looking for.But I took them off after about 6 hours and immediately noticed a little itching where they had been. In short, I had an allergic reaction with intense itching and red welts like hives for at least two week after. I had no reaction from the larger patch I used on the area first. I think this is a good product and perhaps I happen to be susceptible to a reaction from whatever is in them, but I would simply warn users to be careful and not leave them on too long until they are sure how they react to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unusual Combo of Two Masters","review":"Superb, smooth and subtle.

Since I used version 5 for a number of years the learning curve for me was pretty flat. I do especially like the touch-up feature as I do photo touch up frequently. The clone features are still there as well as a red eye repair which I often see with pictures taken with digital cameras. I do appreciate the simplfied version of the tool bar which appears at the top when a tool is selected and the ease of toggling to a full version of the tool features on the right of the screen with a simple tab to move in and it out of the way for a full view. A really great product worth the money.

I am very happy with this.I have only two complaints so far:(1) My 48 bit scans must be converted to 24 bit before most editing operations are possible. I think Ulead wants me to buy PhotoImpact 11 to remedy that.(2) My major complaint is that I cannot obtain a clean cloning line. The ability to set percentage of color drawn from the source, and to set percentage of soft edge in application make for a wonderful improvement over the free Adobe PhotoDeluxe software I replaced, but I sorely miss being able to clean right up to the edge of a colored area in an image. PI 10 pulls color from the adajacent field if you get really close, and this is extremely frustrating."},{"rating":"2","title":"component download is really bad","review":"I've always liked Photoimpact. It has a Lot of features. But every time I tried it, I had trouble with the component download. When you want to use a special feature it says it needs to download a component, then the download freezes or takes forever. They just don't seem to be able to fix this or put enough bandwidth on their site. I've had this problem with different computers, providers and OSes, so it's not just my configuration. I've had no problem downloading anything else.So eventually, I'd give up on Photoimpact due to their awful component download even though I like it better than other graphics programs.In fact, I just went to the ulead site to try it one more time, and sure enough the darn site doesn't load. I've got a high speed connection and everything else is loading quickly. I'm still waiting on ulead as I write this.

If you think today's lawyers are crooks, you should read about the exploits of Messrs Howe and Hummel; they bear no comparison. For example you will read about suits for breach of promise. If a man slept with a woman on the understanding that he would shortly marry her, and he broke that promise, the woman could sue him for breach of promise to marry. Some of the lawyers' income depended on a coterie of sophisticated New York women, semi-prostitutes, who \\"led on\\" innocent young men from the sticks up in New York for the first time. After a brief relationship these women would file suit for breach of promise and daddy would invariably pay up rather than face the embarrassment of a public court case.

And a small town coroner is hardly equipped to pronounce a person's cause of death--that takes a medical examiner and usually lots of time spent in forensics. And seriously, a rotting dead body smells to high heaven and is unlikely to lie around in an attic un-noticed.My edition is riddled with typos, from a police officer named \\"Luscious\\" to a character named Harley or Haley, depending upon which page you are on, to someone who crosses his \\"heat\\" and hopes to die."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long and Unconvincing","review":"We expect a more or less implausible set of circumstances underlying a mystery novel.

The real fault of the book is in its characters. All characters are flat and are never developed fully and as such it is difficult to relate to them and learn why they do what they do- a major disappointment since the story leands itself to explore the mind of a free willed woman. The author takes a very superficial and simplistic approach to the entire novel.

I was searching for a helpful book to suggest. I read SURVIVING WIDOWHOOD before suggesting it and found it most useful. Goshen-Gottstein has a solid social psychology background which allows her to step away from her own experience of widowhood and relate to the larger issue of loss.

Maybe now, about twenty books later, he should spend some time developing a story line featuring Helen Soileau....I think he has worked Robicheaus to death! \\"Sunset Limited\\" was a complex read, not a riveting read, but moreso an unsatisfying read.E.J.

I was raised in the South and lament the long shadow it casts over everything in the U.S., but Burke's book is just one violent spray of blood after another. Too often the critics think only violence makes for characterization. The South has a clotted history but Southern men like Ken Starr are more damaging to the national psyche than the swamp things that rise up in this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"VINTAGE ROBICHEAUX....","review":"I'm not saying I didn't enjoy Burke's newest Dave Robicheaux novel, but some of his early works were a little better. It seems to me that the characters have lacked growth in the last few novels, and there was much too little about Dave's relationships with Bootsie and Alafair in \\"Sunset Limited\\". I think it would be great to touch more upon Robicheaux's trying to cope with his daughter as she enters adolesence and maybe inject some events into his life which put his convictions to a stern test. The last few book's plots have been too much in the cookie cutter mold: I had a pretty good idea who was gonna be left standing at the end of the book. On a positive note, I was happy there wasn't alot of the metaphysical mumbojumbo like conversations with dead people or having the locations of missing bodies being pointed out in dreams. All in all mediocre Burke is better than about 99% of the stuff out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Bye Dave Robicheax","review":"By saying goodbye to Dave Robicheaux I suppose I am saying goodbye to James Lee Burke. I can only say \\"thank you\\" to James Lee Burke since he has provided me many great hours of entertainment with his Robicheaux novels; but Robicheaux may have died in \\"Sunset Limited\\" because I gave up on page 258. I found the characters and the plot confusing, and I would have been happy if a bomb had killed eveyone on page 50.Apparently, the characters from \\"Cimarron Rose\\" are going to take up Mr. Burke's time, and since I didn't care for this book I am not going to read anymore James Lee Burke for awhile.

Perhaps because I'm new to the characters and the series, I didn't really care that much about what happened.

I do not understand why the author feels it is necessary to tell me what everyone is wearing. I bet he wants to set the character personality and style- but it seems discordant with the thoughtful but tough guy Robicheaux to be so descriptive of fashion. The plot did have some unexpected twists, but it is jerky- lots of stops and starts (like a train?). The action scenes did not grab my minds eye as well as some other novels. The ending, while poetic, is unexpectedly trite."},{"rating":"2","title":"As usual, a cut above the rest!","review":"Burke maintains his usual high standard in this complicated and disturbing crime novel. Like always, the novel is loaded with atmosphere and interesting, fully evolved characters. Burke eloquently portrays the violence and injustice that lurks beneath the surface of our world. His world is a dark place in which in many people have not progressed beyond the mentality that existed in the pre-civil war era.In Sunset Limited there are many crimes that needs to be solved. You need to pay attention or you could easily get lost. I thought the story suffered a little because of its slight lack of focus, and for this reason I don't think it was as good as some of his previous books. But overall, it was a gripping and well-written crime novel that is clearly a cut above the genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Fans of the Series","review":"James Lee Burkes David Robicheaux novels are some of the best suspense/mystery novels out there. Great dialogue, characters you care about, great descriptions of New Orleans, and intelligent story lines are just some of what sets these novels apart.I feel as a fan of the series, Sunset Limited continues that trend.What I found a little different about this particular novel was the lack of background information on some of the series secondary characters. I have found that any of the other novels in the series give enough information that someone new could start with any of them. However, this is not the case with Sunset Limited. Therefore, I do not recommend this particular David Robicheaux novel for newcomers. I was surprized at just how little his wife, Batist, his daughter had to do with this story. But again, other than that this was a great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many psychopaths for one book.","review":"The standard characters of the series are first-rate and have come into their own.

The songs are arranged nicely as the listener is treated to an array of themes: among which are lust, cynicism, a lot of black humor and light-hearted moments. Morrissey makes some interesting sounds with his voice on this work and improvises some of the lyrics, providing alternately strange and refreshing accents to the songs.Ultimately it's about the uniqueness of this artist and the ongoing passion he brings to the music world.

Far better than the played out and repeated crap that usually comes out of Hollywood.

Granted, it may not have been the best concept, and some bits were kinda tough to watch, but they did a darn good job with in on the whole. I liked it way more than The Marine, and Stone Cold is a better actor than John Cena. The difference is that with Stone Cold, I could tell a difference between Jack Conrad the guy I see in the WWE ring every now and then. Good cinematography, and excellent fight sequences.My point is, this is a great action movie, Stone Cold is not just a stomper of mud holes, and I can see an improvement in the quality of WWE's movies.

Vinnie Jones and Stone Cold carried this movie on their shoulders and you knew from the beginning they were going to have a great clash; predictable, but still fun.of course this movie isn't for the light hearted and weak stomached. it is for those who like watching violence reminescent of that shown on UFC (except a step up on the disgust).

I mean if you look at movies like \\"The Marine\\", and \\"Walking Tall\\". What do they both have in common-NO ACTING. I mean the stories were good, but Vince McManon, or how ever you pronounce his last name, just flat-out flopped them both. No emotion, no real expressions of loss, or pain, or just about anything. I think he needs to know what it really takes to make a good movie. However, \\"The Condemned\\" out-shined them with flaw-less proformance.

They sent new chains that are different from the original chains that were on the other swing. The new chains were smaller and not as strong and heavy duty. I called them back and their response was they changed the company that supplies the chains and are not using the heavy duty chains anymore. They will send me a new seat but it doesn't solve the problem of the poor quality. I will take the swing chains to the hardware store and replace them with a better quality chain, but I definitely would not purchase these swings again and am very disappointed in the response I received from the manufacturer.

This book is a pleasure; the author does not waste time with what I already know, and focuses in on creaeting real applications and walking you through what can be done by real programmers with real clients.The writing is clear, reasonably concise, the exercises are well explained, and most important the author provides source code and a forum to ask questions.This book helped me become current again, and I'm very grateful.

Another missed Purchased.Would have liked to have seen this one too."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bad, bad book","review":"This book wasn't even written by Tom Clancy (a fact made clear on the cover in much smaller print than the rest).The book is remarkable in that so little happens in the first 400 pages of the book that you think that there will have to be a sequel to sort out the problems that have been set up. In the event nothing is ever really sorted out and threads are left dangling.I know that many people don't associate TC with fine literature, but his books have a rhythm and pace that few others match. This book has nothing of the sort.Mr Clancy, I am surprised that you allow such a book to be written by someone else and have your name on the cover.You have lost a reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible book!!","review":"I'm not sure why some of the reviews for this book have 4 stars, but I thought this was the most incoherent book I read. It was like inflicting torture on yourself to continue reading this book. Stay away from it!And to you John Robertill, in defense of Adam from WI, it's his opinion, let it go. 95% of your review was spent raving about how he made typos instead of giving your thoughts on the book. Obviously you've been deeply wounded by his comments and you have some personal link to the authoring of this ghastly creation called a book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Clancy has sold out by putting his name on books like this","review":"I knew full well that Clancy was not the primary author of this book - that he and Greenberg created a formula framework that Preisler just had to follow. Yet this book still disappointed - the author truly seemed to be just plugging stock spy thriller components into a \\"choose your own adventure\\" framework, and was left with a choppy book with a poor plot, insufficient character development and a climax that was boring at best.Sure, they make him tons of money, but Clancy should really rethink putting his name on books like these - they diminish his reputation and \\"brand\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge disappointment","review":"This book is a very poor book with a very poor plot and is devoid of any imagination. It is badly written and the characters lack credibility. The only reason it merits a 1 in my opinion: no lower score was listed in the choices available to this reader. I am disappointed that Tom Clancy would lend his name to such drivel. I will be more judicious in future purchases."},{"rating":"1","title":"No real point","review":"The plot setup takes too long to get a good mystery or combat scenario (which is part mystery, as in _Hunt for Red October_) going. What results then is a sick daytime TV-style romp through the lives and drama of these characters, but it's halfhearted, as are the few combat scenes. The technique of using multiple characters to tell a story falls flat. I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was expecting. I did finish it.","review":"I finished the book so it gets 2 stars. If I can't make it through only one. Most of the book seem to be setting up the characters and not much is happening.

Believe me it enhances the story - which is pure genious and incredible stuff by Priesler. A struggle for power in which an impressionable hostage is taken.

To be honest I don't understand why everybody -except on guy- has rated it badly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I, too, was misled by the huge Tom Clancy by-line that suggested he is the author of this trash. I am dismayed that Mr. Clancy would allow his name to be attached to such sophmoric blundering.

I wouldn't want anyone to mistakenly think it was worth reading and open it. I wish someone had done me the same favour.The caricatures in Mr. Clancy's story are so over-done as to be completely unbelievable. It is impossible to feel any empathy or even relation to any of the characters. They are either the richest, most evil, darkest, happiest, most skilled, most depressed, or most honourable people on the planet.And the final scene with our depressed hero (anti-hero?...you never really get to find out) MAN TO MAN with the super-assassin?

There are so many cult classic GBV songs that come to my mind when I think of Pollard and this cd makes me wonder if the ability to produce one more gem may never happen again.

When the feminine is missing, both societies and individuals are more or less depressed. We know that from history as well as from myths and fairy tales. When we are connected to the feminine we are connected to life. This book and its very creative exercises do just that; help people reconnect to life and heal a wound inflicted by cold rationality. Soul Sisters is at the leading edge of the battering ram that is needed to break down resistance to the deeply needed feminine values."},{"rating":"2","title":"Revenge Can Be Sweet!","review":"Barbara Eden jumps from the bottle not to the fire, so to speak. She plays Mrs. Stella johnson the \\"wild\\" mother whois mentioned in the Jeannie Riley hit Harper Valley PTA. The plot,as the song goes, starts out when daughter Dee is sent home with a note by the PTA saying they don't approve of Mrs. Johnson's lifestyle. Stella gets an earful of gossip about the righteous members of the PTA from beautician friend Alice(Nanette Fabray) and plans to fight fire with fire, setting each member up to an hilarious downfall. Along the way she has help from admirer Will Newton(Ron Cox) and bartender Herbie(Ron Masak). I have always loved this movie since I was about 5(back when it had become a short-lived tv show). I'm a big fan of Ron Masak's and he's a genius! Told by director Richard Bennett, Ron ad-libed 90% of his dialogue throughout the movie. Anything that comes out of his mouth is priceless!

I was not denied the rigor. Nataniel Kahn understands the value of honoring his film's subject matter-its architecture. The way of honor was a big part of Professor Kahn's philosophy, in which his materials cried structure! Testing the Kahn legecy this film and its subject matter silently called to my architectural persuits,then pushed itself right into my engineering mind. Since seeing this unique film I've visited the Exeter Academy Library,in which all that past silence,discourse,and the film came to incredible life. The library is an important lessons in reinforced concrete in terms of forming that material into warm spaces and gentle structures.

It is beautifully put together, including a montage of shots of Manchester. Our Morrissey is older, but he hasn't lost his magic. I say it's bittersweet to watch it, because he plays a bunch of old songs and it's just sad to see how time passes by. I guess it will make you get all nostalgic and stuff, is what I'm trying to say. The highlight of the video for me was actually the bonus material from the Move Festival. The crowd is just more passionate and you feel the thrill of being there. The only bad moment was The Headmaster Ritual, which sounded really dull and out of place in the show. Highlights were Everyday is Like Sunday, First of the Gang to Die, and Shoplifters, but it was pretty much all good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"This will be a 5-star DVD in no time. The Comcast cable channel in my area played segments recently. It is a well-crafted, nicely edited, richly musical performance by Morrissey and a polished back-up band.

With this pad they have a one piece \\"cross\\" D-pad which has been around since SNES and Sega and they moved Start and Select where they should have been; near the top of the controller away from the sticks.The change to the buttons is a little odd, but since all the buttons are rubberized I guess it doesn't matter too much. It would attract me more if it had programmable Turbo Fire like a Madcatz pad.

Ms. Veirs seems equally comfortable whether leading her band through rock-out tunes such as Phantom Mountain or balancing a mid-tempo tone on the title track Saltbreakers.If you missed this one when it was brand new, this set of smart folk-rock is well worth checking out.

Nick Nolte's appearance made things even more laughable and unbearable. Goofy movie.I don't care if this review helps no one.

After reading this I'm nor so sure. A warped, twisted rant against the institutions of a free society, against America's brave role in protecting the Jews of Israel from a second, terminal, holocaust, and in general against civilization. Sad and bizarre. I would recommend the works of Danial Pipes, Samuel Hungtington or almost anyone else in preference."},{"rating":"2","title":"All I can say is WOW!","review":"This is an excellent video - high quality & well produced. It gives GREAT info especially for visual learners like myself who sometimes have trouble reading something in a book then making it work in a real-life situation. This gave great info for those who are starting to make their own bread for the first time. Invaluable resource for a beginning to intermediate bread makers!

I am a lawyer by trade and have always found the kitchen to be of special therapy for me as a stress free life ingredient! Trust me I am not a cook, more like a hazardous beast in the kitchen! So when I say that I learned to make the most yummy fresh baked herb bread EVER i mean it!!! If I can do it anyone could. These ladies are thorough in explaining how to make a crusty warm bread from scratch. Worth every penny. Once you bake your first loaf you will find it hard to buy a loaf of bread from the supermarket. The big plus: you bring some to work and tell everyone you made it from scratch! You just became the office superhero!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good!","review":"For me, this DVD wasn't as detailed as their Art of Canning DVD but it's still 5 star worthy because it's the best that I have found. The West ladies teach you all the techniques on making homemade bread, hamburger rolls, cinnamon rolls, pizza dough, a breakfast dish and cornbread.Side note:I did have a problem with trying to view this DVD on my computer but it works fine in the regular DVD player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great video to watch and bake with kids","review":"I watched this video with my 6 year old daughter who wanted to bake bread. But I learned a lot myself from it. I am not a novice baker and have been baking bread for years yet the process always had been somewhat overwhelming to begin, especially with kids. The West ladies made it so simple that now I bake almost everyday and not using my bread machine. After watching this, my girl made a bread from scratch almost all by herself, which made herself very confident.If you want to introduce baking to your kids, this video will work well with your purpose. Strongly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I have made bread only once before and it didn't turn out, plus it was quite a process. These women have really made it a simple and fun process.

Pricey for a tuner, but worth it. Originally bought for piano, but use for guitar as well. Accuracy is uncanny, and my guitar has never sounded better.

Interestingly, the Army's new chief of staff, General Eric Shinseki, has begun changing the Army in ways first outlined in this book over two years ago. Among the changes: the adoption of more rapidly-deployable forces, \\"medium weight\\" forces, Light Armored Vehicles, such as those used by the USMC, and a squadron/battalion sized reconaissance element for greater intelligence. The Army has also modified the Officer Personal Management System, a move MacGregor advocated. Sadly, MacGregor himself is a full-bird colonel right now assigned to the National Defense University. Essentially, Macgragor has been put out to academic pasture. He will not get to command a brigade, and consequently will probably not be promoted again."},{"rating":"2","title":"This guide is key for university level Media Studies programs.","review":"Drawn to Television: Prime-Time Animation from The Flintstones to Family Guy joins others in Praeger's 'Television Collection' series, suitable for college-level media studies collections.

Written with great respect, Swami Satyananda tells the many stories that have grown up around this Indian incarnation of the Mother Goddess and her complete devotion to God, which she lives out in both deeply joyful worship and in the exquisite care of those around her. Woven into the warmly good humored and inspiring stories are quiet lessons in Hindu philosophy and religion, reflecting Shree Maa's graceful blending of the various Hindu traditions into Oneness. Recollections by American devotees and delightful Sadhu teaching stories complete the volume.

Simply removing the software and re-installing it will NOT give you additional opportunity to work with the book you have purchased. I have not found secret files or other indications of how to remove the bar to further use of the book and software. If anyone knows how to re-initialize the software so you can use it past the 'limit', please let me know.

It cannot be purchased, nor registered, nor updated (on a Macintosh; the work-around does not affect a trial copy). So all the instruction is effective as a general introduction to Dreamweaver, but useless for the purpose of actually posting a website. If you have a paid copy of MX, well-enough.

Immediately I noticed two things: 1) they felt great on my gums! 2) On the other hand, they did not clean my teeth well, especially between them. However, since they are echo-friendly, i will try the medium strength bristles, and if they do not work, I will be forced back to the Oral-B kind.In summary:Pros:1) Echo friendly product.2) They are soft on gums.3) Product comes with a pre-paid envelope for recycling.Cons:1) Do not clean between teeth.2) You have to replace them every two weeks or so, depending on use, as they tarnish quickly.3) Handles are not comfortable on the hands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best toothbrush ever made!","review":"I've used every brand of toothbrush and this one is outstanding! It is difficult to find an ultra-soft toothbrush for adults, so I was delighted to discover this one.

Take a look at any toothbrush and you'll notice that the head either has no angle or is angled toward the face when brushing. The Preserve brush does the complete opposite. The head of the toothbrush is angled back and away from the face when held. You need to compensate for this angle to bring the head to your teeth by uncomfortably bending your wrist more so than you would a normal brush. IMO, these brushes are unusable. And they definitely should not be used by anyone with any wrist conditions."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Ulra Soft Bristle Toothbrush","review":"I've used many so-called ultra soft toothbrushes in my 58 years of life, and in my opinion The Preserve toothbrush stands alone.

In exchange, we've lost II.11, on abstraction. Since there's little material from Book III, and nothing from III.vi, it's very hard for the reader to make sense of Berkeley's extended attack on abstract ideas in the introduction to the Principles.Re. (3): Inexplicably, the editor has decided to replace John Cottingham's standard 1986 translation of the Meditations with a \`new' translation by Laurence Lafleur, first published in 1951.

This was disappointing especially for what you pay for HABA toys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy!","review":"My three year old loves this. I was a little nervous that he would lose all the pieces within an hour, but he is very careful to put everything away.

The book lists 10 patent formulas for common cold with descriptions/indications for each formula such as: Ge Gen Wan for wind-cold type common cold with stiff neck - or Yin Qiao for wind-heat type with sore throat and fever or the standard Gan Mao Ling.This book is a great reference for beginners or for practitioners that just need to jog their memory.

The only negative is the lack of extras.

To purchase the movie by itself, it would have cost me almost $40.00. By doing it this way, I was able to own 2 of their better works as well as own some of the their other less known films.

I was a bit worried that they wouldn't like the movies, but they did! They loved Frankenstein and the Invisible Man the most!My 4 yr. old asks me every weekend if we can watch Frankenstein.

But ... the overflow hose comes with a zip-tie to attach it to the barrel. Not sufficient. Replace that with a good hose clamp. Also, the overflow hose itself is a flat piece of flex tube: doesn't open up when it needs to, due to the inner plastic adhering to itself. I will be replacing that, too.The watering hose is not held on very well--make sure you tighten the hose clamp well! It came out while my wife was using it and we had a gushing leak.Other design elements are great: screen, varmint grate, overall conception. We like it and use it with a rain chain."},{"rating":"2","title":"recycling made easy","review":"quick delivery of product and fits snugly against outside surface; nice hose feature works when you prop barrel up on cinder blocks so gravity can do it's thing.

He explains his affiliation and wisdom learned from Masters Stanley and Muller, two very intriguing men. Teaching our children well and \\"humble actions\\" that all can easily embrace are well delineated.This is a book that should appeal to everyone from the religious, agnostic, humanist, and ecologist.

I was very moved by its true stories about the magic of living by faith and total self-giving. The author lays his life on the line again and again, and his example draws us to do the same, for the sake of a humanity and a planet glorified by the Love of God.Not every theory and spiritual exercise in this book resonated fully for me. But there was much food for thought in the author's ideas, and much usefulness in his exercises. Most important for me however, was the living example of people making a real difference in the state of the world, by being true to their deepest convictions, and being a Light of Godly service.The life of Herr Muller is truly an exceptional example of esoteric spirituality, combined with very practical, energetic service. Hopefully, his example will become less exceptional, as more people catch the fire of transformation that this book serves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just OK","review":"The shoe seems solid, like any Stride Rite, but even the regular width is very wide.

I didn't really get it at first, but eventually, I suppose that it grew on me and I always find myself returning to those half-lucid, half-insane tunes.Listening to it as an album provides certain rewards and displays the definate presence of a flow from song to song, but the songs can be listened to as individual entities as well. Corpse Pose and Repition are, at least for me, the stand-out tracks, while other tracks like Finger Nails on the Chalkboard are a tad annoying when listened to intently (they don't really say anything except those few words), even though I personally do like that track very much.Overall, I got into this band when I certainly was not ready to listen to similar music.

This collection is largely British/regimental marches that the Guards use in ceremonies such as the Changing of the Guard, investitures, and coronations. 'Crown Imperial', an appropriately named coronation march, was one of the marches played at the crowning of the current monarch, Elizabeth II. A lot of the other marches, namely 'Scipio', 'Army of the Nile', and 'Sussex by the Sea' are marches often used in the Changing of the Guard. 'Milanollo' and 'Figaro' are 2 of the band's regimental marches. 'Sea Shanties' is a great little collection of melodies from the sea such as 'Portsmouth', 'Sailor's Hornpipe', and 'Drunken Sailor'.I was very lucky to find this one as it is not a new recording. Volume II, European Continental & American Marches, is also a great collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sound Military Brass!","review":"This CD from the Regimental Band of the Coldstream Guards is good quality in terms of sound, in range of items, and in the quality of the playing.

If you want a hot night of rock-a-billy in a juke joint without any crowd noise or overdubs of superfluous background singers, then this is the album for you. It just seems to end up in the CD player everytime I fire up the stereo. No frills, just really fine playing and infectious songs, and it gets under your skin from the beginning to the very last cut. Easily the best buy I've made in the past year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"When I started reading historical romances, Johanna Lindsay was one of the first authors that I read. Some of her books on my keepers list are A Gentle Feuding, Fire of Winter, Hearts Aflame. But Glorious Angel is one of her worst books. What do I remember most about this book? The hero. Not because he is so gorgeous and sexy. Just the opposite. He came across as a wimp, no sex appeal at all. And no chemistry and passion between the hero and heroine. An unappealing hero will spoil a book for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so Glorious Angel","review":"I have read many of Johanna Lindey's books, and I particularly like the Malory series. But I found Glorious Angel to be a bit overdone. The heroine has five, yes five, men going crazy for her at the same time. And I use crazy in the literal term. The hero's jealousy is absolutely insane, and makes him come off as very shallow. And no woman in her right mind would put up with him! I end up feeling more sorry for Angela at the end, other than overjoyed. Honestly, I wish that she ended up with one of her other suiters!Glorious Angel is readable, but I suggest that you pick up one of Ms. Lindsey's other books. Try Love Me Forever, that one is GREAT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"Expected a lot more after the gowing review. Very poorly written or editted compared to her other novels.

I have spent many a night pouring over soapmaking books because this is a skill I have long wanted to learn. I have been unable to find anyone in my area to teach me and this dvd filled the gap. I am a very visual person and I learn much quicker if I can watch someone do it instead of just reading about it. They go over both lye and hand-milled (melt and pour) soap making.

Then they spend the money in order to receive dimes as change, and then a young guy disguised as an old guy turns the dimes into paper money at banks. ...Really? Possibly the worst plot of any of the original Hardy Boys books. The subplots are also not interesting.However, the language in which it was written in is pretty cool as are some the exchanges between Frank and Joe & their friends...

We both had a good idea of who was guilty from the start. In addition, the two subplots were way too coincidental when the author tied them together.

And then I pop it in, and the looks go from strange to baffled.It's kind of spoken word; Ashley called it in opera for lack of a better term, and to many people of Gen X or beyond, it might bring up associations of bad William Shatner recordings or a Broadway musical or a beat poetry reading, causing a poor initial reaction.But it is just a dreamy trip through consciousness and beauty and self reflection and irony and word play and I recommend just putting it on, and letting it play, play in the background without paying attention if you don't want.

I am not a fanatic of realism. In fact, I love fantasy, but I think that some subject matters benefit from a sober treatment. If someone wants to read a good book about Auschwitz, he or she should turn to Primo Levi's \\"If this is a Man\\", in which the Italian author tells of his experience there with great honesty and sensibility.

I'd have to say, I doubt children much under 12 would understand \\"the unspoken\\" areas of the book. The book makes reference to things that children might not pick up on like adults.

He would complain about how annoying his sister is or that his house only has three floors instead of five. I mean Shmuel was a Jew who was beaten and starved. I'd like to tell Bruno \\"try being in his shoes for a day\\" which he did, and he surely paid for it.

This book is really quite lame for adult reading; it never made me care enough about any of the characters. I think the right audience is probably kids in their early teens. Problem is, kids in their early teens probably don't know much about the Holocaust, so a portrayal from a child's view that can't even say Führer or Auschwitz properly is surely not going to help them understand. (The use of words by Bruno like \\"Fury\\" or \\"Out-With\\" to refer to those also didn't make a lot of sense to me, particularly because Bruno speaks German, not English.) I was gifted this book and had been told it was being praised by critics, but found it to be a total letdown."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good premise but bad style","review":"When buying this book I didn't know it wasn't written for adults. The style was clearly aimed at children and made the book less enjoyable for me (for as far as a book on this subject can be enjoyable).Because the story is so unrealistic (I don't think children in Auschwitz were able to sit by a fence every afternoon, Shmuell could have just walked out of the camp) I didn't get taken away by the story as much I would have liked to.The end sentence was also to obvious.I think the book would have been better if it had been written from an all knowing perspective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Sad to Like","review":"I found that this was to grim of a book to really enjoy.

Some have criticised the story for being unrealistic or unbelievable, but let us not forget that the subject mattter the story deals with itself is incredible, and yet the atrocities in it and worse have truly occurred in the history of our planet.As for the characterisation of Bruno, I believe that his innocence had to be exaggerated to achieve maximum impact, so one must allow for that artistic license.An easy and quick, but hard-hitting read.It worked for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Startling, even when you know your history","review":"This book wowed me.

However, after delving deeper into this story, his innocence and naivete became irritating to me. By the middle of the story I was quite aggravated with the author's character development style and his protagonist's...gullibility? simplicity? - to the point of wondering if it wasn't more the author than Bruno who was excessively innocent and naive. Young Bruno had, in my opinion, moved beyond innocence and naivete to being just an idiot of a kid. However, the excessive innocence comes to terms successfully in the end, playing a vital, important and necessary component in the final chapters.Within this story there are certainly more points for pondering, reflection and learning than just the innocence of this child and how that played against him - as one should expect in any story set against the Holocaust."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read For A Child!","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It mad me think about being on the other side of the fence. Although, it didn't go into detail from the Jewish child side...it did from the Nazi child. It was a little different perspective.

It is a short book that will interest both adults and young readers. I found the decision to go with a naive 9 year old boy as the main voice of the piece resulted in some interesting misunderstandings about what was actually happening in the story. The plot doesn't seem to be going anywhere until the last 30 pages or so, but it has a good ending that will leave you to think about what happened.The paperback has some weird translations issues. Thankfully the difference is between British and American English, so it shouldn't be confusing to too many people (though I can imagine some young readers would be confused to read about tyres and pyjamas, especially when it is usually spelled pajamas for most of the book).Overall I'd give it 3.5 stars out of 5, but since we can't do half stars, I'm rounding up to 4."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Boy in Striped Pajamas","review":"The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas was a beautifully sad novel.

I also found it annoying that the little pieces of wordplay the author must have thought were very clever because he repeats them ad nauseum don't make any sense given that the characters in the book spoke German as a first language.

It is also short, also features two naive 9-year-old boys, also gives multiple points of view, and also seems to be trying to send out a wake-up call to young people. The difference is that Emil and Karl is well-written, moving, accurate, and full of well-rounded characters across the spectrum of opinions and backgrounds, while \\"The boy in the striped pajamas\\" is maudlin, insulting, shallow, and inaccurate.

By the time most students are 12 years old or in the eighth grade they have already read Anne Frank's Diary and many of them have read Night.

Let's just say I had to wrap both arms around this thing to carry it over to the living room because I couldn't stand having it in my room because it was too loud. Finally, I bought this item to help my severe allergies. I was so disappointed when I had this machine on for a few days because it made my allergies worst!

Unfortunately, in my experience on three different computers, it takes so long to generate those views that it's not really worth the wait.

I quite liked it back then. However, I now have a much more powerful computer (Intel i7, 12Gb Ram, Vista x64, Nvidia GTX 280 etc etc) but i find Powerdesk unacceptably slow. Just one example - when it comes to generating thumbnails of images - forget about it. Its ridiculous. My machine is running at 4GHhz rock solid stable (its used for intensive 3d work that requires 100% stability) and yet I have to wait around for Pdesk Pro to generate a few thumbnails. Any other app (whether it be windows explorer or irfan or adobe bridge etc etc) will generate the thumbnails fast). Also, i find it crashes a lot. I am uninstalling it as of today. I have installed it on an older XP x64 machine though and it seems to be OK on that machine. I am amazed also that the file viewer has not been improved - it doesnt read a lot of files (even image files). The interface is pretty much the same as it was back in version 5.

They said some files might be corrupt, that is highly unlikely on the system that I have and everything else works perfectly.

The location that the film was made,on the Isle of Man,also great. Most interesting was watching the interaction between theGerman occupiers and the occupied British,and the direction that relationships can take when people arethrown together,and must try to make the best of it.Also too,the relationships that develope between the sexes,their nature,and direction,over the course of time,is most interesting,and,I would guess,accurate.It should be noted that a vast majority of the film is not battlefield drama,as there was very little of ithappening in the Channel Islands.

While the novel might have some unrealistic situations - Callahan's exploits involve a lot of \\"outrageous comedic exploits\\" and the dialogue is often more concerned with wry social commentary than an accurate reflection of the way people actually talk (see Doug Coupland) - I feel these touches are allowed in the fictions of Sandlin, Robbins, and Coupland because in all three writers' works, such devices labor in the service of an amusing, socially aware and often touching story. Sandlin - and Callahan - are not trying to transcend anything here or shake the foundations of contemprary American fiction. They're just trying to be nice guys with amusing stories to tell, and in this, Sandlin and his beleaguered protagonist succeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing ending to the trilogy","review":"Huh? I can't believe that mostly everyone gave this book at least four stars. To be blunt, I thought it sucked.Whereas I tore through the Sorrow Floats and Skipped Parts and loved them, I couldn't even finish Social Blunders. It doesn't embody the originality or freshness of the other books at all. The characters aren't even close to believable--they're completely one-dimensional. They don't at all resemble their former selves from the previous two books. They react to their given situations according to a predictable formula, which makes for some really boring reading.As for the plot, I found it overly contrived to make up for the lack of character development. Of course, I don't really know much about the plot since I couldn't even get through the entire book.Conclusion: read Sorrow Floats and Skipped Parts, and forget about this one.

Her tone is impressive and intonation is quite good, but her style is too cheesy, and she sort of makes things drag. I can understand what she's trying to achieve, but Chopin is not meant for violin. If it was, Chopin would have have written for it. Furthermore, Manoukian says something in her notes that a sensible violinist would not understand. \\"So would not a violin pierce more easily through the chords of its collaborator?\\" Now I don't even think she wrote that! It's a bit too complicated for me! I mean if Perlman played these he would transform them. But then, Perlman is not that dumb as to make a Cd with only Chopin on violin.

Basically this book reads as follows, invest in strong companies and/or companies that are deeply discounted, but fundamentally sound ... Don't diversify your portfolio ...

The AC adapter failed after about 2 weeks of use and all contacts with D-Link support have been ignored. I can still use the unit via the USB power supply however it seems to get unreasonably hot which leads me to question how much power it is pulling from the USB adapter.

It's super tiny and works flawlessly.I've used it a a hotel conference where the conference room had 1 lan port and using this router I managed to securely share that connection with over 20 attendees. Performance was more than acceptable and signal strength, despite it's dimunitive size, is impressive.Overall a well balanced product. My only beef is that I wish they had made the power adapter even smaller, and oh yeah, the thing looks ugly. I wish they made it more stylish looking.But those 2 caveats do not affect the performance of the router in any way, they are just my comments.Go ahead and buy it! You'll be satisfied!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I travel all over the world and have been looking for a small wireless router to free me from the hotel room desk. The product is smaller than I expected and works as promised.

Added bonus, the power supply can even plug into 220 volt systems and function perfectly meaning no need for a power converter.Overall a great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still cannot get it to work.","review":"Very nice looking device in a sleek kit.

Once setup, however, the device would refused to stay connected to the wireless signal for more than a few minuets, even though the router is only one room away and other wireless devices have never had any trouble with it.

After spending about 2 hours on my own, I called D-Link support and while they were quite friendly, the call ended 2 hours later with the support person telling me to take the router back to where I bought it.I'm not interested in a product that will give me an open wireless connection, so I didn't even try this without using WPA or WPA2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to find gift","review":"I bought this for a friend.

And as always, they've got DVD chapters set up so it's easy to pop it in the DVD player and go right to where you want to start your practice.Covers a decent number of dance patterns, beginner up through intermediate.

It does contain a lot of info for the beginner, but the tutorials are hard to understand.There are not enough photos of the interface, and 3dMax3 can be very confusing as there are heaps of commands.More photos would help with learning, and also, there were a few mistakes in the tutorials, very bad ones!If I didn't know how to use Adobe After Effects before this, it would have been hair pullingly difficult!! It would have been good if they got some people to check the tutorials before publishing the book!This book is for those with patience and a bit of time on their hands.

It was unfortunately a pretty dry read. There were too many boring pages between actual tutorials, which were pretty good when they finally came along. They were, however, not explained very well in the book. The Lotus ScreenCams that came on the CD showing exactly how the author did something is the only thing that kept me from tossing this book in the trash during a frustrating tutorial.The biggest problem I had with this book is that too much of it read like a help file. The author walked through too many of the menu's and toolbars explaining what their function was. The help files will tell you the same thing.More tutorials \\"showing me how these menu's and toolbars are actually used in a 3DS project\\" would have made this a winner. Oh well.

And the exercises led to different (still nice and effective) results because of vague descriptions. A rather discouraging experience.If your are a visual type by learning THIS is NOT the book for you.

I struggle on BUT... it could be sooo much easier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't do it!","review":"This book spends entirely too much time explaining the \\"fundamentals\\".

She hated it! We didn't even get halfway through it.It is set up in a game show format and the \\"host\\" of the show is really loud and obnoxious and has a kind of scary toothy grin at one point and a big scary square head. Every time he came on the screen as the emcee of this game show that Elmo and Zoe are playing, my daughter started to cry and turned away from the show.The older Elmo DVDs have all been a big hit in our house, but the newer ones like the Sesame Beginnings series, which are REALLY boring, even for smaller babies and this one in particular, are really jumbled.

The beats, the ryhmes and the production are all of the highest quality. It forced me to go back and listen to some of Phanatik's other songs.

No matter what your gender, race, sexual orientation or musical taste(yes, even you hip-hop heads) you will like and revere this album. Like the Top 1000 reviewer guy said, I can't separate her music from her sexuality. I mean, she sings about (...) sex. But not being able to think of Bikini Kill solely in artistic terms is my fauls.This album points me in the right direction. Reminding us that women can be angry, passionate, and make kick-arse punk rock. If you don't like this album, you don't like the progress women made during the 90's.As for the music, it's pure energy. Unbrideled fury, unhindered by concepts such as tone quality and good musicianship. That's not to say that it's not good music. On the contrary, this album is better than any illegal substance and will make you move like you're having a seizure out of pure joy and fury."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"Courney Love and the rest of the \\"Riot Grrls\\" wish they could produce a record like this.

Many couples are going to feel a little uncomfortable with the truths expressed in this libretto, all the more so because the two singers are entirely believable. While Bernstein does not maintain musical interest right through the short duration of the piece, his lyrics more than make up for it. They call, of course, for good singer/actors; and this recording provides them. Perhaps Newport might have fleshed out the timing with a short Bernstein piece; but one will buy this for \\"Trouble,\\" not for any filler.

The chamber chorus comprised of approximately 40 voices sings with the trademark diction, blend, accuracy and warm tone that were the hallmark of Shaw's choruses. This program of twentieth century works is quite moving and serious in tone; highly listenable in that they are all quite tonal, reflecting the unique styles of their various composers. The Copland Motets are perhaps the only works on the disc that suffer by comparison with the remainder of the program.I have the SACD version of this disc which is warm, stunningly clear, reverberant but quite transparent.

The Cosmogony of the Three Worlds puts forward, in my opinion, an excellent theory and provides the traveller to Peru and other global sites, an alternative and plausible theory as to how the vitrified, massive and for the most, inexplicable stonework may have been built. A great DVD that stays true to the theories of Alfredo Gamarra. A must buy, especially if planning a trip to Peru, or any other megalithic site that defies explanation."},{"rating":"1","title":"No stamina","review":"I bought this pump for the pool season - having a young daughter with lots of friends, I found myself spending way too much time blowing up pool toys.

I looked at the return Policy and they don't have one and I need to contact the company. Since shipping cost as much as the item, I'm not sure a return is worth the trouble.

It has tons of pictures and lots of tips. There are lots of things I didn't know about Flash using its built-in help system, but this book told me lots of information.

I rate this book as the best source of Flash information for Mac/Apple Compauter and Windows."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a frustrating book!","review":"This book was our class text for a Flash class. The exercises were pretty easy to follow, but weren't helpful enough if you wanted to create your own site. Many graphics, movie clips, buttons, sound files helpfully added to the library for each exercise, but not a whole lot on creating your own. This seasoned-but-technologically-immature designer needed more meat!Too many erratum. Can you say proofreader?And, when it gets time for you to publish your movie, the book just pretty much falls apart and loses steam. Not nearly enough Actionscripting help for this newbie--help which would decrease the file size of my movie! And HOW do I plug it into my webpage???

As with the other H.O.T. books, it is a great tool for learning, in a step by step fashion, how to use Flash MX. The book is well written and explains the ins and outs of Flash MX. I thoroughly enjoyed reading the book and doing the tutorials. Some of my first animations were based on the tutorials.

It's clear that this is just the right pace for some people, but if you are interested in things like actionscript programming, the book is probably not going to satisfy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great intro to Flash","review":"If you are new to Flash this book is an excellent choice. As the title should suggest this is not a definitive guide, but rather it is a series of lessons geared towards getting you going with Flash. I went through the lessons in this book and was able to quickly grasp the general concepts and abilities of the program. When I was done I had more than enough knowledge to start planning my first flash documents. As other readers have mentioned this book alone does not cover every Flash feature in depth so you will probably want a book like \\"Flash MX Bible\\" by Richard Reinhardt as a reference as well (a great reference book, but not great for learning from). Flash MX HOT is put together in sensible manor, has well-organized lessons, and covers the important bases for those new to the program."},{"rating":"1","title":"DECENT PRIMER, BUT..","review":"..this is targeted at stark newbies into the world of Flash, or 'designers' getting their feet wet with animation, and for that purpose, this is a pretty good introduction.However, if you are familiar with coding in general and sport a somewhat DIY attitude then you may find this brimming with too much hand-holding for newbies. As someone really serious about his timelines, or as someone already quite comfortable with basic programming concepts, Moock's Definitive Actionscript (O'Reilly) is still the stuff to beat -- and that has some very useful observations for newbies as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get this book!!!","review":"I tried to learn flash first by reading the 'straight from the source' book. This didn't work very well. That book seemed to have been written for people who alredy know a lot about actionscript and html offering no apologies for the confusion to 'newbies'. So I picked up the H.O.T book and have learned twice as much in half the amount of time..

I have tried refills before but with awful results. Now I will only purchase original manufacturer, new cartridges. The only 'catch' is that on all the Brother printers I have owned, which is several, they all prematurely signal 'low toner' at somewhere around the halfway point. So, when the printer finally stops printing, I remove the cartridge and rock it back and forth a few times, re-insert it into the printer and it works great for a few more thousand sheets. I use this initial 'low toner' signal as the point to re-order another cartridge and, unless you print over a ream of paper per day, this should be plenty of lead-time.

The cartridge has a window that is closed (blocked) by toner. This window runs through the cartridge from one side to the other. When the toner is full, the window is blocked, when the toner is seemingly empty, a laser is able to shine through the cartridge one side to the other thus signaling to the printer to shut down for cartridge replacement. I have found that when you obstruct this window with a simple piece of masking tape, you will have at least 33-50% more toner left. I'll leave any manufacturer motive speculation up to you.\\"I put two tiny pieces of masking tape over the windows on each end and the printer started printing again.

This book protrays the modern Arab, and how they are caught between two worlds, the east and the west, and for the first time the book does not declare the West to be the better option.

The sad part about Sleater-Kinney is its considered cool to like them and you'll make alot of college indie friends if you buy this one. If these girls were guys everyone would dismiss them. I'm not going to give them credit for sounding loud and being girls, You still should sound listenable. If you want screaming and all that may I sugguest Pavement's \\"Slanted & Enchanted\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"You ought to check this band out!","review":"I wasn't sure if I'd like this CD, but I thought I'd give those pompous wind-bags at SPIN magazine one more shot at recommending a band, and so I dropped the big Ten-spot. I gotta admit, this CD is a blast to listen to. Catchy songwriting, that could almost be classified as pop, but hidden behind a veil of punk - you know, kinda rough production, grungy guitars, etc. And her voice - that vibrato gives her singing just enough edge to make you stand up and notice, without going totally Yoko Ono and damaging my spinal cord. It all makes for an energetic joy-ride that's well worth the price of admission. I'll be looking for them March 26 at the Magic Stick. Who want's to come along?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fabulous album! The band has really grown up.","review":"On the basis of the band's second album, \\"Call the Doctor\\", and a show at which they put on a truly awesome performance, I purchased \\"Dig Me Out\\", and I have not been disappointed. \\"Dig Me Out\\" is even better than its predecessor, and it is evident that Sleater-Kinney has utterly mastered the art of punk-pop. The first nine tracks of the album are all fantastic, and the others are good, too (\\"Turn It On\\" and the title track are especially compelling). Fans of the band's early work shouldn't be disappointed by this one, for although they have certainly graduated to the next level of quality of performance, the basic sound is the same, the songs are still short and sweet, and they still rock. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"just adding to what's already said","review":"A fantastic album from Sleater-Kinney, there's really nothing I can say that hasn't already been covered in the 60 some reviews of this album.

Boo to all those who gave them less than 5 stars. This is an album our kids will think we're cool for liking. Sleater-Kinney is undisputably one of the best bands out there. Indie or mainstream, male or female. This is their breakthrough album and for good reason. The title track explodes. Every song the album rocks. Sure this album may not be as polished as the others, but their raw ferocity is unmatched and they still manage to eloquently communicate their cultural message. That's why they kick arse.As people, all three of them are cool beyond description, especially Carrie Brownstein.

They are some of the most talented guys I've ever heard. The lead vocals, Grim, are throat piercing, soul collapsing, and very beautiful all at the same time. You can tell behind this deep sounding, thrashing guitars and talented drums this is not your ordinary death metal band. Embodiment is very different than other bands. The screaming guitars and pounding beats are very fulfulling. Normally, people would say these guys are just another metal band. They are not they are soulful, raging emotions trying to be let out. They are trapped and come out in the most spiritual ways. They are embodied. If you love metal that is different, then you should try this artist. You will not be disappointed.

I was hoping to find something helpful and encouraging in this book by Fr. Westerhoff.Unfortunately, the author of this book does not even believe in the accurate historical truth of the Bible! He claims that much of the stories in Scripture are merely \\"myth\\", rather than historical fact.But if the stories in Scripture are just fairytales, then Christianity is a faith built upon lies.The original authors of the Book of Common Prayer would be very ashamed of Westerhoff's book. Westerhoff correctly states that the community of Christians is bound together by their common histories. But sadly, he thinks many of the \\"histories\\" in Scripture are not historical at all.This is not a book for Christians. People who go to church, but reject the accuracy of the Bible, would probably enjoy this book.

Then the controls and camera function began to not work properly because it would become so overheated. The second phone had electrical problems. It would vibrate at random times for no reason, and the camera image became completely distorted so I could no longer take pictures. The battery does not last very long- my current phones battery only lasts a day maximum.

The capability of the phone to hold a charge was the largest issue. I still own this product, but have to have the phone plugged into the charger in order for the phone to keep a charge. If the phone is not plugged into the charger, it dies within two minutes and then more problems arise. When you try to turn the phone back on, after the power dies or after you just turn it off, it will freeze on the opening screen and I have to play around with unplugging and plugging it back in, turning it on and off, before this problem is fixed. I know it is not the battery itself, because after the phone dies if you take the battery out and then put it back in it has a full charge. All in all, I am very dissatisfied with the product for these reasons and I wouldn't buy this model again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Phone","review":"I have a family plan and out of the four v325i's we got, three have failed completely.

I haven't found this to be true, but then I don't need all the bells and whistles.I've used text messaging only about ten times because I just don't get the need for texting things when you can just call someone and leave a voice message.But I am quite unhappy over this battery situation.

E.g., for text messaging, it's automatically on Abc instead of iTap English. It's a pain to change it every time.3. The battery life has significantly declined in the 6 months I've owned it.

After pressing the menu button and waiting, hit the end button and WAIT for it to return to the main screen. It is painfully slow. So if you like to text message be prepared to do it really slow.

I don't know whether he was asked and didn't want to participate or if they just made this without even asking him. Either way it makes calling this the 'Story of Naked Raygun' ridiculous.

I read the book then, and again recently. It's available in local libraries by request. The writing is not the best, amateurish actually. The book allegedly recounts the story of a family who owned the Mansion in the 1970's, and their experiences related to the property. I won't go so far as to say the book is a work of fiction, but the circumstances surrounding the book have been questioned in other forums. Yes, there was a Summerwind Mansion in the woods of Northern Wisconsin. Yes, odd things happened to the people who owned the property over the years. Yes, fire destroyed the building in 1986.

I am not a big reader, but I will tell you that as I read the book I took little pieces of paper and marked each and every page of events the author described in the book that actually happened to myself and my buddies.

What this means is that he tries to paint a folksy picture of the people and issues surrounding the major court decisions of the past two centuries--he basically summarizes the major decisions, briefly explains why they're important, and then tells you his opinion and why it is correct. The book gives the reader nothing that your standard constitutional law reader does not--in fact, it gives less historical substance, compared with Kutler's book--but the appeal of this book is that it reads more like a novel and less like a history. Apparently some people like others to do their thinking for them. I do not, so I only found this book to be of minimal use.

The importance of the political climates in which important decisions were handed down is well covered and informs the reader of how external influences impacted certain decisions. The evolution of application of important principles such as incorporation of the Bill of Rights through the due process clause of the 14th amendment is well presented.Mr. Irons also effectively presents personal attributes and facts not only of the justices who decided these important cases, but of the attorneys and clients who brought the cases before the Court.

But for game designers to do the same thing will result in more clones of the same games.I dont think any comparison should be drawn between Gang Of Four design patterns and what is attempted here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it..","review":"This book is so bad, that it would been a crime to not warn the buyers to not waste their money like I did.It is nothing more than an English dictionary of terms used in games... like what means \\"Avatar\\".. or what means \\"High Score List\\".."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poetry in literal liquid motion","review":"Some might question whether this qualifies as music -- after all, isn't it just recording the sounds of a river? Rest assured, it's far, far more than bland \\"relaxing sounds of nature\\" as aural wallpaper! Like any traditionally composed piece of music, there's a distinct emotional tone, a narrative arc, that's the result of careful & precise choices by the composer. Rather than lulling & tranquilizing the listener, it constantly evokes images & memories, and the rich palette of emotions associated with them. And those will be uniquely different for every listener. Yes, you could put this on as mere background ... but then you'd be missing so much. It's a work that rewards repeated & attentive listening, and is most highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL 2","review":"EXCELLENT MOVIE!!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!

The songs are great, catchy, and have a good message. The story line in HSM2 is very lacking and is pretty much a remake of the late years of \\"Saved by the Bell.\\" The songs are not catchy and are not memorable. The story line writers and song writers must be different than HSM1. And as others mention, it is all about the relationship between Troy and Gabriella. And Sharpay is too over the top mean spirited. This movie lost all the innocence of the first.

The holes in his argument are large and numerous, but he just talks louder and demeans his opponent. For over a year of the war, Lincoln emphasized that the objective was not to destroy slavery. He wanted to limit it, but the war was to prevent Southern Independence. When he declared that slavery was ended in the Confederacy, he said that was because he couldn't win the war otherwise. The respected historian Gary Gallagher has said that the Union soldiers wouldn't have fought to end slavery. By the time of the Emancipation Proclamation, many Union soldiers had realized that a black soldier could absorb a bullet just as well as a white. Steven Wilkins does a great job of telling the real story for the South and making a monkey out of Marshall, who should be ashamed of his rudeness and lack of logic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Quality","review":"This product arrived in great condition.

So I expect this one to last only 3-4 years. The metal frame was really disappointing. The steel tubes are only 1-1/8\\" diameter while my old Kmart frame was 2\\" diameter.

Actually quite useful when taken as an antidote for Foucault's overwrought \\"Discipline and Punish.\\" Postmodernists who want to casuistically revel in the delights of capital punishment can go back to their Heavy Metal magazine and their coffee table Witkin.Not exactly art in any sense, this is nevertheless one case where diatribe serves as a welcome comic relief against what is a grotesque side of civilization.

I was able to convert my trial account to a 1-year account... I like the price compared to Apple's own website and store price as well.

The integration with OSX is really nice, though, and I will probably renew again as long as I can get it for a discounted price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Worth It so Far","review":".Mac is worth the money so far. Though you could get some of the facilities for free elsewhere, it is so well integrated into the apps., it is worth it e.g. the Web Gallery is A1. Buy it here at Amazon - cheaper than on Apple.

Should be done electronically."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little expensive","review":"The .Mac product works wonderfully, especially in syncing multiple Macs together. It is a great way to share photos with and you can build a quick website that looks very professional. However, Apple has charged way too much for it!. If you can't use the sync feature (needs multiple Macs) I would suggest that you get another provider for less money and more storage. By the way 10GB in today's world is woefully inadequate. I would hope that Apple sees the way to add more storage and give .Mac some added value."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not sure why I keep doing this...","review":"I don't really think .Mac is worth as much as it costs, but I've had this email address since it was free and I don't want to change it.

Reading the other reviews, it seems that perhaps this has to do with the difference between MSA and how real people speak - which while understandable, does make learning rather impossible for a beginner!The speakers were also way too fast - the first reviewer says there were two settings on the CD - where?!!Lastly, I think the text jumps around too much - it's as though the author is not clear whether the book is for tourists or for beginning serious students."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as simple alone would hope...","review":"The content is difficult and doesn't appear to flow smoothly.

Perhaps it is one that cannot be summed up in this format. Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misrepresentation","review":"Sorry, but anyone who claims that standard Arabic '''''' is actually used in conversation by friends and families in relaxed settings is misrepresenting the language completely (which is a nice way of saying he's a complete liar).You can't start to learn a language based on lies.

I too took a good look at the book at the book store and was unhappy that the book uses a transliteration system without at least showing the spelling in Arabic. I could have made allowances if it weren't for the fact that the transliterations used do not correctly approximate the correct pronunciation such as 'kah-leb' for dog when it should be, as Al-Shayib said, kalb or kelb. Needless to say, I put the book back on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's truly for complete dummies","review":"The book is friendly, but it has no arabic script at all! I was very surprised at how a language can be taught without first studying the alphabet and then some words, and the trying to write it all down... but this book just doesn't cover the script (which is so beautiful %)). It just tells you how to pronounce words and what they mean, but you will never learn how to read and write in Arabic with this book.

I especially loved reading about the imperfections of Mack. But this book ended a bit differently then most love inspired books. It ended with us hanging.I understand the reason for this, but I think the author should have written an epilogue. It wouldn't have necessarily taken anything from the third book in my opinion.

Most of it is just him laughing and going \\"I think it's cool if you throw that third in there\\" and then he plays it for a second and moves on to something else without even explaining. There are much better videos on youtube, explaining blues techniques. The other 20 or so min. of the video is just about him talking...and talking...and talking about the people he's played with. It shouldn't be called a lesson video, it should just be considered a \\"Chuck Leavell Documentary\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Amazing Spider-Man Vol. 2: Revelations (2002)","review":"This volume begins with a 9/11 tribute that, while touching, seemed really out-of-place. If the sad truth is that comic book heroes aren't real and therefore can't actually save the world, then they don't belong in such serious situations in the first place. I do respect Straczynski taking a creative risk, but this was going a bit too far. Just one panel with Captain America silently standing helpless would've communicated the same message far more powerfully.Other than that, this volume manages to be as compelling as the last. Aunt May, after collecting her thoughts, confronts her nephew about his true identity. When Peter admits that he could've saved Uncle Ben if not for his selfishness, he finally receives the forgiveness he's always wanted but has never been able to ask for. Sentimental stuff, and an interesting new direction for the Spidey mythos."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this shoe!","review":"I have a pair of Keds Women's Andie Leather Sneakers and love them.

When you read this book it can be shocking and unbelievable that such crimes do actually happen.

In the middle of working on something, the computer would go crazy like I was holding down the enter key. Even restarting the computer wouldn't fix it. I finally figured it out by systematically removing everything and restarting the computer, then plugging things in one at a time. Sure enough, with this hub in, the computer would go crazy.

I purchased this toy for his first birthday. His aunt showed him how to use it and he was off! Pushing it around the room. When he ran into things he got down on his knees and pulled the toy back and then he could go again. He never pushed it away from him and face planted. It wasn't two weeks later that he was walking on his own. He doesn't use the shapes now- but he will later. Good toy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice sound and precision, but where's the fire?","review":"As always, Perlman handles the technical challenges beautifully, but there is a lack of fire and brilliance that one would expect from a rendition of a work by Brahms. My major complaint with the performance is that the first and third movements are WAY too slow. I almost fell asleep listening to the first. I would suggest Heifetz's performance of Brahms with the Chicago Symphony, conducted by Fritz Reiner. (It is ironic that two performances of Brahms with the Chicago symphony can be such polar opposites.) Heifetz is probably one of the only violinists of the 20th century who could have taken Brahms as fast as he did, but the concerto (esp. the 1st movement) sounds better played faster. In this way, the performance is infused with more fire. After listening to the Heifetz/Reiner recording, I guarantee that you will not be able to listen to most Brahms renditions again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this CD!","review":"The sound is extremely poor. Perlman himself would hate this production for its lack of sound engineering and its lousy quality control. EMI Disgraced this particular performance. If you want to hear Brahm's Violin Concerto try Anne-Marie Mutter with DG, Yehudi Menuhim with Seraphim, or look for Isaac Stern's. If you love Perlman's performances, then go for it with Barenboim (under our infamous label EMI, but with good sound). And do yourself a favor: DON'T BUY THIS CD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak and disappointing","review":"Perlman is a very fine violinist, but this recording is not one of his best. His virtuosity is clear and pleasant and he has the advantage of being accompanied by the Chicago Symphony. The biggest problem with this recording is that Perlman and Giulini choose a tempo that is far too slow. This is a huge factor which is why this performance is weak and disappointing. Both of these two have done better. Stay away from this however."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well...","review":"I don't know why but I thought this thing would be very nice but it is a mere \\"okay\\". Glass container part has little chips upon where it is cut. Glass part doesn't align perfectly with the bee body so it is loose...I guess you don't fill it up beyond a 1/4 full? I will say at a glance it does look good but lacking finish and functionality."},{"rating":"1","title":"A so-so presentation, but better than others...","review":"I tried to find a good CD of National Anthems, this one sounds the best, but still quite dissappointing. The French and USSR/Russia ones are OK but certainly not the best, the rest are really so-so. I am not talking about the songs, they are all great! But the presentation was weak. I guess you have to find the band from their native country to present their own National Anthems, can't count on foreigners :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"Pretty good mouse, it points, it scrolls, what more do you want a mouse to do?

It's very accurate, glides wonderfully, works on any surface, and has a cord long enough for just about everyone. It is a little on the light side, but for me that's just fine; it means I spend less effort getting it to go where I want it to. And while the buttons, specifically the wheel-click button, may feel like they're going to break sometimes, trust me, it takes a lot of effort to damage this thing. Of course, if you do somehow manage to break it, you can buy a second one and still be paying less than you would for many other optical mice. Besides, the red LED glow on the back end looks pretty nifty, too =)"},{"rating":"1","title":"uncomfortable.","review":"This mouse works well and is affordable. However, I would not recommend this mouse if you spend an extensive amount of time surfing the internet, gaming, or working in various mouse-intensive applications. I got this mouse a couple months ago at my workplace and it's simply uncomfortable after extended use. I find logitech's designs or microsoft's right-handed designs to be far more ergonomic. In fact, I have switched back to a track ball logitech as my primary mouse at work due to the repetative stress that had been effecting my hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I just received the mouse and I love it! True that it could be a little heavier, but it's great to use. I don't know how I ever did without it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"poor design","review":"This mouse is not very good. I was looking for an optical mouse without a whole bunch of buttons, like this one. I got it and was happy with how precise and smooth it is. But it's extremely cheap feeling. It's super light. The buttons feel like they will break after a bit of use, the wheel is so loose it sometimes moves on its own. Microsoft tried to save some money by making this mouse for both righties and lefties. The comfort level is nowhere near that of the old Intellimouse. In my opinion, the Intellimouse is a better mouse, although it requires cleaning the ball out once in a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was good until......","review":"It was a excelent mouse (high precision, usefull, confortable) but it only last 1 year... and i treated very well i do not punch it or anythin like that.... one day while I was on the internet the mouse just turn off and never turn on again in any o my 3 computer... i im very engry about that..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything You Need In a Mouse","review":"Microsoft comes up big with their optical wheel mouse. It is a simple and easy to use mouse that doesn't have any of the extra bull that a lot of mice are coming with these days. The optical sensor works flawlessly and really changes the way you look at mice. The design is nice looking and comfortable to use for right or left handed users. Overall, a great mouse at a great price. No skipping or getting stuck with those crappy balls...it's all about precision with the optical mouse. Upgrade today!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Total waste of money","review":"Don't buy this headset amp. It's my fault, should have read more user reviews - it has one feature that makes the unit useless: has an automatic on / off feature to conserve batteries. However, the unit turns off when it doesn't hear you talk after about 30 seconds. If you are on conference calls for work (which I bought it for) and just listening, it turns off and you can't hear anything on the call. No wat to defeat this option that I am aware of. Awful product design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very low and cheap quality","review":"I purchased this item and when I was placing its batteries according to its instructions I noticed one of the clips/tiny metal battery holder was broken. This little metal holder should have some flexibility to be adapted to the size of the battery but its quality was not good and it broke. Unfortunately this tiny metal battery holder can not be fixed or replaced once it is broken from its base/contact. I did not get to the point to use it and accordingly I am not able to make a comment about its working quality. As far as I am concern it is not a reliable piece of equipment."},{"rating":"1","title":"sad","review":"I'm a truck driver and i get a lot of noise when i bought this at a truck stop it worked great until a month later when i needed batteries it takes 3 button batteries at quit the expense, the sad part is this is the only amp on the market i just want a rechargeable battery or AAA would be nice, the running cost is just too much I'm sorry to say i had to throw it away."},{"rating":"2","title":"it works","review":"I spend a lot of time in phone conferences. Many of the people won't talk into the microphones. My headset wasn't loud enough. I have this taped to my handset now and the sound is great.The amp plugs into the handset. The headset plugs into the amp. You have to figure out what to do with the amp. It has a little belt clip, but for me it makes more sense to just tape it to the handset. Life would be better if the phone had more volume control, but it doesn't. Given that I need an amp, this is a good one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silence-Deactivated, not Voice-Activated...","review":"The high points:* Small* Has a clip on it (I clip it onto the handset)* Battery life seems great (haven't changed it yet)The low, low, low point:* Cuts out when there is a lull in the converation, during hold music, etc. This problem is a real drag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works but with serious flaws","review":"This handset amplifier works fairly well, but has two serious flaws that can sometimes make it difficult to use. In order to extend battery life, the amplifier turns off after 10 seconds without a strong incoming signal to amplify. As others have commented, this is a nuisance when you are on hold (music on hold usually isn't enough sound to keep the amplifier on) or there are frequent pauses on the far side of the converation.The other flaw is that the specified batteries seem to have a limited life even if the amplifier isn't used often. The manufacturer specifies three AC675 zinc-air (air-activated) hearing-aid batteries. Perhaps these cells work best in a hearing aid, where they are used every day for hours at a time. I've found I have to replace the batteries in this amplifier about every six weeks."},{"rating":"1","title":"not reliable at all","review":"I tried it out and it just wouldn't do- the voice activation is the problem. I wish they made it without that feature. It kept turning itself off while my daughter was talking to me. Waste of time. Thanks Amazon for being so great with the return policy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Plantronics Mobile Headset MHA-100","review":"I am currently using the third MHA100 from Plantronics. The first one I ordered from Amazon had an annoying problem of turning off in the middle of a sentence. Returned to Amazon for a replacement which had the identical problem. I called Plantronics & spoke to a technical support specialist, who in turn sent a replacement. This one is by far the best of the three, but it still becomes sporadic during an extended telephone call. I do not recommend this product to anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"When it works - it works great!!!","review":"The MHA100 is small, compact and easy to use. It works great when the batteries are alive. Since they use THREE Zinc L675ZA hearing aid battereis, they have a limited life (one or two weeks max) once activated by the air. And these puppies are not cheap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Batteries expire almost immediately","review":"Because the product is touted as being \\"voice activated\\", I assumed that meant it would drain the batteries only when actually being used. But after my first conversation using the device, I disconnected it from the phone and from the headset, and put it away. Got it out again for another conversation a few days later, only to find out that the batteries were dead.For a while I tried the approach of putting the batteries in immediately before using it, then removing the batteries after the call, putting them in again for the next call, etc. But that was just too much of a hassle.After a bit of experience with that, I stopped using the device."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good in-line amp for cordless phone","review":"This product works well.

I am hearing impaired and this unit works magic. It's lightweight and very convenient to use. I have not noticed a problem with the power down feature. In practical use, it has been fine...but maybe I talk a lot to magpies.The clarity and volume are just essential to me. I'm used to hearing aid batteries and the potential failure of these is not a problem for me. Best thing I ever bought to aid in a phone conversation."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT REALLY WORTH IT","review":"It works, but its draw back is that it turns it self off if the person on the other line pauses for more than 5 seconds.

It plugs into the handset, then you plug your wired headset into this device. Voila, much louder volume than the handset can provide. I have a cheap headset so it might work even better with a higher quality one. I agree with other users that the lack of a manual on/off switch is puzzling and very slightly annoying at times but it has not caused me to regret the purchase and I'm not aware of any other device out there that does what this one does for a cordless phone. It's also puzzling that it uses three large hearing aid batteries instead of one AAA battery, which would take up about the same space and be more convenient to replace. However that is a minor quibble and the batteries are readily available at drug stores or online.

Nope, this thing is too \\"smart\\" for that. It will detect noise and amplify it otherwise it will turn itself off.

In order to save battery power the unit is sound activated. When there is a short pause in a conversation, the unit quits working and doesn't start again until the person you are talking to is several seconds into his next sentence.

If the product had a power switch I would rate it 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Would be 5 stars except.....","review":"Like others have said, it doesn't have a manual on/off. Occasionally, when in a call if it gets really quiet, the amplifier will turn off so I have a tendancey to blow lightly in the mic while waiting... just because it's unnerving to hear the line sound like it went dead. Other than that, it really works well. It has more than enough volume for me, and it gives my headset cord that little extra lenght I need."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not meet my needs","review":"My major complaint with this product is the voice activated feature. The amplifier turns itself off when no one is talking. It's a good concept in order to save battery life but I found that many times it would turn itself off in the middle of a conversation if the person on line was not loud enough. I found the unit would even turn itself off during the muzak while on hold. When it does turn back on it will lose the first word of the speaker.

This music is truly timeless, and Allison's astounding vocals make them even more so.
