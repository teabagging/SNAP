These films should have been made available in their respective WIDESCREEN aspect ratios (2.35 for Gidget and 1.85. for the other two). The films themselves are a lot of fun, especially the first Gidget with the great Sandra Dee, but the joy is quickly snuffed out by the fact that almost half of the picture is missing. How about a PROPER release showing these films a little respect?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cancelled","review":"I had ordered this item this morning but immediately cancelled when I discovered they had been released in a standard format. Columbia Tristar is making a big mistake in not offering at least the option of the films' original aspect ratios-these were extremely popular films when they were released and remain interesting for all kinds of reasons, pleasure and delight not the least of them.

Two daysbefore it went off warrenty it would no longer print. My yellow resetbutton flashed, and no tech support was provided with this 612c model. However if we wanted to pay 2.50 a minute they could help us. I looked up the printer on Amazon customer reports and found someone else with the same problem, a faulty ink cartridge that came with the printer. I went and bought a new one for 30.00, popped it in and bingo the printer worked again. If this happens often I'm getting rid of it. Don't get me wrong It prints great, only if you can afford it, and I rarely use mine. That's why we bought A less expensive one.

It conflicted with my other installed printer drivers so I had to remove them. I also found the direct cable connection software which is part of Windows 98 would not work while the software was installed.

Number 1 is that my 612C work out and would not printer anymore after about only 6 months of use. I was well under the monthly duty for what this printer is expected to printer. The second is that the documentation that came with this product led me to believe that my printer was under warranty for an enitre year, but when I called HP to have it fixed I was told my warranty was expired, and that additional documentation was released showing only a 90 day warranty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Consumer friendly","review":"This printer was extremely easy to set up. In fact I needed to download the drivers from the internet because the computer it is working with has no cd rom drive, and was a bit skeptical about the outcome. The whole process, from getting the drivers from the HP internet site, to installing them, and setting up the printer was really smooth. Hell, my husband could have done it! (just kidding, dear) Color is fine also-it all depends on what your requirements are. For us it is all we need, and it beats the Canon products hands down. I am giving it four stars because I have not seen yet how long the cartridges last. Also buy the extra year warranty for 10.00 dollars.

This grommet does not have a positive lock on the shaft and allows the fan to move back and forth. Unfortunately, it can move far enough that the fan rubs the housing and makes a high pitch whining sound. I choosen to modify mine and lock the grommet to the shaft so it won't float, but most people will not want to mess with this.Do not buy this fan. Even if it fits.

So many lovers so little time I thought while reading this first john, then Ricari, then Daniel, then Lovely ..., girl!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenomenal Read!","review":"A triumphant first novel! Ms. Jefferson's writing style is pulpy and poignant, with a gruesome sense of humor woven throughout her dark tale.

Hopefully, in future writings her books will be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get It Secondhand","review":"I ended up buying this book at a used bookstore for $$$... dollars. That's all I would recommend paying for this. This is just another first-person tale that falls short of the two genres that it aims for. First, it aims for the \\"ancient vampire's lament\\" style with the character of Ricari, who isn't developed nearly enough. Secondly, it falls short of the Poppy Z. Brite \\"vampires-as-trendy-young-cyberpunk-hipsters\\" style with the characters Daniel and Lovely. It has a distinctly \\"Mary Sue\\"-ish quality to it. For a book that combines both genres and yet hits the mark, I'd reccommend \\"The Time of Feasting\\" by Mick Farren. And of course, if you like vampire fiction, you can't go wrong with \\"Lost Souls\\" by Poppy Z. Brite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This was such a wonderful novel. The fastest I've ever read a book. This book was so well written that I could not stop reading it. It follows a young woman who is searching for companionship when her lover moves away. What she finds is something she hardly bargined for. She meets a man named Ricari who is very handsome and who also is seeking a companion. For fans of Buffy the Vampire Slayer the feelings Ariane has towards Ricari really reminds you of the feelings Buffy shared for Angel. Very excellent but seemed far fetched at times overall I highly recommend this to anyone who is a fan of vampire novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow, uninteresting","review":"I thought the characterizations were for the most part unfocussed and uninteresting. I had read the reviews and expected a seriously graphic and horrifying read that would satisfy an afficiando of the genre and found that I was dissatisfied in all respects. While yes, there was sex aplenty there really was not much else. The horrifying stuff was usually shown in a few lines of dialog tossed off by the characters. I reccomend if you want serious vamp fiction you try Lumley, Taylor, and Hamilton."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vampire Tale Lacking Plot and Characterisation","review":"'Voice of the Blood' is initially interesting for the scenarios it creates and the use of a female main character as a vampire. I bought this book thinking it would be a real page-turner on a cold, wet winter's day. It was a page-turner but mainly in the sense that I kept reading it hoping for the plot to develop more and characterisations to extend beyond two-dimensional profiles. I was disappointed in that the characters could have been developed further and their individual histories given more substance. I found myself not really liking the main character. If you are into horror that is more sex and romance, then perhaps this book is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"VOICEOF THE BLOOD","review":"I LIKED THE STORY AND CONNECTED WITH THE CHARACTERS.

I did not find the characters at all interesting. I thought they were whiney, immature, and one dimensional. I have read a lot of the best in this genre, Laurell K.

However I'm really disappointed in this cheap feature. The scenes are short and tame like all playboy products and would only satisfy a high school kid,if that. There is one instance where Carmella is in a black and white old film and just is way to artsy fartsy. Furthermore playboy could lose the guys,there is more focus on a peeping tom in one scene then Carmella. In another scene the camera gets most of the attention while Carmella is in the background by a pool.

A group of likeable college students help two crusty old miners open up an abandoned mine. Too bad they don't know it was abandoned for good reason, the mines are infested with tentacled turtle like monsters that quickly escape and wreak havoc. I appreciate movies that at least try to build characters that can be cared about, as well as rely on our fear of them coming to harm to build real suspense as opposed to simply tossing buckets of grue around for a cheap thrill. The cast is quite good (young talent, Rebecca Balding where are you?! I was in LOVE, mixed with the usual sprinkling of seasoned character actors), as is the monster design. The Boogens is by no means a classic, but it remains an endearing enough success to be worth an occasional revisit by the monster movie enthusiast.

It's not a bad film, per se, but it's most remarkable feature is its total mediocrity.If you want a good monster movie of this vein, I recommend the classic \\"Island of Terror.\\" If you want something a little more contemporary, go with \\"Tremors.\\" The former is closer in tone and nature to \\"The Boogens\\" than the latter, but both will sate your need for creepy critters and thrills more effectively than \\"The Boogens.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Our VHS version wore out a long time ago...finally a DVD!!","review":"Well, I wasn't exactly a kid when this gem of a film came out, and it didn't give me nightmares or make me afraid to go in the basement, but it was one of the most enjoyable movie dates ever with my future husband in December 1981. We liked it so much that we bought the VHS version as soon as we found that it was available in the 1990's, and made an anniversary tradition of sending the kids to grandma's, lighting a fire in the fireplace, turning out the lights and popping some Boogens into the VCR (we even brought it along to a hotel once). The tape lasted about a decade before becoming unwatchable a few years ago, so it will be terrific to be able to revive the tradition for our upcoming 30th anniversary.

A cross between an octopus, a lamprey, a turtle, and a Chupacabra, the monster is a silly little puppet that doesn't scare unless hidden in the shadows. Which is where the first 90% of the movie keeps it. So towards the end the creeps turn to laughs. A good cast, with so/so death and gore scenes (the dog bites it the best) that will put a smile on any Horror fan's face.

Not only does it give Gossage the attention he deserves, it gives us a capsule social history of a very interesting time. And it's full of little nuggets like this: In addition to introducing Marshall McLuhan to the world, Gossage bought him a decent pair of black socks so that Professor M could show up to a speaking engagement without looking like a rube.

Thinking of all the art possibilities for the Psalms, I was very disappointed with the Saint John's Bible:Psalms. I think the author missed a golden opportunity to make the Psalms shine. In a Christian thrift store I came across a small book called The Book of Psalms in the Authorized Version. There are lovely illustrations on practically every page. I believe it is being offered as a used book through Amazon at a very reasonable price. I won't buy another Saint John's Bible book without seeing it first.

The display read: \\"Superimposed on this image are digital voiceprints (electronic images of sound) of the monks at Saint John's Abbey singing Gregorian chant; a Native American sacred song; a Jewish men's chorus singing psalms; Buddhist tantric harmonics; an Islamic call to prayer (adhan); Taoist temple music; Hindu bhajan; and Indian Sufi chant.\\" I could not believe it when I saw it. This is a direct example of pluralism, a school of thought which teaches that there are many ways to God. To superimpose voiceprints of worship into the sacred biblical text exclusive to a religion other than Christianity is absolutely heretical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Calligraphy sorely misunderstood","review":"Donald Jackson and his colleagues let their calligraphic skills shine in this volume of The Saint John's Bible. Unfortunately, many readers purchased this book hoping for the same level of illustration found in the Gospels and Acts voulme. What the detractors of Psalms utterly fail to understand is Jackson's intent to let the text of the psalms speak free from the artist's interpretation. The Psalms are perhaps the most personal texts in all of the Bible; it would have been truly unfortunate if the artist had imposed his vision on the psalms, rather than respecting their integrity as texts of personal and liturgical prayer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Praying the Psalms Aloud","review":"For a great read aloud, praying the Psalms Bible, the St. John's Illuminated Psalter is a beauty. Visually a masterpiece, with calligraphy text and unparalleled illustrations to assist listeners, this new illuminated Bible is a great addition to the home for anyone interested in bringing back to ancient tradition of reading the Bible aloud with others. Though pricey for each section of the Bible, what a gift to give to another who is thirsting for a drink from the deep well of Scripture.

No, it isn't. And I tried to like it. The acting is bad, and not just in places. The story loses focus, and, as a viewer, I got lost out of boredom. The effects are... non-existent.

I chose this novel because it is about an industry that I know much about, and the factual matters were quite accurate. However, I found the brotherhood banter to be almost unreadable and incredibly un-entertaining. The author clearly enjoys writing the flying sections, as they are over-wrought with detail not found on any other topic in the book.

I read it in Hebrew, and I have to admit that Oz must be one of the greatest Israeli authors. The word play (I don't know how well it came out in the English translation), childish and powerfully metaphoric all at once, of a boy growing up in a developing Jerusalem, with his internal struggles reflected in the entire Jewish history, forms one of the most poignant books I have ever read.On a personal note, I grew up in a Jerusalem of the 1980s, a city full of life, completely developed, with cultural centers, theaters, malls, parks, opera houses, etc. Reading this book has made me truly conscious of and made me truly appreciate the immense amount of change and progress Jerusalem has gone through in the past few decades.Also recommended - A Tale of Love and Darkness, although I don't know how it came out in the English translation."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"This book is excellent.

The Manufacturer should build it as two seperate units. A small remote volume controller up-front, and a Line level controler connected near speakers in the trunk. Then provide a 20ft or longer cable that connects the two.

However, the fact they weren't was a prime factor in Jack Bruce leaving for more commercial avenues with Manfred Mann, and then, when the opportunity presented itself, joing with Eric Clapton, and prying Ginger Baker away from this group, in order to form Cream.Had these albums made it to the states, that formation would have been doubtful. The sound of the Graham Bond ORGANisation was quite unlike anything the British Invasion sent over here. Deep, dark R&B;/jazz/blues based rock in roll, with Bond's onderful organ work, and dark menacing vocals, Dick Heckstall-Smith's unbelievable sax work, and Bruce and Baker weaving their magic that we would later hear in Cream. These two albums are wonderful gems, and should not be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine British R&B","review":"This is great stuff, rather jazzier than most British R&B of the time, and with an unusual sound since there is no guitarist on hand. Bond and Dick Heckstall-Smith make one hell of a front line, and of course the rhythm section of Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker can't be faulted (Baker, in fact, plays with much more restraint than he did later with Cream). In a way it's surprising that Bond doesn't make more use of Jack's fine singing voice, but Bond is a good singer in a rather style openly imitative of Ray Charles (who is pretty obviously the main influence on this music). Graham Bond was a fine talent who unfortunately never found much commercial success and died too young.

Their rock n roll /latin roots in a blues blend brings out a vunerability that takes us deeper into the magic of what guitar playing does to your soul.

If you can spare the change, I would recommend investing in an i-Pod/Zune if your main interest in this product is to play music."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT COMPATIBLE WITH ITUNES!!!","review":"The most important thing to know about this mp3 player is that it is NOT compatible with itunes. Now, who would want a music device that cannot be loaded with the bazillions of songs they have purchased through itunes? Exactly. Which is why the product does not mention this, and it is also why most of the really positive reviews are about the website or are from grandparents, who may not exactly be \\"current\\" on music download technology. Waste of money if you are at all inclined toward itunes."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Daughter LOVES it!!","review":"I was somewhat leary to purchase this item for a 6 year old but when Amazon had it on sale for $19 I just couldn't pass it up. It was a breeze to set up and uploading songs from CDs was just as easy. I am not a computer person and haven't tried the Itune files or anything like that, just straight from all her CDs. My daughter takes it everywhere. So far there have been no problems at all. I do wish that the Barbie Girl website activation was for more than one year though. Who knows if she will even still be interested in that website in a year but it would be nice to have if she was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daugher really likes it","review":"The only thing about this is that it does not show the song playing in a window... but other than that it's easy for my 10yr. old daughter to use- she's downloaded songs and changed her playlist without needing any help from me.

My husband is against Barbie software because of previous spyware problems with their software. My daughter never had a chance to play with it because of disc problems; it may have been scratched, but what do you expect when it comes packaged right up against hard plastic with no protective sleeve. The tech support was no help at all...the woman knew next to nothing about computers or the new product. The biggest laugh is when she told my husband....we're a toy company! So save your time and money, we returned this and bought her a Be-Bratz doll instead. It's half the price and all you need is a USB port; no disc to install! It's not an MP3 player, but she doesn't care, the web site is great. She always liked the Bratz dolls better anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk...I guess you get what you pay for.","review":"Ordered this for my daughter for Christmas.

A big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still can't get the CD to work.","review":"I'm sure my daughter would love this MP3 player if we could only get the CD to load on the computer.

I feel so strongly that what is said in this book needs to be said, readand understood by all!! What a magnificient gift the author has given us!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Insightful Attempt. A Missunderstood Mesiah?","review":"This is an insightful attempt to perceive a Messiah that many of us have never really understood. Fr. Grizone does a great job of \\"fleshing out\\" the Jesus we SHOULD be taught about. Obviously a bit disenfranchised with (many?) leaders in the Christian Church, Grizone pieces together various parts of the New Testament to paint his view of how the Church OUGHT to be. He's right. One has to wonder what Jesus would tell many of our priests and pastors about the way His Message has been manipulated in the last two millennia. (Flashback to the movie \\"Oh God!\\") The book is a fairly easy read and does a wonderful job of painting the Man so many of us long to understand, but have been so sadly misinformed about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book","review":"This is a very good book, by Jospeh Girzone, about the life of Jesus, in a story format. It is really a great way to learn about the life passion, death, and ressurection of Christ.I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relationship help","review":"For those of us seeking a deeper relationship with Jesus, Fr. Girzone shares his insights onto the Gospels in ways I had never heard before. I read this book with pen in hand to underline and journal close by."},{"rating":"2","title":"A clear simple picture","review":"A simple portrait of a Savior. I have recommended and given this book to many. It is awe inspiring how the author can grasp the real Jesus. This book can be read by every religion and culture. For a clear understanding and feeling of a undescribable \\" Messiah\\". The author displays a true friendship and love for Jesus. We can all learn from this wonderful little book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Unfortunately this book has several problems. First of all, there are several misquoted Scripture references, wrong book or chapter, etc. Then, he paraphrased Scriptures (according to Girzone's interpretation) which are completely in error, changing meaning, etc. He often simply failed to give the Scripture reference at all.As to the writing, the book is extremely repetitious in a monologue, not a story. And then he introduced Catholic Church beliefs that get into areas that are not at all helpful in his area of painting a portrait of Jesus and make the book hard to follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the Jesus I never knew.","review":"Girzone captures Christ's persona. I found myself asking lots of questions of who I thought Christ was--and found Girzone answering them in a way I never expected. Shedding light on Christ's humanity and well as his divinity by shedding insight to his story, as found in the Gospel, Girzone creates a vivid picture of a truely caring man who relished his role as counselor, teacher, healer, friend and savior.If you want to know Jesus better and more personally, read this book. Have a Bible near by, you may wish to look up stories as Girzone mentions them. I know it was worth my time and effort and I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was amazed","review":"I was thrilled with the book A Portrait of Jesus. There have been so many authors that have tried to paint an acurate and readable description of what Jesus might have been like but few have given Him the justice that Girzone does in this book. This book delves into every facet of written scripture to bring out the subtle, as well as the obvious, acts of perpetual love that exuded Jesus's every being. More than a reminiscing of the well known tails of Jesus, this book reaches behind the words and actions to what each encounter must have ment to the lives that were touched by Jesus. Beautifuly written,deep, accurate, and refreshingly simple this book overwhelmed my heart and taught me to look at Jesus's life, and what he was trying to accomplish as a whole, in a new and peaceful light. I highly reccomend it to anyone, Christian or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Works well, easy to install, makes a huge difference!!!

Helps make those hard notes hit harder without as much draw on the rest of your electrical system. Only bad thing about this cap is that it comes with just a resistor instead of a resistor light bulb so when you are charging it you know its done when the light dims but with this one you just kinda have to sit there and watch the voltage meter till it stops.

To my great disappointment, he has not been executed for treason, as he deserves.Instead of dealing with the alien invaders the way would really would have as soon as we gained a technological advantage (attack and complete subjugation of all survivors), Turtledove has us all trying to get along for some reason. The result is an utterly boring novel. I kept waiting for the shooting to start. It never does so don't bother reading this dreck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turtledove embarrasses himself again!","review":"I've read the book and read all the customer reviews of this book, and all I want to say is \\"Harry, please, stop writing these books. They're an embarrassment!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Turtledove, Sorry this stinks","review":"For the record, I REALLY like Harry Turtledove's work. I buy them all in hardcover. This one was not up to par. Homeward Bound was insultingly repititious and boring. It seemed to be a 20 to 30 page novellette that was drudgingly expanded due to a book deal contract. Of the 597 pages I would expect that less than 30 were actually Harry's work. If it weren't for my dedication to the series and the author I would never have finished it. Frankly, it was painfull. I hope there isn't a similar 'wrap up' to the American Empire, et al series....... Sorry Harry, with all due respect and at least a 3.6 average overall, this one was a dog."},{"rating":"2","title":"Space Suits?

I got started on Turtledove reading the WorldWar books and was happy that he's finally wrapped it up. Bewarned though if you expect the \\"action\\" like in the pervious books prepare to be disapointed, theres no fighting just talking. But its still interesting espically as a final volume in this saga.Only real complaint is the extreme example of Deus Machina near the end. I see how it fit the story well but it also kinda felt like a cop-out. Anyway if you've read the WorldWar and Colonization books you owe it to yourself to read this one too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little bland","review":"I'm about halfway through the book, and I'd say that it's good. Definately worth a read if you've read all of the books so far. However, it's got very little action going on. I felt that the plot was weak. It seems like there's nothing to write about, so he just kinda treads on and on and on... It's the first book in the series that I had a hard time keeping open. Yet, I gave it four stars because there are times when it gets VERY interesting, and I can't put it down. Worth buying and reading..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Short Story Balooned into 597 pages","review":"There is exactly one plot device in this book.And it gives it away on the book jacket.Then you have to wait for 400 pages to see it.This book is literally just every character saying the same thing to every other character over and over and over and over. Instead of developing what could have been a very interesting idea set in the \\"invasion\\" story backdrop it is a continuous stream of talking heads. All of whom repeat what they said in the last book.What little character development is so minimal, that you need a microscope to find it. Don't bother with this one. Harry can do much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of the Series","review":"Like many of the other reviewers, I was extremely disappointed with this book, and I am a fan of both Turtledove and this series. But this was truly a low point. The level of repetition was unbelievable. If that weren't enough - the largest part of this book consisted of completely superfluous scenes that served no purpose other than mere page-fillers. Any sort of reasonable editing would have knocked this book down to 200 pages (max), instead of the bloated 600 published.The writing itself was equally bad - characters were caricatures and the aliens(?) were simply human beings with attitudes in lizard suits. The good doctor didn't even make an attempt to inject any sort of versimilitude to his dialog or characterizations.This was, I am sorry to report - a complete waste of time and money. Definitely not recommended - even for faithful followers of this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm a big fan, but this was disappointing...","review":"Basically, the story went nowhere.Nothing happened. I don't know how else to say it. Americans made it to Home in suspended animation. Home is hot and dry. The Race is shocked. America demands that they be respected as equals by the race. The Race refuses and just before they decide to launch a pre-emptive war, an American \\"Faster than Light\\" ship reaches home. Instead of spending years in suspended animation, the trip to home takes 5 weeks. Home, now realizing that they are now technologically INFERIOR for the first time in their history, decides not to make the attack. One of the Americans becomes Kassquit's sex partner, leaving her pregnant. The Americans go home.Uh.......that's pretty much it. 600 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"My last Turtledove book","review":"Harry's writing quality has been in a continuous decline since \\"Guns of the South\\" and the Videssos Cycle books. This supposed final installment of the series was one of the worst books he has written and as mentioned by other reviewers, filled with nothing but an endless sequence of repetitive nonsense. How many times can a reader be tortured with reading the same points repeated over and over again, ad nauseam? If you really want a painful answer go to a library (so as not to waste any money) and spend a few minutes on any page and you'll soon put it down. It is actually a painful book to read and I found myself skipping entire pages. I really wonder if Turtledove actually took the time to proof-read his product because I can't see how he could have let this one out into the market. This will be last book of his that I waste my time and money on."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 paragraphs","review":"2 paragraphs would have summed the entire book. The repetitive reminders are brutal and take up half of the print. For example: the Race never having to deal with catching up takes up at least an eigth of the book alone.

What happened to that great writer of yesteryear? I'll tell you what happened, he sold out! Having made some money with his earlier hits he is now pumping out as much drivel as he possibly can before he's too old to write it. Don't waste your time folks on this one unless you like to read page after page of mundane meaningless conversations between characters who have no bearing on the story. Page after page of boredom, it seems that all of his work is heading down the same path."},{"rating":"1","title":"R. Clark nails it","review":"I could write a lengthy review, but I direct you to the review titled \\"Monumentally Bad\\" by R. Clark. It catches everything that was terrible about reading this book.Turtledove is my second-most-read author, but this book highlighted all his worst tendencies in writing and has really put me off his work. As Clark said, even if you've read the rest of this series, this one isn't worth it. Imagine your own ending - it'll be better.Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I am not kidding when I say that on could easlily skip 150 pages and not have missed any action or character development. I loved the series up to this point and was excited when I saw the book came out, but my disappointment after reading this awful thing cannnot be exaggerated. Warning, spoilers: For any of you fans of the series, be content in the knowledge foreshadowed in the last book that the U.S. send a ship to Home.

Jack Nietzsche (Cassavetes) investigates fraudulent claims. For example he peeps into the window of a hottie in a wheel chair who actually has no problem moving around when no one's looking. She's even able to have sex! No sense explaining a thread bare thin plot involving strippers, hookers, gangsters and con-men. Cassavetes who's now into directing (\\"Notebook\\", \\"Alpha Dog\\") made the right move. It's definitely worth mentioning his co-star, Deborah Shelton a former Miss USA/Texas who does the full monty several times. Also Miles O'Keeffe (remember Tarzan with Bo Derek?) and Richard Roundtree (original \\"Shaft\\") have roles. The movie is terrible except the sex scenes which are particularly good for this genre.

The cars react like real cars (brakes aren't like dropping an anchor, doesn't handle like an F1 car, etc) so a bit of driving skill is required to master it.

The wheels are so narrow that moving it with a load on grass, dirt anything uneven is impossible. I replaced them with bigger pneumatic wheels and it helped a lot but a regular wheel barrow is better. The bottom back supports make it impossible to avoid spilling concrete all the way to the destination.The second big problem is related to the emptying of the mixer. It is great for pouring footings etc. but when it goes into anything above ground level it is impossible to empty it completely. I had to dump the concrete on a piece of plywood and shovel it.It appears a great idea at the first glance, but traditional design would work better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wilton Halloween color kit","review":"Loved this kit.

The action is basically chop-the-bad-guys with no room for skill or strategy. It also doesn't help that the controls are horribly unresponsive. While the gameplay is bad, the story is decent.

The characters are well defined. You get to know them all extremely well.It is written in the first person. That allows the reader to learn plot point before the protagonist (ex cop Elena Estes.)Elena was let go from the Palm Beach Sheriff's Office after her aggressive action on a bust got a fellow cop killed. So, she has her demons to wrestle and begins the healing process of personal redemption in a kidnapping case.There are enough twists and turns and false leads that at one time or another I was certain of whodunit and was wrong on all occasions. Great deceptions.It is a great thriller set in the world of competitive horse jumping and dressage. I have zero interest in those equestrian sports, but the book is so well written I could not put it down. A solid \\"Bee Plus.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"a great read","review":"I thought this was one of her best books and I have read quite a few of them. I don't know anything about horses or the world she describes in this book but I really felt that it didn't spoil the book at all. In fact it probably would have ruined it if I had known more about this subject.

CANNOT TELL YOU HOW MUCH I ENJOYED IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I've read several other Tami Hoag books, but I found this one disappointing. All the references to the \\"horse world\\" were rather confusing to me. I also thought that there were way too many characters to keep track of. There were many potentialevil-doers; and since these characters were not fully developed, I found myself bored and distracted. The plot got very intricate, and by the end I didn't care anymore about who did what. I'm not even sure why I finished it, except that I hate to stop a book in mid-stream.On a positive note, I did like her main character, Elena Estes. She was a very gutsy ex-policewoman, but she didn't usually display a lot of common sense. You'd have to give her an \\"A\\" for effort. There was a hint of romance in the book between this woman and Detective Landry.

Thus we have a kidnapping, insurance fraud involving horses, murder for inheritance, a serial killer, a hoax, and so on. With so many balls in the air, the author misses many, coming up with all sorts of illogial twists. Practically every single character turns out to be guilty of something or the other. Plus, the principal character has her own demons and problems, but doesn't seem to resolve them.Plus, the book is way too long (all the plot threads probably made it so). Trim off around 150-200 pages, tighten up the plot, and you would have had a good story. As is, you get a confused and tedious book, with a couple of plot twists that are not enough to redeem the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark Horse","review":"This book was much better than I had thought it would be.

I have to agree with other reviews that the main character, Elena, is a little too much at times. But, the plot moves along and I found that I couldn't put it down.One problem I had was when Elena first went to the Seabright house and ended up meeting Bruce. He practically throws her out, and then a couple of days later, she goes to see him in his office, and they procede to have a conversation like they had never met. I paged back to see if there was an explanation for this, but didn't come up with one.Otherwise, I'd recommend this book for those murder mystery fans out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complex Whodonit","review":"I've enjoyed all Ms. Hoag's books and the fact that each of her books have been unique in their own way. There is no cookie cutter at work here. Dark Horse didn't disappoint, in fact, I had a hard time putting it down. Strong characters, an interesting relationship twist, and a gritty, complex plot for this \\"whodonit\\" keeps readers guessing at all the answers until the very end. With a cast of characters pretty much all guilty of something, it was very difficult to figure out this intricate crime-on-crime until the writer decided to reveal it.

The four cubes on the end are angled in and have rounded corners so they are even smaller. Granted the packaging does say \\"approximate\\" but being off by 15 ml is not close enough to call approximate in my book. Having 1/2 oz cubes does not necessarily bother me, what does bother me is the inaccuracy of the product description.As for the product itself, I purchased it to freeze breast milk so that I could place exact portions into storage bags. When I first opened the trays I was pleased by how sturdy and heavy they were, but after using them I have found that I should not have been pleased. The plastic is so heavy it is impossible to get any flex. The only way I can get the cubes out is to run warm water over the bottom of the tray.

Usually though, I have no problem if I let them sit out of the freezer for about a minute. Also, with the lids on they stack neatly and easily in the freezer. I hand wash the lids and wash the trays on the top rack of the dishwasher and my lids continue to fit very well.I like the small size of the cubes because they thaw quickly and fit in the small tupperwares I use to keep thawed food in the fridge.I have 4 of these trays (2 sets of 2) and highly recommend them to anyone making their own baby food. I also plan to continue using them to freeze broth, tomato paste, etc after I am done making baby food."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"Purchased 2 of these to make homemade baby food. They have held up well over the past 6 months of use. They come clean easy and havent stained. Ive always hand washed them so the lids still fit."},{"rating":"2","title":"good trays with a lid in this price","review":"These trays are good to freeze baby food. The lids doesnt really snug tight but atleast it covers the food while in freezer. Once frozen i run hot water at the bottom and keep it outside for 3-5 mins. The cubes come out fine whether solid or liquid food items. I transfer them to ziplock bags for further use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money!","review":"I read the reviews and thought that the good seemed to outweigh the bad, but I was wrong! These cubes are no where near an ounce each! The whole point of purchasing the product was for easy grab and go for my breast milk. I put three cubes in a bottle, expecting to have 3 ounces, and it was about 1 3/4 an ounce. That is ridiculous! PLUS the lids don't fit correctly.I guess I can use them for regular ice cubes."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a crock","review":"These came warped. The lids do not even slightly go on the trays.

The plastic is so hard when frozen that it becomes brittle. Still looking for a better way to freeze baby food."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Rubbish","review":"I bought this item thinking that it would serve as an organizer for my breast milk storage. Instead I ended up with two over-priced ice trays with a cover ! You are much better off buying breast milk freezer storage bags or containers where you can put the date, the amount and keep more quantity per unit.Do not waste your money and buy this as there are several better and more cost-effective alternatives for storing breast milk. I promptly returned this as soon as I opened the package. PS Amazon was very graceful about the return, which I appreciated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really bad experience!","review":"This company never shipped the item, never responded to my emails and was just plain disappointing!

Certainly making pureed baby food and storing it frozen in cube form is very convenient, but I do *not* find these \\"Fresh Baby\\" trays to be any better than using regular ice cube trays. I do find the trays to be more stiff than my other regular trays, so I have to let them sit on the counter for a few minutes first before I can twist/flex them to get the cubes out. So far I haven't had any problems with the lids snapping properly, as some others have commented, but I also remove the food from the trays after a couple hours when it is frozen and store the cubes in another container. Since I do that, it doesn't even matter that they have lids. In my opinion, save your money and use regular ice cube trays instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not 1 oz cubes as advertised","review":"I received these trays as a gift. Love that they are bpa free and come with lids, however, each cube holds only 1/2 oz to 2/3 oz breastmilk (not 1 oz as stated online and on the product packaging). As thawed breastmilk is only good for 24 hours in the fridge, this makes planning more difficult and can lead to wasted \\"liquid gold\\". Will not be using for breastmilk storage"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, but the covers pop off in the freezer","review":"I liked the idea of these trays, even if they are just fancy ice cube trays with covers. Unfortunately, the covers don't seal well and pop off in the freezer."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't care for","review":"I really like using the little square glad plastic tubs rather than this item just didnt like how it was too much work trying to get the frozen cube out if I didn't want to defrost the whole thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"useful","review":"These have served their purpose pretty well. I used them to freeze breast milk, and now for homemade babyfood. All in all they have worked out great. They actually yield a little less than an ounce though. Maybe you have to fill them to overflowing to get a whole ounce. Also, sometimes the lids don't seem to fit quite right or stay on well. But most of the time they do. I always wash them by hand, as other reviewers had said the lids warp in the dishwasher."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"So easy to make food in bathes and store in the freezer this way. It saved me a lot of time, since I worked, I could make food and my mom could use it. Still home made, though not totally fresh.

I would reccommend these to any parent that wants to make their baby's food!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy To Use","review":"These ice cube trays make making baby food a piece of cake and this is the second set I have ordered (if you make large batches of baby food like I do then having 4 trays makes life a lot easier and the baby food making process goes by a lot quicker) I have never had problems with closing the lid or popping out the ice cubes and I have been using them for 8 months; although I do leave them on the counter for a minute or two before I turn the ice cube trays upside down to release the ice cubes into the lid. The reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 stars is because each ice cube spot ONLY holds a heaping 1 tbsp which turns into 1/2 oz---not 2 tbsp which is 1 oz like they state. I have recommended these to my friends that make baby food, especially since they are BPA free."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Trays that Get the Job Done!","review":"These trays have worked great so far for freezing my daughter's baby food. So far I have used them for sweet potatoes, carrots, applesauce and acorn squash. No problems so far and I'm considering ordering another set for extra convenience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Work great","review":"They are exactly what I wanted. I use them for freezing Breast milk and homemade babyfood. I would have given 5 stars but I always have to ask my husband to get the cubes out for me. I am not strong enough to twist them. But they pop out clean and wash up nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"lids aren't snug and frostbite overnight","review":"I wanted to love these trays. I have been nothing but disappointed. I could have saved money and bought other storage containers. The lids do not fit very snug. I make food, leave it overnight, and by morning there is frost on the cubes. Grr. I immediately transfer to ziploc bags for storage. I will continue to use them because I am not willing to spend any more."},{"rating":"2","title":"works as expected","review":"I haven't had any issues with this that I wouldn't expect to have (e.g. if you don't keep it horizontal it will spill when it's still liquid). I washed the lid in the dishwasher and it still seems to fit well."},{"rating":"2","title":"these trays are great!","review":"i have other baby food trays, and they don't work very well - these are very flexible, which makes it easy to get the cubes out with simple, easy twisting - even while only having one hand if i'm holding the baby! i would highly recommend these, especially if you are making your own baby food like i am, and need to make lots of it at a time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just an expensive ice cube tray","review":"These are really just an expensive ice cube tray. I should have just bought a few more of the ones I have from Ikea- they have covers that fit, they're flexible and they're cheaper. The covers on these don't fit and they are not flexible. I have a heck of a time getting stuff out of them. I guess I fell into that silly new parent thing- must buy all kinds of baby stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simplest Way to Freeze Homemade Baby Food","review":"I have to admit I was a bit skeptical about how well these would work (or even how easy making baby food would be in geenral), but after having tried these, silicone trays, and individual plastic 1 oz. cubes to store my daughter's homemade food, I have found these to be the easiest. The silicone sticks (no matter how much they say it doesn't) and the cubes are a pain to pour the food into. Depending on the consisitency of your puree, the food can simply be poured from the blender into the trays. After freezing overnight and removing the lids, a quick twist back and forth is enough to release your perfectly forms cubes. And the size makes it easy to combine with other purees (i.e. apple and butternut squash) to make organic blends at home. From now on I will give a boz of these and the book of 100 top baby purees for shower gifts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as Advertised","review":"The cubes are NOT 1 oz!!!! They are half an oz which now looking back i should have read the negative reviews instead of the good ones. Maybe if my child drank less but one whole trays worth of food is what my baby drinks in one bottle. I will be rummaging these and sticking with the storage bags."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good luck getting the cubes out","review":"It is VERY difficult to get the cubes out of the trays. The trays do not bend well enough to easily pop the cubes out. Yes, of course you can run warm water over the back of the tray to loosen them, but this is NOT an effective way for getting frozen breastmilk out, as it begins to melt slightly, which is not good if you are planning to store the frozen cubes for the future.Also if you're trying to make cubes that are exactly 1 oz in size, this is not the tray for you; pouring in one ounce of breastmilk overflows the little compartment. It might work fine for baby foods to slightly overfill the compartment, but it is messy and extremely annoying with milk.The only positive thing I have to say about these trays is that the lids fit well and are easy to put on and take off."},{"rating":"1","title":"good concept, has fatal flaw","review":"When I first saw this product, I was excited about it. It looked durable and I loved the silicon lid. However, the use of this product in freezing my homemade baby food purees is not great. The trays are very rigid; there is no way to twist the product (like one would an ice tray) to remove the cubes. YOu have to let them thaw a little to get them out, and for many different foods (like prunes!) this is disastrous. In fact, I still have a tray of prunes from when I first tried the trays! I've tried banging them on the counters and the only thing I have found to get the food out is to run water along the back of the trays, and leave them sitting upside-down for about 5 minutes. Most of the cubes will fall out, and you can usually bang or pry the last few.The lid works well and fits snugly. I really wanted this product to be great, but it isn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"lid fits snugly","review":"I was worried reading so many saying the lid doesn't fit snugly. But mine does.For those having fitting problem, you may want to try this direction from the product description: \\"To correct any fit issues, run lid under hot water until it is warm and pliable. Place the lid on a tray and wait for it to cool down.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for breast milk storage","review":"I haven't tried this for baby food, but I can say that it does not work well for breast milk storage. The reason is because the plastic the tray is made out of is too hard to twist easily to make it release the cubes of frozen breast milk. In order to be able to get the breast milk out, you have to let it thaw slightly, which isn't good for breast milk if you are planning to keep it frozen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great and easy to use - perfect size and durable!","review":"I bought these to freeze homemade baby food. As many others say, it doesn't seem the lids fight air tight, but that's not a problem because once the food is frozen, I put it in ziplock bags. My son is only 6 months, so we are just introducing some solids and not really eating meals - he won't really do solids until 1 year, but I am loving the amount in each cube and how they freeze and are quite durable. I washed the tray in the dishwasher but the lids by hand. Great for the price and meets my need for its purpose!"},{"rating":"2","title":"definitely made easy","review":"I wish we had known about this a year ahead. We use it for pureed fruits and veggies.

The lids will sometimes warp if you put them in the dishwasher; but as mentioned in the directions if you heat them there is no problem getting back on."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product","review":"These are great, the food doesn't get ice on the food.

After I finish preparing my son's puree, I use a measuring spoon to scoop the exact amount needed for feeding, and pop the trays right into the freezer.

The overall impact of Bruckners' scoring is reduced, as opposed to say Karajan's reading and interpretation recorded on DG. Where Karajan's symphonic climaxes flow with the music, Haitink's rather slowish tempi stall the scale and grandeur of Bruckner's music. While the VPO play beautifully (as always) and the recording is pretty good, but no better than that, to balance Bruckner interpretations Karajans DG/BPO should be in your collection. This recording will appeal to those liking slower, lower voltage Bruckner, Haitink fans, longer phrasing and fine detail. In fact, for slower tempi readings, I\\"d say Tintner, with his interpretation looses nothing in sound, musical flow, comprehension of Brucknerian phrasing and orchestral detail.Audition Haitink before buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken","review":"These earrings broke when I tried to put them on and I didn't use a lot of force.

She's cold and stuffy, he's a pathetic buffoon. They fuss and fume over being dumped by their spouses. The only thing they have in common is her spouse is now with his. The rest of the movie is a tepid plot to regain what they've lost (she repeatedly demands that he come up with a means of getting her husband away from his wife and is quite putout when he won't cooperate). Since neither spouse is ever seen, one is left to wonder why the overwhelming desire to get them back. Are they crazy or just desperate? By all accounts, what they \`lost' wasn't that great to begin with. This makes them stupid and the ordeal they subject the audience to tedious and tiresome. Not a good movie on any account.

There's still a story behind it, but it's not so annoying to follow as in SC3.My only real complaint are the graphics--or rather, the \\"drawings\\".

It does little for me and quite frankly, I can't help but wonder about the editors who let it go.Beyond the ick factor, this book was poorly written. There wasn't enough of the universe beyond the explanation of the grey-eyed Mary Sues, to give the reader much of a feeling about what was going on on a grand scale. Our heroine was just another pampered girly who did so little to stand out in comparison to the other pampered girlies in the genre that she was flat out forgettable. Our hero, the stereotypical rogue with a sympathetic past, was also so generic that he didn't do anything worthwhile to stick in my mind beyond the obvious gross out sex with a close blood relative.Overall, this book was utterly lacking in originality and was nasty to top it off. I'd recommend it for fire kindling should you need to get the fireplace roaring this winter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast-paced sci-fi thriller","review":"It's nice to see some sci-fi in the world of romance novels!

One of the abilities they have is taking an over worked theme or plot changing it into something new and exciting and their very own story. Fairy tales some of the oldest stories around have been retold in amazing ways that are unique to the author.This author didn't do that in this story.I made myself read the whole book just to see if she would use The Chronicles of Roderick and Dune for her plot all the way through the book. <sigh> She did. I felt like i was reading a very badly rewrite of Dune with Roderick thrown in as a whoosified hero. If you like sci fi I don't recommend this book. Its way to unsettling to see an author not find her own way to make these two stories, she seems to have took her plot from, new and unique to her form of story telling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great illustrations","review":"This book was given to me by my niece who knows what a cat lover I am.

I just ordered 2 more. I'm a 40DD, and I've had a terrible time finding bras that really fit. This bra fits better and is more supportive than anything I've found for a long time. One thing I've discovered though -- for a comfortable fit, it's very important to have the outside edge of the underwire (the part that's under your arm) \\"adjusted\\" to the proper place along the side of your breast. Otherwise, it can have a tendency to stick out a bit and poke against your arm. If you do a little adjusting, it will lay nice and flat. I'm guessing this quirk is because the bra is constructed a little differently in order to smooth the area under your arms. Vanity Fair lost one star on the rating because I wish the elastic in the underarm and back part of the bra held up over time a little better, but overall, I'm very satisfied with this bra."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be advised, be very advised...","review":"This is a small flyer-style leaflet of the stage play put on in Pennsylvania in 2000.

But the line-out signal from the casstette deck was too strong for the aux mic input on the cam-corder. Putting the PAC-LC1 in-line brought the signal down to the right level for the cam-corder, so the final DVD now sounds great.We also have a portable 6 channel mixer/amp without gain control, and the line-out signal from the CD player was too strong coming into the amp to allow any real latitude in adjustments.

Though Collinson is scrupulously fair, the account, perhaps necessarily, given its subject matter, tilts slightly toward the Reformers as occupying the high ground -- but high by only inches. Collinson alternately communicates both a wry detachment from the protagonists and also an empathetic understanding for the passions of an age far more sincerely religious than ours. While presupposing a familiarity with the outlines of history of the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance, this book would satisfy both the beginner as a guide and the historically informed for its learned perspective."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE AUTHOR AS SCHOLAR","review":"Page 67:\\". . .another of history's jokes, the Book of Concord (1580)\\" (without further elaboration).Do you think Mr. Collinson actually read it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Off the Mark...A Mixed Bag of Essays...","review":"Patrick Collison's Reformation: A History, is off the mark, for it fails to produce the overall effect that the title suggests. It is not a history, in the true sense, for his subject matter is buried too far in obscure theory and it lacks precise modes of chronological sequencing (time-ordering of people, places, things, causes and effects) . This work is more like a mixed bag of essays, which insufficiently treats subjects tied to the Reformation. Also, Collison writes in distasteful, unbalanced, and unpolished prose, and so does not even add a rhetorical coloring to his already stale and humdrum work on the Reformation. Of the hundreds of works to turn to for guidance to knowledge of the Reformation, Collison's is not even suggested among those. Instead, consult Diarmaid MacCulloch, Will Durant, or Phillip Schaff, for authoritative works on the Reformation."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT FOR THE UNINITIATE","review":"Patrick Collinson is hailed on the book jacket as \\"Regius Professor of Modern History, Emeritus, Cambridge. A renowned scholar of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. . . .\\" I found this very small book, like any history, to have interesting nuggets, but was disappointed in that it assumed a familiarity with Reformation history I lack --and in fact purchased the book to acquire. The chapter on Calvin and Calvinism, for example counts only 16 small pages. These raced over the subject in a high-speed rattling-off of names, dates, and places, without engaging me in the historical story. One jacket blurb (London Times) recommended this book to readers like myself because of its brevity. I disagree. Find a larger book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Unimpressive","review":"I'm a big fan of the Modern Library series, and of Collinson's work in general, but the only virtue of this book is its brevity. It is certainly not for the general reader who wants an introduction to the Reformation: Collinson leaves too many basic ideas and concepts unexplained, and too many phrases in Latin untranslated. A symptomatic example: He writes, \\"We are nearly at the end of the chapter on Calvinism in which we have yet to define Calvinism\\" (p. 100). Not a very useful approach! The best parts of the book are its grounding in historiography (how historians' interpretations of the Reformation have changed over time) and its bibliography. Its major weakness, other than those already noted, is that it does not provide a sense of what people actually thought about religion, other than the insightful - but pithy - comment that the Reformation substituted the Ten Commandments for the Seven Deadly Sins (p. 13). It's not worth the time or the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"too little on too much","review":"Like a couple of the others who've reviewed this book I believe this book to be a poor choice to get a handle on Reformation history.

I would be glad to be proved wrong, to have my theory destroyed not only as unprovable (which it probably is, given the current historical situation), but as illogical, crazy, etc. Until that happens, I have to consider it logical, sane, and the best theory of reality around, since it explains more of the \\"facts\\" (read \\"mysteries, lies and contradictions\\") than any other."},{"rating":"1","title":"First things first","review":"Preparation, Preparation, Preparation is crucial.

I am proud to say that I have lost 20 lbs and am closing in on my goal and I still have 3 months to go. A huge help in taking off this weight was due to this DVD. I went straight into the 50 minute workout and struggled at first but within just a couple of weeks I could start to see changes in my body. I alternate this DVD with Jillian Michaels \\"No More Trouble Zones\\" and my body is starting to look slimmer and more defined. I cut my food portion sizes in half and have done no pills or fads, just the DVD workouts. My metabolism is coming back thanks to the muscle tone.

Yes, this title comes out every few years, and yes, it has a different author each time. That is the Gun Digest way. But don't be mislead!This is not a book for the handgun hobbyist, this is a book for those who are serious about self defense with a handgun. Massad Ayoob is very qualified to write on this topic and his information is top notch. His style is very readable. He really covers every aspect of the topic--self defense with a handgun--as well as one can in a single book.If you are new to the subject of self-defense, buy this book and Ayoob's \\"In the Gravest Extreme\\" as your introduction to the topic.

He also has a difficult time saying anything bad about any of the guns, a sure sign of a gun hack. Even so, one can learn a lot from his experience, especially the legal ramifications of using a handgun for defense. One such tidbit is to tell the police briefly what happened, but keep your mouth shut until your attorney arrives. The police aren't always your friends, despite their actions and comments. Meanwhile, anything YOU say can and undoubtedly will be used against you in a court of law. It's an excellent book for beginners and experienced alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly expert advice on handgunnery.","review":"This book is chockful of truly useful information written by a man with impeccable credentials in the world of firearms and combat. Taylor utitilizes a combination of valid scientific techniques and practical experiences to evaluate established concepts, ideas, and dogma in this field; he cleanly separates the wheat from the chaff. If you want to survive a handgun fight, who better to listen to than someone who has lived through five of them? All aspects of combat handgunnery are covered along with their relative real-world importance.

There is definately a scene I thought that was totally brilliant. The main character is dreaming of this girl name Lorrie, and he describes an orchid scene or a plain full of flowers, he describes the girl as a flower, it was very poetic, being a poet myself, I was very impressed.

I think this novel will appeal to all readers from age ten to one hundred but also to individuals who do not identify themselves as readers. The story setting is a small town in the mid sixties, and the plot revolves around Jim at thirteen as he experiences friendship, love, loss and other lessons of life. This reader experienced emotions from laughing out loud to crying out loud.

Haitink's conducting is not quite like this, but close. It is as if he slows down passages just to savor the richness of the moment. But what seems to have happened is that he doesn't come across any \\"moments\\" he doesn't like, which results in the whole performance seeming to drag along. If you are fond of Haitink's style of interpretation, or that of Klemperer for that matter, you will probably like this performance.

What about his relationship with his kids, neighbors, family, in relation to boxing? Why not simply state the various build ups to different fights, as opposed to Primo Carnera's birthplace and the size of his underpants? This story does not get fully underway until more than half way through the book. It ends quickly without much information of Braddock's former years and how he lived after boxing.

But when I first popped this into the Playstation, I immediatley new that this was way better. The music is awesome, and in my opinion better than Tony Hawks Pro Skater. The crashes are realistic and when you watch your re-play, its so realistic that it looks like your watching a competition on TV. The controls are very simple.

The game slows down A LOT, the animation practically freezes. Every riders bike has a Haro sprocket. Amazing soundtrack with Sublime, Cypress Hill, and Deftones. Levels are fun. Controls are top-notch. There is a HUMONGOUS variety of tricks. This achieved by being able to combine up to four tricks into one. For example, instead of doing a tabletop to backflip to one hander to one footer, by pressing up, down, square and then quickly pressing left, right, circle you will backlip while doing a tabletop while only having one foot and one hand on the bike! It might sound complicated, but it is not. This allows for over 1,000 different tricks, not counting combos!

His pictoral display, which ranges from his own childhood artwork to advertisements and newspaper clippings, brings that period of history to life. This book is a quick read because of his use of illustrations in telling his story. I highly recommend this book to others that want to learn more about WWII and the unique Alsatian culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Transfer I've Seen...

Works fine with a trackball mouse, except for the frequent lockup in the backswing, causing my drive to be 27 yards, and the commentary not matching the shot, and it making me not able to switch clubs from a LW on a 97 yard shot that takes me 3 swings to go 97 yards.

I was really hoping that the 2006 version would bring the game to the next level. I can honestly say that this game is no better than the 2002 version and maybe a little worse than 2004. I agree with the other reviewers: rent the game before buying. You will probably be disappointed.The one thing this game does improve upon is the tournament competition. You likely will no longer be winning tournaments by 30+ strokes. However, you will probably still win every tournament without much difficulty, but it may only be by 5-10 shots. I actually like the change in the putting controls as this makes putting slightly harder and less predictable.Menus are not as intuitive as they have been in previous versions and loading times for each step are pretty poor. Game face is really not improved (I actually think it is worse than 2004).I have been a huge fan of previous versions of this game, but I am disappointed in this edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened????","review":"Why did EA take a perfect game and screw with it? The '05 game was perfect; easy to play but challenging. There is absolutely no way to shape your shot and add distance with the L1 button unless your an octopus or maybe EA wanted this to be a two player game. One to swing the club and the other to tap L1 for added distance. All I asked was for the '05 gameplay with the same controls but add different courses and a few new players. What we received was a completely different game with difficult menus to navigate and ridiculous controls. If you have played Tiger from 2002 to 2005 you will be dissapointed in the new game.

I have loved every Tiger game to come out in past years. The graphics got worse, the game play is pathetic, and the menus are just not user friendly. The new dual control only makes things frustrating. The new voice addition to your player is almost as annoying as listening to Michael Moore. This game sucks! The only logical thing that I can think of; EA made this Tiger game exclusively for the next generation consoles like Xbox 360. EA must have used most of their resources to make this game for the more powerful systems and just put the scraps into the regular consoles. The evidence is in the graphics, they are equivalent to PS1 plus the game play is leggy. I am rattled that such a great title has gone from top notch to worthless. Maybe the Xbox 360 version will be a revolution in the Tiger series, but until then, don't buy this game without renting it first.

They've poisoned the well; no longer will we rush out and purchase each new version of TW PGA Tour sight-unseen.

But say that you learned that attack with an axe. You can only equip that attack on other axes, so basically you are stuck using an axe the entire game if you want that special attcak. I think that is ridiculous. Other than that, the game is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old Style RPG Good Story Average Game Play","review":"I like tactics type games, and Vandal Hearts (the first one) was a lot of fun. I was put off by the second one because they totally changed the fighting system. Instead of a turn based system, where all of your members move, then all of the computer's members move, you input the move for one of your characters and the computer does the same. THen the player and computer characters move simultaneously. Essentially, you have to try to outguess the computer. It was sort of interesting at first, then, as you add more party members, it gets really hard. Once you get the hang of it, it gets almost ridiculously easy (with some notable exceptions). I found I had to force myself to finish this game, but I did enjoy the ending. Don't think I'll ever play it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take my word for it, this RPG isn't one you would buy.","review":"I'm sorry to say, but this game is just awful. The characters are bland and do not develop through the game. The plot lacks any intersting twists, and the graphics are just bad. Also, there is no variety in mission objectives, I's just \\"Kill all enemies\\". Take my word for it, this game is just not interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vandel Hearts 2 Another Dumb sequil","review":"I've allways said the only series where the sequil wasn't worse then the orginial was the FF series, and VH/VH2 is no exception. I enjoyed the orignial VH so figured I would try the second one. I was very confused by the battle system, even though a plus is that it became very difficult for you to win battles now because of the constantly moving char's. The job system was very hard to get the hang of and had nothing I found immensly rewarding to intregue me enough to work with my jobs. Plus the fact that the magic was very low scale (even less then VH 1) and that the job class made no sence just made me dislike this game. If you want to play a RPG/strategy game. Try VH1 or Final Fantasy Tatics. This isn't worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"I bought this game because I really like RPG's, BIG mistake! This isn't a true RPG this is a story game, This game is boring, the game is one big video and the only part you have in it is the battles that are annoying and don't have that something that games like Final Fantasy has, you also get to make the OCCASIONAL decision for the hero. The weapons are basic and boring with the only variation being in the stats and spells. The graphics are terrible, I've seen better graphics on a SNES!The music is resonible but a bit repeditive with not much variation from song to song. The story is boring with the biggest twist being a traitor and a war. The story also jumps without much explanation, and as usual everyone is in love with the main character or his friends.My suggestion is don't buy this game, wasting money on lollies will give you longer enjoyment! It looks like Konami have made another terrible RPG. If you like RPG's stick to SquareSoft and the Final Fantasy series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chrono Cross","review":"I was really dissapointed with this game. The game play went ok, but there were wayyyy too many characters in the game. It reminded me of Final Fantasy too much. I think that the game designers were Final Fantasy programmers on a severe amount of Heroin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not rocket science","review":"I was hoping for a book that offered some real value - an easy to read, quick to digest volume that provided some real insight.

The book was written when digital photography was just becoming popular. It is good for formal wedding posing ideas, but it gives no technical info for digital photography. All of the info is based on using film."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better wedding photography books","review":"I purchased this book first, read it in a day, and haven't looked at it again. The most useful elements were the business section: it has a mockup of a contract and other information on business and legal issues. Otherwise I found the book less than useful. The photos aren't very impressive, rendering the advice a little suspect. There isn't very much technical information about posing or lighting, it's all generalized and vague. Nor are there wedding-related tips, most of the advice in this book could be summed up by \\"know how to work your camera\\". I went to the bookstore and picked up Wedding Photography by Mark Cleghorn, which was much more useful. I recommend you look elsewhere for wedding photography books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated Style","review":"This is a very outdated book. The images are very dated and the style is too stiff. I am guessing that the pictures were old when the book was originally published in 2001. If you fancy yourself as a contemporary photographer then look elsewhere.I recommend looking up The Top 10 Wedding Photographers in Popular Photography. Their styles are fresh even if some of them like Jerry Ghionis are highly posed. Even Jerry's work doesn't have a posed look to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"The use of all the power generated by this machine was amazing. I think the design concept is lacking.

The story line is great, plenty of twists and turns, and is pretty captivating. While the game moves a little slow, and the battles do get annoying, I was hooked waiting to find out what happened next. I'd recommend this one. The movies in the game were excellent, with lots of detail. And the game was challenging, nothing really pushover that you could beat within a few hours.All in all, an enticing, exciting title you won't be able to shut off ^_^"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not like the others.","review":"I didn't like this game. It got real tiring after the first battles. Most of your attacks are just punches and kicks. There are throws that are pretty cool, but they are all wrestling moves. The story line is stupid. A game that should've been overlooked by its creators."},{"rating":"1","title":"simply boring","review":"This game did not live up to my expectations. The graphics are solid and the story's all right, but the pace is SLOW. The biggest problem with this game is the battles. It tries to put together the best aspect of fighting games and RPG battle systems, and it simply doesn't work. Trust me, this should not be called an RPG. Of course there are some people who'll love this game, but you probably aren't one of them, and so should rent instead of buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"long and confusing","review":"youre this dude who travels all about this underground world and battles weird monsters.when you get into a room with them.the combat mode is very strange.you must pick and choose each minute aspect of every strike you perform.whenever you get nailed with a move you learn it.you can customize your guys fighting style.sounds gresat right?WRONG!!!!!!!!!!!youve got like 10 million stats to keep track of,the game gives you no real indication of whats wrong when it is.theres no clear cut way to go.the instructions are really vague.its all a good idea but,it failed miserably.i wonder if stalin programmed it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great RPG","review":"This is a great rpg. It has some pretty awesome cut-scenes. But the best part of the game is the great sci-fi plot. It's also cool how your physique improves as you move through the game. Although the fighting is a little akward at first, you get used to it.With an expansion pack, the graphics are great. The music also adds a lot to the game.Overall the game isn't too hard, but it kept me awestruck. But make sure you have a memory pack before you buy this game. I think anyone who truly likes RPGs should get this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete bust","review":"This game is a pittiful excuse for a game, the moves are boring, the \\"rpg\\" aspect is childish, and the graphics are horrid. The game \\"claims\\" to take full use of the powers of the expansion pack, but when I put the expansion pack in, it just increased the frame rate a slight notch. And that was needed, the frame rate for this game was horrid, the camera angels constantly were wrong, and the \\"wide variety of monsters\\" were a joke. There was almost no variety, they ALL attacked in the EXACT same manner, and avoiding there attacks is just WAY too easy as you just have to stay out of there reach untill your \\"power meter\\" is full. As for the \\"high res\\" graphics, they were pitiful, colorless, and for the most part unnoticable. The opening cut scenes were very annoying in thier length, and the translation of the text to English was done by a 3rd grader if that. If you want to waste your $50 that badly, just flush it down the toilet, atleast it wont take up your time as well!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst game i have played!","review":"mmm, What a mistake making this game.

Because it is written through the eyes of the girls as children, it is not laden with a lot of adult scenes that are often painful to read when studying written works of the Holocaust. Even so, its story is poingnant and leaves a lasting impression. Cecile's parents and their love live forever in this book. I highly recommend this book.

The second one was the ladder match for the World's title which was an epic brawl. The Hog pen match was one of the worst and most dumbest matches I ever seen and I saw every match with Doink The Clown in them. The Submission match between John Cena & Big Show looked like it kept on going & going & going just like the bunny from the battery commercials and it's the same basic match only without the pinfalls. The rest of them were second to third rate.

I really didn't expect anyone to know more on the subject than I did.While I was mostly right, the book did manage to discuss the topic with surprising lucidity without losing a bit of detail. Not a small feat considering the subject matter. It also manages to be very lean, not wasting any time on theory or conceited tangents that just tend to waste the readers valuable time.The only problem I had with the book is the cover. While programming books are not known for their stylish leather binding or gilded pages, I'd prefer to have a book that didn't look so much like \\"chicken soup for the GUI\\" on my shelf.I recommend the book for anyone interested in working with SWT/JFace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fundamentals on JFace frameworks","review":"This book is well written. The narrative flows conversationally and keeps your interest throughout the chapter. This book gives you a fundamental understanding of the architecture of SWT and especially of JFace. It puts the pieces together for you. Whether you are writing desktop gui applications, Eclipse plug-ins, or Eclipse Rich Client Platforms (RCP) applications, this book is an excellent starting point. Unfortunately, the chapter on RCP was full of errors and the application example did not run. But all the other book's examples ran without any errors. And its excellent explanations of the JFace frameworks make the book worth having."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor reference","review":"This text may work as a simple introduction to SWT and JFace, but it is a VERY poor reference material for the minutae that is what makes SWT and JFace challenging to use.

I have since lost the ring so i reordered the whole set and was so disappointed when i received it today. The pans are a poor lightweight quality and the ring does not fit correctly in the pan at all. it just spins around. I will have to make do as this cake is for a birthday.

All three cakes came off with no trouble and not one inch stuck to the pan. I did not use any form of oil or spray. The pans are just that good alone. However, the plastic part that is supposed to help make the cake come out checkered stinks! You would need to have four or more hands to maybe make it come out right and that is if the cake batters don't merge together in the oven. The plastic part does not stay to the bottom of the pan well enough. Therefore, the cake batters end up coming out like marble cake instead of checkered.

Wilton makes some nice cake pans but these aren't it. I would gladly pay extra for pans that are more appropriate to creating a three layer cake. Because of the pans being nonstick, it was very difficult to make the divider insert stay in place while adding the batter. I would not recommend this product to anyone wanting to make a nice looking cake."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing cake pan","review":"I was disappointed by the insert in this cake pan. It does not evenly fit the bottom or reach the sides properly so that it slides around when you try to put the batter in, creating a smeared layer effect. The pans themselves are a fine quality but it's really hard to work with. I've tried several times, with someone holding the insert to try and keep it from sliding and I've ended up with off-center, smeared layers and weird looking cakes. It would really work better if the insert clipped down to the pan. The plastic is too light and the batter \\"lifts\\" it as you put it in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Um.....You can't change physics.","review":"My older sister bought this for me as a birthday gift, (I bake....a lot)and i was super excited. But before I even used the product you KNOW as an intelligent human that thick batter will move that flimsy plastic insert (that has so side clips or rubberized edge to stop batter bleeding)in a nanosecond. In short- this product can NEVER be used as intended with a perfect result.However, if you're like me and refuse to be bettered by something as sad as this, you take a different approach. Using this insert as a \\"cookie cutter\\" of sorts will product the perfect cut outs to assemble a perfectly executed checkerboard cake.

First of all, I like the variety of styles you can pick when creating a boxer as well as the realism of the career mode. The only bad thing about the game is its somewhat limited graphics and gameplay. As far as gameplay, it needs to be tweaked a little bit. It's like they got the majority of the game and left out some small specifics such as the announcing.

Every boss that has tried to shoot snake, as soon as he shoots them they start whining about their horrible past or their family. WHO ON EARTH CARES. Another bad point is there are no great cinema clips, they all use the in game graphics. I read all these great reveiws saying its just like a movie and I was sorely disapointed.

The storyline is amazing but certain parts literally makes me cry (even on the third time I played it). I don't like shooting people so this game gives me opions 'cause it is a game were you sneak instead of shoot. The animation is very good for an old game. The only part I was not crazy about was the tourture scene because I was stuck for 2 days so Meryl would not die.(In my game she did). You should totally buy Metal Gear Solid if you like espionage."},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest of all time. Absolutely so question about it.","review":"What can be said about this masterpiece? This game is utterly amazing in every aspect. The plot is full of so many details. It relates to things that we know about. Not everything is just hoopla made up by the game designers. The action and the thinking parts of the game are superbly balanced. You're not just running around, fighting people. There's parts were you have to be stealthy, part's were you have to think. Man, this is just a milestone in video game history. And wouldn't you like to partake of the sweetness that is Metal Gear Solid? I assume your answer was yes, and the only way to do partake of it is to buy it. So do it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally awesome!","review":"Wow. This game has so many elements which fit perfectly together! If you like storylines such as ones present in the ever popular Final Fantasy games, plus a mix of action, this is the game to get!

Cinematic scenes are integrated flawlessly into the game, not feeling like interruptions as some movie clips can do. Witty banter makes this game all the sweeter, whether directed to enemies or allies! A fantastic game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More Than A Game","review":"Metal Gear Solid is more than a video game. It is more like a movie experience. Game play and cut scenes use the same graphics. The music and sound are the best I have ever heard in a video game and the voice overs are top notch. Now that MGS is on Sony's greatest hits list you can't afford not to buy this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much Better Than Syphon Filter","review":"This is a great game. There are endless exciting fights and challenges, and the puzzles are reasonable. A few words of warning: The cimema scenes are endless, sometimes as long as 20 consecutive minutes, and often your desire to keep playing will frustrate. Some of the boss fights (such as the second meetings with Raven and Wolf) seem impossible and can be frustrating. This is also a short game - it took me about 12 hours, and I'm no gaming expert. It may also leave unfulfilled, but that is more due to the excellent gameplay than a subpar ending.Now that its $20, I strongly urge you to buy it if it sounds at all interesting to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the greatest game ever!","review":"Metal Gear Solid is got to be one of the best games I have ever played.

This game is not a Duke Nukem \\"shoot'em up\\". You start out with no weapons and have to use stealth and get around undetected...you acquire weapons as the game progresses. The graphics are phenomenal and the control is, pardon the obvious play on words, solid. The best part is the voice over acting! Unlike the rancid voices in Resident Evil, these voices are well done. Try RE and see if I am lying... MGS is a long game, but is highly addicting. The fights are great - especially Psycho Mantis and fighting Meatal Gear Rex itself.

You really should buy this game before you buy MGS2 or else you won't understand 80% of MGS2. Also this game is really hard if you you play on Extreme mode so it does get frustrating sometimes. Really the only reason I give this game 4 stars is because of the graphics but if I could I would give it 4 and 3/4 stars.

Maybe not for younger kids, but peoples over 10 is a fine age to play. Blood CAN be turned off. I don't know one person who has not liked this game. Another fabulous quality of this game is that there are many secrets to be revealed, even after beatong the game 2 or 3 times. Difficulty level is optional. It's also fairly humorous.

Okay, yes, with all the cut scenes and the linear plot, playing this game is much like watching a movie--but a BAD movie. The writing is pale, the voiceovers are wooden, and the graphics in the cut scenes don't pass muster. It all comes off as melodramatic, convoluted, and tedious. Minus the storyline and the cut scenes, the gameplay is pretty good, actually--maybe three and a half stars. Also, the whole thing is too easy to get through--you can do it in two days or less.I suppose that my final judgement is that for gamers over age 14 Metal Gear Solid is unegaging.

Basically you go threw a bunch of missions so you can destroy metal gear, which is a nuclear weapon. The game not only includes killing and adventure, but also tries to teach you about the nuclear weapons and power. I think getting this game for ... is a steal. If you have never played it definitely buy it and play it on normal or hard mode. It will waste the adventure to play it on easy. It took me around a month to beat, playing it about 2 hours a day.

It really helped him breathe better when he had a stuffy nose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for newborns/not for babies older than 1 month","review":"I bought this item when my daugther was first born and it worked great. Once she hit a month old and was moving around more, her head would slide off of the side even with the positioners in tact. I got pretty scared. Once they start to move more, I would probably recommend getting the wedge incline for the crib, or just purchase that in the beginning. It is much cheaper and you will feel more safe and secure when your baby is inclined."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!!!","review":"Our son has reflux so we like to keep him on an incline when he sleeps. He is 2 months old and still uses this product. My only complaint is that the incline could be a little steeper. I also like this product b/c I often place him to sleep on his side and the \\"bumpers\\" hold him nice and secure. I know..I know..BACK TO SLEEP but when your child has Reflux you will do what it takes to ease his pain! But the bumpers give me peace-of-mind that he will not roll over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only good for a week and not great then!","review":"I am not too impressed with this product. It was okay for the first week, but then my son started to slide up or down and would not even be on it by the time he woke up, which defeated the purpose. The sides do not attach very well to begin with and definitely are not helpful if the baby scoots during sleep. Another problem is with washing it. It is very hard to get the cover back on once you take it off. It is like it doesn't fit properly. My son is 5 weeks old and I stopped using this 3 1/2 weeks ago. Don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Used for 2 weeks","review":"Don't bother buying this \\"pillow!\\" I used with our son for no more than 2 weeks! After about 10 days he had figured out how to scoot down so his face was where his body should be. This made me nervous because of fear of SIDS with those pillow things. A few days later he started scooting himself up the pillow so his head was off the top. Totally useless! Also, the cover shrunk dramatically when I washed it before using it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby Slides Down","review":"We bought this wedge because we needed to elevate our 3 week old baby's head and make sure that she stayed on her side. At this early age, she managed to wiggle down and get her arms pinned above her head. We tried a couple of times to get it to work, but she woke up crying each time with her arms stuck.

Two problems: 1. He was once napping in the middle of his crib on this and his head when over the edge as he must have scooted upward. (from then on I made sure to place the head side against the bumper) 2. After he was a few weeks old he would squirm down it and I was uncomfortable with his head being between the cushions. I have since found it easier to place a pillow under the crib mattress to raise the head side up a little. A regular bed pillow works good as it is the same length as the width of the crib mattress. His head is now elevated and if he moves around there are no obstructions. He is also still sleeping on a firm surface, which is safer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"We had this for our son.

Baby can work his way off the wedge!","review":"I work with a lot of newborns in private homes, and have used this positioner quite a few times. I now refuse to work with it. I have seen many babies work their way UP the wedge, and then their head falls off the top of it. This seems very dangerous (if not uncomforatble) to me! If you want a wedge because of tummy troubles, reflux, etc. get a wedge that goes under the mattress or under the sheet, or better yet, just put a thick pillow under the mattress."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy","review":"My newborn could not stay positioned properly on this.

But, after the very first time in the washing machine, the foam insert began to crumble into pieces. Also, it is very hard to reassemble after washing/drying. Then, the second time through (the wash) caused a big hole in the middle of the positioner. It looked like someone took a huge bite, not to mention all of the foam I had to clean out of my washing machine. I would definitely not buy this item, and am going to look for more sturdy positioners."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it safe?","review":"I'm somewhat scared of this products safety.

The SIDS alliance tells new moms that there is to be nothing in the crib with the baby AT ALL, no blankets, stuffed animals, nothing. These have pillows that have BEEN KNOWN to become detached and create suffocation hazards. The industry loves new moms because they can market so much useless (and in this case dangerous) crap using the fear tactic and make oh so much money doing it. Don't buy into it.My nurse has been at this for a very long time and works closely with the SIDS alliance and told me that there is no reason for a healthy baby to use one of these but one big reason not to, IT CAN KILL YOUR CHILD.

The wedge is much too soft. A soft matress or putting the baby near blankets or pillows is supposed to be a suffocation risk. Well, based on that advice, this product did not feel safe to me. I washed it when I brought it home, and the seam fell apart. I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Night's Sleep","review":"This product is helpful for a few reasons, it definitely helps keep my baby from spitting up at night, he seems to have some morning sinus issue and the inclined position is better than his lying flat, and most importantly, when we first brought our son home, we couldn't put him down to sleep unless he was swaddled, this cushion is so cozy, with the side wedges in, he feels like he's still swaddled. He did slide down, but he was on his back and waking up every three hours, so it wasn't an issue, I fixed it by wrapping a receiving blanket around the entire cushion, so now it's warm as well as cozy and he doesn't slide. This doesn't appear to be a suffocation risk because I tucked the blanket under the cushion and his weight keeps it in place. He's seven weeks old now and sleeping well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great for us!

I moved him up the wedge again and moved the sides down lower on the wedge (thinking this would help somehow...) When I checked him again, his head was hanging over the side of the wedge. At that point, I removed the wedge completely and will never try it again.

At that point, it became too dangerous to use because it could smother him if it flipped on top of him. I tried to use it one more time when he seemed congested, but he screamed when I put him down on it & immediately tried to wiggle himself off of it.

I figured I would save money since I was planning on buying both things anyway for my son. Well, from the very beginning, he would slide down and end up off of the product. He did this every night. Finally, by the time he was two months it was in his closet. Obviously, since he was able to scoot himself down, the positioner did not keep him in place.

Until this age she was fine with it...but by 3 weeks...she was wiggling and moving too much to use the pillow part. I am thankful that nothing happened to her when she sild down the pillow.

Perhaps other babies do better with this thing, but my daughter had a will and mind of her own since day 1, and she absolutely hated being constrained in any way. She did not like being swaddled, and would always try to free her arms and legs. It was frustrating. My advise to new moms would be: don't put this item on your baby registry or your wish list before your baby is born. Wait and see how he/she does with swaddling. Also, it is important to remember, tiny babies CANNOT turn and so naturally will sleep only on their backs.

My son rolled right off after the velcro became dislodged. We found our son with his head buried in the side of the positioner/The cover does not wash well.

This item is essential for babies who have reflux since it keeps their head elevated to help them sleep better through the night. I gave it 4 stars because like the other mom shared, my baby does slide down but I have never found him face down or in a position that he might suffocate.

It is really soft and the velcro sides are adjustable."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have used this item since my baby came home","review":"I like this item. When I brought Maggie home we swaddled her and put the sides snuggled up against her. She quickly started moving and constantly kicked off her blanket. After 8 weeks we put her in her crib and I separated the sides a little further and tucked a blanket around it - using hospital corners - This stopped her from squirming down. We have used it every night - for the past 11 weeks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plan on using for a REAL SHORT time","review":"This was fine for the first couple weeks, then I realized that it actually didn't do much help. Sometimes it would slide up or down and just wasn't long enough for him (and my guy is a short guy!). I then just used the trick that they did in the hospital and rolled up a couple of baby blankets and placed one on each side of him. Worked perfect!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby slid down the slope","review":"We used this product several times in our pack n play. Thankfully, we only used it during our baby's daytime naps because we were able to monitir him carefully. He actually would slide down the slope and end up with his face in the wedges. After the third attempt with this product, we discarded it and used the first years product instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Squirmy Babies...","review":"In theory, I thought that this was a good buy since it would keep the baby on her back when sleeping. I tried this the first night my daughter slept in her bassinet. I had her feet positioned at the bottom and moved the side support wedges so that they were around her waist. A few hours later, she was wailing uncontrollably; when I went in to check on her, she had wiggled up so far that her head was over the top wedge therefore painfully extending her neck. I removed this from her bassinet immediately and will not use it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful product!!","review":"I loved this item. I've used it since the day I brought my son home. It was very helpful in co-sleeping as well because of the wedge sides. My only complaint is that he tends to slide down, but he is a wiggler so I dont really blame the product. To remedy this I bit a small blanket under is feet which stops him from sliding down! He is 5 months and I still use it. I saw one review that said it raised the risk of SIDS...but it actually is recommended to REDUCE the risk of SIDS, which is the main reason I bought it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty helpful for newborn","review":"My mother in-law got this incliner for us since I refuse the use of pillows and blankets while my son is sleeping. I was reluctant at first, but I gave it a try anyways. I was impressed with the product coz it helped my son snoozed better. It prevented him to roll over to his tummy. It even helped him breathe better when he caught a bad colds because his head was slightly reclined higher than his chest. I guess it helped open up his airway. It gave me less worries too about SIDS. I'm pretty glad this recliner was ever invented. My son & I love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"1st Time Mom","review":"I am so surprised that this product received rave reviews. The wedge is much too soft, it offered no incline or support for my 6.5lb son. I washed the cover once, and it pilled instantly and never fit over the foam right, so I tossed the wedge part. I gave the product 2 stars because I've been using the triangular sleep positioners. While the velcro on the positioners never stuck well to the wedge, they attach quite nicely to the terrycloth sheet savers that I use. 6 months later, and I'm still using the sleep positioners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game","review":"I have a ps2 and play this game ALL the time.

Since it will work for what I wanted, I'll use it rather than going to the hassle of returning it for a different one.

For the 50 minutes you devote to the DVD so much more could have been done in terms of different kinds of poses. I eventually just kept the DVD playing because I liked the sound of it and did my own yoga poses. It's pretty much just a flow in and out of childs poses to downward dog with a couple of standing poses thrown in. The intro section did feel good however, as it had a nice dance like stretch to it. Overall, I don't recommend it to anyone other than serious beginners who want the same repetition throughout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the express workout","review":"As other reviewers have mentioned the longer workout is pretty slow and not much of a cardio workout at all.

Still was not close to a tough yoga workout, but MUCH improved and she kept her silly phrases to a minimum. The bonus stretch was okay. I can do these 2 bonus features infrequently.Due to her EXTREME cheesiness and turtle-moving-rate for the main workout, I will NEVER buy any products with Patricia Moreno."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stick with the short workout to really feel the burn","review":"I love Patricia's enthusiasm, she really keeps me going even when I'm feeling the burn.

It made me feel much more secure, and I could nurse her without waking her up. I also used it to keep her on her side because she would sometimes spit up in her sleep and I didn't want her to choke. The foam wedges have velcro so you can space them at the distance you want, which is a great feature. The enclosed pad breathes easily, but when her diaper leaked the pee went right through it onto our sheets (leaks tend to happen when you put baby on her side). So I took the foam wedges and stuck them onto an absorbent waterproof pad at night, and it works great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Moves with the baby","review":"I bought two sleep positioners, one for my daughter's crib and one for her pack 'n play.

I registered for this anyway and was really happy that I did. It gave me peace of mind at night that my daughters would not roll over on their stomachs when sleeping on their sides. (I also put them on their sides to sleep as this was how they were positioned in the hospital). I even bought two more to keep at my parents' house for overnight visits. It is a relatively inexpensive item and although it might not be a necessity, I would recommend it to any new mom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't nap without it!!","review":"We love this item. As a new parent, you're constantly trudging back and forth into the nursery to check whether your baby's sleeping ok. After a few hundred return trips, we realized that the Rest Assured kept our baby from rolling onto her tummy and kept her reasonably comfortable.The peace of mind is well worth it.P.S. Our pediatrician told us to keep the baby's mattress propped up to prevent colic and the slick bottom of the Rest Assured can occasionally make for a \\"baby slolem.\\" We had to buy some non-skid matting to put underneath to keep the baby from her nightly ski. Just something to keep it in mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"We Love It!!!","review":"We brought our baby home from the hospital at 5lbs 4oz. He was use to sleeping in a slanted craddle at the hospital, and he transitioned well with this product. We have a different brand that is flat with the adjustable sides but we prefer this one.

I was taught to put my child down ALWAYS ON HER BACK with nothing else in her crib, bassinett, etc. The manufacturer of this product also states this in their description of what the product is for. You want your baby to be able to turn over by him/her self as part of natural development. This is the point when they could be safely tucked in with maybe a blanket. Please check with your pediatrician for the safest position for your baby to sleep in. I am positive he/she will tell you on the back, until they can turn themselves over.

The truth is that you will probably not need it. Babies naturally sleep on their backs if placed that way. I was given this as a gift when I was in the hospital and when my doctor saw the box he suggested that I return it.

My son was squirmy enough from the beginning that he managed to slither out of this after a week or two. He would be half out of the top after an hour or so. It just didn't keep him in place and I was afraid with him moving around so much anyway, it may actually be dangerous.Also, (he was a June baby) the polyester type material made him very sweaty, which contributed further to multiple nightime awakenings. I kept thinking he had leaked out of his diaper before I realized his sides were sweaty from this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better in theory than in practice","review":"I registered for this sleep positioner and got it at my shower! As soon as I brought my son home from the hospital I was using it to ensure that he was sleeping safely! However, within a day or two he figured out how to slide himself down the mat so he ended up with his butt at the very bottom and often with his head between the two side pieces which terrified me! He was 8 lbs at birth and I never felt that I could get the sides tight enough to actually hold him secure. Now my son is suffering from acid reflux and I need to keep his head elevated when he sleeps. I have given up on the side pieces all together and I use the mat alone althought he still ends up at the bottom in a crunched up position anyway. This item may be great for a nice docile baby that does not move in his/her sleep but I don't think it is workable for a baby with any tendency to move or fuss in the night!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Never cured.","review":"This product is terrible.

One thing about this one is it is too easy. If you get the right runes (RAGE, MOTHER EARTH, CYCLONE, BLUE MOON) You can really lay waste to everything and anything including the end boss. Thank goodness there are no Neclord puzzles in this one my hair has finally began to grow back from the first Suikoden. This is a good RPG for the money. I think I spent about 60 hours on it, a good deal of that time was leveling up weapons, characters and acquiring cash. This RPG delivers classic gameplay and is right on with the first game.

The plot is by no means dry. Music is appropriate during cut scenes. The anime portraits are beautifully drawn. Should you allow yourself, this game can definitely move you to tears, laughter, and, of course, anger. You'll find yourself attached to certain characters within the 108 stars of destiny because they all have unique personalities. And yes, there are minigames, as well as plenty of \\"hidden\\" characters/items.Those of you who have been exposed to the current generation graphics might have to readjust slightly-keep in mind this game is great by playstation 1 standards.

This one will keep you up for awhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Game did not work","review":"After recieving the game I couldnt wait to replay this old game and once putting it in my ps2 it would not load a total waste of my money. I am so glad I did not spend the $200."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you haven't played the first one buy it otherwise...","review":"Great game but a complete copy of the first one(which isn't a bad thing). I wish the graphics could have been improved on a little bit being that they are carbon copy of the first one (which didn't have great graphics either) 108 character makes for a lot of fun although it happens to be the exact number of characters in the first one. Also the more characters you get the bigger you base gets (just like in the first one). This game is a good game. A 8.0 out of 10.0. This game is not anywhere close to a 10!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A lil over $100 not so bad!","review":"If your wondering why this game is so expensive! it's because they only released so many copies not expecting it to do so well in America. With that being said it is the best game in the series its just sad that if you owned it once before like myself and sold it, and now are looking to buy it again to replay it, well your S.O.L. but then again A lil over $100 with original case and book isn't bad due to how rare the game is!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great way to do a sequel!","review":"I enjoyed this game as much as the first. The fact that this is actually a continuation of the story instead of an entirely new one is a plus. If you completed the first game with a perfect ending, you can use your saved data in this game. This is a feature not used with other RPGs & I think it's a wonderful idea. The characters are very indepth & characters that have returned from the first game actually have the same background. Playing this game was like playing an interactive movie with a plot & well made battle system. It has lower graphics than most new RPGs, but that really does not take away from the overall gameplay. I would definately suggest trying this game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid RPG","review":"Fans of the series will tell you its worth the money it's going for but I think if you missed Suikoden II, you missed it. Suikoden 3 is better afterall. Even the reviewers will tell you. I'm not saying this is a bad game, it was actualy a very good one, but it's not worth shelling out 150 dollars for."},{"rating":"2","title":"A worthy sequel","review":"Just like the first Suikoden, what I like best is the variety this game offers. I don't get tired of using the same characters all the time, and although its true that with some many characters in one game, they become rather shallow. But Suikoden II try to make up for that, with sub quests and the ability to gain people's secrets, you get to know each character fairly well. Story is good, and the 2D graphics isn't bad either, make it a pretty good RPG package, pick it up when you have the chance. Overall score, 88 out of 100."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suikoden II Rocks!","review":"All I can say about this game is that it is part of one the best RPG Series I have ever played. I think one of the things that makes it great is the fact that you can import your data form the first suikoden for some real cool features. You can get new characters, also you can recruit your character from the first game. Alot of work has bene put in to make the game flow from story to story instead of how final fantasy works it. You stay in the same world, guiding history of this world. And with the release of Suikoden III which does let you import your Suikoden II Data, It makes it even more fun. I must go and buy Suikoden III now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Fun RPG","review":"Suikoden II ties as my favorite RPG. While it is not the most challenging game, it is a fun quest to take. The \\"Hero\\" is taken through his boyhood into maturity as he learns about the closeness of his family and the deceit of friendship. A cast of 108 playable characters and side quests, plus a large map and a buildable castle, this RPG kicks linear games in the (...). The graphics are anime influenced, and in my opinion very cute. Magic spells, cooking reciepies (and a sort of \\"iron chef\\" mini game), sculpting, baths, painting, teleporting, and tons of other little quirks to get your hooked into the world of Suikoden. I recomend this game to any RPG'er, new or old, as it will be fun for all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Candles on Bay Street","review":"Enjoyed this show, like the interaction between the three main characters.Henry P.

Every time we view it we find more to laugh at -- AND more that's almost frighteningly plausible in today's political climate. Fortunately, the intelligent humor keeps it from being too serious, but...it does give pause for thought. Most of all though, it's just a thoroughly enjoyable film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh out loud comedy","review":"I am a political junkie so I bought this movie before I even saw it and I was not disapointed. It is hilarious from beginning to end. It focuses on an unlikely friendship of two ex-presidents, one being a staunch republican, the other being a staunch democrat. It is definitely worth the purchase for anyone who enjoys comedies, as well as political comedies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fun...","review":"Respectfully, Tom Keogh has his opinion/review - I simply don't believe he knows what he's talking about here. Lemmon and Garner do a great job - solid supporting cast. I'm happy to find and buy this; too much garbage is ready to be sold once it's box office run is completed. This movie is memorable and enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Our dreams are our children.\\"","review":"The story covers several years and three presidencies. First Lemmon, then Garner and now Aykroid. Vice President Ted Matthews (John Heard) is a dunce. Turns out rumors of a scandal are surfacing and the now president is having thoughts of pining the scandal on Lemmon who was president at the time. Joe Hollis (Wilford Brimley) the head of the opposition party wants to pin it on the present administration. Col. Paul Tanner will protect the secret at any cost. There are many more players, too numerous to mention. Seems that someone has determined that Lemmon and Garner are best dispatched.Will this happen?Can they clear their names?And not just who is behind the plot, but what is the plot?Watch out for Blinky.This movie has a sound mystery base to get us through the twists and turns with lots of \\"who's behind it\\" moments. However the interaction between Garner and Lemmon is so much fun that sometimes we forget the plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Funny Movie James Garner And Jack Lemmon are awesome","review":"I love this movie and every thing about it it is about two ex-presidents who are accused of taking a kickback. It stars Jack Lemmon and James Garner there performances are very charming and very very funny. Even Laurn Bacall has some funny lines even though she is not in it much. I wish that Bacall was in it a little longer. Really what i think makes this movie works are the performances from Garner and Lemmon they work off each other and are very funny together."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Fellow Americans","review":"Have not actually watched it yet, thought it would be a good addition to previously movies that I purchased that were political but funny"},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT...an intelligent comedy for a change","review":"An extremely hilarious story of two former presidents played by Garner and Lemmon.

Two very veteran actors in James Garner and Jack Lemmon with an excellent supporting cast. Movie touches on several current day issues, and while movie is very humorous, it attacks these issues in a united front. Something our Congress needs to learn how to do today.

Maybe this writer should have done a little checking on his own, before letting it be published.Poor judgement for a person with a degree from an Ivy!So many new places that had been in business for more than two years before this book was sent to print, Why I ask the writer did you not publish this book before you where in Panama last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lackluster Mob Tale","review":"A straight up biography of \\"Crazy Joe\\" Gallo, who led a bloody revolt against Brooklyn mob boss Joseph Profaci in 1960 and then, a decade later, Profaci's successor Joseph Colombo. Nothing new or groundbreaking here. The author basically recounts Gallo's criminal career, the years he spent in various New York State prisons, and his murder in a Little Italy, Manhattan, seafood restaurant in retaliation for the attempted assassination of Colombo at an Italian-American Unity Day rally ten months earlier. (Colombo remained in a vegetative state and eventually succumbed to his wounds in 1978).

The TV band coverage only goes to channel 13, so you're limited there. If you can get the \\"wire\\" antenna positioned well, the reception is decent...as decent as you can get from a \\"dial\\" tuner rather than a digital tuner. The weather band comes in nicely and has helped me out a number of times from being drenched from an afternoon rainstorm by listening to the forecast.Once again, overall nice, with many quirks, but as an alarm clock it does its job. Yes the dials, buttons, dial positions, and sound could be improved.Here's the deal: If you can get this cheap...say for under 15 dollars, then in my opinion, the cost to value ratio is in your favor. You get a radio, alarm clock, tv sound, and weather for your money. Not bad.

While very unlike Barbara Hambly's other books, each one of which I have loved, this book shines out as a more lighthearted version of the same gripping plot, deep characters, cohesive world view, and some creeping horror that must be fought, if only they can figure out how in time.

Set in 1923 in a nascent Hollywood, Hambly has presented the hectic life of early movie people, and mixed it all up with an ancient evil Manchurian Rat God, and Chinatown in Los Angelas. Her totally charming heroine, \\"Chrysande Flamande\\", with 3 little pekinese dogs, which are also Fu dogs, born to fight demons is at the center of this great story. But there is also the dignified, sholarly brown haired Norah, and her new love, Alec, the short and stocky cinematography.

This book evokes the images of great black and white adventure movies with heroines slinking through in elegant floor length gowns and no gentleman went out with out a hat. Even though the story is from her superb imagination, she has taken incredible pains with the accuracy of the setting. Living in the great megalopolis of Los Angeles/Orange County, we often forget that once there were tremendous open spaces, that we wouldn't be living here if not for the film industry. How skillfully Ms. Hambly gives us a history lesson about what is under our very feet and enthralls us with a great story at the same time.

There is no way I could have this container where my dog or ants could get to it because my dog could just tip it over and the ants can walk right in.

They had some beautiful cues and themes that are still wonderful that they don't even bother to play anymore and that is such a waste.

This CD, however, is terribly disappointing because the majority (like all but one) of the selections are newer music cues from the mid to late 90's that all sound quite similar. The don't have the familiarity and distinction of the classic music cues I was so hoping would be included. VERY DISAPPOINTING!"},{"rating":"1","title":"long awaited disappointment","review":"Like the above- I eagerly broke open the CD so I could hear all those tear jerking, beautiful songs from the 70's ,80's and EARLY 90's only to find they weren't on the CD. I can't believe that the very moving theme they always played in a touching moment with Victor and Nikki isn't on this CD...it was one of the main reasons I bought it. Y & R owes it to us long time fans to offer the earlier years music.

From this I can say that David Fisher's account of Maskelyne's wartime achievements is a novelist's fabrication -- as history and biography it is rubbish. There is an interesting story to be told, but you will not find it in the pages of The War Magician."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unpalatable","review":"Being a magician currently in the military, I bought this book with great excitement. I had expected the author to create a fictional world around basic historic facts, so the point made by other reviews about the book not being true did not effect me one way or the other. However, the book soon lost my interest. The authors writing style is very awkward. It is neither matter of fact non-fiction, nor compelling fiction. He has chosen a writing style somewhere in-between the two, and it did not work for me. A great \\"true\\" story with great \\"real-life\\" characters but poorly presented.

In fact the book is an invention, not remotely based on fact, and instead is an attempt to gull the credulous and make money in the process without the slightest concern for the truth of history. I have examined the records at the National Archives at Kew in London, where nothing supports Fisher's story; nor do the records at the Imperial War Museum. For that matter, the word in magic circles here in Britain is that David Fisher's book is so bad, his film treatment so feeble, that Peter Weir, who was asked to direct the film of the book for Paramount, has refused to do so, and the project has been dropped. That is how bad David Fisher's The War Magician is. It is junk for the gullible and feeble minded; it is a travesty of history. It is a lie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Interesting","review":"Whether you are a magician or not, you'll love this book.

Even his alleged involvement in the deception plan at El Alamein is open to question.David Fisher has produced a mercenary work of dubious historical value. Readers are welcome to contact me for the alternative version. ...."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent look at not only the SP, but of the CA Coast","review":"I acquired this book because of the UP merger of the SP. I wanted to have a memory of the trains that used to roll by home every day of my youth. This book did exactly that.The book covers every Coast Line station (active and inactive) from Los Angeles to San Francisco/Oakland. If you can remember the Scarlet and Gray then this book is for you. However, the best part of this book doesn't just stop with the trains.Reading this book will give you a perspective on the California Coast and the Salinas Valley. Reading this book will help you see why the CA Coast developed the way it did.Just as the book says, nothing quite says California like the image of a Daylight train rolling along the Pacific Coast through Gaviota.If you can remember a time when the CA dream existed and when the land from SF to LA was only braved by a train, then you should buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disney MP3 Player","review":"This was by far the worst MP3 player I've ever purchased.

Fortunately, they gave me a complete refund. The instruction booklet is useless, the software doesn't auto load, and the only \\"Cars\\" logos are little stickers which will fall off.

When you hook it off it is on and works. But as soon as you turn the power off and would like to put in on, it doesn't work.Maybe I do something wrong, charging the unit or it really is just not worth to buy it.Maybe somebody who reads it and owns it aswell can help me on that?If you dont own it, buy a cheap ipod for your kid!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"User UN-friendly","review":"I purchased this device for my son only for it to be taken by my husband who decided he wanted an MP3 player of his own and thought he would use it until he got the one he wanted.

Kodak forces you into using their software as it's the only way to get the pictures out of the camera unless you use a drive for your SD card. Once inside the software, you can't rename picture files or save them to another folder. Neither can you select a group of pictures and copy or drag and drop them to another program. You can't even see the name of the picture file unless go to properties and then parse it out of an unfriendly name. The software was made to lock you into using ofoto to share/print your pictures. This software is extremely basic and suitable only for the beginning digital photo user or someone who only wants to print with the Kodak Camera dock. If you want to do anything more complex, buy another brand that doesn't lock you into their software."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd never buy another Kodak camera!","review":"I bought a Kodak digital camera and it has been fine. However, knowing what I know now I would never buy another Kodak camera. Ever. I dropped the camera, and a little plastic piece broke off which keeps the battery pack in the camera. Not a big deal. But NOONE repairs Kodak cameras. Instead you HAVE to send it into their corporate repair center and they instead sell you on trading it in for a refurbished camera. So, I can send this one in and for $250 get a new refurbished camera. Whooppe! But it only sells for $50 more on amazon.com - and thats a new, non-refurbished one! Its a total crock. Just be forwarned. I'd never buy a camera which I cant get repaired locally."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kodak has terrible customer service","review":"I bought a high end Kodak camera a little over a year ago. The shutter ended up getting stuck and not opening. I called in to get this resolved and they charged me 1/2 the price of a new camera to get the shutter fixed. I went as far as to talk to a supervisor who explained that Kodak digital cameras were not designed to last over 5 years. I was in shock. She said that there were too many little pieces that could break (the shutter???) and they weren't meant to last like a regular camera. I would highly recommend stearing away from Kodak. The shutter not working sounds like a defect. Highly disappointing for a big name like Kodak."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great camera, but a little bulky because of the zoom lens.","review":"Pretty much every thing has been said on this camera in the older reviews. My recommendation is simple:If you want a camera that has great zoom capabilities, a big LCD and want to stay under $500.00, you'll be more than happy with this camera. If you don't care for those features, go with something that's smaller. (The 10x zoom lens is the reason that this camera is bulkier than other cameras with less zoom. I believe that, for the ammount of zoom, it is still incredibly small. But once again, if this isn't important to you, you'd probably be happier with a camera that is smaller and a little more portable.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and predictable","review":"Edward James Olmos is a great actor.

I'm not a huge fan of racing games. I like Burnout Legends because it can be played in short chunks or hours at a time. It has easy to understand goals. The goals are also varied. You can break track records for time, most destroyed cars, types of impact, etc. Best of all, there are lots of different tracks AND race types so, for me anyhoo, boredom hasn't been an issues.My only gripe is a small one. In 2008, the graphics look a bit dated and low-fi. I think that sometimes small objects on a fast track can be difficult to see."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow","review":"this is quite possibly the best video game out.... nice graphics, easy to understand, and fun.

My big complaint against the game is the fact it's basically a port of Burnout 3: Takedown(PS2,Xbox) with the soundtrack of Burnout Revenge(Xbox 360, Xbox, PS2). Other than that it's a solid handheld racer that's easy to pick up and play and it still is an exhilarating and destructive racing game that never gets old. This is one of the best handheld games you can purchase and is well worth the money. This is the perfect game to play on some kind of vacation as well. So if you think you need something new to play on your PSP, this is your game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just a great PSP game, a great game period!","review":"This is by far one of the best games I've played for PSP, I also have played the Burnout titles for the PS2 and PS3, and this handheld version stacks up pretty well with the console versions.

It's the same formula as in the previous Burnout titles: you basically crash into other vehicles and try to inflict as much damage and mayhem as you can.Unfortunately, that's about it. It's fun and exciting enough for me to give it four stars, but I believe this is really a rental title. If you buy it, you are wasting your money. The fun and excitement wane quickly and the gameplay grows old fast. For me, after a couple days of knocking out other vehicles and setting off chaos, I had had enough. There's actually a wealth of \\"missions\\" included, but they are all similar to one another, so for me, the allure of completing them all simply wasn't a big draw.In summary, a really fun game for driving game lovers looking for a little action on the PSP, but it's just a rental title."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating topic, fair writing, tragic ending","review":"If you like French haute cuisine, this book will give you a lot of insights into how it's created -- not how it's cooked, but the amazing amount of work by a large group of people to produce and serve it.

What happened to the strategy, deep levels, and intense action from \\"Seeds of Evil\\"? Turok 3 is a HUGE letdown! The levels are too short, the story line, characters and weapons are unimpressive. Shouldn't game sequels evolve and be better than the ones that came before? Well, this one simply isn't.

But instead of trying to top it, which makes most companies succesful with a video game franchise like turok, it looks like acclaim thought using the same trick twice would do it, unfortunatley thats not the case. the boss fights were awful and didnt make any sense. The weapons were the same as turok 2 with a few upgrades, most of wich are useless and uncreative. The graphics were excellent for this games time though. Theres more but i cant name them all.

The enemy stands there and shoots at you.Unlike its previous game, where the Dinosoids would hide behind crates and throw grenades, or self distruct, ect.The guns are like worse versions of T2s guns. The only gun I like is the hardest gun to get.The story line is bland. Nothing really happens. It has nothing to do with all the othe turok games. All of a sudden, things just happen.Over all, it seems the game had a lack of intrest when they made it. Notice Iguana(who made the other two turok games) didnt make this one.

Rosa's Booty-licious is by far my favorite track. How she can come up with new and inventive ways to mangle the English language, yet still make this song sing-able (I defy you not to start singing with her when she urges you to 'Work that Jelly!') is a testament to comedic genius! Jaime's 'All By Myself' is also haunting in it's ear screeching wretchedness, but you can't help but chuckle when she adds 'Here We Go' before belting out a seriously wrong note!Buy it for comedy.

Three DVDs, Bowfinger is on its own disc with extras. Two films per disc for the other four films, no extras except a trailer on Dead Men. The transfers look pretty good, Bowfinger and Dead Men look the best. Of the five, only Bowfinger and Parenthood have 5.1 audio, rest are stereo.

Otherwise, it is very adequate and I am happy with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"great mower","review":"All I have to say is that this was very easy to assembly, I don't know why some people found it difficult.

Mower is exactly what I was looking for as I need to carry a mower up steps to several different levels of lawn. At 8amps power some grasses may be a problem. The thicker heavier grasses may really slow this down. It would be better with a more powerful motor which would create more weight. The rear mower flap needs to be removed as it always flips the mower up when you pull the mower back.

The mower would not roll easily over rough places in the yard, would not cut high grass without bogging down & shutting off.

The mower might work well for trimming where grass is short & ground is very flat but is too light weight for anything more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and weak","review":"This mower is useless if you have more that 3 inches of grass.

I couldn't mow more than 1 foot without the blade stopping and I have a really small yard. And unless you have the perfect tools, adjusting the blade is extremely difficult. I guess there is a reason why they don't have this model on stock at the nearest Home Improvement stores. I returned it. The only good thing is that I got a good cardio workout. It is actually lightweight to move on level surfaces, but on the grass (8' X 8') it took me an hour and 1/2 to mow the yard. And now my yard looks really patchy, like allopecia, because I had to use the weed eater to help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Handle Breaks","review":"The handle and wheels are very poorly built.

We use outlook express, not outlook so that is part of the problem. The sales people at the store were no help and did not tell me any of the limitations of this product. The price was what sold me. When I got on the web site I discovered that only more expensive models will allow a conversion to outlook express. With hotsync never working correctly, we never transfered data. OUR MISTAKE!!! The stupid thing resets itself. We lost over 200 addresses, most of them for my husbands' business. Called tech support. Only have a 90 day warrenty, give me a break. Will cost 25 dollars for the phone call and 75 to repair. Now I have paid for it twice. And that is if I understood their broken English correctly! Don't buy this product.

It did not have a 5-way directional pad. Certain games didn't work with it because it only had 2 buttons. Planning things was quite a task with the tiny screen and sub-par handwriting recognition, so I ended up not using the calendar more often that not.One thing that I did enjoy using it for was catching up on tech headlines with AvantGo.However, seeing as there are ridiculous holiday sales going on, I may upgrade to the Zire 31. I do find humor in the fact that whoever stole my Zire 21 is probably kicking themselves in frustration right now :-)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great choice! what else can you ask for at that price?","review":"I have had my ZIre for a couple of months. It has done nothing but help me coordinate my outlook calendar, task list and contacts. It keeps my information at my fingertips and is very easy to work with. I found no problems with this handheld, it has never lost my data as previously reported. Of course I would love to have a tungsten but face it, its not gonna happen at this price. This is a great choice for a first handheld. It looks fun and looks very impressive I am told when kept in the Zire series hardcase which is not included but can run you 10-15 bucks.

It will not work with any 64 bit system. You cannot back up data on your computer due to this. Also you cannot enter data into your computer and transfer it to the PDA. It is very difficult to enter data into the Palm directly. It takes forever and many times the letter or number you put the pointer on is not the letter that comes up. The matrix is too innacurate to work with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Piece of Junk !!!","review":"I was prepared to deal with limited memory and the unlit screen. What I wasn't prepared for is the fact that every time I start this thing now it jumps back to Jan. 2003. Every fourth time (or thereabouts) it loses all data and requires a reset (screen centering, date, time, etc.)and then a hot sync to reinstall all of the lost data. Now after six months it when it hot syncs it won't add any new appointments.I bought this because it was inexpensive and I wanted to see if I would get enough use out of a PDA without spending $400 and having it collect dust.I found out three things.1. I think PDAs are a fine idea and I will use one a great deal.2. You get what you pay for and the Palm Zire 21 and Palm's quality and customer service are truly unimpressive (90 day warranty then $25 per call for service and no useful information on their web site)3. I will buy another more sophistcicated PDA from one of their competitors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Performs random HARD resets","review":"Luckily, I got my zire 21 free with a Dell computer (which made me wonder why Dell was handing out a competing PDA for free).Turns out the Zire 21 does RANDOM HARD RESETS randomly when encountering certain cell phones, making it nearly impossible to use. If you didn't already know, hard resets are ones that delete ALL your data. Palm advises users to keep their cell phones and palms separated, but given the pocket space in my pants, that's almost always impossible.Just try asking any department store about Zire 21 returns, and they can confirm this. Email/call customer support and ask them about the Zire 21 and cell phone resets and they will reluctantly confirm this as well.

For me it has been a good pda and hasnt had the problem of resetting near cell phones. To tell you the truth, at this very moment it is 6 inches away from one right now and its still working fine. So for whoever had this problem, I think its just bad luck. But in the past I have had to reset it myself because it would freeze up when I put certain games on it. So overall I think it was good and I didn't like the fact that there was no backlight.

By March it crashed. I had to recalibrate and reload it. Crashed again, and again, and again. Palm support says it does this because of proximity with a cell phone. So, \\"To avoid this occurrence, keep the handheld and mobile phone separated.\\" - I guess that means I should carry two purses, one for my phone and one for the palm! It can be a new fashion trend.First, to release and market a device that cannot tolerate cell phones in a world dominated by cell phones is just stupid. Second, to not offer a firmware upgrade or credit to upgrade to one of their own products is also unwise. Who runs this company? At least if they did that, they might keep some customers.My advice: keep shopping. It might be cheap, but you get what you pay for.

I did not put it to use at that time because the screen is hard to read... and my Palm XIIIE was working perfectly. Recently, I bought a new computer which did not have a LPT ports so I decided to use the Zire which synchronizes via USB. The big problem is that it is uncompatible with my cell phone. If my cell phone rings all data in the handheld is lost. According to Palm Support they should not be close to each other, not easy being a female who carries both products in the same bag.

Dude walks like he's in quicksand so you have to run everywhere. The enemy lock-on is ok, but the camera often spins around so a wall pops up to block your view.

I thought the notorious 'Obstacle course' of Indiana Jones- Emperor's tomb was most difficult (took me atleast 125 tries) but the 'Pits and Falls' level of Dragon's lair has taken the cake. 140 times and still counting.

I couldn't even eject the dvd from the unit OR from the remote control. I turned it off and on back on about 5 times and finally got it working. I got the dvd out, put another in (just in case it was the dvd) and tried it out again. It didn't work.

Christy also comes to the Texas Association of Health, Physical Education, Recreation, and Dance Convention each year and attracts a huge crowd that is eager to learn her old favorites, as well as the latest dance moves.

I tried a B&D mower before and didn't care for it's plastic construction, but these two are probably equal products. The B&D seemed little more powerful or free running. However, this mover has not really faulted me yet; the small cord routing bar is cleaver. After mowing, I will usually find a clump of grass that didn't cut well. I will keep and use this mower, it works for my moderate suburban yard, I expect it to last for several years, but I doubt I'd replace it with the same brand because the build seems a bit flimsy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product was not described well","review":"The book was not the text book i was looking for. the title was the same, but the book was not described as a workbook, which is what it was.

He's able to tell a number of stories, but he clearly lacks the intellectual curiosity to perform serious research beyond talking to his small group of \\"old China hands.\\"To get a better understanding of how much value his business advice has, it is important to understand his own China business background. Immediately after writing this book he started his own company, which flamed out miserably after a few years--and is now continuing on with him having been forced to leave. This would certainly make me wary of buying too much into advice he prescribes in the book.One of the real problems is that he takes anecdotal evidence and comes to grandiose conclusions that may or may not be valid.

I think Fisher is one of the best death metal vocalists there is, along with Jason Avery and the new vocalist for Cryptopsy, whose name eludes me. Sure, Barnes had a deeper growl, but it just isn't as menacing as Fisher's 200 mile per hour primal growls. He sounds like some kind of animal. And his high screams are incredible. His vocals fit the new CC music style better. This is my favorite CC album, I really don't care too much for them other than this, Vile, Eaten Back to Life, and Tomb is okay, if not just for Hammer Smashed Face.

When Vile came out, I didn't like it at all, and for some reason it is still my least fave Corpse album. But, Gallery was better, and Bloodthirst even better yet. His screams on \\"Unleashing the Bloodhtirsty\\" are absolutely amazing. Fisher seems to put a lot more effort into his vocals, using different articulations and timbres than Barnes ever did. I wish he had been with CC since day one. The band is, as ever, razor sharp in their technicality. The riffs here are the most complex yet for a CC release.

The album is brutally heavy and technically-driven throughout, beginning with the thunderous \\"Pounded into Dust\\" which leads into one of the sickest metal tunes ever, \\"Dead Human Collection\\". You WILL develop whiplash enduring the menace of \\"Unleashing the Bloodthirsty\\" and \\"The Spine Splitter\\".

The old Boss FV-200 on loan to me from a friend doesn't require any power source."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fails as a standard guitar volume pedal","review":"Yes, I know this is a keyboard pedal ... but ... I had used other similar pedals for keyboards as guitar pedals before and didn't have a problem, why? The short answer has something to do with the impedance and that this pedal is of a higher quality.

The reason they are not around any longer. This reflects their \\"dry\\" period. No creativity at all. Sorry, but they have done a better album. This one is Not good.

Go figure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Digital Remaster???","review":"I've been gradually replacing all of my older CDs with digital remasters, so when I purchased this Grand Funk CD, I thought I was going to get one that was whisper quiet when it was supposed to be in a song and between songs. Yea...right! If this CD is what Capitol records is trying to pawn off on the customer, then these clowns need to learn what \\"digitize\\" actually means when reissuing a studio album. I'm sitting here listening to this CD and I'm EXTREMELY dissapointed at the quailty of sound. If I had known I was going to get a professed \\"digital remaster\\" of such obvious poor quaility, I wouldn't have wasted my time, effort or money searching for and purchasing it in the first place. Hopefully, Capitol will step up its game and begin offering true digital remasters in the cataglog in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soulful and profound","review":"This is an amazing collection.

And there's a reason: because they are incoherent, poorly written and just plain stupid. The longest one is about how the Masons did everything, but it seems that there is no transition between his ideas. Two paragraphs about Masonic control of the royal throne in Englans and suddenly it changes to JFK. You reread it thinking that you missed something, but you didn't.

Every song is written and sung with 100% honesty. Some songs softer, sweeter, some more raw and rockin, this EP is the perfect way to be introduced to Howie's sound and soul. For old fans, this EP is one more showcase of Howie's truly awesome musicianship. For musicians and non-musicians alike, listening to such a genuine and unique artist with his amount of passion and creativity is simply a blessing. Though Howie is backed with a band and there isn't a whole lot of his signature looping on this EP, his talent is still highlighted and fans will still listen to these seven songs over and over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad design!","review":"I purchased this item because I am a teacher and I wanted to put a collection of literary figures on my desk. Shortly after taking the figure out of the box (literally, within minutes) a colleague was looking at it and went to raise the figure's left arm. She did not apply unnecessary pressure but the figure snapped in half. When I looked at the broken midsection, I noticed that the top and bottom were held together by less than 1/8\\" diameter semi-circle of plastic (an amount slightly larger than the largest part of a toothpick). I feel that the design could be improved greatly.

It would be expected that makita products would be better than they were 10 years ago, but they are far from it. There is no quality to this light it is a complete rip off. I had to cover the whole thing batteries and light in JB weld to try to save them. I thought the high price was for quality but I was wrong. If I could give this a lower rating than a 1 I would.

It doesn't matter if an author gives you all the techno mombo-jombo behind the software/language if they can't show you how it works in the real-world.This is where Lucene in Action shines. Every code example is not only useful, cleanly designed, but production ready. This is how a programming book should be designed: simple and straight to the point.

Unfortunately, no matter which way you set your configurations, the game remains frustrating. One of the problems is one so common in third-party Gamecube games: functions of the L&R; buttons suffer from the \\"click only\\" effect, meaning you have to press them all the way in for a response. This is apparent also in BloodRayne, NAMCO Arcade Museum, and Evolution Worlds, among other titles. I don't know why third-parties do this -- it irritates the hell out of me and I'm sure I'm not the only one.Anyway, this is one of those medieval settings on no particular planet.

The story envolves you in such way that you don't want to leave the TV. I saw an earlier version of the story but nothing compares to this one. You can't get enough of it.

What disappointed me a little was that the story is dramatically changed from the book...it's like the movie does not follow the book at all!...Most of the intrigue of the book is lost here, and that's a pity.Nonetheless, I cannot say that I didn't like the movie because I did.

In addition to Anthony Andrews skill in his various disguises, he also shows an athleticism that is lacking in the Leslie Howard version. The plot of the Jane Seymour/Anthony Andrews version is more complex than the Leslie Howard version with the addition of King Louis son.It has to be one of the most entertaining period movies around."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best version of this classic!","review":"This is a must have if you like Anne of Green Gables, The Man from Snowy River, or any of the Jane Austin's. I've seen other versions and this is by far the best. Funny and suspensful...still great after all these years. Perfect for the girls' night."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Sink me!\\" A fabulous movie!","review":"'The Scarlet Pimpernel' is the best movie in the world! I first watched this movie a couple years back when my mom rented it and forced me to watch it. Now I can't enough! Foppish Percy (Antoney Andrews),beutiful Marguerite (Jane Seymour) and horrifying Chauvelain(Sir Ian McKllenan) are funny, charming, elusive and positively perfect. It is my favorite movie of all time. I can watch it 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. I have to buy it from 'Amazon'. The \\"Pimpernel\\" rocks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Sword Fight EVER!!","review":"I can't even remember the first time I saw this movie but I have loved to dust it off and watch it again from time to time. My three teenage boys were even able to sit through it and loved the sword fight between Percy and Chauvalin (consummate bad guy, by the way).I know it has elements of other stories and not quite true to the author in fact, but in style and spirit I am sure the Baroness would stand and cheer at the result! Wish they still made movies like this but I am glad to have a copy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A CLASSIC!!","review":"We saw this movie many years ago when a friend loaned a VHS tape to us. I have checked Amazon multiple times over the years for this title, but it was never available. Recently I checked again, and to my great surprise and delight, Amazon had it on DVD. I ordered it right away, and already we have enjoyed it a couple of times. It's a totally fun movie for those who enjoy that genre of movies. It reminds me of Pride and Prejudice. There's some unexpected twists and turns, and of course, the good guys win, without all the gratuitous blood and gore found in so many movies today."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel with Anthony Andrews","review":"Riveting action, awesome costume, mystery and intrigue every minute clear to the end of the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite good","review":"This is the first Scarlet Pimpernel movie that I had ever seen. I saw it when I was younger. I liked it a lot then, and I still like it a lot. I have since read the book and watched the older Scarlet Pimpernel movie with Leslie Howard (in my opinion he plays the best Scarlet Pimpernel). I recently bought the movie and have watched it again. It is a good movie and it goes more in depth with Chauvelin, as well as life before Marguerite and Percy are wed. McKellen does a wonderful job as Chauvelin, the Marguerite and Percy are also good. The movie doesn't have any special features and the main menu is just the scene selection."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"I loved the book as a child and have enjoyed sharing this with my children. There's a good reason why this movie has been remade several times. I chose the last remake so I could share the experience in color with my family. On the same level as \\"The Three Musketeers, Count of Monte Cristo\\", this movie is a gem!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"Had this DVD for years so bought it for some friends as we had talked so much about it. One of the best classic films ever. Anthony Andrews and Jane Seymour are wonderful together and, although this film had been produced previously, I think this is the best version. Would highly recommend it. It is a film that can be watched again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best movies ever made","review":"There is only one word that can describe this movie. EXCELLENT! This is one of those movies that you sit down expecting it to be pretty good and when it is done you are left with a smile on your face. You are left with the sense that you have to watch it over and over again. Antony Andrews is fabulous in this movie and really captures the true character of Sir Percy. Jayne Seymour is charming, beautiful, and lovable. Both actors could not have created a more romantic atmosphere, which is essential to the story. Other buyers be warned, this movie will \\"knock your soxs off.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"You've gotta love it","review":"I have loved this movie for almost 20 years. This delightful script is complemented by an excellent performance by Lord of the Ring's Ian McKellan, and Anthony Andrews is charming as Sir Percy Blakeney. I have yet to see a rendering of Baroness Orczy's book(s) that I enjoy more. If you're looking for a brooding, deep literary experience, this isn't your film - but if you want to have fun and enjoy a great adventure and love story, I can't think of a better movie than \\"The Scarlet Pimpernel.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Andrews steals the show","review":"We really enjoyed this dvd. Anthony Andrews interpretation of the character the pimpernal was amusing yet authentic.The acting by others was of a high standard and we felt the story was well told.Costumes were particularly good.Some aspects of the plot were slightly implausible but these didn't detract from the overall excitement of the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST Pimpernel of all, end of story.","review":"Of all the \\"Pimpernels\\" on film, there is not ONE that measures up to the adventure, romance, comedy and drama of this one. Anthony Andrews is at his most handsome, most charming, most sexy and most stylish as Percy, and who could ever rival Jane Seymour? Ian McKellan is sexy-smarmy at Chauvelin, and all the supporting characters are more captivating than ever. Yeah, okay, so it takes off a little from the book (actually, it's two combined), but nearly 20 years after it first aired on TV, it's as fresh every time I watch it as the first time. And for the record, the final fencing match between Percy and Chauvelin still takes my breath away, even after having seen it hundreds of times!THIS IS THE ONE YOU WANT!!!! ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic, in every sense of the word!","review":"From the time I saw this movie at age 14, it has been one of my (and my entire family's & many friends) favorites--finally on DVD! Thank you to the brilliant person who thought of a DVD version. This is, by far, the best version of Baroness Orczy's classic novel (there are many, beginning with Leslie Howard's, David Nivens', etc.)It makes for a satisfying dose of historical drama, romance, adventure, sacrifice, suspense, swordplay and humor.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for your home video/DVD collection!P.S. The Scarlet Pimpernel is actually the first in a long series of novels by Baroness Orczy! If you want to add worthwhile titles to your reading list, take a look at blakeneymanor.com--you'll be in for a wonderful surprise!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming","review":"This movie is a favorite in my family as well. Anthony Andrews was a perfect actor to portray the character of Percy. The romance was sigh worthy and the presentation was wonderful. The musical score gave it a perfect added touch. I think this movie was very well done for its time, and enjoy it everytime I watch it. You know the actor is a good one when he can be annoyingly foppish, a passionate romantic, a dashing savior, a courageous swordsman, a comedian, and did I mention good-looking all in one movie. Anthony Andrew not only had to portray himself as Percy, but as all the characters that The Scarlet Pimpernel has to pose as to carry out his good deeds. Jane Seymore, of course, is a classic beauty. Again, not disappointing me as the heroine of a contagious story. I hope this movie comes out on DVD. It would be a shame not to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is the DVD worth buying?","review":"In short, NO. The show itself is WONDERFUL -- fine acting, costumes, storyline, directing etc.....but the DVD itself has NO extras. The picture quality is only marginally better than that on VHS. So if you already own the tape, you may want to consider holding off buying the DVD for the moment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too silly.","review":"I don't understand why this movie has recieved such rave reviews. I watched it and could only handle it for 30 minutes before feeling compelled to turn it off. It was way too silly and \\"over the top\\" for me. It is a great story, but this version was unbearable."},{"rating":"1","title":"God-awful, don't bother!","review":"I gave this one star by mistake. If I could give it none, I would. This is so bad, I could hardly finish it. Come to think of it, I don't think I did finish it. I had hoped it would be a nice remake of the original film, but, alas! NO SUCH LUCK! Stick to Oberon and Howard, trust me. Anthony Andrews lays it on with not just a trowel but a shovel, drawling and hamming, and Jane Seymour wasn't much to write home about either. Sigh. Only Ian McKellen was at least in the right ballpark, though I still prefer Raymond Massey in this part. Absolutely save your money, and stick with the 1934 version. Seeing this one will just pollute your memories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ummmmm, what to say?","review":"I was forced to watch this movie in my French class at school, and enjoyed it to a degree, but found Percy utterly annoying. His way of speaking enrages me. In my opinion, the actors acted poorly, either that or there was a screenplay problem. You know those movies and times when you are just emberassed for the character? How you just want to yell at them and order them to do something to end the misery of other characters as well as yourself? This is one such movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miscast","review":"Sadly, the wrong person was cast as the Scarlet Pimpernel, and it ruined the entire film for me. IMHO, Ian McKellan was more aptly suited to that role, and would have played it with pin-point accuracy. I thought the Pimpernel, as played by Anthony Andrews, was ridiculously unbelievable. He was too much of a fop to be taken seriously, and to label him as a \\"master of disguise\\" is a misnomer of vertiginous proportions. As a result, it was barely watchable. A shame, as it is certainly a wonderful story."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY IT NOW!!","review":"Great adaptation of the original novels (The Scarlet Pimpernel and Eldorado). Andrews and Seymour were wonderful in their respective roles. Sir Ian McKellan gave a fabulous performance. He is the best Chauvelin I've seen so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN!!","review":"I've never seen it with L. Howard, but I ADORE Anthony Andrews in this movie. I was thoroughly entertained and it kept me guessing what would happen next. It's a MUST for your video collection. Jane Seymour was quite good also. The bad guys you could really hate!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't miss this \\"lost classic\\"!","review":"Taped this on the old VCR when it first aired on CBS in 1982 and wore that tape down to nothing. Purchased the commercial VHS when it came out, and recently upgraded to the DVD. Can you tell I love this movie?Hard to believe a broadcast television network produced such an engaging take on this classic tale. The story has everything--romance, political intrigue, swashbuckling action. Anthony Andrews is absolutely magnificent in the title role. I don't want to reveal too much of the story since that is a large part of the fun for first-time viewers. I've recommended this to dozens of people over the years, and so far no one has been disappointed. Give it a try!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"One of the most entertaining and fantastic movies ever made! I bought this years ago when my children were very young (only available in VHS). This tape had been played over & over again & we (including my children) have introduced this wonderful film to all their friends & family over the years. Frequently we recite to each other some of the most entertaining and humorous lines...\\"Sink me\\". This is a MUST SEE movie... It includes: swashbuckling, political, history, intrigue, masquerading, history, fun, and huge laughter! Do yourself a big favor, don't miss this movie, you won't regret it I promise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Adored It!!","review":"I can't believe they stopped making this movie. Truely, what a loss. Jane Seymore (sp?) was as precious as ever, and there couldn't be a better Sir Percy than that of Anthony Andrews. The intensity of passion between these two lights the screen on flame. I am a very big fan of Baroness Orczy's works and this is my favorite reproduction."},{"rating":"2","title":"To Perfect For Words","review":"This movie is so enchanting, adventurous and other things that I can't even begin to explain! This is like my second favorite movie in the whole world and I think that all of these reviews that I have seen based on this movie, are absolutely true in that the acting was perfect, the characters superb and you've gotta say it had everything in it from humor to adventure. From love to murder! It's the best movie ever created and should be one of the movies on your movie shelf at home! When I first saw it, I had to have it, but nobody sold it! SINK ME! I am absoltely glad though now that I know where I can buy it and that it's such a cheap price! I may only be years old, but I've got my standerds and this movie fits them all! Buy it or SINK ME!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Odd's fish, m'dear! This is a must-see!","review":"Absolutely wonderful! Even my boyfriend got hooked on this film, and he's not one for movies! This \\"Scarlet Pimpernell\\" just has all the ingredients for a really great story - romance, adventure, discovery, excitement! If you're in the mood for something to sweep you away, this is the film for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice illustrations, Forget the stories!","review":"The illustrations are pretty, especially the metallic silver touch!However, the stories are [weak] and simplistic (nor all original -- the \\"Danced-Out Shoes\\" is a variation on the well-known Twelve Dancing Princesses story).The stories have a \\"silver\\" theme forced on them; the morals at the end of each story also are forced, and do not depict our values. (For instance, in the first story, we think that the first sister was right to hurry home once she realized that the old woman had stolen their money.)We love beautifully illustrated fairy and folk tales -- this one does NOT make the grade."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Southwestern recipes","review":"Reflections has some wonderfully Southwestern recipes like Southwest Black Bean and Wild Rice Salad and Green Chile Cornbread. There are even wine recommendations with almost all the recipes--for people like me who don't know what to serve with dinner. And there are all kinds of menu suggestions from Fiesta to Summer dinners. The desserts are incredible. The Grand Chocolate Mint brownies are beautiful to look at and truly decadent. And my kids love the Wrangler Ranger Cookies. There are so many great recipes in the book, it's hard to decide what to make first. The San Francisco Chicken is so easy to make, and delicious too. I often make it when we have last minute dinner guests. This is a great value cookbook for all the wonderful recipes. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worn","review":"I have many Junior League cookbooks and this one is one of my favorites. The recipes work and the food is yummy.

I like it alot. There is defenitely a lot to do in it, but i got it yesterday, and i beat it today. I finished the whole game. It was pretty easy, and very exciting. The bonus points are very helpful, and fun. You get to put on a fashion show, snowboard, cheograph your own dance( thats sorta hard) take pictures of lifeguards, and serve up food. This game is fairly easy, but when you first try it, taking the pictures, serving the food, snowboarding, and cheographing are all a little tricky. It gets easier though.

Hate crimes against children condoned by adults who fail to act. I am still a little uncomfortable with TVs and transexuals, but this movie helps us understand the pain they experience.

Unlike the first two Warlock movies that actually had original and decent stories, this one just copies the current trend of unoriginal story. Kids go to old house, strange man shows up, strange man is evil, kids are stupid, strange evil man kills them in weird and exotic ways, one person lives to defeat strange man, and live happily ever after.

Then a storm hits, so Payne stays with the gang threwout the night...some thing he's cool, some think he's just a freak and some think that's he's not who he says he is. Soon, Payne unleashes his wrath, killing the friends off one by one to get to the prize, which is Laurence and he's supposed to sacrifice her for something. I was only interested in this for Bruce Payne, Ashley Laurence and Soap Opera star Rick Hearst (Carpool Guy, Tv's General Hospital). Also starring Angel Boris (Intercepter Force) and Boti Ann Bliss (National Lampoon's Dorm Daze).

THEN, once we got the new stamp, one of the gears on the wheel broke, so it couldn't move! At this point we figured we got a piece of junk, so we put all the pieces back in the box and sent it back.

I picked up this book after reading the also excellent The Man Who Never Missed.It follows the adventures of an ex-navy commando who's now a courier, expecting and receiving lethal attention from others trying to intercept the package he carries.I didn't expect such detailed descriptions in the sex scenes though. It's definitely not something I'll lend my teenage nephew.The only real problem I have with this story is that parts of the last few pages appear to have gone missing. The plot thunders wonderfully toward the endpoint, then all of a sudden there's the epilogue and I feel I've missed out on the final scene. What happened in that missing scene that explains the epilogue?If I'd stopped at the penultimate page, I would have given it five stars. It is a great read until then."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good story but too many flaws","review":"I've been a Steve Perry fan since The Man Who Never Missed, so my disappointment with this book bordered on disgust.I hope a print version of this book is better written than the electronic version since the story was entertaining. When I read, I really \\"get into\\" a good book. Just as I'd become immersed in the story, a stray ampersand, check mark, or random letter would appear, right in the middle of a word. Unfortunately, this was not a rare problem. It was like loud, screeching, speaker feedback happening every 15 seconds while listening to a great, four-minute song. The momentum was lost and was difficult to get back.Beside the typographical errors, a glaring mistake where one character's name was used in place of another may slap you between the eyes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good product","review":"Well it's a good thing that I had a gift certificate for this item and thus didn't have to pay too much money.

Other courses, such as Bethpage, Pumpkin Ridge, Kapalua, do not work properly. The motion of the graphics is segmented so that timing becomes almost an impossible challenge. Not on every shot, but enuff to ruin a score on the hole and with a few problem shots on different holes, the round. The 2005 game does not have this problem and its graphics are far superior in any event. Really hope that this problem is corrected for the PC game in '07."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did EA Sports Outsource '06?","review":"I own Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2004 and 2005 which are both awesome. When I got 2006 for my birthday I thought EA Sports decided to outsource their programming and UI to a foreign country with cheaper labor. The game loads slower and doesn't allow for skipping animations like '04 and '05. The putting is confusing, the Pro Shop UI is disturbingly unfriendly, and the overall game play experience is a vast disappointment from its predecessors. This game should be renamed Tiger Woods PGA Tour 1986 and be available exclusively for Atari."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hole in one","review":"This games is great. I am a new fan of sports games.

The animation is basic with the characters- but the golfing is great and challenging - but not incredibly hard to learn.Putting takes a little time to perfect but you wouldn't want a game that is going to make everything easy, would you? Yeah, there are some hard parts- get over it."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE!!! Stick with 2005","review":"OK, I don't know who's paying the two guys below, but this game rots! It looks just like 2005, loads more slowly (believe it or not), the menus are really cumbersome, AND you have much less ball control. This is a game, not a golf simulator for pros to play when it's snowing out. This is not supposed to be like a flight simulator for pilots who need to log their hours. Its a game. It should be fun. It isn't. Add to all of these disappointments the fact that you can't earn money/skill points for your own profile when playing other golfers (a near necessity, as they start you out with so little skill a 12 yo kid could toast you). AND you earn them incredibly slowly. I'll still play it, but when I'm having the guys over for some Tiger, it's still gonna be 2005, we've all agreed. Save your money, they'll fix it next year and we can all buy a good game then."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment on Tiger Woods PGA 06","review":"Well I cannot speak for everyone but here is the bottom line after I have played the game.After playing 05 I thought 06 would have a lot more to offer but wow, how I was wrong. You have almost no control over the ball off the tea and about the same all the way down the fairway. You can not change your position before driving the ball and trying to build power at the same time is impossible, most of the guess work on the green is now gone it seems and the new voice overs \\" well they seem annoying \\". They made room for players voices and took away from game play I my self rather have the game play. Any hoot, 05 is a much better game all around, 06 does have some better graphics but creating a player is just not the same.I feel 06 would have been better if they would have left the game setup like 05 and just added in some of the new 06 features.If you want to have control on the ball and have more fun all around play 05Thank you, for reading"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good TWPGA","review":"I do very much like this game.

As long as who have a pretty good grasp of the English language you should do fine. The one ting that might be of some use from this book is the definitions. Some of these terms like obsiquious did show up in the exam. The only thing that might cause you some trouble is the time limit. I used the entire 90 minutes.

On the one hand, Practice Test 3's questions 66-60 quite nicely test one's grasp of basic literary terms applied to Shakespeare's Sonnets; on the other, the next section's prose reading passage contains enough ambiguity (Qs 70, 71, and 74), that I'm not sure what one is learning! The answers are just too debatable to make an effective prep tool.MUCH more concise in prepping and testing for this CLEP is the second half of Princeton Review's Cracking the SAT II: English.Only the multiple choice test length is different, making this a far better learning tool and investment of your precious time."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a factory shop manual.

This woman rocked perfectly from start to finish! She played in front of a pcked stadium and had that enormous crowd mesmerized the ENTIRE time. She's just an awesome performer. This DVD is a great value for the price, and just as good as being there.

Very highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it for the DVD, not the CD","review":"The best part of this set is the killer live DVD that comes with the CD. The concert is a big production with Shakira at her best. This concert is really sexy too, lots of costume changes, tight pants and Shakira was cool with letting the cameras get tight shots of her...assests! I would have given this 5 stars if the disc had better songs, too much stuff from Laundry Service which was a luke warm record at best. However, Shakira made an inspired choice by doing \\"Back in Black\\" which she pulls off very well in her own hot style.More CDs I recommend are Bond's new CD \\"Classified\\" as well as Mr.Deviant's \\"Techno Obsession\\" which is a mix of power rock and hard dance music for some killer instrumentals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"Creo Que Shakira Esta muerta en Vida, Shakira es Una Guisa si piensa vender esto que es una reverenda porqueria, prefiero comprar la porqueria de thalia greates hits,pero para que peder dinero si exite Pau-Latina."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two thumps down.","review":"Shakira and her producers don't know what to do to make money.

Also, all of the songs on the DVD are from either ¿Dónde Están Los Ladrones? or Laundry Service, and then there's Back In Black, which was OK. The only song from Pies Descalzos was Estoy Aquí, and I hate how the live version of that song sounds. It's nothing like the one on the album. As for the DVD, it's mostly good. However, the part with Antonio surprising Shakira (by having the Mexicans sing a song for her) on Valentine's Day doesn't seem real; it looks as if it's acted out.

It tells you all about photometers of 20 years ago that used photo-electric tubes or pulse counters, but says nothing about what people use today for photometry (CCD cameras). The technology described in this book is ancient considering the major advancements that have been made since 1990. For example, it tells you to make sure you use a computer that has 20MB of DASD! This book is badly in need of an update.Nevertheless, there are aspects of photometry that have not changed in 20 years and for those aspects this is still one of the best books out there. But often it's hard to know whether the procedures and techniques they describe are dependent on the old technology and now you should use new procedures with CCD equipment, or whether the procedures and techniques still apply. So it's very difficult trying to sort out what is still relevant vs. what is ancient history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soft and cool","review":"For the price this top was a steal! Great on those steamy days due to the eyelet like construction of this garment. Only slightly risque with nothing worn under it since the holes are quite small. Hand wash only is the only slight negative about this top."},{"rating":"1","title":"PAPER WEIGHT","review":"This printer is little more than a paper weight. The money you save by having a printer/scanner combo, you spend in paper and ink cartridges. I can honestly say this because there isn't a time when it will not get jammed and continue using ink, even when the paper isn't feeding properly. So the next sheet or two of paper you run through your printer will come out with excess ink all over it. It is also very frustating, that it has trouble feeding paper, it either refuses to take any paper, or instead of just 1 sheet it will feed as many as 5 at once and cause the printer to jam."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can better","review":"The Lexmark X75 burns through ink. Worse, it is a cheaply manufactured product that breaks down after about two years of use. Specifically, it starts feeding multiple pages at once. The color functionality stopped working. Finally, if you own a Mac steer clear. Lexmark does not update the drivers and therefore you lose the diagnostics tools."},{"rating":"1","title":"really mediocre","review":"My husband and I bought this \\"all-in-one\\" printer a couple years ago for $129... After a few months the scanner stopped working, since we were still under warranty, we managed to have it replaced, however, I have to say that it is a really mediocre printer, the paper jams a lot, the printing is never even, the ink cartridges are very small, etc. Right now I am buying another printer and will keep this one as a scanner only, for as long as it will work (cross my fingers). Look for another printer while you are still on time."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for.","review":"I've owned this printer for a year, and for awhile it was okay.

It is a very long URL, and can be confusing for some people. Such length is horrible if you want to remember it and give it to a friend to write down so they can check out your site. If you are not using .Mac 4.0 for your own website hosting, you cannot beat the deal. However, if you are planning on having your own website as the primary reason for buying .Mac, you would be far better off with GeoCities or some other hosting.

Gmail offers its free email services with 1GB space. Various photo sites allow you to post, distribute, and print your pics. Sure .mac allows you to work \\"seamlessly\\" with iphoto but is this really worth the yearly membership price? Evidently, many reviewers don't think so and I would heartily agree.

I use four computers at work, at home, and on the road. I depend on my address book, calendar events, and 1000's of browser bookmarks. It's a GREAT convenience that this data automatically sync's whenever I make a change on one computer. The alternative is a PDA which may be more convenient for others; but .Mac servers my purposes perfectly. The iDisk is handy for storing small files that I change often and need quick access from any of my computers. Using the iDisk does require the time to complete the sync which can take some time for larger files. The Public folder feature is also very useful to transfer rather large files to anyone anywhere. For me, the convenience offsets the price.However, I do find it rather strange that Apple does not offer a discounted automatic renewal every year. Every year I return to Amazon and buy .Mac for $20 less than Apple's renewal price. Go figure, but thanks Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unnecessary and overpriced","review":"With so many free methods available to upload one's web site with, it seemspreposterous that apple gets away with charging what they charge for this service.

It gave meaningful insight into Lewis' relationship to the genre of fantasy, it drew interesting parallels between revelation and The Chronicles, and was written in very polished prose.If there is one element of the book I found a little difficult, it was the circuitous method in which very disparate parts of The Chronicles were strung together to push forth a common theme. But Edwards finished each chapter with a summary that brought it all together convincingly.The end has a very cool part (was it true?) that is very 21st century.

The floppy is terrific because it is easy to use even for the 'analog' generation. You can always take the floppies to a pal's house or to Kinkos to print out photos if you don't have a computer or printer. PLUS you don't need to know anything about computers to use this camera. I took this camera on a trip around the world for the millennium, it went to the Democratic National Convention and has been at my side for scores of conferences. I've probably taken more than 3000 photos with it. Most I would rate at about 80-85 on the l00 percent scale. Not perfect BUT very acceptable.Enjoy your camera, you can get it at a great price now. Plus you can then download easily and store your photos in JPEG format.My only challenge has been that the flash seems to not work perfectly in really dark rooms. But maybe that's just me??

I had heard that these pictures did not print well! Not so! I printed dozens of them on glossy photo paper, and have had real photographers raving about them. I am more pleased than I thought I would be with this camera. I use it to make pictures to put on all my greeting cards that I make. The battery lasts plenty long for a day of shooting, and recharges rapidly. The large viewscreen lets you see your picture as soon as you take it. I highly recommend this camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"getting alot of use from this camera","review":"I read alot of the reviews for this camera before I purchased it. Mostly I was concerned about the pic quality, but decided to get it anyway. It has two main modes: standard and email. Both modes produce fairly good quality pics, perhaps not suitable for editing, but great for standard utility shots to send to friends or use in online auctions. It takes the best pics when the object is well lit; pics are sometimes grainy when taken indoors with low light. Overall, I'd say that this camera offers what most people need in a digital camera and I am glad that I didn't spend more. The pics are high quality, the camera is easy to use, has very high battery life and lots of functionality.

On the good side, you can use common floppy discs to save your pictures, the batteries last for ages and it's extremely easy to use, but on the other hand the resolution (640x480 in hi-res) isn't good enough for anything more than simple holiday snaps. If you're prepared to do lots of re-touching you can use it as a useful image aquisition tool, and the lack of resolution can be a creative spur intself, but for anything more than simple web-site images and casual snaps you'd be better off with a proper megapixel camera with some kind of smart-card memory storage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Killer first Digital Camera!","review":"I just recently purchased this camera, and I have to say that it has made taking pictures fun.

Compared to other digital cameras that need USB, memory cards and other stuff, this one is handy. Floppy disks are not that expensive when compared to memory cards.Also great to use it for taking picture of items to be sold on eBay.

The only noticeable difference is the cleanup of the Japanese to English dialogue. If there is one drawback, this collection does not include the 4th in the series. I guess due to lack of overall game storage or maybe the fact THQ would like to market PSIV as a stand alone and rack up more bucks in the process...hehehe. PSI by itself makes this a very worthy purchase. LONG LIVE PHANTASY STAR!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The reason to get a GBA.","review":"I only gave the GBA passing notice until I heard about the Phantasy Star Collection. I immediately got giddy and weak in the knees. These are the games of my childhood and they're back to please me again. The original Phantasy Star on the Sega Master System is the pinnacle of the 8-bit RPG. PSII on the Sega Genesis is still my favorite RPG of all time. PSIII was a change of pace, but still good. The only thing keeping this from being a 5-star release is the lack of PSIV, which brought the series back to the PSII feel. Why Sega didn't publish this is beyond me, but thank you, THQ, for bringing me some wonderful nostalgia."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Review of the Gods","review":"Phantasy Star Collection was pretty darn good, I mean, holly moly, jumpin jolleys, three games for the price of one!!! Man o man, what a bang, what a buck, what a deal!!!! I would strongly recomend buying this game. My reasons for this decisive decion are as follows: 1.good graphics (for the time it was made in)2.The learning curve is steap, but effective, meaning that once you get past the first hour, and level up a bit, no, alot, you will begin to enjoy the game.3.

Casio makes good products, and when I saw this, I decided to 'give it a go', as the Brits say!I am happy to say that it continues to keep excellent time EXCEPT when I keep it in a drawer too long (away from light). Amazingly, it knows what the correct time is, and upon charging, will adjust itself accordingly. Apparently, it has a memory which tracks the duration of crystal vibration, and applies same when there is enough energy to move the hands and to display the LEDs.It is also a sturdy watch, and can be worn at work or at play.It is an excellent value, and does a great job of keeping accurate time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too big for a woman","review":"I bought this watch for a (female) friend of mine, and am going to have to return it, because the face was just too huge for a woman's wrist--even though she is athletic and very physically active.

She shows a move once then adds on moves and speeds it up and it is too hard to keep up. Also the camera is focused on the exercisers' faces too often and not enough on their feet so it is hard to know how the foot work is supposed to go. I must not have done it right because even though she kept saying \\"you should feel it in your abs\\" I didn't feel a thing. That is the area I need to work on the most. Also be warned the express workout has no warm-up. I don't know about a cool down since I didn't get that far. You should do your own warm up and stretching before and after. I didn't, and the next day I had a lot of pain and soreness in my hips, legs and knees (my left knee still hurts). Be careful."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good starter video","review":"I actually own the \\"Kickbox Yoga Fusion\\" version of this DVD. I was a total newbie to kickboxing, and I've found this DVD to be really helpful in getting to know some kickboxing moves. Patricia Moreno is an encouraging teacher, and she makes the routine easy to follow. The emphasis is really on form though, so I think anyone who's very familiar with kickboxing isn't likely to benefit much from the DVD. I definitely work up a sweat doing it, but I'd have to get myself a heart rate monitor to see if it's really a high-calorie burn.One warning - do not do the \\"express workout\\" without warming up beforehand and stretching afterwards. You'll definitely end up sore! The longer workout has the yoga stretching moves built into it, and I've never had a problem after doing that one."},{"rating":"2","title":"My kids could not stop giggling","review":"This is a great movie that my kids could really relate to. My kids could not stop giggling during the first scene where the bear comes to life. There is something magical about the puppetry that really feeds their imagination.

I hesitated because there were no dimensions listed for this item, but for $16 I figured it wouldn't hurt to try. It is adorable, but VERY small.

I wish they could correct the volume level because this toy is great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for all ages","review":"This toy is actually really fun. It is pretty loud, so get ready to have all other sounds drowned out by this toy. We got the toy when my son was 7 and 1/2 months old and just kept the legs off so he could sit on the floor and play with it. He loved it. Eventually though he became less interested in it. When he started pulling up on things though, I put the legs on and it is like a whole new toy to him. It is so cute to watch him chase a ball around the table with his pudgy little hands. He has even figured out that he can put other small toys in the center and watch them spin off. This toy is a fun toy to sit down and enjoy with you child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid, dumb , idiotic and vulgar!","review":"This is the all-time WORST movie I've ever seen!

It's a total snore-fest!Plus it had way too much sexual humor!Don't waste your time on this awful movie!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"1/2 star, complete garbage","review":"This film was on TV the other day and the only reason I watched it was because I was bored. My god, afterwards I felt like Id truly wasted the day and just like the film it seemed 200 years had passed. The script was flat and boring, full of misplaced jokes and inappropriate sexual innuendoes (only one joke brought a chuckle) the acting mediocre in no way moving,. As for the story itself, it was like being spoon fed a lesson in human morality and re-gurgitated SCI-Fi babble with no real depth or intellect at all.I dont know why I continued to watch the film, maybe just to see how worse it could possibly get but when it finally did (and what a predictably rubbish ending too) the only satisfaction I had was knowing I hadnt made the mistake of paying for the DVD..... even I-Robot is better than this heap"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie Ever","review":"This is by far the worst movie I have ever had to watch. It isn't even bad in a way that you can laugh at. It seems like it takes a bicentennial to watch. It is slow, boring and seems to have absolutely no point. Each stop along the way in this movie, Williams is trying to become real, and in the process finds out how to be real boring. This movie should have been 30 minutes maybe, but they decided to take that material and streatch it out for what seemed like 5 hours! I am still not sure that this movie, which takes place over 200 years was not filmed in real time, like the show '24'. Do not see this movie under any circumstances."},{"rating":"2","title":"As Science Fiction a great movie!","review":"As a Science Fiction fan I loved this movie. I'm not crazy about Asimov as a writer (of whose short story this movie is based) but I like most of the plots of his stories.I love robot stories and so in that to see the transition of the main character (a robot) and his search for others like him as he comes to higher awareness is very interesting.As a Christian, I find it offensive that anyone could really be taken in by the idea of man making a robot that is clearly supposed to be as human as a human.However, I suspended my disbelief and enjoyed the pure science fiction of it - I suggest that everyone else do the same and enjoy the movie (but do watch and talk about the movie with your children - good to have them think rather than just decide to avoid it like many have done with Harry Potter another good story)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shames all prejudices right out of you.","review":"I had no idea that this would be such a heavy hitting movie. I laughed and I cried. I would recommend this movie to people of all ages, all colors, religions, etc. It teaches that we are all one. Major kudos Mr. Williams. You've done it again.

They were jumping so many yrs, was hard to tell women apart at times. Film was a hybrid comedy/drama -but the science part(one man in a lab doing all that)- when they made him human was absurd, considering their apparent lack of progress in expanding human life span. Plus they suggested these droids had been phased out, w.o. mentioning probable similar, yet more advanced droids that would have been produced by other companies.Williams did a good job, and probably a difficult task for the screenwriters to even make this film as good as it was.Movie does present many interesting thought provoking topics, no question."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Joy!","review":"I cannot explain what this movie has done for me. It is not just an excellent plot, but an excellent cast of actors as well. I believed the first 40 minutes were a tad drawn out, but once the story picked up, and the film traced the Martin family, it turned into one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen. It truly makes you think about your own appreciation of life, your own capacity to love, and your own mortality. This film makes you remember that very often, the least tangible things in life are what make life sweetest...freedom, love and joy. I recommend this to all who are in search of renewing their own life with happiness and awe. You must search for these themes...but they are there. I feel deeply sorry for the people who are obviously fearful of exploring themselves and hope that one day they love the life they were given as much as Andrew loved his..."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is for older children on up","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this film when it first came to theaters a long time ago. Robin Williams almost always provides us with fun and laughter, but this story touches on serious philisophical and ethical questions. It seems to me that I saw this movie ages ago; however, it been only 9 years since its release. While I enjoyed Bicentennial Man, I never realized that the story was published in hardcover in 1976 as I had always thought that the book, The Positronic Man, had been the model for \\"Data\\" in the Star Trek Next Generation series. All of these are wonderful stories, but I do believe that if you haven't read The Positronic Man by Asimov and Silverberg that you would enjoy it. It definitely changed many of my views on life, death, and the phrase \\"sentient being\\". It is more adult book, but suitable for teenagers on up. As I will soon be 70, maybe I ought to read that book again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bicentennial Man DVD","review":"I hope everyone has a chance to see this movie, I found it quite interesting and somewhat of a tear jerker. It's a happy but sad movie. If you cry easy then you should see it, as I felt so involved with the character, I felt like I was there witnessing every move Robin Williams went through. Good plot! What else can I say, I truly enjoyed this movie!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It\`s true love and freedom seeking stroy!","review":"I was very moved it.I could not stop sobbing my heart out the latter half of the story.

Robin Williams takes you gently into the depths of what it means to be \\"human\\" and how to love simply, purely and deeply with all of your heart and soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching, Entertaining Movie","review":"I thought Bicentennial Man was a very touching story. At times it was a bit lame, but overall it was a good movie. Some of the visuals were just great, particularly the ones of the distant future. I thought a lot of the talent in the movie was miss used. Robin Williams doesn't really seem like a robot to me, I think someone would have been better off playing that role. Also, on the DVD there really werent any note worthy extras, just a trailer and a five minute promotional snipet. Common, this is dvd, we want more."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Loved It!!!!!","review":"This is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen.

The story is slow, the swearing useless and the sexual innuendo completely out of place. Did Robin Williams even read the script?"},{"rating":"1","title":"It seemed like 200 years...","review":"Typical of Robin Williams' \\"New Age\\" drivel that he's been making lately. Where is the actor of \\"Dead Poet's Society,\\" \\"Good Will Hunting,\\" and \\"Good Morning, Vietnam\\"? This film is TERRIBLE! Not is it only overlong (it seemed like 200 years), but the character development is nearly nonexistent and the themes overstated and underdeveloped. A clunker. Some nice set design, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"In my humble opinion, this movie was way too simplistic, sometimes even silly. I couldn't even finish it. I feel really sorry for Williams, one of my favorite actors, whose career has to carry the stigma of this movie. Believe me, this is not a sci-fi flick; it's a soap opera.However, I have to admit that a lot of people like this movie. The same people who like soap operas, reality shows, talk shows and who enjoyed \\"Evan Almighty\\". This includes most of my family. You might like it, too. Not everybody is a critic.For the more critic among you, Spielberg's \\"Artificial Intelligence\\", \\"I robot\\" and even \\"The Animatrix\\" are better treatments of the same subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should Be A Zero","review":"I spent the beginning of this movie waiting outside the theater for the flea, and boy am I glad that I did. Afterward I was really glad to have missed any of this tedious, endless mess. Easily the worst movie I've seen this year, it made BATS seem witty by comparison. Trite, trifling and dull, this movie is simply syrupy sentimentality at it's worst. OH! To be human! Even Star Trek The Next Generation did this shtick better. Could these really be based on Asimov? tMoby fell asleep, I only wish I could've. Sheer torture, by the end you'll be praying for Robin Williams's death, or maybe for your own."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't recommend this movie","review":"I thought this was going to be a good movie when I first saw coming attractions, but it was not good. This movie is NOT a comedy it's a family comedy for maybe the first 45 minutes, if that. For the rest it is a very very very utterly very sad drama.Bicentennial means 200 Years. He literally lives for 200 years. He's staying alive while he sees everyone he knows and loves die. It's horrible. It's the kind of movie that ruins your day in my opinion. Don't watch it if your in a good mood. But I guess if your sad while your watching it, it'll make you feel worse.The one good thing in the movie is the adorable Hallie Eisenberg (Paulie, Pepsi) who plays the younger \\"Little Miss\\".Well, for some reason other people who have written reviews seem to like it, I guess it's a matter of interpretation. Maybe watch it and see for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Distrubing!","review":"I have always hated the concept of machine taking over man. In this movie Machine tries to marry human?

I couldn't wait until it was over! I would never watch a second time. Mork calling Orson!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Touching and warm family drama","review":"Another of those films that is too long at 2-1/2 hours but which is warm and touching. It's a variation on the PINOCCHIO story with a futuristic robot yearning to become human and who succeeds in that endeavor only to see those he loves die from generation to generation. It's a treatise on what it is to be human and how love actually works and is rather a lovely little film. If it could have been edited down to even a two hour running time it might have worked better. The Academy Oscar nommed it for Make-up but it also deserved nods for Costume Design, Sound Effects and Score - all quite exceptional. A nice movie for the whole family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long and boring","review":"Very long. Very boring. This movie did not hold my attention very long. I made it about 1.5 hours through and realized that you were basically watching the same story being repeated over several generations in the same family. The whole \\"freedom\\" and \\"declaration of humanity\\" themes just didn't save it. It's very difficult to portray the life of a single character spanning 200 years, and \\"Bicentennial Man\\" didn't pull it off.The biggest problem is that the life of \\"Andrew\\" is portrayed so quickly, moving through time like the years are broken blades of grass, it's impossible to make a connection with the character. Once you think you may be connecting with him and feeling what he feels, BAM, the movie just skipped 16 years, and you're left with, \\"Hey, wait a minute, I was just getting into that period.\\"Robin Williams and the special effects guys did a fantastic job. Other than that, it's just plain dumb."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOO HISS! WILL NOT KEEP YOUR KIDS INTERESTED!!!","review":"This movie was a TOTAL drag! It will not keep your kids interested at all! The story line was much to involved, and even I had a hard time staying awake for the whole movie. It is very depressing. If you have kids that are under 13, don't buy this movie, and expect them to hang around the popcorn. Eventhough there is a \\"moral\\" to the story, kids will not wait around for the whole movie to \\"get it\\".

He tries to rescue this film from utter suckiness, but it just isn't enough. The first half hour is good, as Robin Williams is a robot who was just bought by a family to do various house hold projects. It's funny, and he has some questions about life that make you think. It goes DOWN from there. Time keeps passing so quickly, you don't know what's going on. Half way through the movie, there is a girl robot who is mind numbingly annoying. Everyone in the theatre was moaning with the stupid things she said, trying to be funny. People were laughing because it was so bad. An ancestor of the family who bought the robot ends up having sex with him, and then it just gets stupid. I won't say anymore, except that I don't know anyone who likes this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fantastic movie - Critics should get their heads examined.","review":"This was a fantastic movie, and a true-to-form continuation of the Asimov Legacy.The film incorporates many of Isaac's insights into the fundemental core of the human condition, in the person of R.

I'm sure that if you never read the novella, you really enjoy the movie. But like most people who read the story first, I can't get past the fact that the storyline was butchered for the sake of making the movie. Asimov rarely included romance in his writing, and what little he did wasn't included in Bicentennial Man. Maybe if they just called it something else, or said \\"loosely based on ideas and characters created by Isaac Asimov.\\"For those of you who have never read Isaac Asimov's original, enjoy this movie. It has special effects and a storyline you don't already know, and one of Robin Williams's better performances. But if you've read the book, don't disappoint yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bicentennial Man","review":"Great movie, Robin Williams at his best.

First published in 1964, it remains the best account of the Boston Tea Party in or out of print. In fact, it's something of a classic.

Still and all - this series gathers togther all of that earlier material that laid the foundation for the egyptology today.

The \\"Legacy of Darkness\\" expansion brought two new characters including the one I thought was strongest and most well-rounded, Carrie. I enjoy her stages the most.The graphics look extremely dated and they weren't the best even when the game came out, but I don't think they take much from the gaming experience. My biggest gripe was the difficult controls, which made jumps difficult, and the camera wasn't the best, but most games have a camera problem.There isn't all that much of a story to speak of, it's mostly straight adventuring, which is what I want out of a game. It's colorful and has a lot of action, and in general it's engaging fun, although not that deep. I'd recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Legacy continues","review":"This has to be the best game I ever played. At first I was hesitant because Castlevania 64 was kinda iffy but I decided what the heck. I was amazed at how much the play control had improved and how the levels were much longer and a lot more fun. Not to mention two totaly new characters with storylines all their own but if you earned them you can also you the characters from the previous Castlevania game. This adds great replay value. So in my opinion you should get this game even if you are a veteran of the series or just starting you will love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Room For Improvement?","review":"If you are a die hard castlevania then you will get over the fact the game has horrific animation and you can find yourself haveing a hard time controlling it.

Every detail is so real. The diffuculty settings help out new players to the castlevania relm. There are three hidden charcters that add to the games length with new levels and game play.

But alongside the existing Tao literature, this is a fascinating and masterful supplement. For Crowley readers, it is a must.

There is information pertaining to newborns, infants, and toddlers."},{"rating":"1","title":"W a r n i n g","review":"Warning: if you do not like clinical details into abnormal psyches, do not read this book.I was so demoralized by this book. I liked the writing style and so kept with it to the end. BUT the grisly, gory, despicable details about child abuse, torture, morbidity, etc., were disgusting! It angered me so much that I had been suckered into such a horrific tale. I HATED IT!I don't like to ever write bad reviews, but I'll never read another of this author's books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Imagine","review":"Imagine, if you will, a book about serial murders in an early Native American culture in the very remote past. About such a culture, our knowledge is necessarily limited so some speculation is in order. Now imagine that you're listening to a wise man of that culture dispensing the wisdom of his many years. O.k. so far. Now imagine that the wise man expresses opinions that might easily have come from the mouth of a dippy, unlicensed, untrained mid-1980's California therapist - the kind who succumbed to and foisted onto their patients an unwavering belief in every goofy fad from alien abductions to crystal therapy to satanic ritual abuse. If that sounds plausible to you, you might like this book. Give it a try. ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't deliver","review":"I finished this book debating at times if I wanted to continue. Since I was on a trip thought New Mexico I continued. It was an interesting premise which didn't deliver. I was weary of hearing about the shape of the women's faces (triangular and oval) with large doe eyes, and the many paragraphs about what the archeologists were wearing, \\"a white t-shirt with khaki shorts and hiking boots\\" etc. Who cares? What else would they wear to dig in a ruin? Donna Karen! I find Hellerman's mysteries involving Chee and Leaphorn much more satisfactory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"Save your money and buy a Tony Hillerman book instead. The Visitant is simply unbelievable. If the male Anasazi War Chiefs were that confused, insipid, and wimpy, it is no wonder the Anasazi died out. The book is politically correct, if you value that sort of thing (I don't). However, if you like harmless fantasies about women warriors and powerful clan matrons, you might like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book.","review":"I can't believe anyone would give this book five stars! I agree with several other reviewers who feel that this book has too much fluff. The story is so predictable. Force together a man and woman who hate each other and they will end up together. Gag! It appeared to me that the Gears had a word limit on this book, so they repeated physical descriptions of every character in the book (almost) each time they were mentioned in the story. I think this book could have been improved by simply leaving out the contemporary part of the story!I would not recommend this book to anyone.Unfortunately, I bought this book, so now I'm going to donate it to the public library. Hopefully, they will be able to put it to some good use. They sell old books as a fundraiser each year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, had me looking over my shoulder!","review":"Since I come from a line of \\"medicine women\\" I grew up on witch stories and The Visitant is comparable to some of my favorites. Parts of this book read really slow (mostly the modern stuff), but overall the book was hard to put down. The end of the book was kind of confusing to read, so I had to re-read it. I loved the crude sense of humor of the archeologists, although their stories are predictable and tiring. This book definitely left me curious about the next two and I will definitely continue reading the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Agree with the two other reviewers who assigned it one star. In addition, I grew weary of the constant, unrelenting use of \\"long black hair\\", \\"huge brown eyes\\", etc etc. ad nauseum, constant repetition of overused adjectives. Having established in the first few pages that the Anasazi had brown or black eyes, black hair, which they often wore long, it was boring to read the same descriptions over and over again, page after page. Authors did the same in \\"Summoning God\\". Where are editors when you need them??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Researched on Wikipedia","review":"I would question whether the authors actually know any Native Americans personally. The tone is so weird, the historical portions read like Star Trek fan-fiction, the modern portions are just a mess (ex. I would be surprised if the authors could find Crownpoint on a map, never mind that there has been a Bashas in Crownpoint for many years prior to this book.)I really doubt that the authors: visited Chaco Canyon more than once, could name more than two federally recognized tribes, have ever seen an active archeological site in New Mexico or visited a modern Pueblo.If there was an award for working \\"turkey feather capes\\" into piece of fiction, then this book would win, but overall it is garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Mystery","review":"I have enjoyed these mysteries very much. I'm on the third in the trilogy. The plots move along very fast with a lot of side adventures going on in addition to the main storyline. Gear's descriptive ability with the characters and the southwest country, flora and fauna add to the story immensely. It makes it easy to put yourself right in the book. I couldn't put this first book down and immediately downloaded the second book so I could keep the story going. The way Gear switches from prehistory to current time and back again running two sets of characters side by side also works and adds to the reading excitement. I've enjoyed reading the Anasazi Mysteries more than any of the Gear's other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful","review":"I have always been fascinated in indian heritage and this books bring it all to life! This is my second time reading this particualr series and it won't be my last!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Visitant","review":"This book started very slow, jumping back and forth from the Anasazi to the present. After gettin through the first couple of chapters the story grew and gained interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Go Nowhere Anasazi Murder Mystery","review":"Never have I expected more, only to get much less than I expected. This book is supposed to be a murder mystery set in the Anasazi times of Chaco Canyon. Instead it becomes a burdening plot (if you can call it a plot), unbelieveable, and then leaves with no conclusion. They just want you to buy the next book so they can continue their boring story. Don't waste your money on this book like I did. If this book is really about the Anasazi, no wonder they disappeared, they were too embarrassed knowing this book would be written about them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anasazi Thriller Trilogy-But There is a prequel","review":"Why Amazon tries to link People of the Owl with this opening of the trilogy instead of People of the Silence is unfathomable. Before starting the trilogy, be sure to read the excellent prequel, People of the Silence, which actually has as its first chapter the death of Magpie's grandmother that is referred to in the Visitant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!!!","review":"If you don't get this mystery than it is because you don't get the depth of research it took to come up with such a plot. This is a great first book in the continuing saga of the native americans in the southwest. It is refreshing to read about different times and cultures. I look forward to book two, and many more to come. The Gears are one of my favorite writers, I have read ALL their books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Enough--Too Much","review":"How to explain my reaction to this book. Well, I wasn't hooked until I was well over 250 pages into it. This is not good for a mystery lover and avid reader.I anticipated a tale as fascinating as The Eye of Horus. The similarities were there--modern day archealogists and anthropologists working to solve the mystery of the Anasazi mass burial site while the story is consecutively being revealed.Unfortunately, the story itself is not compelling, nor the characters. The conclusion lacked...let me think...oh, what is the word I'm looking for...A CONCLUSION.Yes, I know this is just a bridge to the next book, but I don't think I'll be reading it anytime soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I really liked this CD.

I left the theatre very excited about getting this CD just for the fanfare at the end of the movie. Forget it. The instrumental music cannot be found anywhere. (I've been trying to track it down for years.)What a disappointment. I have the oldies included from other albums and venues. What a shame they didn't include the soundtrack music which is not available anywhere else.Stupid. Stupid. Stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"This book is absolutely worthless for passing the exam, teaching, or learning networking in general. Amazon needs a -5 Star rating for this book. There are numerous typos, information that was not researched and very wrong, multiple concepts thrown out in the same paragraph that have nothing to do with each other, and topics and information that are beyond the scope of the test and most beginning students. Save your money and buy the New Riders book."},{"rating":"1","title":"SKIP THIS BOOK","review":"This was a pitiful excuse for a textbook. So many typos in the first two chapters I seriously doubted the validity of anything in this book. Text obviously cut and pasted but never read. Chapters disagree with one another. Acronyms constantly misspelled, wrong photos for captions. Meaningless diagrams and third grade sketches plagerized from the cbt systems CD rom (included) and farsically photocopied in stunning shades of gray and darker gray. The CD rom (yawn) was suitable for my 9 year old.

The text is not only full of typos but also contains information that is completely wrong. You'll learn more about networking from the Sunday comics than by looking at the worthless illustrations in this book. Spend your money elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for the next edition!!!","review":"This book had so many typos and grammatical errors I returned it and complained directly to the publisher. Some of the mistakes were so egregious, they actually affected the content. Clearly it was rushed into print, and it is doubtful it was either properly edited or proofread. I thought I was doing myself a favor by getting a shorter volume, but in fact there are much better study guides available that cover the material in more depth, and in a better sequence. If you are new or relatively inexperienced, go for something else, e.g. the Sybex series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why would I waste my time to warn you?","review":"I did finish reading this book, but I had to go out and get another book just to verify what I read was wrong.

I only wish more people today thought as he thought and would speak out as he spoke out. No greater gift could be given a teenager or adult than a compilation of the best (and often funniest) Sheen had to offer. Sadly, this is not the case here. Instead, the viewer is presented tantalizing snippets of Bishop Sheen's brilliance, but just as the viewer is drawn into his story, the scene is harshly cut to an unrelated episode. And so it continues endlessly throughout this video, jumping from one clip to another. In the end I found my myself worrying more about when the cut was coming, rather than enjoying the content of the scene. The best service the producers could perform would be to repackage this product as as boxed set and present each episode in its full and unedited form. It would be worth the added price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sheen Gems","review":"Fulton Sheen was a great Christian but the Gems cut off so much of the true meaning of his speeches by cutting them off partway. One cannot get the full picture unless hearing the entire speeches. The Gems did include one full length speech in two parts for the last speech he made. This is how the entire DVD should have been made. I was disappointed to only get 10 min. of a 30 min. session, then to go to the next 30 min. segment and get 10 min. again.... This made the DVD and his message disappointing...I would order his full lenghth features only, from now on....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bishop Sheen ROCKS! But this DVD? Not so much...","review":"Bishop Sheen is awesome, as always, but this DVD is about 40% Bishop Sheen and 60% cheezy panoramic shots of beaches, mountains and rivers that you have to watch every 5 minutes while listening to the Narrator try to poetically compare Bishop Sheen's performance to roses blooming next to a calm stream in the spring time.The strange montages of bad poetry and shots of people walking on the beach gave me that suffocating feeling I used to get in highschool when we were forced to watch an outdated human anatomy video from the 1970s!I'd usually say its the thought that counts but....not when it costs me $19.99!!!I highly recommend ALL of Bishop Sheen's programs in their full length, but not this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money on THIS DVD.","review":"I agree with the others who rated this DVD poorly. Whoever did the editing of this DVD did a horrible job of frustrating the viewers by cutting off Bishop Sheen right when he was getting to the point of his topic, sometimes in the middle of a thought or sentence. I was very disappointed. I will search for another DVD of the great Bishop Sheen and I will do a better job of reading reviews in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slicer Heaven","review":"I have owned a Feemster slicer for over 40 years. It is by far the most complete slicer both for ease of use and prformance. In fact, I was supprised to find out that the Feemster slicer had been upgraded with stainless steel parts. My old one had some rust on the blade and was getting pretty dull after all those years of use. The new slicer with the updated materials, is an exact replica of my old one. The performance is great and will serve me for many years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice little Slicer","review":"I've only used a couple of times so far, but this is why I bought it in the first place. Yes, I looked at the more expensive and fancy Mandolins. But, as many people wrote, they generally get used very infrequently and only gather dust in their cupboards.This device is simple, small, easy to use, and cheap. It may not do everything a mandolin can, but it will make the job of slicing potatoes, or carrots a much simpler job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Slicer Ever","review":"I had a Feemster slicer for several years, and gave it to my daughter, assuming I would be able to replace it easily. What a surprise when I found the \\"new\\" slicers had a stainless steel blade instead of the original carbon steel blade. I was delighted to see the \\"original\\" on Amazon. They have placed non-slip grips on the feet and include a slicing guard now, and the blade is still amazing! (Wash by hand and dry immediately to keep it in tip-top shape.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Cheap Slicer","review":"I've had my Feemster since about 1982, and it's still going strong. I do sharpen it occasionally, it takes an edge beautifully. It's got a little rust in areas that are difficult to dry, but that's about it. I consider it an essential tool, and a lot easier to use and clean than the more expensive slicers. I've also sliced the heck out of myself on it in the beginning, so caution is required just as with a knife. Because it's carbon steel, you have to rinse it off immediately, but I haven't had any issue with leaving it to drain and air dry along with pots and pans. I give it 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was very excited about this product when I saw it online, because our son LOVES to be outside but the mosquitos are all over him every time we step foot outside.

They are afraid of facts that may be different that what they were taught to believe. Discovering a truth can alter the entire perception of a person, and many people don't want to go there.

It was an early 1970's made for tv movie, but, I'll tell you, I was scared! It's a great modern-day vampire movie. Great movie to watch on a dark, stormy night w/ someone near you!

I don't think any one author/illustrator has such a catalog of playful, meaningful, generous, witty, profound and literate books for young people. Amos and Boris is a distillation of all the great themes of life: friendship, courage, spiritual ecstacy, the question of an afterlife (\\"Would his soul go to heaven? Would there be any mice there?\\"), altruism and love.As weighty as these issues are, they are simply part of the fabric of the wonderful story; there is nothing ponderous or cobbed on, no subtext. Steig's genius lies in his ability to create stories that appeal equally to small children, and to their parents and grandparents -- they ring that true on all levels.The characters in this little book have become a part of my heart, as has William Steig. Don't miss it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amos and Boris","review":"\\"Amos and Boris\\" is one of our family's favorites, bar none.

It is almost worthless for using with liquids. There is a major problem in the design of the spout. When you try to pour out it, a large quantity of the liquid ends up on the counter. It appears that the spout itself is too small or shallow. This design flaw makes the cup virtually worthless -- it was a complete waste of our money. We've also noticed that the glass is somewhat wavy and that it gets much hotter than other Pyrex measuring cups when heated in the microwave. I'm not sure why that is. We have an older Pyrex measuring cup of the same size which is wonderful. There is no comparison between the two. I would strongly recommend against buying this particular measuring cup.

Well, while I was gently stirring, the thing exploded into many tiny fragments, some of them thrown several feet away, some of them even getting stuck to my clothing. Thankfully I didn't get anything in my eyes, but I spent the next hour cleaning the stove and everything around it.After some research it appears lab glass Pyrex and kitchen Pyrex are two completely different products. Some time ago the company switched to soda-lime glass (the same stuff used for common bottles) to cut production costs.

I can scrape it off but was really disturbing is the defect in the cup itself.My experience with Pyrex having used them for 30+ years, I never saw one with a huge flaw in the glass. It is hard to describe, but the area where the handle is has a visual ripple in the glass you can feel too.

That said, they are study and strong and won't break or chip as long as you don't drop it from too high. (still don't believe 10 feet - maybe that person has rubber floors). That said, I trust glass, and this is the only measuring cup I'll use. I like the quart size too.Edit, changing from 5 stars to 4. The reason is the spout is too small and pouring liquids from this thing takes patience and care. If you pour as fast as you expect a standard pyrex, you get liquid all over the counter. The wider circle, with no increase in the size of the spout (not sure what to call it), is a design flaw.

Never had that problem with my old-style Pyrex cups. I have a Frigovere glass pitcher with same approximate diameter opening and glass thickness and it pours perfectly, neatly, so it's a design flaw. The Pyrex designers should have to spend eternity trying to pour successfully from their new design; and it would take eternity, because it simply can't be done.

My last one, exactly like this one, also from Amazon, chipped on the edge with less than two years' use. This could have happened in one of two ways.

However, I have used Pyrex for years (over 30) and never had this problem before.

Personally I refuse to use a plastic measurement cup. Especially for heating liquids in the microwave. Plastic does leach chemicals into your food, especially when heated. I suggest people write to Pyrex to complain or the glass Pyrex measuring cups will be gone forever. I bought two complete sets to last me. Also don't use any scrubber nor dishwasher to clean your Pyrex or you risk wearing off the lines. I suggest you keep them separate from banging or rubbing against other dishware. Wash by hand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate and clumsy","review":"I'm surprised at all the great reviews for this product. While it looks nice and has a nice weight to it, the spout is horrible. It's nearly impossible for pour from it without it dripping down outside of the cup. Also, the one I received is inaccurate. The markings are between 1/8\\" and 1/4\\" too high so I can't use it for my baking needs because it adds to much liquid to the recipe. The only use I have for it at this point is for scrambling eggs for an omelet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design","review":"I have always used pyrex glass measuring cups, so when my old one-cup cup broke I wanted to replace it. I'm very disappointed with the design of the new cup. The cup itself will probably hold two cups of liquid. It only has markings for up to one cup. The cup is very short and wide. This makes the markings so close together they are hard to read and hard to pour the precise of liquid I need. I bought another one that I like. I can't imagine why Pyrex made this cup like this. I would have never believed I would review a measuring cup, but this one was so bad I decided to."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Pesky Problem In Otherwise Perfect Pyrex","review":"I have an \\"older model\\" of the 1-Quart Pyrex Measuring Cup, so I have a direct comparison. My original is tall and slender, with thick glass. The new version is short, wide and the glass is thinner. I don't know if this makes a difference, but my problem is thus: When pouring liquid, my new Measuring Cup DRIPS. The spout allows liquid to escape down the outside of the container, often outside my bowl. This is not what I'm looking for when attempting to achieve an exact amount of any ingredient needed in a recipe. However, Pyrex is Pyrex. Great for SO many things, and this is a perfect size container for a million different applications ... thus it's impossible for me to give it less than 2 stars.

My parents both work in a lab and so they've come to rely on the Pyrex brand. We had them at home when I was growing up, and now that I've moved out, I've gotten some measuring cups for myself. Pyrex is extremely durable - but can be heavier than your average stack measuring cups.

Pyrex is the top of the line and this 1-Quart measuring cup is no exception.Pyrex measuring cups are ideal for measuring ingredients. You can even put this in microwave. The handle is nice and thick, to ensure a good, easy grasp. The measurements are in raised red letters and lines that won't wash off over time, which was a problem I've had with other perfectly good measuring cups. You don't get that with Pyrex! To make a good thing better still, the handle on this measuring cup does not get hot when you pop it into the microwave. It's made of good quality, durable glass that contains no unnatural ingredients and is perfectly safe for measuring and storing food/liquids.Pyrex is your best friend in the kitchen.

It also contains One Man Band, which got a lot of radio play in the day, I'll Be Creeping, and I've Got Enough Heartache.Three Dog Night had incredible harmonies and range.

After finishing a blues number he'll get to his feet, shakily lay his guitar down, and perform an unaccompanied spiritual. But before he starts he delivers odd mumbled monologues - alomost inaudable - about how he hasn't left God, he is still pious even though he sings the blues, etc. The audience doesn't know quite what to make of all this.

This way, the student does not only know the meaning of the word, he knows how to use it properly in dialog. Another excellent feature of this book (and series) is that the author groups words with similar meanings in the same groups so that the student will be able to distinguish between the two when faced with real material.

Prof Hyland's narrative is very helpful in understanding Blas Valera and the context of the world around him. My only criticism, and a mild one, is that Blas Valera's somewhat gilded view of Incan culture and accomplishments, although understandable given his imprisonment, could have deserved more discussion.

Nas has that sick rhyming flow and that sick production backing him up making this album flawless. Nas is never the same again after Illmatic but still delivers it hard unlike most rappers (don't worry I'm not looking at you 50 Cent)...50 Cent is a guilty pleasure of mine but he will never be as great as Nas. Nas made NY known once again and had the crown but soon stolen by Notorious BIG. When he died it came back to Nas and HELL NO! it's Jay-Z. Nas, forever my favorite rapper!

There is a reason why some of the best producers in the game in 1994 got together to hook Nas up with classic production. There is a reason why this album gained the first \\"5 Mic Rating\\" from The Source magazine. There is a reason why this album is constantly being discussed 13 years after it's release, always being hailed as \\"Classic\\".If you consider yourself any type of fan of Hip-Hop/Rap, owning this album is a REQUIREMENT. Nas redifined lyricism with this masterpiece. The production on this album is timeless and the beats still haven't lost their touch even today.If you have any doubts about this album, don't read the recent reviews. Set it to show the most helpful and read through those. To be perfectly honest, anyone telling you not to purchase this album truly knows nothing about Hip-Hop."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album is still hot 10-11 years later!","review":"Nas hit it on the nail in 1994 with Illmatic! I played that album several times! I like the anniversary edition where they put the original 10 songs on one CD and this special one as the second. I still like Life's A..., The World Is Yours, One Love, that xylophone based song that rocks, New York State of Mind and others. L.E.S., Large Professor,Pete Rock, DJ Premier, and some others produced some dynamic songs. But the true star is Nas, as his lyrics are street, his metaphors and cadences and rhymes are on point, and how he describes life in Queensbridge. This is still a classic, Nas is one of NY's best rappers and his latest one will be another classic in its own right!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Illest !","review":"Nas totally came with it on this debut album. He first shined on Main Source's \\"at the BB-Q\\" joint and every sence that track I had to get it.

It is essential to every hip hop collection. I've never heard an MC spit such sharp rhymes while remaining perfectly in sync with the beat. Nas's rhyme style and cadence makes good beats sound better, and after 2 listenings you'll be fighting off the urge to rap along with him. This CD just gets better with age. Simply timeless!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible CD","review":"few albums have left such a mark on my mind. Illmatic is a must have for any hip hop collection. If you are thinking about buying something else, forget about it. Drop everything and BUY THIS ALBUM. I got it when it still came out and I still listen to it everyday. \\"The world is yours\\" \\"memory lane\\" and \\"it ain't hard to tell\\" are my personal favorites, but every track is good. Nas stings together his words like poetry, he paints a picture, you get inside his head. This album is much much beter than \\"It was written\\", his second album. If you can't feel this album you don't feel hip hop. Unquestonably the best piece of music ever made."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the ALL-TIME best","review":"With this, his debut album, Nas let it be known that he was here to stay.

Illmatic is of course a hip-hop classic, five stars, maybe even six. But one star has been taken off for Disc 2. It contains the hard-to-find \\"It Ain't Hard to Tell\\" remix and \\"The World is Yours\\" remix. Those are tight, but the remixes to \\"One Love\\" and especially \\"Life's a B****\\" are weak. The former is a clean version while the beat that Rockwilder provided for the latter is one that's better suited for the new Nas, not Illmatic Nas. Fortunately, the disc also contains two new tracks, the Large Professor-produced \\"Star Wars\\" and the Marley Marl-laced \\"On the Real\\", which both show that Nas still got it. So with that, let's stop talking about Illmatic all the time and focus on Nas as of present because he still has skills. -EJR"},{"rating":"2","title":"Remixes ARE good - don't believe the hype","review":"Man...the 4 remixed tracks are worth the purchase.

The album was created in 1994 what do you expect?

Don't get me wrong, I like Illmatic a lot, I just wish people would give more credit to Nas' other work. Illmatic is plain and simply a TREND. People call it the \\"best\\" so people will think they're \\"Hip Hop\\"... The album IS worth the money, no doubt.. but \\"It Was Written\\" and \\"I Am...\\" are too. I Am is my favorite.. but on the other hand Nastradamus was disapointing. But as far as Nas' first peice goes, I wish people would stop calling it better than it is, and calling the other albums trash.

This album really does showcase \\"Nas'\\" street-wise mentality and his superior thirst for knowledge with a vast amount of extended vocabulary used in every line he hits.

A creative song and beat, made into a classic.Then we see the hustle and bustle, survival-of-the-fittest rhymes that Nas spits in \\"N.Y. State Of Mind.\\" In fact, this is one of his best songs featured in rap magazine, XXL's April 2004 article, \\"Who's the New King of New York.\\".One of the dope beats that Nas shows now is in \\"Memory Lane.\\" A tribute to Ill Will (the record label named after his desceased best friend).Illmatic is the real-hardcore album we need to hear today, because rappers like 50 Cent and Big Tymers are only talking about jewels.

For some reason I still cant figure out, I slept on this album for about 5 years after it was released.Of course, I heard all the talk about how it was the best hip hop album ever made, so one day I picked it up.I was impresed. I dont think it ranks at the top of the overall list, but this album is extraordinary in its own right.The entire album flows together, showcasing a blessed poet rhyming over music. Cuts like Halftime and N.Y. State of Mind paint vivid pictures of Nasir Jones young life. The standout Lifes a Bit** with AZ is a hip hop jewel shinier than most. While Nas' recent releases Stillmatic and Gods Son are quality recordings, it would take an absolutely perfect album to eclipse this as Nas' best effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"Illmatic is considered to be one of the best lyrical masterpeices that ever came out of the rap game, and if you hear the CD, the chances are slim that you will think otherwise. But besides Nas' detailed rhymes of life in the slums, what the critics forgot to say is that the songs themselves sound good. All I heard about this CD before I got it was that the lyrics were incredible, but after buying it, I saw that the album also had some phat beats. Out of the 10 tracks, there's not one I skip over. Illmatic lives up to its words and is still a CD you can blast on your radio. A must have.

I see that has changed. First the seat is designed for someone with really short legs, all the way back and your knees are stiil in your chest. To empty the bagger you have to tip the seat ahead. Since I mow when the grass is wet(Live in WA), the tube plugs up often. But it is not designed to disconnect from the mower easly.The blades are made from to soft of steel and bend too easily. So if you hit any gravel or other obstuction, you end up with a bent blade and an uneven cut. They don't offer a heavy duty blade. I wouldn't recommend using on anything but smooth level ground."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still 1 star really would give 0","review":"Yes, MTD owns the companies that make a lot of mowers/tractors ie - Cub Cadet, YARDman, Bolens, MTD brand, etc. That is why I'm looking at Husqvarna and Kubota.

Very nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dawson & Joey","review":"Well, after watching the show for six years, I can't believe the ending. In one word: horrible. There is no doubt that the first two season where built around Dawson & Joey, and their relationship. Season's 3-6, it was like they were so close to getting back together, but for some reason they never did. It is obvious that throughout, it was Joey running from Dawson, not Pacey. Kevin Williamson wrote two drafts for Dawson & Joey to end up together, and though he doesn't say in the commentary, the WB ordered that Joey & Pacey end up together.If the WB want's the show a certin way, (what to wear, hair style, whom ending up with whom) the writers must do what the WB asks. So for all you Joey & Pacey fans, just remember that it was writtin twice for Dawson & Joey, and only cause of the WB it didn't happen."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it","review":"I think it's very sad to have the show ending...but I must say, the finale was great. I was very happy with joey's decision in the ending...and it was cute. They should have kept the scenes with andie in it. Yes!!! andie WAS suppose to be in the finale but due to the time problems, they cut her off. Actually they should have made everyone come back for like a little gathering thing. I miss Drue from season 4...and I wonder how Gretchen turned out. Although I don't like the ... part, I still think that buying this dvd is a must for everyone who watches the show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved the ending","review":"I have not seen all the six seasons yet but I just had to skip to the end.It was beautifully done and answered all my questions.I loved the way it tied up all the loose ends.Even with the sadness that was to come they still made a happy ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Show","review":"The last 6 years culminate in this 2 hour finale. As a diehard Joey/... fan, I am obviously disappointed with the ending (so ... gets Joey, and ... gets...Steven Spielberg? That's NOT an ending.). However, I hope that the alternate ending they are promising is one that I will wear out over and over again since...I can only imagine that it must be my version of the show. Whatever the case, this was beautifully acted, and having Kevin Williamson back encapsulated the Dawson's Creek magic that had been severely lacking from seasons 5 and 6. Michelle Willams still makes me cry every time I see this finale, and I hope the alternate scenes bring in Meredith Monroe (Andie McPhee) because she was sorely missed these last 2 seasons (Wasn't she supposed to start Harvard in Season 6? Shouldn't she have been with the gang again?) Anyway, here's hoping! And Season 2 (THE BEST SEASON) is coming out soon too, so go get that."},{"rating":"1","title":"D/J","review":"I have read many reviews here, but there is one thing everyone is leaving out. Kevin Williamson explains that he wanted Andie in the entire finale not just one 90 second scene with Pacey. He explains that the show was writtin to have Pacey & Andie end up together, and Dawson & Joey end up together. It would not have worked to have Pacey & Andie, who haven't talked in 7 years (going back to season 4) sit down for one scene, and have them end up together. Andie was working on another movie at the time and could only stay for one day.So the re-writing that Williamson did, not just for the second hour, but for most of the finale didn't have much to do with letting the story take him where it should. He was left with no other choice. A Pacey/Andie ending would have been far better than a Pacey/Joey ending anyway.After all I think Pacey & Joey are on world war1000 by now. And we can't forget how Pacey feels when he is around Joey. \\"When I'm With You I Feel Like I'm Nothing\\"Now that's chemistry!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DC fan","review":"I have always been a dawson's creek fan, and while it really didn't matter to me who ended up with who. I must admit that the Dawson Joey moments, weather they were together or just friends where always magic. Yes, they did fight a lot, but it was no more than Pacey & Joey fought during season 4. It was moments like the graduation episode where Joey had Dawson read her the letter her mother wrote for her, or the final epside of season 4 where they kissed at the very end right before Dawson left for college. When Dawson showed up at Joeys door, at the end of the first episode of season 5 always gives me chills.While Dawson was always my favorite, and the finale was So-So,I think it was a little rushed, Williamson wrote the entire script in 8 hours, because he was working on other movies at the time. I just hope when 7th heaven ends, that finale will be much better and have a little more thought put into it."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unfortunate misstep.","review":"A show that was to define an entire new genre in its first season goes out on in the exact fashion it sought to lampoon, punctuated by an ending that invalidates the premise that was at the very heart of the show.

Best to turn the spigot off here and redirect those hard earned funds toward something that kept its integrity and stayed true to its heart, such as Shout Factory's \\"My So Called Life\\" or the pre-Star Trek J.J.

I cryed many time during the two hours the show took place. It was amazing! I was happy about everything, except of course, Jen's death.In all the episodes, Jack couldn't keep a boyfriend. I was thrilled that Jack finally had someone who loved him, and who he loved. I never saw Doug as a boyfriend for Jack, but I did always like him. And when they got together in the first half I was suprised, but happy. But when they broke up I was mad again. But in the second half they got back together and I was happy again. Good job Jack.I want to thank all the writers who could give Joey, Jack, Dawson, Jen, Andie, Pacey, and Audrey the perfect life you made for them.If you like Dawson's Creek at all, you need to see this Finale!So in honor of a great Finale, I have to say one thing: \\"Say goodnight, not goodbye.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Kevin Williamson should have ended the show as he originally intended-with Dawson and Joey getting together.

Season 1 and 2 were great, and then it quickly went down hill."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST ENDING EVER","review":"Joey should have ended up with Dawson, not Pacey.Joey and Dawson's relationship was the through line of the entire show. By having Joey ending up with Pacey, it discredits the first couple of seasons... it makes the entire series... pointless.I bought the first season on DVD but when I saw the season finale, I took it back to the store. I can't watch the show anymore... which is so disappointing, because it was SO GOOD up until the last episode.I was hoping ther would be an alternate ending where Joey ended up with Dawson, but there isn't.... very, very disappointing.

The cliff-hanger at the end was quite satisfying. Even though I knew some about the basic plot, the superb acting by the entire cast overshadowed my prior knowledge of the outcome. Michelle Williams delivered a particularly stunning performance. I was deeply moved. If you have only one DC episode in your DVD collection, this should be it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not enough Joey and Pacey","review":"I had read online that there were more Joey and Pacey scenes that had been trimmed or not even filmed because of time restraints. Sadly, as far as the two of them go, what you saw in the broadcast version is mostly what you get. The extra stuff was fun, and I enjoyed the commentary, but I wish that there had been more...maybe scripts to the previous versions that Kevin Williamson talks about in the commentary. Also, I wish they had an option to play only the broadcast scenes as that version was better in some respects (pacing for example)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is this Pacey's Creek???","review":"Now as much as I love Pacey, I believe that the show was called Dawson's Creek. Which is why DAWSON should have gotten Joey, but either way, I don't think Kevin Williamson would have done that had he written the entire series. I mean, he certainly would NOT have made Joey and Dawson a mere one night stand. If you watch season one and two, you know that Dawson and Joey were MEANT for each other no matter what...I guess I am still mad about everything they had to endure and wind up having nothing! If Mr. Leery had not died, the show would have turned out much different. Anyways, I thought this was the perfect way to go, in the future so that we don't really know the whole story, there is a lot left up to our minds and no matter what, this is the story of three best friends..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool Product It Works","review":"I love this product..

I loved him in Much Ado About Nothing, and especially in Peter's Friends, but it seemed that right before this his hammy acting started taking over his personae. I think maybe him in Frankenstein ruined him on me, but this truly took the cake. He is way too over the top in this performance as the Danish prince, when so many have done better versions. I felt the film followed his lead with some bright shining moments, particularly Jack Lemmon and Billy Crystal. Hamlet is my favorite of the Bard's plays, but this was much too Hollywood for my eyes. Rent Olivier's or even Mel Gibson's version, or better still rent the very clever Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead, penned by Tom Stoppard of Shakespeare in Love fame. It is the most clever movie ever made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Hamlet","review":"Kenneth Branagh's reputation as the golden boy of Shakespearean actors crashed with this over-done Hamlet. There's a good reason why no sane producer actually uses all of the text un-cut. It's a six hour slog--and I say this as a literature professor, not as a surly student. In terms of acting, Branagh again misses the mark, looking very old to be Denmark's young prince. Added to the grinding length and mis-cast lead, the special effects here (green screen work, mostly) would embarrass your local weather man.For an understated but elegant alternative, check out Kevin Kline's Hamlet."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this video-- an excellent representation of \\"Hamlet\\"","review":"I have viewed both this video and Mel Gibson's portayal of Hamlet. I think that Brannaugh did a much better job of representing Hamlet with so much passion and no evidence of an Oedipus complex which I found revolting in Mel Gibson's portrayal of this character. This version provides an accurate account of the entire script where more detail and passion was input into the overall production. I have viewed each version mentioned here twice, and I would watch Brannaugh again and again. He is captivating, and I feel very talented in Literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST Hamlet EVER","review":"Anything Kenneth Branagh commits to film is excellent, and his appreciation for the beauty of language and the stage makes his productions of Shakespeare no exception.Branagh's rendering of the grief stricken Hamlet is stellar, and his direction of this well-known tragedy is, without a doubt, the most true to the play's script that I have ever seen. I suspect were the Bard to view this incomparable interpretation, he would be quick to shout \\"Bravo\\" and to grant Branagh his approval."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning","review":"Wow!

Not only is Branagh's performance extremly inspiering, it is also most convincing. I have definetly found a new love for Shakespear's work. This version of Hamlet show's what enthusiasim for a piece of art can do to a play. I am only sad that it is now unavailible to buy, because it is definetly a video that deserves to be in everyone's video collection, especially mine. I hope they re-realease it soon.

By far, the best interpretation of a Shakespearean play on film and the first (and likely last) full-text film of Hamlet. The intro by Kenneth Branagh gives props to the multi-year, on-line campaign by fans of this film to get it out on DVD and the running commentary is informative without being invasive/distracting. The cast, the set, and the direction/editing are all flawless. If Laurence Olivier were alive today, he would have re-made Hamlet just like this.

He made shakespeare real, brought meaning to the dialog in a way that no other actor has or perhaps will. Henry V is the finest on screen portrayal of a any shakespearean play. I adored Hamlet, but I felt it was slightly OTT, vaudevillian and camp. However, I hate to be critical of a piece that reaches for perfection.

Branaugh is as silly and self-important ever, playing Hamlet (of course -- Branaugh *must* be the star) as a prissy brat, making it more difficult than usual to empathize (much less sympathize) with him and his plight. The sets are lavish and some of the other actors do quite well in their roles. Certain scenes are given interesting and creative twists, and all in all it is clear that a lot went into the making of this. That's worth something. But it isn't enough, especially once you get to the absolutely ludicrous, over-the-top climax (the climax of the play itself is fine, it's just the way Branaugh does it that's awful.) A well-intended, colorfully painted, but ultimately overrated version of Hamlet."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD UNBOX!!!","review":"The download is bad, very bad.

He not only nails Hamlet the character, but he also nails Hamlet the movie - as a director. K.B. proves his mettle once again as the incomparable Shakespeare aficionado of our day.Having just watched both K.B.'s and Laurence Olivier's versions back-to-back, I can unequivocally state that Branagh's emerges as not only more complete, but more enlightening as well. Whereas Olivier leaves out Fortinbras entirely as well as countless lines, Branagh leaves you begging for more Shakespeare to be brought to the big screen - Macbeth would be nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"I know the title lacks some inspiration, but so does this movie.

It is great for a first-time Shakespeare experience or a wonderful reminder for life-long lovers of Shakespeare as to why he is considered a playwright that transcends time.Kenneth Branagh is so superb in the lead role, and his very close supporting cast, seem born for the bard. But nobody makes Shakespeare come alive like Kenneth Branagh, as a director, a producer, an actor or any combination of the three. As Shakespeare had the Midas touch in his ability to make people, places and events become real, Branagh brings them to life. Not just in \\"Hamlet\\", but in other works he has brought to the silver screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sue O'Donoghue","review":"At last, at last, at last - although I had to buy it from the States, as Amazon UK don't stock it! Unbelievable, I know.Anyway, the film is a feast of fine acting - if you try to ignore Charlton Heston and Jack Lemmon, who are, I'm afraid, quite dreadful. Apart from that, this dvd is over four hours of Shakespearian bliss! Branagh is my hero, he has helped me to show my children how wonderful the Bard's works can be, when they are presented with such natural honesty, and when they have not been too changed. There really is no need to present Shakespeare in gangland New York or in a post-apocalyptic wasteland!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable ham-fest!!!","review":"I found this movie almost impossible to watch. To be sure, there are some incredible performances here, turned in by some legendary actors. But Branaugh manages to ruin the film with his obnoxious over-the-top ham acting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Hamlet","review":"I recently watched this, along with the Laurence Olivier and Mel Gibson films. I thought this was by far the worst. Most of the actors sounded like they were reading Hamlet, rather than being the characters. The worst by far was Jack Lemmon. How in the world could a great comedic actor be allowed to embarrass himself with such a ridiculous performance. Not only was he too old for the role, but he sounded like an old American reading Hamlet for the first time. It was painful to watch. Robin Williams looked like Robin Williams doing stand-up.I also did not like the memory flashbacks. The audience is capable of imagining what 'poor Yorick' looked like as he bore Hamlet on his back. We didn't need for the film makers to act out the memory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad costuming choice.","review":"This is an Elizabethan play with Elizabethan language.

This is not meant pejoratively, but Branagh's Hamlet is an assault on the senses. He brays and he mews and he mugs for the camera. Where are the grace notes? How can the Dane be such an unsympathetic character? Winslet's Ophelia is a raving hysteric, Polonius a caricature of a hypocrite, Lemmon woefully miscast, his line readings leaden. The soundtrack, always intrusive, at time overwhelms the dialogue. Bigger is not necessarily better. Give me Olivier, even Gibson, any day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stuff & Nonsense","review":"Ill-assorted actors costumed for Chekhov, in a setting passable for Sheridan, sound insane by mouthing the language of Shakespeare, and wander in a chaos of acting styles through mechanical scenes lacking pace or structural purpose. No detail of the play is allowed to be natural or genuine: Hamlet's father, for instance, is a flying statue obviously errant from \`Don Giovanni' until he turns into huge talking head reminiscent of Miss Piggy (which at least justifies the guards who announce him with techniques ranging from \`Beyond the Fringe' to \`Murder She Wrote'), before disappearing into silly special effects lifted from \`Ghost Busters.' It sad to see so many talented people wasting their time, and sadder still to have spent more than twenty-five cents to watch them doing so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best rendition of Hamlet ever","review":"I can only echo the responses of so many other viewers.

Kenneth Branagh stars as Hamlet. He also adapted and directed this beautifully realized version that's set in the 19th century world. Quite different from Lawrence Olivier's 1944 film, this 1996 version of the timeless tale of sex, murder, ghosts, corruption and revenge is set in lavishly mirrored, gilded interiors. Along with Branagh, the cast includes, Julie Christie, Kate Winslett, Derek Jacobi, Billy Crystal, Jack Lemmon, Robin Williams, Charlton Heston and others. Shot in 65mm film and exhibited in Panavision Super 70, the glory of the ravishing hi-def disc is a site to behold. This is the definitive film adaptation of Shakespeare's longest (4 hours), and perhaps greatest, play. \\"Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.\\" Thankfully for us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get it out on DVD!","review":"I can't believe that after nine years since its release, \\"Hamlet\\" isn't yet on DVD.

Warner bros, please hear my plea: get this out on DVD now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Branagh does it again!","review":"Branagh does some great Shakespeare. This film is close to the original script and not modernized, which I like. Anytime Branagh does a Shakespeare film, you know it will be good."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite movies!","review":"This version of Hamlet is excellent. At around four hours the movie requires some determination to watch, but if you like Shakespeare it doesn't seem like that long, really. I can't rate it a perfect 5 stars because some of the actors just shouldn't be here - Jack Lemmon is horrible, and some of the other acting is questionable, but the parts of Hamlet, Claudius, Gertrude, the gravedigger, and many others are, in my opinion, great to watch. My favorite scene is when Hamlet has the players stage his mini play-within-a-play, The Mousetrap, to confirm for himself the guilt of Claudius in old Hamlet's death. Here Branagh really shines - every time I watch it I have to rewind it a couple of times just because the scene is so fun to watch. Kate Winslet is excellent as Ophelia, especially when she begins to lose her mind. Rent the movie once at least, and if you like it as much as I did, you'll have to buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth every penny","review":"fabulous! especially watch and listen to Branagh discussing the movie!This movie has clarified so much about the play that i recommend it for first time Hamlet viewers,"},{"rating":"2","title":"hamlet","review":"The whole play. what really went on in Denmark?

In this one he created a surreal set with past, present, and future all mixed-up together. He brought so many different extras that it looked like a circus. I understand that this was supposed to heighten the sence of madness and chaos in Danish Kingdom, but he went too far... I mean, five hours of this circus, give me a break! He tried to pile too many ideas together and as a result the film turned out to be some sort of a thick, chewy stuff that never ends... I have seen three other Hamlets on screen and I am sorry to say this is not the best one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfection","review":"Absolutely fantastically amazingly superb. And that's all I have to say. Well, not all exactly. The acting was positively outstanding, the costumes greatly superior to those in the Zeffirelli version, and, unlike the aforementioned Franco Zeffirelli film (which also has its good points, like Mel Gibson's acting), it's all there in order. The actor playing Polonius was much better than the other version as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Full Hamlet","review":"Whatever your views on different versions of Hamlet on film (and there are lots of them), this one is a must, a benchmark. In addition to its excellent, well-known actors (including Kate Winslet's debut), it gives us every line of Shakespeare's original. In other words, this is a great starting point and/or reference point for viewing other versions, and a major achievement by the directing team.The commentary is also very good, and well-worth listening to as you go through the play. All in all, an excellent DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb adaptation of Hamlet","review":"Kenneth Branagh has done a remarkable job with this version of Hamlet. The scenery and costumes are dazzling, the performances remarkable, and the play itself is fully intact--no odd cuts or editing here.

Of all the Shakespeare films I have seen, this is my favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"To watch or not to watch","review":"I've seen three versions of Hamelt, this version if I must give a rating is a 2 star at best, without a doubt the best version of Hamlet is the Mel Gibson version.

Forget long overly-dramatic soliloquies that, while brilliant, can put you to sleep. Now the clever lines are delivered with witt and passion in a real and alive setting. The acting is superb. Kate Winslet is a gorgeous and believable Ophelia, refusing to play the role as an indifferent ninny but rather with a pitiable sensuality. Kenneth Branagh perfectly portrays the role of disturbed Hamlet. His excellent understanding of the complex character shines through every line he delivers.In addition, we get lavish sets, ornate costumes, a star-studded cast, and a sword-clashing, heart-pounding, tear-jerking finale.

The only thing I remember from each of them is his patented, wimpy soliloquies. He does every one of them the same, ending each line with an unpleasant intonation, as if every line were a question. Maybe he was wondering what he was going to look like on screen when he recited the lines, rather than concentrating on becoming the part.

To be honest, though, Branagh simply did not work for me as Hamlet. Too old, too blond. Also, I don't know why he thought it would be a good idea to cast big-name American actors in minor parts--Robin Williams is kind of amusing as Osric, but most of them look glaringly out-of-place. On the plus side, Jacobi was typically briliant as Claudius (an intentional joke based on his starring role in the excellent I, Claudius?), and I absolutely *loved* the guy who played Fortinbras--talk about radiating menace! All in all, it's a worthy film, although at four bloody hours it's a bit of an endurance test. Also, it does not in fact feature the play's script in its entirety--I noticed at least one medium-sized speech that was conspicuous by its absense.What we *really* need is a Branagh King Lear.

The sets are stunning and the music enhances the action probably beyond what the bard himself could have imagine.The casting of Branagh regulars, Derek Jacobi as Claudius (narrator in Henry V) Brian Blessed as the ghost of Hamlet (Duke of Exeter in Henry V) is amazing. To top that off he adds Billy Crystol as the grave digger, Robin Williams as the fop Osric, Laetes second in the duel, and Depardeau as Polonius's servent are splendid.It's hard to believe that a 4 hour movie can so completely absorb you but this one does."},{"rating":"1","title":"No longer works","review":"We have purchased two of these over the last 18 months and both have quit working after about 8 months of use.

I give this book 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the time","review":"Our who family was very disappointed with this move. the characters were horrible and obvious things to do, like run or move when in their situation.very unhappy with this movie.it was dubbed in English, and a lot is usually lost during translations. so maybe that could be a factor.I would not recommend this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Family Dinner...","review":"If you enjoy the gooshier works of Lucio Fulci (ZOMBIE, CITY OF THE LIVING DEAD, THE BEYOND, HOUSE BY THE CEMETERY), or any cannibal classics like CANNIBAL APOCALYPSE, then you should love THE LAST HOUSE IN THE WOODS! It's a true homage / throwback film loaded w/ blood, unraveling intestines, and a chaotic sense of insanity! Don't expect an art film! This is a squishy splatter extrava-gonzo! Recommended for entrail enthusiasts only..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I will NEVER buy a GH underground movie again!","review":"This was probably the worst movie that i spent 11 bucks on!The whole thing was voiced over (originally in italian) and the fake blood was terrible and the plot was so screwed you couldn't follow it. One second its one thing and the next a quadriplegic is being hugged by a cannibal! Its so bad that it can't even be considered as one of those cheesy movies that you watch with your friends. I'm so upset by how i wasted money on this movie, anytime someone even brings up GH underground, I want to hurl!"},{"rating":"1","title":"GORE, GORE AND MORE GORE-THAT'S ALL","review":"An Italian Dario Argento knock-off but without Argentos' style and talent.The flimsy plot is just an excuse for amputations, dis-embowelments,throat cutting, shots to the head, knifings and a 8 year old cannibal. And a couple of Italian, deformed, redneck mongoloids(also cannibals).I rated this junk 2 stars because it succeeded in its intentions to be over the top gory and gross-but the movie is crap.Body count-12 viewer 0"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid...just plain stupid!","review":"Im sorry to the seller I ordered this movie from. Yall did a great job in getting the movie to me immediately and as described and I hate to ruin future business with good people but the movie was total crap. I tend to think \\"well might as well buy it for the price I can rent it\\" well I wish I had never seen this movie on the list at all. Terrible scripting, Terrible acting, terrible camera, terrible storyline!!! Had a couple of gory scenes if you like a movie just for that, but I would definately recommend not buying/renting this movie. Out of everything I ordered at one time this is what I was mostly excited about seeing but all copies of this need to be buried somewhere way \\"underground\\" and far far away I think."},{"rating":"2","title":"Argento would be proud","review":"This is one of those movies that you have to\\"get\\". What I mean is the way it was filmed and the score of the movie was an obvious homage to the great Italian Directors of our time(Argento, Fulci,)and although the storyline seems old hat and cliched, the way they execute the film makes you feel like you are actually watching an old Giallo movie from the 80's.I think this Director did a fine job and I am proud to have this in my dvd collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Last Movie On the Shelf","review":"I wouldn't watch this garbage again if it was the last movie on the shelf! I like independent horror movies, but this is just plain LOUSY! I don't know how in the world it garnered 5 stars.The production value is non-existent. It looks like it was filmed by some high school kids who had nothing better to do and sure didn't know what they were doing.The story is equally as bad. I got the impression they were writing this as they were filming.The acting? What acting.And the special effects, well, yes, there's a bunch of red stuff spilled and the chopped off limbs are gory, but they look like someone just went to one of those haunted houses you pay to go through at Halloween and filmed there. Shoddy, shoddy, shoddy.Needless to say, in my humble opinion, this movie sucks big time. What a total waste of money and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's last in my list.","review":"This movie is really bad, and not bad in a good way. I enjoy lots of bad horror movies, but this one is just a bad movie. It could be dubbing of the original movie from Italian to English, but the movie makes no sense. The \\"acting\\" is perhaps the worst acting I have ever seen in a movie. The only good scenes in the entire movie are the buckets of blood used during the last 10 minutes of the movie. Don't buy this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unhappy with the product/service","review":"I received my costume a couple of days before Halloween. The bag it was in indicated that it was size 2-4, but the actual product was size 24 months. I sent an email and called right away, and never heard back from the company. Because it was so close to Halloween and I didn't have time to exchange it we used the shell and had to buy something else to wear with it. I still have never heard from the company and won't buy from them again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I ordered this for my 2 1/2 year old for Halloween. The item I ordered stated the product was a size 2T. When the package arrived I attempted to put it on my child only to find out the size of the spandex suit they sent was 6 MONTHS!! It is too close to Halloween to return the costume for a new size so I will have to find something to replace the spandex suit. The shell, gloves, and boots all fit and appear to be the correct size. Do not buy from this company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pink SLVR Motorola Cell Phone","review":"I shouldn't have bought a used cell phone. The seller said it was in very good condition.

A poor investment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to Gene Watson's standard","review":"This video smacks of someone having the rights to the video and putting it out on DVD to make a quick buck. Don't be fooled by the recent pictures on the cover of the DVD. The footage is very old; I would say the early 80's based upon the clothes styles. The editing of the video is very amateurish, often breaking in a few notes after the songs have started. I suspect the sound is in mono. The 4 songs by \\"special guest\\" Denice Price at the end appear tacked on just to add to the run time. Despite this, the quality of Gene's voice does come shining through. Gene Watson is arguably the best pure singer in country music. He deserves better than this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really??","review":"How can anyone complain about this dvd - quality, etc.? Gene is so awesome live and this is a rare glimpse of it (no autotune needed)!The way he sings My Farewell Party is incredible, one of the best live country performances EVER!This dvd is only ten bucks and well worth it to watch and hear the master at work.Hey Country Music Hall of Fame... it's amazing how you haven't inducted Gene when he sings circles around most that are inducted?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous book","review":"If you want a book that shows you amateur pictures of t---'s, than this is the book. If not, then don't waste your money. A friend of mine, gave me this book and I should have choked her instead of thank her. The silly book is for readers with minds the size of peanuts, it talks about the different sizes and shapes of breasts, but with no sense or meaning. It's just a book about breasts, nothing informative and certainly nothing educational."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Christmas Together is a Treasure","review":"I love the muppets and remember this Holiday show with John Denver. I had the LP and now I have the CD to play at home and in my car!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Survivor","review":"This is a GREAT book by the Ultimate Adventurer/Explorer, John Goddard. The book covers many daring and dangerous activities that many would not even attempt. Goddard's living-on-the-edge lifestyle will definitely leave you on the edge-of-your-seat with his thrilling brushes with potential death. A must read. Also, his book \\"Kayaks Down the Nile\\" is equally thrilling...in both books you'll be shaking your head asking yourself,\\" HOW did he ever live through it?\\" Simply...he IS the ultimate survivor! I couldn't put the books down until the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful! Not what I expected from the title.","review":"I was very disappointed in this book on many levels. First, the techniques Ms. Ross employs remind me of the old paint-by-number paintings I did as a kid. Awful!! Next, she uses all three mediums in each piece, with watercolor being the dominant medium. Her subject matter is very limited and to my eye, was not in the least \\"realistic\\". I really can't find anything of any use whatsoever in this book. Save your money! The one thing it DID teach me was never to buy a techniques book based on it's cover and title again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading Title","review":"Although the artist, Sueellen Ross, is very talented, I was disapointed with the book. It's title should say \\"Paint Radiant Realistic Animals\\" or something similar because thats all you get. I was hoping for a variety of subjects, like scenery, buildings, still lifes etc, but it's all animals. An excellent book if you want to paint animals, especiialy cats and dogs. Definatley not what I wanted though. I'll be returning mine!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, Informative","review":"Thank you Suellen for sharing your wonderful talent! The book gave me a new inspiration and enthusiasm for my art."},{"rating":"2","title":"A quick read - packed with information","review":"As a builder, I wish I had the information in this book a long time ago. I was especially impressed how in one chapter Foreman shows and proves that the more you charge customers, the happier they get. Good job! Even though some of the sarcasm and jokes make it seem like light reading, this book has some real meat to it. I recommend it to anyone seasoned or not dealing in the construction industry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review by a 13-Year old Romanov buff","review":"This was a beautifully drawn and colored book and had excellent colors and selections!It was fun to cut out to!!I recommend this book to any one who likes the Romanovs or OTMA!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Would have been nice if i actually got the book.","review":"These folks are really crooked.

There is little quality in this book when it comes to GBP. While there is information in there about some struggles and what it was like for her, the \\"meat\\" of the book was about her posing in playboy, and being in love. The crude language remained, although it was not as bad as her first book, \\"Gut Feelings.\\" I was going to sell these on eBay, but I think I will just give them away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"so so","review":"I really enjoyed reading about Carnie's experience because I have also had WLS. She offers great ideas, although I caution you that one should always talk to his/her own Dr. and not just taking her advice. Anyway, my complaint with her book is that she is sooooo inlove and sooooo happy all the time. It seems as if this was a panacea. Yes, I am happy and I have had great results from WLS, but it isn't all peaches and cream. In fact, there are many days that I don't even want to face the world. She seems to glamorize the surgery too much and she talks about her wonderful, fantastic, amazing husband too much! Enough already- we get it you're happy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Carnie does it again!","review":"I just finished this book. Her first book was great but this one was awesome! I had gastric bypass surgery in Aug of 2001. Carnie truly is an inspiration! This book talks about how losing all the weight does not magically fix all our personal problems. She tells it like it is and doesn't hold back. I think it is awesome that she decided to accept Playboy's offer to pose. You go girl!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Journey Worth Taking","review":"I throughly enjoyed this book. Carnie is very funny and she gives a personal and detailed story that is shared by many. The personal point of view was greatly welcomed. I loved her humor and her insight. She shared herself in a way that I would be afraid to. She shed light on many issues that we as obese people usually overlook or ignore. Carnie is a very brave and inspiring person. Everyone considering having WLS should read this very personal story. Anyone that has had the WLS and does not have any support should also read this book. This is not only a story but a helpful guide into a brave new world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Odyssey White hot","review":"The White hot XG is fantastic. The balance of this club has taken a 50 putt player to a 30 putt player in the space of a few months. The smooth swing it allows gives you great alignment and balance which are the keys to good putting. The face is clean and it is solid on impact giving it a great feel...I would recommend the Odyssey White hot to anyone looking to shave a few points off their handicap."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"This was to be a replacement for my current Leighton umbrella which has performed well for over 12 years. I had to send this one back because the shaft did not collapse easily; it was nearly impossible to fold up the umbrella and tuck it into its protective sleeve; and the knob cut into my hand. Additionally, the fabric seemed a bit flimsy and the umbrella was wobbly when I held it. On a positive note, the umbrella is lightweight and the peacock print is cheery. However, I'm left to wonder if Leighton is cutting corners."},{"rating":"1","title":"wrong item","review":"the item was supposed to be red white polka dots it was plain red very unhappy dont have patience to return"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Purchase","review":"I LOVED the pattern on this umbrella so I was very excited for it to arrive.Even for a mini umbrella it is cheaply made.The material is very thin so the only time this umbrella would be useful is in a very very light rain. If a gust of wind came suddenly, no more umbrella!The metal frame is extremely weak.Even an umbrella hat is made tougher!I am so sorry I wasted the money! I was going to send it back but calculating the price it just wouldn't be worth it! I would be spending as much to return it as I did to receive it which in total is equal to the amount of the darn umbrella!Go for a better brand!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only worth it to watch Urban","review":"I saw this so I could watch Karl Urban, a very talented New Zealand actor. But it really wasn't worth the time spent. The movie relied too much on violence and shock to get its point across, and you get treated to a few scenes replayed over and over and over again. The plot was hard to follow, and the whole thing just seemed unlikely, especially as the characters had a range of accents, from American to Kiwi (New Zealand) One of the things that bothered me the most is that I wasn't able to figure out where the film was supposed to be taking place. On the other hand, Martin Donovan was more than interesting, and I'd be interested in seeing some of his other films."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great quality and service","review":"I'm very pleased with the quality and beauty of this tang horse.

One is Donald Pleasence as Doctor Sam Looomis. He's become like Captain Ahab in that he's still wants to catch that elusive white whale. Or in this case, a white masked killer whom has consumed his life. The other thing are the two cops who act as a kinda comic relief. Pity they bite the dust. Other than that, this movie is hardly worth the effort. Especially the little plot hole of having a different house for the Michael's old home from the first two movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good adition to the saga","review":"I really don't know why people didn't enjoy this one. It's one thing if you never liked them for the start but I can't see why a Halloween fan wouldn't like this one. I hadn't seen Halloween 4 yet so I hadn't seen Jamie at all and I though she was mute in the first place. It was kind of confusing when she would see Michael because nobody knew if it was a dream or if he was really there. One thing stupid was that they left Jamie in a room with a cop who was so dumb he didn't have enough sense to take his gun out. Jamie was lucky that Michael didn't kill her but he got her in the next one. Loomis was seeming crazy but once you realized what he was doing he seemed a genius. He should have died when Michael stabbed him though. That old man can survive more than Michael can himself. This was a good movie and all horror movie lovers should see."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS MOVIE SUCKS","review":"A DISCRACE TO THE HALLOWEEN LEGACY. THIS SERIES SHOULD HAVE ENDED AT 2.

Jamie is back ! She still does a wonderful job as playing herself as a 10 year old girl. Alot of fright in this movie, and I think that it is an instant classic! I love Halloween 5. please rent it or own it, If you like the Halloween series and love all scary movies you will love this one !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Michael's still alive and kill'in!","review":"Well what can I say this movie is awsome.there are only 3 bad things 1st.Michael's mask is differint. The myers house is differint and That shadowy figure kicked the little dog.yeah.And I was mildly ammused when Jamie stopped Michael so easly and others (such as the good docter) can shoot him stab him what ever. well all in all I say this movie is great so go buy it or the boogieman will pitch fork ya.sweet dreams."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Picture, Great Audio","review":"This new remaster of Halloween 5 looks and sounds great. New details in almost every scene really flesh out exactly how great this film's cinematography is and all the distinct stylistic choices the director made. I especially like when two characters are trying visit a little girl at the hospital and you can clearly see Michael Myers looming in the background. Now you could always tell he was there, but i bet you never noticed he had a weapon in each hand! (if you did, congratulations!)Also the new audio sounds fantastic, and is much better than the audio on the Halloween 4 bluray. Included in this release is a commentary with H5's Michael Myers' himself, Don Shanks, and the info he has to share is priceless, including talking about deleted death scenes, and how he speaks on how the film was described to him, making some of this info very interesting and valuable to fellow fans.The bonus features aren't spectacular but whatever, I'm just happy to have to the bluray."},{"rating":"2","title":"Halloween 5 was the last great one before the series went to shit","review":"Halloween 4 and 5 are IMHO the last good ones in the series with solid acting and a decent story, I think despite what others say part 5 was really good although the man in black character was a little hokey but it doesnt ruin the film when dimension got ahold of the series it just seemed to go downhill from part 6 to the rob zombie crapfests spare yourself from dissapointment and keep Michael Myers in 1989 :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"very scary and a dark halloween","review":"Halloween 5 leads off where Halloween 4 ended. Though Jamie is unable to talk she knows where Michael Myers is. I'm very sorry to say this, but Rachael does die so early in the movie. Michael Myers is finally unmasked, but you can't really see his face in the movie. A huge suspensful part ends the movie when Michael Myers escapes a dungeon. This is all I'm going to say. So if you want to find out more facts about this movie you'll have to watch it. Just don't watch it alone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Don't waste your money...\\"","review":"Halloween 5 is very ..., and the ending was extremely stupid. The little girl, Jamie, was overall annoying and there is no Jamie Lee Curtis. You don't see Michael's face either, and Donald Pleasence sounded like an old fart on his death bed. Michael killed hardly any people, he just snuck around in their houses and watched 'em, he barely did anything. Try H20 or the original Halloween, don't waste your money on this junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good sequel to Halloween 4","review":"Picking up immediately where Halloween 4 left off, Michael continues to chase his niece with the intent to kill her. We find that his niece now has a telepathic bond to her uncle and can visualize/feel his presence when he is about to kill again. This movie contains more blood and violence than is typical of the Halloween series, but overall I really think it is a great movie to own!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent dvd","review":"This LIMITED EDITION TIN is great.Halloween 5 one of the best of the series looks great on this dvd.There are no grains on the picture,the sound is magnificent and the extra features are great.The documentary has inteerviews with the cast which i really enjoyed,a deleted scene which is also good,and intro's by Danielle Harris and Elle Cornell which i agree with the other reviewer they shouldn't of killed her.The price maybe high but you'll get your moneyes worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Halloween 5 is An \\"ehh\\" kind of movie","review":"This movie was a major dissapointment to me.

To avoid giving away any spoilers, let's just say if you've seen the movie in the theaters and then on video, you know exactly what is missing. And those missing elements, IMHO, gives the video version a much different tone than the theatrical version. I've never been a big fan of any video that has been cut down without informing the viewer as such (hence the rating, my own pet peeve mind you). I have no idea why this was released on video edited...if anyone can tell me, I'd be happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally out of hand","review":"By this movie the Halloween movies are really exhausted and pooped out. The Myers house in this Bomb looks nothing like it did in the first two movies and the town does not look like the original movie either.

This is probably the worst in the series right behind part 6. There are just too many plot holes and the whole thing feels really contrived(even for this type of film!). The sequels don't compare to the original and this one is really confusing and boring at times! It still delivers some shock value here and there, but nothing we haven't seen before. The film transfer is very good though and if your a fan of the series......."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't even attempt to see this one","review":"This movie is even worse than number four.

Oh, the joy of watching this.2) Loomis, acting like a certified paranoid schizophrenic. Oh, the joy of watching this.3) Some teenage girl who obviously did so much coke before filming each scene that she's almost literally climbing up the walls. Oh, the joy...Other than that, some guy in a silly mask walks around doing an imitation of Data from Star Trek. Apparently this is supposed to be scary?

She made Halloween 4 and gets killed a half hour into Halloween 5. What were these people thinking. Yeah, I'd really rather watch a mute pre-teen dressed as a cicus clown and an old man who overacts battle the bad guy. What market research did they pay for to come to that conclusion. Overall, the plot is slow and the movie tiresome. Check out 1,2,4, or H20 for anything worthwhile.With any luck, Ellie Cornell will be resurrected."},{"rating":"1","title":"No sir i did not like it!!","review":"It was a very cheesy movie.

It was good the first time I watched it, but it the other times I watched it, it was boring! That is the reason it gets 2 Stars is for a low re-watchability factor!

It has undertones of a \\"jason\\" type movie and the plot does not make sense when you think about it and also the mysterious way they set up for a sequel was tacky. VERY tacky. The ending was not brilliant, it was stupid, and involved unexplained characters (circular reference to nonsensical plot). Definitely not as good as 1, 4, or 7 (H20). Watch it if like me, you must see every piece of drivel associated with a long running story, but if you want a thriller get either 1 or 4, if you want closure get 7 (H20)."},{"rating":"1","title":"H5: Don't believe the hype, it's not that good.","review":"Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers is a flick that has begun to exhaust the Michael Myers angle...While I felt that H4 was well done and an intelligent horror flick, H5 seemed boring at times and the storyline could've been a lot better...the apparent \\"psychic link\\" between Myers and his niece was cheesy; it brought down the entire Halloween series from a horror icon to a Friday the 13th-like slasher series...If you haven't seen any Halloween flicks, than I'd advise you to see the 1st, 2nd, 4th, and then not expect too much from the final 3, although H20 was better than it's two predecessors."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was a scary movie considering it was the fifth overall","review":"I read this when i was thirteen, and it scared me. for being the fifth installment people may think it may be stupid but it wasnt it was michael myers meets the nineties.

Not scary or suspenseful."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst movie in the series","review":"michael myers is still trying to kill his young neice,like in Halloween 4,but not as good as Halloween 4.This ones a stinker,stay away from this one.Boring!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great entry","review":"michales back agao=in in this chilling sequel this is a dark andd creepy sequel micals very different and creepy theres not to much gore thee actings great thjis is one of the darker and scarier halloween movies the curse of michal myers is ok but then h20 and ressurection camwreally bad h20 curtis is back good only good ressurection is the worst enntry with michal ever"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great movie!","review":"I don't see why people think that this is the worst movie with Michael Myers. I really liked it. People say that they hate it because of his mask. You don't really notice how bad the mask looks like throughout the film. The killings were great. And Donald Pleasence did a great job acting. I suggest you rent or buy this movie, but after you've seen the 4th one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Michael's back once again.","review":"Picking up right from Halloween 4, Halloween 5 was one of the last '80s slasher films and its got high standards of horror. Michael Myers' mask in here is really cool. It looks a little less cheaper than in 4. The mask is still not as good as in 1 and 2. The mask got better in Halloween 6 and Halloween H20. Still the mask is cool. The mysterious Man in Black shows up, and the film is very mysterious with a very mysterious ending. The John Carpenter feel is pretty much lost, but Michael gives us some gruesome deaths and some exciting moments. Still, not as atmospheric or entertaining as Friday the 13th films. Halloween 6 is a little more gruesome and entertaining, and I liked it better, it does bring a lot of things to friction, and Halloween H20 creates some great moments for Michael, but in an atmosphere that ignores 4-6."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stereotypical 80's horror.","review":"This is basically what all 80's horror movies were like. I really did like this movie. Sure, it had it's very slow points, but the great kills made it worth the money. If you are a fan of the Friday The 13th movies, this one is for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah.","review":"I can't be bothered to write out a full review for this. I can't summarize the plot, because there really isn't much of one. Michael wakes up a year after the events of Halloween 4 and begins stalking his niece, Jamie, again. That's it.A mind-bogglingly pointless film, even Donald Pleasance (who doesn't look at all happy to be there) couldn't save this trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"halloween four","review":"very good moviekept you wondering what was going to happen nextmusic was also very good and never missed the action"},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible movie","review":"I have to say that this movie wasnt even worth renting.

THE ENDING WAS TERRIBLE, WHAT AM I SAYING THE WHOLE MOVIE WAS TERRIBLE."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Very boring, probably the worst in the series...\\"","review":"Even though our masked anti-hero, Michael Myers, is in this one quite a lot, this was still boring on so many levels. For one, no Jamie Lee Curtis, two, you don't really see his face. I could go on forever. Donald Pleasence wasn't very good at Dr. Loomis this time, he sounded like he was losing his voice, so I'm guessing they made him play the part while he had a cold. And I got so sick of Michael's neice, Jamie, going nuts every time Michael is about to kill someone, and it...it was just so boring that I stopped it three times. Take my advice folks, don't see this one. Go for such films as Halloween:H20, Jason X, and the original A Nightmare on Elm Street."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure and simple, a sequel for nothing more than more money","review":"The whole pawn of a cult plot is ludicrous and totally takes away the element of evil started and ENDED in parts 1 and 2. Michael's niece having a mind connection with him? Give me a break. They just needed to find some way to keep digging up ole Michael to milk more money from his image and name. Unfortunately, they made another one after this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"good quality","review":"Love it that the saga continues! It was great quality, you would never know that it was made so long ago. Shipped fast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Third best in the series","review":"This is the most underrated horror movie out there. Sure, production was rushed to feed off the crowd of the masterpiece that was Halloween 4, but it is still a good film. It has alot of suspenseful scenes and is twice as good as teh best \\"Friday the 13th\\" movie.Pros: Suspenseful , GREAT acting by Donald Pleasance and Danielle Harris, alot of kills (for those gore-fans) , and still contains that classic horror feelingCons: Early death of Rachel (Ellie Cornell), annoying teenagers, NO Halloween feel, and has an odd ending"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The second best sequel to the Halloween series\\"","review":"\\"Halloween 5\\" was the second best to the Halloween series. The best one was \\"Halloween H20\\". The part when they have sex in the barn was completely unessesary! I mean just blew the story off topic. I was so glad Michael Myers ruined their party! I mean Uh,uh,uh! I just can't stand hearing that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bow down to Michael Myers! Obey!","review":"When I saw this movie, I thought I was gonna turd in my pants! It is one of the best horror films I've ever seen. The suspense killed me with the part when the girl saw Michael Myers in the tree and thought he was chasing her through the house! I am one of those guys who always shout at the tv saying, \\" Run faster! Go, Go!\\" My sister wanted to kill me because she didn't want to watch this film! Finally she watched her own show and I saw the movie, in peace!!!!!!! For all you guys who love horror and suspense, this movie is for you! More power to Michael Myers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"better than IV, not as great as the first this is still a fun little slasher movie","review":"5 opens with the end of part IV without the attack of the foster mom and lommis tring to shot her as he finaly loses his mind. this has michael's niece in home for troubled kids still seeing visions of uncle who, hold the drum roll, is still alive , and coming for her again. they give this a little twist at the end to set up another film that never really happened. give this one a look."},{"rating":"2","title":"the Revenge","review":"Starting with the movie, it's a great continuation from Halloween 4. Our favorite characters rejoin from the last film (at least the living ones) and Donlad Pleasence and Danielle Harris are brillant. As far as the dvd itself, the short documentary is great. It shows some old footage shot behined the scenes that's total eye candy for any Halloween fan. One particular feature of the dvd that I enjoy is the reverse side of the cover. As most of you know, you can pull out the covers from the dvd plastic shells. On the reverse side of this movie is a nice little review by Michael Felsher, adorned with behined the scenes shots of cast memebers being applied with stage blood. Very nice!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Movie ROCKs!!!!!","review":"I love the horror movie genre...........this is one of my most prized movies i have saw!

This is my favorite Movie out of all of them............ a Great ending!!! *****"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst of the Halloween Series","review":"As others have already said, this movie had no intentions but to make money. I mean, why was Michael killing all of these people that were not even in his way of getting to Jamie. Plus at one point, Michael was at the clinic that Jamie was at and decided to go chase Tina to a party. I didn't understand that. I'd reccommend this only so you can see what happens to Michael not because of its meaningless content."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrific. Horrifying. Horrible","review":"The halloween saga has reached it's lowest poiny ( not including Halloween 3). The movie just wasn't good. No suspense. Rated R for really bad movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still Not There Yet","review":"Myers is after his niece yet again. But this time he stalks a bunch seriously annoying teenagers on the way. Really just Halloween 4 with a touch of graphic voilence. Michael seems to be going from a serial killing stalker to a hardcore homicidal maniac."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS FILM IS BEYOND THE POINT OF STUPIDITY!","review":"Halloween 5 is downright awful. The only plus in the film is when the 2 comic relief cops are killed. This movie would not scare a child. I would pay NOT to see this film again."},{"rating":"1","title":"good ol predictable halloween movie.","review":"Basically part 5 is just like the previous halloweens, suspensful at times but ruined by a predictable ending that you know is coming but you just sit there and watch it anyways, maybe people just like to see people get stabbed and killed brutally. it's a year later from where part 4 left off, the girl is in some mental hospital, meyers kills about eight people and goes after the girl, the girl fends off meyers for awhile until good ol crusty doctor loomis comes in and shoots meyers with some darts. Meyers is then hauled away to a prison but of course he breaks out at the very end. okay so that was a spoiler but it was so obvious that you would have to be an idiot not to know what was going to happen. one burning question still remains, why dont people just gang up on michael and cut him into pieces, burn the pieces, put the ashes in a jar, and throw the jar into the bottem of a lake?"},{"rating":"2","title":"still going strong","review":"Michael has survived the barrage of bullets he recieved from the police in 4,and is revived by a lonely old hermit.Meanwhile,Jamie now shares a telepathic bond with her uncle,who returns once again to kill and slash his way to get to his niece.More victims and more mysteries surround this flick in what might be the best in the series.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst sequel yet","review":"Halloween was scary, stylish and suspensful. Halloween 5 isn't scary nor suspensful. This is the worst Halloween movie yet besides Halloween 3 which was just stupid. Halloween movies were really scary but this one is just cheesy and annoying. The Halloween series which was once scary, now has to please a new generation who thinks gore is scary. Do not waste your money on buying this piece of crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Umm....lets see....no!","review":"This one was the worst Halloween for me. I know not many people are going to agree with me, but let me spell it out for you. It's been a while since I've seen this one, but this is the one where Michael and Jamie(the niece) have the almost psychic link, right? That just ruined the whole Halloween feel for me, since when has Michael had \\"mind control\\" and \\"linking powers\\"? I just liked it better when he was just a crazy guy, seemingly killing for little to no reason(Halloween 1 and 2)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"On time, as described...price is great...Book is sweet. For everybody who is upset about not-reading children. Will feel better!"},{"rating":"1","title":".","review":"Overrated. The movie really loses force, clarity, and credibility in the last 45 minutes or so, and some of the \\"harshly funny truths\\" of the film are too gimmicky to be fully appreciated. That isn't to say that there aren't some impressive flourishes of style and a sense that there may be some real talent behind this. But I found this film a bit disappointing on the whole. Solondz's next film, Happiness, is far superior."},{"rating":"2","title":"~great! ~","review":"This movie was awsome my two favorite parts are when Dawn\`s in the bathroom than she sees that girl Lolita, then she pretends she\`s washing her hands, but the bully new, the bully makes her use the bathroom. my other favorite part is the first part in the cafeteria, that\`s all I\`m going to say, I don\`t want to spoil it for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing, just a beginning.","review":"palindromes, storytelling, happiness, this is just what pre-empted the emptiness felt at the end of each movie.

No, there's no rape scenes, just a school bully talking trash. He torments Dawn Wiener, an 11-year-old girl who always catches grief from a myriad of classmates, siblings, and/or parents. Her troubles are so comical and deplorable, you can't help but empathize with the poor girl.Welcome to the Dollhouse really captures that early segue from childhood to adolescence--so many questions, insecurities, pitfalls. It's such a funny and poignant look at growing up. Get ready for a trip down memory lane..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Film","review":"This film has a lot of truth, but also is way to far taken at times. Whenever I watch this I feel like the writer has no obvious overview of what it means to be a nerd. The filmed settings are also very dull. I don't recommend buying this film cause you won't enjoy it more than once. I only said the negatives, but there is also a lot of positives. This movies filming is impressive."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE!","review":"I think this may be the worst movie I have ever seen. The characters were not developed the plot did not go anywhere, the stroyline was depressing beyond hope and nothing had changed between the beginning and the end of the movie. I suggest that this movie be thrown off a cliff for good."},{"rating":"2","title":"this movie is sweet","review":"This is the tipe of movie u want to see with a friend its so messed up its funny!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing stuff","review":"I rented this movie because I had been told by some friends that it was a great black comedy. I fail to see any comedy in this movie whatsoever. Instead, I found myself dragged into the misery of the main character and her despicable family. It was a compelling idea, no doubt, but Solondz would have been well served to lighten this movie up a little bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"The female Napolean Dynamite","review":"As is so frequently mentioned, this is the story about a girl who just doesn't seem to get the breaks. Yet, when you watch the movie it is obvious that she doesn't give up trying and is surprisingly in control of herself.As with \\"Napolean\\", the slights tend to bounce off as she plans her next moves and, although this movie seems more fatalistic than the other one could call it the logical feminine outcome of the same plight which will probably only be mitigated by a successful marriage, if that is in the cards. Whatever the case. these are not impressionable people, with both lead roes played by Scorpios, don't get scared off by the seeming pathos and you may wind up enjoying this somewhat quirky film."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT FUNNY!","review":"I think people who consider this movie funny are sadistic. But because everyone of us is some kind of sadistic, you can really laugh! There comes the moment when you think it can't get worse for Dawn, but a few minutes later it does! At the end, I felt great and was happy with my life. So if you have depressions, WATCH THIS MOVIE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark comedy","review":"This movie rather pushed the envelope of its day, but it's actually still a pretty memorable film in this age, and touches on subjects like sibling rivalry, homosexuality, rape, mental issues, etc. There's a lot of hard knocks for this girl, and this is not a cheesy movie with a stereotypical ending, though I do wish the ending could have been a bit better-executed."},{"rating":"2","title":"the truth as it is","review":"i think this movie speaks of the truth, regardless of how frightening it is. it's anti-hollywood, basically becus it's so real and realistic in the way that things seldom, if ever, end in a happy episode. this movie is not afraid to use a less than good-looking star to tell the truth. in hollywood movies, sure someone will go thru' hell but the hell can't be worse than here. i mean, yeah sure, good-looking people go thru hell too but their version and experience with hell is nothing compared to dawn's. this movie addresses the real problem, though there is no attempt to solve the problem, maybe cus in REAL life, no one attempts to solve problems or that there is NO solution--it's jus the way things are, how ever much it stings. anyone who doesn't find this movie realistic either 1)had home schooling 2)too cruel to care as they're too busy making others' lives hell 3) too cocooned and sheltered all their lives that basically, they've become hopelessly ignorant"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd prefer the dollhouse","review":"This film was touted as a fantastic dark comedy. I got the dark part. I'm still waiting on most of the comedy. It was very well acted and I'd even say finely directed... but something was missing. The plot just did not seem to go anywhere after such a strong setup and such stellar presentation of rich characters. I look forward to seeing where this ensemble goes from here, as everyone in it shone.

This movie sure does resurrect the woes of a product of suburban dreariness. I loved this movie because it is told very simply, no over-the-top acting, explosions or SFX.

The ending is rather dark and sad, and yet the movie as a whole is funny and absurd, but with a disturbing ring of truth that related to the human experience - at least for adolescents."},{"rating":"1","title":"The absolute worst quality dvd transfer i have ever seen.","review":"I was extremely disappointed at the poor quality of the DVD transfer on this title, very blurry soft images, shaking picture, pixelated and extremely annoying to view. It is like viewing a non HD television channel on an hd Television. The quality on my VHS version of this film is much better which is ridiculous. The people who transferred this film should be ashamed, they have ruined a great film by doing a cheap low quality transfer. Beware if you enjoy a good sharp DVD quality picture, this title fails completely as a DVD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Humiliating, Horrific, and real","review":"If you are a parent with a child in Junior High School I would highly recommend seeing this movie. Although it is horrifying, it will help you understand the kind of world your child is probably inhabiting everyday, and help you to be more kind and compassionate towards them. This movie so closely mirrored my own experiences that I almost wept. Not out of self-pity, but out of gratitute that someone else was finally telling the truth about life for many at that age. This movie does not exaggerate anything. Junior High School really is as brutal and humiliating as it is portrayed in this film. Aside from being realistic, this film is also superbly acted, written and directed. Todd Solondz is a genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbingly excellent","review":"This is a greatly disturbing American film. One watches this film laughing all the way through, while simultaneously shocked at the provocative and deeply disturbing character interaction one sees. Welcome to the Dollhouse is a satire of the stereotype of the American condition. It challenges us to look beyond what 1950's television told us what is the American family. This film should be seen. If you liked American Beauty, this film is similar to it, although it is far superior. Its strength lies not only in its writing and acting, but also in its humility. A great film for the serious thinker and casual movie viewer alike. Deserves its R rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing and not humorous....","review":"It simply was not funny, and it was disturbing and depressing in a trite way.

It wasn't funny. I know what funny is. Seeing a girl in junior high, who has never even kissed a boy, offer to sleep with an olderguy in order to be popular is sad. The main character is portrayed as utterly pathetic and miserable."},{"rating":"1","title":"A foot-dragging film that wallows in despair","review":"What in God's name was going through Todd Solondz's head when he made this? I kept imagining the film would get better and the plot would pick up, but it just drags on and on. Anyone who likes it is either sick in the head, or has an IQ of 60. Just because a film is realistic doesn't have to mean it's bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Great......","review":"This movie was depressing but i mean if you are emotionally hurt by this movie you probably have many problems of your own and shouldnt be leaving your house. But on the other side of the arguement that this movie is great.... It is a pointless stringing together of little problems teens have as they are growing up. We were all teens right? These are things we have all lived through. We dont need to see things that we ourselves lived through just to say \\"hey my mom did that\\" or \\"hey i remember that when i did that\\" This movie is just showing us things we have ourselves lived through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible movie, really bad values","review":"First, I want to say I do like Heather Matarazzo as an actor. She's brave and certainly you can see that by her choice of roles. However, this is a terrible movie and I was saddened that her parents or gaurdians allowed her to be in it. The song is catchy and no doubt the bad values displayed in this film are, too, for some people. The absence of goodness and caring in this film is just depressing. I'm sure some people's lives are like this, but it's not the commonplace experience of adolescence, even for 'outsiders' or 'geeky' kids. It's tragic and traumatic and frightening. Not comedy and definitely not cool. Furthermore, anyone misguided enough to think that the would-be rapist kid 'loves' Matarazzo's character is just sick in the head. Do yourself a favor. Avoid nihilism and other branches of art advocating bad values. Garbage in, garbage out."},{"rating":"2","title":"United states of Tara season 3","review":"Each season gets better and better!

The only highlight of this season was Eddie Izzard's guest appearance as Tara's professor/therapist. The rest of the series...well, it just felt like the show was trying too hard. There was too much drama, too much craziness, too many altars, etc. \\"United States of Tara\\" ultimately became too over the top, even for a show about multiple personality disorder.

I do like the intrigue, mystery, the twists and turns it goes from one surprise to another. This is one that is hard to put down, (edge of your seat suspense.)

I'm just sorry that Crystal never got a chance to clear her name?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Characterizations","review":"This is one of Steel's better books (although that's not saying much) but the characterizations leave something to be desired.

Imagine a world in which everybody has ONE flaw...except for the primary character of the novel who, the author assures us AD NAUSEUM, is absolutely perfect, without flaw, completely incorruptible, God's gift to this green Earth. Little snot-nosed brat if you ask me. I was forced to read this book for an \\"Intro to Fiction\\" class, and gave up after the first chapter, resolved to fail before committing such hara kiri upon myself...only to find out that the instructor for the course also gave up after the first chapter and scrapped the assignment. Oh well, you've been warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a boring book.","review":"I have to agree with the recent reviewers. Star could have been so much better.

And yeah, I did...for about the first three pages.The plot's decent enough. BUT. Yes, BUT. Throughout the entire story, all I kept reading was \\"Oh, she's such a nice girl.\\" \\"Oh, she's such a pretty girl\\" \\"Oh, she's so innocent she could blah blah blah.\\" Which pretty makes it hard for me to enjoy the book when my mind clearly rings out by the likes of MARY SUE!!! Crystal has an amazing voice, she's so sweet it's just..., Crystal is sooooo beautiful she attracts every single men nearby (or if not, they simply gawk at her), she has a terrible past (hints that she's a Mary Sue), and I could go ON forever!But that's just me, and that's my opinion of the book. These are NOT facts.

While reading through, it's hard to tell what character's feelings are being conveyed as she changes character thought in mid paragraph. I would rather hear one chapter from one character's point of view. I think that she tries too hard to get her point across by saying the same thing but in different ways. You can see it page after page. Crystal needed to get out of town. Crystal needed money first. Crystal needed to graduate, but she needed to get out of town. You get the point just by having it written once! Is there a word quota she was trying to achieve, hence the same sentences being thrown around?I think it was just plain over written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly the same story","review":"This book is exactly the same story as American Star written by Jackie Collins, that doesn't mean that this book is better or vice versa, the only thing is that if you already read American Star, don't waste your time with this one.This book is the typical love story, at first Crystal and Spencer meet, then the problems begin and keep going on until God says: from now on everything will be fine, and everything is fine. Nevertheless, the book will keep you reading page after page and willing to know what will happen in the next page.The story of Crystal in Hollywood is the typical one, the problem is that many people like that kind of life, sincerely I don't like it and I think that is a pity that men deal with women like personal things."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste Of Time","review":"Though Danielle Steel is not known for her great literature, but for her gripping storytelling, this book could undergo a few changes. I recomend it to people that enjoy a never-ending story, repeat after repeat of the same scenario, and a wimpy, unrealistic, bordering on sleazy main character to relate to. This book is exhausting. Time after time Crystal and Spencer meet again after being apart for a few years, and every time they make up some dumb excuse not to stay with each other. We all know that these books ALWAYS have happy, romantic endings, so why not just get to the point and be done with it? The ending of \\"Star\\" is one of those that makes you say \\"Thats it? All this reading for THAT?\\" Seriously, though, do yourself a favor and skip this book. I recomend \\"Accident\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"this book........oh where do I start?","review":"This book spawns some of the most annoying characters ever made. Poor Crystal, she grows up unloved in the boonies of Colorado. Of course she is unloved because she is stunningly beautiful. How many times has this already been done before? At age 14, Crystal meets Spencer, and it is love at first sight.

Both of them avoid getting together because they are thinking of each others happiness.

The pillow itself I would give 5 stars. The only problem with it is that although it is advertised by the manufacturer as fitting in a standard pillowcase, it doesn't. The only way to get it in a standard pillowcase is to squoosh it up so that the advantage of the separate \\"roll\\" is lost. The regular part of the pillow should not be so deep.

The chapters are relatively short, most only being 8-10 pages long, each ending with questions for further study and personal application.

I have had it less than 9 months and it is now in the trash/recycling bin. It was nothing but a major mess from day one but I thought I could live with some of the issues like:1. It never mixed anything all the way through without me having to \\"hand mix\\" to get it started.2. I could never pour anything out of the pitcher without it getting everywhere. It is too wide at the top.3. The lid seals so tight that when I would pop it off, food would often spray out on me.Things I couldn't live with:1. Shards of metal coming out of the bottom and also in my smoothie. Also found ball bearings loose in the base.2. Some kind of black liquid (probably food) leaking and spraying all over the place when I would blend3. Not being able to remove the blender from the base. It would get stuck after blending.I just went to Target and bought a $15 blender. It mixes 100% better than this Kalorik."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sprays smoothie all over the kitchen","review":"Loved the blender at first, but I'm junking it after about three months. Liquids are seeping through the blade assembly; it drips little puddles of juice and grease. The biggest problem is that the jar works itself loose every time, no matter how tightly I crank it down. I have cleaned smoothie off my walls for last time. Into the garbage it goes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted less than a year","review":"We use our blender to make smoothies around once a week. After about 10 months, the plastic socket that receives the drive shaft disintegrated. Since it's not repairable I had to throw the blender away. I'm still giving it 2 stars because it worked pretty well up to that point. On the plus side it was relatively quiet for a blender. Smoothie consistency was good except for the minor annoyance (also reported by Cooks Illustrated) that it left the occasional large chunk of un-pulverized fruit. Since it broke I've done the research again and may just buy another one. The issue is price: you can get one of these (or the equivalent under another brand) for about $30. The well-rated KitchenAid KSB560 was my other choice at about $100 but it has too many reports of leaking jars. I figure I can get by with one or two of these Kaloriks for a couple of years and hope that by then a new moderately priced blender will emerge as a clear choice in the ratings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe not..","review":"I just received this blender, and it came missing the middle piece of the lid. In addition, the jar did not sit sturdy in the base and was therefore very wobbly, as well as feeling really cheap.

The second ones have also become insanely loud, and have the added fun of emitting a pervasive burning plastic smell. Awesome. I can only imagine the toxic stuff it's injected into my \\"healthy\\" smoothies.Replacement blades are expensive and shipping prices are exorbitant.

It is loud enough that I actually make my children leave the kitchen while I'm making smoothies. It is as loud as the Jamba Juice place with 3 blenders going. It does make fine smoothies, but I hated it because of the noise level. So I kept using it for about 7 months, probably once or twice a week.Now, it is broken. The gear that connected the motor to the blade broke off so it will not turn. Looks like it will cost me about 19 dollars to fix it. It appears I can get the part from [...] - which is at least better than an earlier review. I was not making cement. Fruit smoothies - yogurt, fruit juice, frozen berries (the one hard thing) and bananas. No ice.

At first it was great (we make a lot of smoothies from frozen fruit). After a couple of months, I thought it seemed louder than before, but shrugged it off thinking that it must have always been that loud, as it was still working fine.

The blender is distributed in the US by \\"Team Marketing\\", a 6 person operation in Miami. They do not answer their phones, their employee directory is non-existant and their website is non functional for ordering parts. This is the context in which I experienced them: I broke the glass jar and could not find a replacement anywhere. As of 6/25/09 their website was unavailable to order. I paid $50.00 for the blender on Amazon in 1/09, a replacement glass jar costs $20 plus shipping.

The glass carafe seems well made but the rest of it is just junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I had in mind","review":"I purchased this blender based on the Cook's Illustrated recommendation. While it does a good enough job at tasks requiring high speed and lots of power, I really wish I'd purchased a blender with a wide range of speeds, especially slower speeds. While it might do a good job with ice or a smoothie, both of the two speeds available on this blender are faster that what I typically like to use with my food. This blender tends to obliterate things like chutneys and pesto rather than make a nice, smooth blend. And I just don't like the idea of processing soups, etc. with such force. There is also a strong ozone odor in the air since the motor is so powerful. And it is so loud that I have to cover my ears when I use it in my ceramic tiled kitchen.My old blender could be set at very slow speeds, allowing you to turn up the speed just to the lowest level needed to get the job done. I think I'll sell this blender and purchase one with more speed options instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken after 14 months","review":"Plastic support for the blades crumbled into our smoothie today after just 14 months with only a moderate level of use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Blender *ever*","review":"I have owned this blender for a year. The top is cheap rigid plastic that is difficult to get on and off. Replacement gaskets are expensive and they wear out (so the blender leaks) regularly. The jar is not totally stable on the base. And the top reason I hate it is the blade continually loosens and as it does not only does performance suffer (it doesn't blend smoothly) it becomes louder and louder to the point that it is unusable. And rusting. Honestly I can't believe that Cook's Illustrated recommended this unless I just got a total and complete lemon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I bought this because of the high rating it received.

Now the blender's extremely loud and screechy, smells hot, and produces a dusty red material at the outside bottom of the blade and the top wheel of the base (where the blade assembly and the base connect). I've stopped using it. It's going in the trash. It seems dangerous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simple, adequate, LOUD!","review":"Bought this blender based on Cooks Illustrated review. If you're hoping for a quiet blender, this isn't it. Blade design looks meaningful, but our old Krups blender is plenty effective and much, much quieter. BTW, the two (count them, two) speeds are rather similar. There have got to be better choices in blenders than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"wish i'd bought this on amazon","review":"I also bought this on recommendation by CI. I don't know how many blenders they used to test this, but if it was more than 1 or 2, I cannot believe they had no problems with this thing. The noise should have been a tip off right away, especially after CI described it as \\"ultra-quiet.\\" It may be time to consider some type of class-action suit against Kalorik based on their homicidal product. I was also assaulted by mega-hot flying ball bearings after only a few uses, and actually have little dents in my stainless steel fridg Perhaps Amazon needs to start their own \\"test kitchen.\\" I'd LOVE that job!"},{"rating":"2","title":"As Expected","review":"This is the \\"best buy\\" blender recommended by Cook's Illustrated. They marked it down for not making perfectly smooth smoothies, and for taking a long-ish time to work. So far I have only used this blender to make smoothies, and there are often a few little chunks. Just something to be aware of if you're very particular about your smoothies.As other reviewers noted, the gasket for the blade is a clear/whitish color and could easily be lost.The edges on this blender are a little harsh: I cut my finger with the bottom of the base while getting it off a shelf, and the lid's plastic ridges are a bit sharp too. Just be careful.If these problems don't bother you, this is really a great deal for a blender. I expect to get many smoothies out of it, and am pleased overall with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"5 Month very noisey wonder","review":"Bought the blender because of Cooks Illustrated review, It works just as they said it would. However after 5 months the blender motor was so loud you almost needed ear plugs. Kolorik replaced the blender under warranty (I paid postage to get it to them in Florida, which was not cheap). But then again after 5 months the loud screaming motor noise returned. In to the trash the Kalorik Blender went.

I have had mine for a little over six months and use it typically every other day and so far no mechanical problems. However, the blender does have a few caveats. It is very loud. I had problems when I put the frozen fruit or ice in first. I now always put the yogurt or other softer ingredients on the bottom, and I have never had a problem since. When you pour the finished product, you have to pour quickly or it will run down the side. Finally, addressing the gasket problem: My gasket was shredded (the bottom piece was not screwed on tight so the gasket got sucked into the blades - user error). As others have said the shipping for a gasket is ridiculous, so I simply went to Fleet Farm and bought a 2\\" rubber gasket for some sort of hose for $2. Works great and is far superior to the original gasket.Overall, you are paying $40 for a product that does its one job of blending and mixing incredibly well."},{"rating":"2","title":"kalorik BL 16909","review":"I love this blender.

I am amazed that they found this product worthwhile at any cost. Problems as follows:1. Leaks from the bottom no matter how tight I screw on the base. I crank the base on and it still will leak.2. The blender jar slowly spins itself loose after you turn the blender on. Takes 5-10 seconds until the jar unscrews itself from the base. I hold the jar in place until I am done.3. Doesn't even blend a banana in a smoothie. I have to make smoothies in 1 cup batches or else it can't smooth out the fruit. I pour some out. Blend. Pour some out. Repeat.4. I never thought being loud was an issue for a blender I would care about. But this one is horrible. It actually hurts my ears to run it. I wrap a towel around the base when my kids are in the room.5.

We tried plugging it in the next morning when the motor was cold....nothing whatsoever. A colossal waste of time and money. Amazon has a terrible return policy, I would not recommend buying anything like this from Amazon - if you don't use it, hope if it breaks, it does so immediately and return it right away (within 60 days) - otherwise you are out of luck with a 'partial refund' after you have paid for return shipping of course, which will likely consume all of your partial refund for an item that never worked to begin with."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor workmanship","review":"I had high expectations for this product, because of its review. I had been looking for it for some time before I thought of amazon. When I first used it, I noticed that the jar did not sit on the base properly. It looked like the Leaning Tower of Pisa.

Almost right away it made such an incredibly loud noise that now our entire family keeps a set of ear protection muffs (the same worn when operating a chainsaw or loud equipment) IN our kitchen to put on when we run the blender. After reading all reviews, I think our suspicions are confirmed: the loud noise is most likely trashed bearings. Time to throw it out and go try the Oster that others recommend.

He makes all of the characters sound like spoiled brats, thus changing the tone of the whole video to a negative, whiny experience. All of the engines sound the same - snobbish and rude, even when speaking common, every day phrases. Not only does this make me really dislike this video, but I worry about my children mimicking his attitude.Look for the videos with the other voice actors - they do a MUCH better job of portraying childlike behavior without making you cringe.

Of course none of that occurred to me until I kept watching it as many times as my son did, but the sarcasm and nastiness between the engines started me thinking, I guess.

Every one of the items, Stanley references with passages in the bible but doesn't over do it. The context of writing would be equally appealing to a believer and also a nonbeliever.

If I touched the probe to the negative terminal of the battery it seemed to possibly reset to 100C, so I thought if I got the probe up to the boiling temp of water and touched it to the negative battery terminal it would reset the temperature correctly. Well, in putting it back together one of the little wires came off and I didn't have a soldering iron, so now it's in the trash.

Too many coincidences piled up on top of each other. I know, the director was going for magical realism, but too many elements of the plot were contrived.

The author helps us to realize that it is not the leadership styles of the leader or behaviors of the followers that count the most. Rather, it is the spiritual essence of our being as individuals that influences how we effectively move organizations and motive people. It teachers us that leadership is about self and how we view and manifest our spiritual and personal principles as leaders. It is a must read book for those interested in improving their leadership skills."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enlightening Perspective on Leadership","review":"The content of this book is immediately applicable to those who are currently in leadership positions, to those who aspire to become great leaders, and to those who are charged with educating/mentoring future leaders. The author includes salient examples where the lack of human factor qualities resulted in integrity crises and unsustainable leadership. The book presents a pathway for rescuing Type II leadership from the cesspool of 'amorality'. The importance of living a principle-centered life is emphasized, and a keen sense of selfless service is noted as a ubiquitous trait in Type I leaders. The author describes a unique problem-solving approach derived from the human factor-centered leadership effectiveness model. A key message is that anyone can improve their \`map of being', and their ability to lead through the honest practice of self-reflection and introspection. This book is highly educational and inspirational."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book we need","review":"This book is both an excellent and fresh perspective on leadership in this present day and age. Senyo provides us with timeless morals and priceless absolutes to give us a piece on leadership that will prove to enhance our ability to inspire others to action without compromising our intergrity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy As Christian Gets!!!","review":"This is the second Impending Doom album I bought, though I'd heard songs from it on myspace and such, I still was stunned by this album, it is amazing. Very heavy, and very strong Chritian message. If you like grind, or death metal, I suggest check this out."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is right up there with old school Cannibal Corpse and Napalm Death","review":"I remember the day I found out about this group, Impending Doom. I was just randomly checking out some death metal groups on myspace which I clicked on Impending Doom by mistake. What a great mistake it was. The first song I heard was \\"In Reverence of\\" and that literally blew my mind, from the low growls to the pig squealing to the thunderous drums. As a fan of death metal, I have been disappointed with many new bands that claim to be what they really aren't. Impending Doom is not one of them; in fact, I rank them the 3rd heaviest death metal band behind Napalm Death and Cannibal Corpse. If you want something that will blow you away, pick up this album. You will not regret it one second."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better Options Are Available","review":"The beat and rythym are constant, with no variety, changes or anything throughout every song. The vocals are subpar to say the least; growling, while carrying a distinctive sound... should also be able to have some pitch.To sum it up... if you want constant and repeating sounds across one cd... then this is the cd for you. However, if you want a bit of variety within the tracks of a cd, \\"better options are available.\\"i.e.Soul EmbracedThe Devil Wears PradaVirgin BlackSuicide SilenceJob For A Cowboyetc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impending Boring","review":"I was in Best Buy today picking up the new Down, Black Dahlia Murder, Between the Buried and me...and looking for something different.Since Job for Cowboy is the hottest new band this summer, I got excited when I saw a sticker on the Impending Doom album saying: \\"For fans of Red Chord, Job for a Cowboy, Arcadia Strain\\"I acutally popped this cd in first of all the ones I bought...by song 4, I was ready for the disc to be over.While the production quality is top notch, the guitars leave the listener wanting more. The vocals are uninspiring, low volume, repetitive tone.I think a listener can really enjoy this album if they are looking for hypnotizing death metal atmosphere. Also, a drummer can really appreciate the tightness of the rhythm section, and students of production would have a field day with some of the techniques...but as a guitarist, I was left unfazed, and wondering what else I could have spent $12 on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Death metal is not \\"bad\\". This CD is simply boring.","review":"A picture of guys with death metal t-shirts on the back cover, and OOOOH, one guy is even trying to put on that evil SNEER! OOOOH, SCARY! So the metal fan buys it and then is pummelled with a \\"new message\\". But it's a boring message, and the music doesn't back it up.MUSICALLY, this band cops some of the chops others have invented in this style of music, but really isn't very creative. They don't bring anything new to the genre, except \\"different\\" lyrics. So it ends up sounding trite and repetitive. And gosh, the lyrics aren't even interesting, but more of the samey stuff that's been sold in churches for centuries. Really, if they were good, they would get a good review. They're just formulaic. I thought I wasted my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Le Dud","review":"It is no wonder this performance has sunk like a stone in the ocean. I am a big fan of Pinnock's later Sturm und Drang recordings, which balance warmth with clarity. This CD was recorded some three years earlier, and Trev was manifestly infected by Hogwood-itis during the sessions - hence the bulges in the melodic line, the squeezed phrasing and the overall anaemia. The ensemble - surely a 4-4-2-1-1 line up string-wise, is unable to bring any sort of palette to bear on this fabulous music. Compare it with the Dorati alternative (Haydn: Morning, Noon & Evening Symphonies 6 7 & 8): does it strip away the centuries of anachronism to bring us closer to the Master of Esterhaza? Not at all. It's fraudulent in a way.In short, this is 'Historically Informed Practice' at its most exercrable. Do not reach for your wallet, unless you want that saying about fools and their money to apply."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For The Beginner","review":"The instrument shop where I work selected this book for apprentice instrument techs. It is a disaster! None of the techs understand calculus or differential equations. Most of the theory and terminology are way over their heads. The book is long on verbage but short on real meat for the beginners. Quite honestly, I don't see any use in having this book on my shelf. I recommend the 4th edition of the Instrumentation book by Franklyn Kirk. It also comes with a very good workbook for a few bucks extra."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for Managers","review":"This book only provides a slight overview on system process control, if you want a detailed how to design a PID then look else where.Just my 2 cents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short Life Span","review":"While the thermometer seemed to give out accurate readings, it only lasted us a few months. I was always careful to only wash the probe and not get the screen area get wet and after drying, put it back in it's sleeve.

I'm not wasting my money to find out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bizarre for us","review":"This version of the Nutcracker drove us nuts for the first part of it (about 20 min) with old folks dressed in horrid costumes reminiscing about the days when one of them was a prima ballerina. Then traditionally dressed dancers started coming on the stage, but it was very distracting and muddled. We gave up, turned it off, and donated it to the local library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good product","review":"I purchased this for my computer monitor. I stuck it on the corner of a big CRT monitor. It worked awesome for a few days... Then I found it on the floor. The sticky part on the back of the mirror does not hold up.

Would not purchase again."},{"rating":"1","title":"lightweight plastic, but scuffed in the packaging","review":"lightweight plastic, would be shiny and clear, but scuffed in the packaging, probably from being stacked or under a heavier object at some point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mirror surface is scuffed","review":"As others experienced, the mirrored surface was slightly scuffed inside of the package. Simply the movement of the mirror against the plastic packaging scratched it. It's like chromed plastic instead of glass, so that's why its easily marred. I highly doubt it could withstand the rigors of the environment if stuck on a car door mirror. More suited for inside applications, like using it as a computer monitor mirror."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I wanted","review":"This is more less a big blind spot mirror and not what I wanted.

This is not it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mirror came with manufacturing defects, it would be unwise to buy this mirror.","review":"mirror came with imperfections/ scratches.

As others have written, the package it comes in sucks. It came scratched/scuffed up in the middle. I'm not too happy about it. It defeats the whole purpose of having a mirror. The item is not worth enough to go through the trouble of returning."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe I paid near $5 for this piece of junk","review":"Like many other reviews already mentioned, this mirror came with multiple scratches and tiny marks on it.The packaging of the material by the manufacturer is so poor that the mirror is actually packed with dust and plastic residues. I'm not talking about the amazon.com shipping package. The manufacturer uses 4'x6' sized paper and a clear plactic to cover the mirror. And inside of that cover, the mirror resides along with the dust and residues. Therefore the mirror gets scratched from day 1 even before you open it up, and the scratch is inevitable. I can't believe I spend $5 for this piece of junk. Take my advice and please stay away from this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap, convex, lightweight, BUT CAME SCRATCHED!!!!!","review":"At least, a year since the bad reviews that said the mirrors showed up scratched, this vendor has still not done anything about the problem, apparently. Everybody thinks \\"It won't happen to me.\\" Well, it happened to me too. Sure, it is cheap and it's not like I took a big financial hit with this deal, but what ever happened to ethical business practices?It's just not worth it to me to return the thing and it still kind of works.Anyway, find a different vendor for your cube mirrors because this vendor is unscrupulous, careless, and they just just plain don't care."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scratched","review":"I have bought several of these trying to find one where the surface is not scratched. I'm still looking, but haven't yet found one. The problem is that the packaging is such that the surface of the mirror is not protected and they are prone to being scratched during shipment / transport. Functionally, unless the scratched area is large, the mirrors still function. I'm picky ... I want to put a convex mirror on a show car that is not scratched."},{"rating":"2","title":"does it's job","review":"Bought it to see over my shoulder in my cubicle and works great for that.Surface is a little scuffed and has a small flaw close to the center, but I only use half of the mirror (which is clear), so not bothersome for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth for money","review":"Even though it's a packed one, seems to be old. It's more like a plastic toy. Better go for high quality products."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as advertised but could be cheaper","review":"I am using this at work for my computer since I sit with my back to the corridor. It works well but I feel like for a plastic mirror it could be cheaper than $5. Overall though if you are looking for a mirror to stick on something, this works as advertised."},{"rating":"1","title":"defects, pay a dollar or two more to get a better quality mirror","review":"bought 2 of these for my car, i noticed small scratches on them, but probably wouldn't bother me looking at them from my driver's seat. When i put them on,i noticed a dent in the mirrors, i felt it, and it was round, so it was probably on the inside. i ripped them both off immediately and tossed them out. I get what i paid for.The time it will take for me to ship them back out for a refund isn't worth 4 dollars.

They are pretty much the controllers that come with the FC Yobo NES, so don't expect something too different. They work, and are good replacements in case your origional NES controllers aren't working or you just like turbo functions and whatnot. It gets four stars though because I don't like the spacing of the turbo and normal buttons - don't get me wrong, after a little practice you remember where they are. It's just, I dunno, maybe they could make the turbo buttons just a tad bit farther away from the normal ones? It has a learning curve, I guess. You'll figure it out in the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the same....","review":"Wasn't the same as the original controllers and cheaply made.

Good cast, HORRIBLE PLOT, HORRIBLE ACTING!","review":"I can't believe it. Sutherland, FOnda and Ann-Miller, altough not big stars, are, without any doubt, very respectable actors to make such a lousy picture. Maybe the director is to blame, for having extracted such sleepy performances from the actors. Ann-Miller's character is totally empty, no purpose at all. Fonda is totally unconvincent as the deaf beaten woman. Kiefer Sutherland seems to be only waiting for his paycheck and his partner cop (don't know his name), who acts as the \\"bad cop\\", is ludicrous."},{"rating":"1","title":"ILLTEPHILL is wrong!","review":"Bridget FOnda at her best performance? Guy, this is a lousy picture, where everything is wrong: the director seems to don't know what to do with the weak script he had in its hands; Sutherland and Ann-Miller seems to be working to pay their bills, only; and Bridget confused the order to act like a deaf woman and acted as a sleepy girl all movie long ! Every minute watching this pocture was wasted, but I rented it because of the cast. Sad mistake..."},{"rating":"1","title":"DUMB PERFORMANCES","review":"Everything is this movie seems out of place. The old cliche \\"good cop-bad cop\\", lived by Sutherland and his pal doesn't work at all! Dridget is in an awkward performance, totally unconvincing, unreal, flat. ANyway, it serves to study how a movie with so good cast can be a tremendous waste of time.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than mediocre","review":"Worse than mediocre thriller about an abused wife who goes on the lam after she is linked circumstantially to the death of her husband and sister. Determined to prove that her husband is alive she follows leads across the state, her peril increasing at each stop. Chasing after her are the traditional \`good-cop' and \`bad-cop' pair of partners. One is convinced of her innocence the other more interested in closing the case and getting home. This pair is often able to corner their suspect but never quite to capture her. All the main players meet up in a remote town in the desert and the truth begins to unfold with deadly consequences for some.Wow! This was a bad movie. The lead acted as if she was tranquilized, The cops couldn't find a suspect if he or she is in the police station (this happens twice) and everyone else is as one-dimensional as can be. Avoid this one at all costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"An intelligent take on a bad story","review":"There are some issues with the story that simply are not well resolved, such as the way the ending was put together, but in all this was an intelligent take on spouse abuse, violence that is out of control, and how some people simply refuse to give up. Virtually anything I say is a spoiler, but Bridget Fonda nailed a role so well that most people don't realize who the actor is.Bridget Fonda dominates the movie, layer after layer of story being peeled open like a large onion, and while the locations, some actions, and attitudes have changed, the inner story is still valid.Worth a watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to follow, very well written","review":"This book is well written and easy to follow. It's a very good way to learn HTML."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Explanatory - a bit too much","review":"If you want to spend hours reading about html, this is the book for you. To be fair, I used a free online tutorial ([...]) to teach myself html and CSS and it worked well for me because it teaches you everything you need to know and takes you through the lessons quickly with no extra fluff. I definitely won't say that this book isn't useful, but it isn't easy to read and it takes much longer to understand the concepts than it should. Plus it mixes in CSS near the beginning without explaining it.It does split everything into lessons, which makes for a more orderly learning experience. Overall, only buy this book if you need it for a class."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond gorgeous!","review":"Novica brings us another fabulous artist, as this necklace is beyond gorgeous. If you look closely at the picture you'll see the butterfly bends slightly down from the coil collar. This detail makes the necklace arch beautifully over the base of the throat rather than laying completely flat...it is difficult to explain other than to say the necklace \\"sticks up\\" a bit at the throat, giving it an elegant, 3D effect. I love the mixed colors of all the stones, and though the silver-work appears fragile, it is quite sturdy. The coil collar is covered in super-sparkly brown glass beads (coils are great as you don't have to mess with clasps, yet they remain firmly in place). The stones of the butterfly are smooth and give more of a subtle sheen. It is both a delicate piece and a knock-out piece at the same time.

It doesn't have split screen play, so you basically need an xbox for every player. Useless. This is basically the most lamest worthless $50 piece of crap that I ever bought.

There is not much you can do with this game unless you have X Box Live. The single player missions are pretty boring and you will get tired of them within the first 15 minutes or so. I don't have X Box Live, so I can not comment on the game play online.Pros: None that I could see. There are better first person shooters out there.Cons: Lack of game play offline.

They're not really missions at all--they're \\"scenarios\\", no plot, no direction, just lots of mindless running and shooting. I was expecting CS to be like SOCOM, an online-enabled game that also happened to have a truly stunning single-player experience. But this ain't SOCOM. The graphics are horrible (even worse than Ghost Recon), the sounds are muffled and the voices are often unintelligible. The reviewers at IGN.com got it right: If you don't have Xbox-Live, then don't play Counter Strike.I rented it for five days, but I took it back after one night."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Helpful Review!","review":"Ok, just to let you know this game has no storyline, you can't beat it, you can't even beat a level.

You can either be a terrorist or a counter-terrorist. A terrorist in hostage rescue makes sure the counter terrorists don't rescue the hostages and the counter terrorists rescue them. A terrorist in demolition plants the bomb at either a or b bomb site and the counter terrorist defuses the bomb!Pros:1.second funnest game on xbox live (Rainbow 6:3 is #1!)& super addicting2.good graphics3.good weapons4.realistic5.buy weapons adds funCons:1.no multiplayer2.no storyline!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wowww","review":"Okay when I first saw the ad for this game I thought it looked very, very stupid.

So if you're looking for a good game i recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"PC VS XBOX on couter-strike","review":"Ok, so heres the deal. If you own a pc, have a fast internet connection, and have a mouse, not a touchpad for your PC, go and buy counter-strike for PC, belive me it is way better. If you don't have a PC and still want to buy counter-stike, go and buy Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six 3, it is way better than counter-stike for Xbox. If your still not satisfied go get cstrike for Xbox. THIS GAME IS A DIFFERENT AND WORSE GAME ON XBOX. i love it on PC, hate it on Xbox. I bought it all happy that I had bought cstike on Xbox but then played it for 10 minutes, turned off my xbox, took out the game and I haven't played cstrike on Xbox for 3 months now, not a good game at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"reminds me of old times","review":"This game reminds me of when I played it on the original xbox just one problem one of my faviorate maps didnt work it was the map called miami but over all good game"},{"rating":"1","title":"CounterSUCK","review":"I think I waited too long to buy this game. A non-Halo playing fan of CounterStrike said I should play it. Man.....it ain't Halo. It was a lame time killer.

I have a few things: 1. I don't have XBOX live, which would probably make this a better game. 2. The graphics are like N64 or PS (NOTHIN LIKE HALO'S GRAPHICS) 3. The aiming recticle is like a dot, and i like it to be a little bigger. 4. To easy 2 die, terrorist shot one shot, and your dead, and you have to watch your teamates finish the game. 5. To hard to aim 6. You can't pick up dead players ammo, guns etc. 7. Don't buy this game when its still $50, wait for it to go down, or rent it, or get it used. Its not worth your money at $50, unless u have friends with it and XBOX live. 8. If your lookin for a game like this, try Rainbow Six 3, or if your new...Get HALO, every loves that game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you serious?","review":"How dose this game have the good reviews?

I gave it four stars due to the fact that it is a little bit bigger than hotwheels and matchbox cars, so occasionally it gets stuck in the Little Tykes train and track table, which frustrates my son.Additionally, he slides this car across the floor to hit it into things. He doesn't throw the car, but after only a couple times, the car looked like it needs a new paint job. Although he does this to all his cars, this is the only one that has had the paint chip off like that.

The writing itself leaves a lot to be desired.The hero, Nathan Burdett, is a stock character, two-dimensional at best. Too many of the scenes are contrived. Although the accuracy about arms and armaments is marvelous, that isn't enough to carry a story for me. I can get a good gun book for that.However, B-Zone is a beginning.

Then I suddenly noticed problems streaming music and video from the NAS which connects to my home network using this switch. The transmission rate fell so low that music could only be streamed for a few seconds at a time before it had to be re-buffered. At first I suspected WiFi coverage issues at the player endpoints, but then I noticed that the one computer hardwired via the GS605 experienced significant performance degradation whenever accessing remote files. I thus tried circumventing the switch and all file transfer performance in our home network went back to normal. Since this switch cannot be configured, I have to assume it is broken. I just wish it had failed by stopping to function altogether. Since it degraded performance, this very basic switch was the last thing I checked after troubleshooting our WiFi, the player HW, player SW, NAS, and server SW."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inexpensive, but not built to last / high failure rate","review":"A few years ago I upgraded my extensive home network to gigabit ethernet.

However, last year the two year old 8 port switch failed, and a week ago one of the 5 port switches failed too. That's a 67% failure rate within 3 years. It's probably a matter of time before the last one fails too.I've learned my lesson...AVOID Netgear's consumer-oriented switches.

At first it took me awhile to figure out how to get the device to control the drums in Impulse (Ableton Live) once I realized that each pad had to be set in order to have each tone mapped it was a breeeze. I suspect that maybe the first reviewer as well as any midi newbie might have difficulty in that respects since it is not plug in play as M Audio states....it is program and play, however once you get it programmed correctly it is effortless.

I did enjoy his93+101 more, and find this 96 + sin con an unadulterated joy. The COE is superb-just the right size and wind blessed (eg the sinfonia at the end of 96/2 and the entire sin con). Abbado's Haydn here reminds me of his inspired Don Giovanni rather than his disappointing Figaro, both on DG. The sin con has not fared very well- I have owned the Spivakov, Bernstein, and Bohm performances,all good but not as bouyant and exhilarating as this Abbado. CA's main competition comes from Karl Ristenpart's former Nonesuch lp (now issued on CD by Klassichaus). I prefer the Ristenpart VERY slightly. The Abbado #96 is also excellent, moving to elite status with Szell/Sony (still #1 I believe), Davis/RCO/, Jochum/LPO amd Van Beinum/RCO.

The bottom line is that the unit just sounds OK, that's it. Yes it has lots of features, but the sound is just slightly better than a boom box. I hooked the same speakers, CD player, and monster cable interconnects up to another amp and it was much, much better - night and day. If you're OK with something that looks decent and has plenty of features, then maybe you'll like this unit. If you care about the quality of the sound and want \\"high fidelity\\", look else where.

FM tuning is not fantastic.But the big problem is that if there's a problem, a fuse (hidden inside the case, that the manual doesn't mention), blows. If you open the case and find it, you discover it's a 125V 6.3A mini fuse, which Radio Shack does not stock. (I can't tell if it's a slow blow or fast fuse, either. The manual should specify that; did I mention the manual does not mention the fuse exists at all?)This is just ridiculously poor design. Fuses should be in externally accessible holders, they should be mentioned in the manual, there should be a spare in the shipping box, and in home use products, a shorted speaker lead shouldn't blow a fuse in the first place - the receiver should display a message and turn off the audio.I don't know what they were thinking, but I'm thinking I'm sorry I bought this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unhappy - keeps dying","review":"I bought this product in 1/06.

Also, the book's brevity is a plus.The only downside to the book is that it's now in need of an update -- most of the source material is from the late 80's and early 90's.

The track called 'Anya' doesn't feature in the movie and is not a exciting track to listen too. The end credits track is different to the movie one.

Not a lot of fiery passion, but the heroine (Harriet) is absolutely delightful and the trajectory of the romance makes sense. The hero (Miles) is, at first, portrayed as proper and somewhat fussy and it makes sense that he - as well as everyone else - would assume he would prefer the older, ladylike sister Charlotte. The younger sister, Harriet, is her complete opposite. She loves architecture, is prone to clumsiness and often speaks before she thinks. That the most proper Earl would come to love the younger sister, despite the chaos that surrounds her, comes to make sense as the story unfolds. I also liked that the hero had been very much in love with his first wife and is such a loving father. I thought that his ambivalence about loving again was very well-handled. Add to all this some interesting information on architecture and a secondary romance and this makes for a very pleasant and delightful love story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like Georgette Heyer???","review":"I bought this book because of the 'like Georgette Heyer' description and was disappointed.

Now, as we stepped out of the building, there was a man sitting on the stoop with a wild, untamed look in his eyes...He also had neither his right arm or leg.We began to speak....rather, He began to speak to us, and mentioned that he was a published writer. I thought \\"yeah, right...buddy\\" But, Sure enough. he told me the title of the book (God Head) and his name, and the next day, on my way to my girlfreinds house (whom I had told all about my encounter), I stopped by Barnes & Nobles and found the book.

No intellectual content. And there's no chemistry at all -- especially between the two leads, boy-next-door Pullman and delicious Irène Jacob -- who successfully overlays her French accent with a Russian one.

The plot of the movie was extremely spastic. The scenarios jumped around so much, without much cohesion, that one feels like they are spending most of the movie trying to discern what is going on and where it is leading. I enjoy movies with complicated plots, but somewhere along the line they need to be tied together. In my opinion, this one did not. I only watch movies over again when I have really enjoyed them. When this movie was over, I felt like I needed to watch it again to figure out the whole purpose. HOWEVER, this movie is worth watching solely for the purpose of listening to the 5.1 soundtrack. It has one of the best audio musical formats I have heard in a movie.

There are virtually no routes given for the majority of walkers who are looking for more manageable 1-3 hour afternoon walks.

The features are good, the battery seems to be okay, screen is big, sound is great, signal transmission is good - no call drops.

On the outer screen it shows 1 bar, but on inner screen its almost full and after sometime suddenly gives a low battery message.Overall its a nice mobile for the offered price."},{"rating":"2","title":"learning to be human","review":"It's interesting to see the binary response readers/reviewers have given this book -- like an inverted bell curve. For my part, I'd say that the picture painted of MIT's graduate program is pretty repellent, but the very things that repel are also a source of the school's strength. Maybe civilization needs places like this and Caltech -- but you wouldn't necessarily come out of the experience a better person. To his credit I think White does emerge a better person, and that makes the story interesting. For those who haven't read the book, I'll just say keep an eye on the peripheral figures. They are more important than you think at first -- and more important than White initially thought, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"The suspense \\"grows\\" throughout the book.","review":"After reading the Plante book Seed of Evil a couple years ago, I discovered that the author had penned a couple of other horror novels. Garden of Evil is one of those other books.This book contains several \\"classic\\" horror elements that fans of the genre will immediately recognize--a large old house, witchcraft, secrets, and yes, even the good old creepy cellar. With these elements under its arm, this book takes off in an interesting direction. culminating with the growth of cursed seeds planted by the main family's daughter.What comes of that growth is certainly terrifying, and as you visit each of the little girl's gardens planted north, south, east, and west of the house, the suspense grows page by page. And while \\"killer plants\\" have been done with much \\"cheese\\" and ridiculousness in other horror books and movies, Plante manages to pull it off with a minimum of \\"oh geez\\" groans and rolled eyes from the reader.A quick, solid read for horror fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"!!!","review":"this album is completely amazing. all the elements, the lyrics, the mix of genres and creation of a whole new kind of sound.. this cd is definately worth the buy, and the band could use the money!it's absolutely great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Slow","review":"Being a big fan of the Themselves efforts, I eagerly awaited the arrival the 13 and God debut. I couldn't imagine what Doseone and his pals had come up with this time. Here's my synopsis: Doseone went just a little too crazy. Everytime a song began doing something interesting, it delved into obscurity. Waves of electronic noise, often incredibly slow and plodding, make up too much of this album's denomination. I fear the Themselves group is slowly but surely becoming a \\"noise\\" band. The CD does have shining moments, however. \\"Men of Station\\" has its charm, despite the hilariously dopey part where all instruments fade out save the \\"boom-boom-tsh-boom-boom-boom-tsh\\" drum machine. I really like the cello in \\"Superman on Ice\\"; I just wish they had done more with it and perhaps sped it up a bit. All in all, not bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"13 and God","review":"German hip hop mixed with electronica. In all honesty it didn't work for me. The meloncholic tunes of The Notwist and Console are clear and strong with seemingly definite direction from Martin Gretschmann, then suddenly there is a ridiculous outburst of rap from an individual sounding somewhat like a bad Primus or Residents album. If the desire to experiment with electronica still exists in Germany I suggest they stick with the concepts begun by Oval. As a colsolation track two \\"Men of Station\\" is one of the best Notwist/Console songs I've heard since Pilot, in fact it's better. The decision then is this, is the album worth a majority of crud in exchange for a small amount of beauty? For an individual such as myself it most definitely was."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is that Tri-Colored Vibe on our Tongue and Cheek!","review":"Amazing. Gorgeous. Inspired.

There seemed to be a small reduction in bugs on the bottom 1/3 of the windshield but there was no noticeable reduction in bugs on the top 2/3 of the windshield. The most noticeable difference was the loss of slightly over 2 MPG. I averaged 39.9mpg over 9,000 miles without the bug deflector and 37.8mpg over 3 tanks of fuel with the bug deflector.The best indication that this bug deflector is not effective at protecting the windshield is the rain still beads and blows straight up off my Aquapel treated windshield. When I used Rainx in the past on pickups, the water almost stopped blowing off when a bug deflector was installed.If you're looking for hood protection, this deflector fits fairly well and will probably do a good job...just don't expect windshield protection."},{"rating":"2","title":"let's just say this changed my life","review":"well, it's certainly one of my favorites, and deeply lodged in my heart! it's incredibly unique, and thought provoking. if people say it's confusing, that's because they only watched it once. you really need to watch it more than once to understand the entire story. and the part that changed my life would have to be the flashback into shion's past where yoko kanno's gorgeous, haunting music is playing in the background... and the fields, *god* the fields!"},{"rating":"2","title":"PSME Will Blow You Away!","review":"PSME is definitely one of the three best anime shows I have seen (and I have seen easily over 200).

With the DVD containing all 6 episodes of the series being released by VIZ on 6/27/00 (containing both the original Japanese voices subbed in English and the English dubbed version), there is absolutely no reason for any anime sci-fi drama fan to pass up buying this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, amazing and lovely","review":"Being an avid anime fan I was pleasantly surprised to finaly see Please Save my Earth. I'd heard tons about it but it took me quite a while to get ahold of it.

I was completely caught up in the multiple plots and I hope there will be more volumes in the series.I would recommend Ellis Peters' Brother Cadfael series, beginning withA Morbid Taste for Bones: The First Chronicle of Brother Cadfael; Margaret Frazer's Sister Frevisse series beginning (I think) withThe Novice's Tale (Sister Frevisse Medieval Mysteries); and Kate Sedley's series beginning withDeath and the Chapman (Medieval Mystery)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Medieval physician solves another mystery","review":"Kathryn Swinbrooke, physician in Canterbury, is called upon to be the Devil's Advocate in the petition of sainthood for the queen mother's confessor.

The hero is a happy, cooperative young man who has been dubbed \\"Loser\\" because his handwriting is terrible, he works slowly in school, and he doesn't always get the jokes of others. Contrasted to his very supportive family are the elementary teachers who make destructive judgements about him. There is one great example of an empathetic teacher. The \\"loser\\" ultimately makes an attempt to be a hero, and readers will find out if he survives."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOSER","review":"This book is about a little boy who is oblivious to the bullies in his school.

He doesn't have any friends and no one likes him, but he doesn't care. Nothing bothers him. People call him Zinkoff, because it's his last name. He's funny, nice, and brave. The book is about him doing different things like finding a best friend, trying to save a little girl, and spending time with his father. My favorite part in the book is when Zinkoff tries to save a girl named Claudia. This shows how loyal and brave he was. So if this book sounds good to you buy it or get it out of a library and read it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of his better works....","review":"Look, this book is about a \\"different\\" kid.

But, I for one wish I hadn't wasted my time on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"quite good, but confusing!","review":"In the begining, the book's quite confusing. I don't knowif the \\"children\\" are dogs because Jerry Spinelli called the children \\"pups\\". But read on! It soon gets very interesting. Something bad about this book is that it doesn't end, the story doesn't get finished. I wish there was a LOSER II! Some parts are a bit confusing too, you may need to read a sentence a few times to understand its full meaning. Overall, Jerry has written a fantastic book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LK-MS. RANIERE-PERIOD 1","review":"The novel Loser is written by Jerry Spinelli. Donald Zinkoff is a misfit who is just in search of a friend. As the years go by, kids keep getting meaner and meaner to Zinkoff. This book is a little bit unique because it has 2 main conflicts. One of them is that Zinkoff has no friends. The other one is that there is a girl missing in Zinkoff's neighborhood and he tries to find her. As the hours go on he ends up farther and farther away from home. After a while the police aren't searching for the girl anymore, they're searching for someone else...I chose to read this book for 2 reasons, because I have read other books by Jerry Spinnelli and they were very good. Another reason is because my friends told me this book was good-they didn't lie! The only thing that was bad about the book was the end, and although I am not going to tell you about it, it wasn't a very good ending. There aren't many twists and turns and although it is boring at times, it is still a very good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book","review":"This book was an interesting book.

But, Stargirl was the most brilliant book ever. That book made me cry. There's a book worth reading. You see, Loser is about a boy who is a loser.... bla bla bla bla bla. But, you see, the boy isn't in my opinion, that bad. He just laughed a lot and wasn't fast at racing. We were all geeks when we were little but it's a part of growing up. This book isn't great.

Loser is a hard book to follow,you should not waste your money on it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Loser Left Much To Be Desired","review":"Loser by Jerry Spinelli could have been an interesting and overall good book but, in my opinion it was not because it was rushed and undeveloped. The book chronicles the life of Donald Zinkoff from his first day of kindergarten to his last day of eighth grade in a mere two hundred pages. Thus no grade is well developed and neither is any character but the loveable loser and main character Donald Zinkoff. This book was attempting to give a good message about the life through school of a loser. Because it is hard to go through your time in school with out true friends or any real interests to speak of let alone to be unatheletic on top of it. But although the message was no doubt an outstanding one, it left much to be desired as a whole."},{"rating":"1","title":"check this out","review":"This book is fiction and it tells about this kid who is not really noticed and this kid has an annoying laugh.

That's what makes it so funny so it's a very good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was really stupid, and at times, sad","review":"This book was extremely boring.

This ugly combo creates something like this: \\"He walks over to the water fountain and takes a drink.\\" ahem, Boring!!!! I mean come on, who writes a book like that?No offence to the author. Really, peace on earth. And for that matter I give the author credit for the fact that they wrote the book. And that some parts were sort of interesting. Notice the word some.

And Spinelli brings it out in her book as if it's amusing. It's sick. I'm an avid reader and very accomplished writer, so I know what I'm talking about. I read Stargirl by Spinelli, and hated that book too. I thought I'd give Spinelli a second chance by reading Loser. She doesn't deserve it. Save your money.

It has an unsatisfying ending without any resolution to his sad sap life. Makes you wonder how come his family never got him any special help because he so needed it.

Basically, it talks about the life of a loser. I think that this book was not as great as the other books that Jerry Spinelli wrote. In his other books, he talkes about people that are different. In this book he does talk about that, but he doesn't tell us why this different person was important in the lives of the people around him. If you do like books about different people, and why you should treat them with respect, then I would recommend you read \\"Stargirl\\" or \\"Maniac Magee.\\" Those are also great books that Jerry Spinelli wrote.

I would recomended this book to anyone that likes funny, good books. I enjoyed reading this book and there were alot of funny parts to it.

It is a great book. It is about a boy, Donald Zinkoff. In this story, we are with Donald as he grows up in his own little world. Donald is a little bit strange, but all the same has a very kind heart. He does not realize how different he is, but is almost alone in this. Among Donald's small group of friends are little Claudia; the old lady with the walker; his sister, Polly; and for a short time, his neighbor, Andrew. Donald's dream is to become a mailman, just like his father, this job, to him, is the greatest in the world. Donald also loves school, though he does not have the best grades.This was a story that touched my heart. I did not find it hard to follow, in fact, I thought the story line was particularly easy to follow. The name did not match the quality of the story.

When he was born he had his stomach turned upside down. He throws up a lot. He always is in the back, since his last name is Zinkoff. You see, they sit in ABC's order.

If you realy realy realy like books that you might think it's ok. It just was not like somthing in real life... but it was not a good fictional story also.This book was not very interesting.

The flat, identical characters, the flat, simplistic storyline, none of it seemed to have any depth at all. Zinkoff seems to be autistic or challenged to me, yet no information was given on his questionable mental health. Nothing really happened in the book that stood out for me, not much of a climax in the storyline. After such a good book like Stargirl, I'm wondering what in the world Spinelli did to write this one. \\"Loser\\" tried miserably to inspire me to sympathize with Zinkoff, while all it did was to make me think it was all an obvious pity-party for everyone who's ever felt different. Too many books have been written on this, I feel like I'm drowning in a bowl of chicken soup(books)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meagan's review","review":"No I did not like this book because it's not about something I like.

He is a loser at everything including relay races and playing the flute. He also laughs a lot and he also likes to run away from home. He's not actually running away he's actually going for a walk. In the winter he goes out looking for this little girl called Claudia. But Claudia gets found by 8:00 and Zinkoff doesn't know that. When Zinkoff isn't back by 8:00 his mother and father are worried.

Although it started off a little slow, I couldn't put it down once I got half-way through it. Some of it was predictable, but the ending had a really cool twist to it that kept me thinking.I loved how Ted Dekker created a character that is representative of all of us: The good, the bad, and the lost soul struggling in between the two!Looking forward to reading my third Dekker novel!Ps, I am a novice novelist, but I'm learning to write suspense along the styles of Dekker in my next few novels. He is a true inspiration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational fiction that isn't sappy.","review":"The first book I read by Ted Dekker was Blink. I enjoyed that so much that I subsequently checked out three more books by this amazing and talented author. I really loved this book for the ingenuity and research that had to be involved even before writing it. It has some amazing psychological twists and turns I never forsaw. I would compare Dekker's intriguing writing to an extreme roller coaster. The book goes by so fast (I even lost sleep over it!) but it's so good that you can't get enough. I plan on reading every book by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ted Dekker Delivers Quite a Twist With This One.","review":"I literally could not put this book down. It's one of those that just keeps you turning the page.Ever since the lady at the counter told me that is had a twist I tried to figure it out. I was constantly postulating theories as to who the killer was. It really shocked me as it was totally not what I was expecting.If you enjoy suspense stories that keep you reading and has a twist that'll shock you thouroughly, then I recommentd Thr3e as your next book. Read it before they release the movie so you will know whether they butcher it or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"The plot is a cheat","review":"There's a malady at the heart of this book. Problem is, the malady as depicted here has little to do with the malady as it exists in real life. Much occurs in the book that could and does not occur when actual humans have this malady.I understand that readers are fascinated by the questions of good, evil, and volition raised by THR3E. For me, the fact that the plot is almost wholly removed from reality renders it irrelevant to genuine questions of good, evil, and volition.Having stuck through almost all the way to the end leaves me feeling cheated. Life's too short to spend on thriller-mysteries that make no sense in the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"impossible plot device","review":"*****SPOILER ALERT******* Do not read this review if you have not read the book but intend to do so.The ending of this book aggravated me so much that I really don't recall if I was enjoying the book up to that point. The problem is that everything that happens ultimately is due to the main character having a psychiatric illness that DOES NOT EXIST! The author even says so himself! If you want to reclassify the book as science fiction or fantasy, fine, but to create your own never-before-seen variation of a mental illness is an unacceptable abuse of literary license otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nature of man","review":"Possible spoiler?I agree with others that Dekker's conclusion left me quite disappointed and frustrated. But aside from the gaping holes in the plot left by the ending, my biggest objection is the author's premise that man's nature is comprised of three states: good, evil, and one caught in-between (represented respectively by the personalities of Samantha, Slater, and Kevin). Since this is a book review and not a theological forum, I would simply state that although this may represent a popular secular view of the nature of man, it is not consistent with the view of man presented in the words of Scripture. So, to anyone searching for \\"Christian fiction\\", I would suggest that you look elsewhere as this book simply does not present a Biblical view of the nature of man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Care For a Riddle?","review":"I LOVED this book. It was gripping and interesting and I never saw the end coming. I think I went just about crazy trying to figure out the riddles and I even dragged my friends into it, but I never did end up figuring them out. In my defense...I suck at riddles. I would tell anyone who enjoys psychological thrillers to go pick this one up because it is a must read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your time","review":"I picked this book up at a local library sale for a quarter, and I think I may have overpaid. I had never heard of the book, but the plot synopsis on the back was enough to get me to ante up 25 cents. As I began to read the book, I immediately disliked Dekker's writing style. As for the plot itself, it was just weird from the beginning, but not in a good-weird way. The exchanges between the protagonist and his childhood friend were strange and un-engaging. I can usually knock out a book in 3-4 days, but this one took me over a month, as I was never in the mood to pick it up. The plot device used at the end for the final twist was predictable and lame. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. It's not horrible, but there's so many better books out there that you shouldn't waste time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not Dekker's Best","review":"He tells you the plot twists before they happen. You think, \\"That's stupid. It can't be that.\\" And then it is.Ted here had a great concept for a book, but he executed it very poorly. I recommend \\"Black\\" from his Circle Trilogy. Not this book. It was quite frustrating."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I've read this year!","review":"I have to be honest here...this is the best book I've read this year, and I've read a ton of them. One thing: this one bears several similarities to a recent Hollywood thriller that came out a couple of months ago, so the ending was a little familiar. However, since I know it takes a long time to write a novel, I have no doubt that Mr. Dekker was working on this even before that movie came out. Still, this is a major thriller, and I have to say that it remains tense throughout. It's very easy to see this one as a possible movie someday, and you can tell Ted's really coming into his own with his voice as a thriller writer. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting","review":"Not disappointed in the twists and turns... an \\"I wish I didn't have to sleep because I want to see what's going to happen\\" kind of book.

I started reading \\"Thr3e\\" with high expectations -- and was utterly disappointed with this lame effort from Dekker. I felt compelled to write, if only to refute the puzzling rave reviews I've read here at Amazon.com about this book.Early on in the book, I guessed where the ending was headed. I hoped I was wrong, but unfortunately I was right. It's a plot ending so implausible, so disappointing, so darn stupid it's hard to put into words. I won't go into detail, but believe me -- it's an ending fit for a cheesy late night cable TV movie. My brother, mom and a good friend all read this book too -- we all had the exact same reaction to the ending.Read \\"Blink\\" if you want to read a great Dekker novel, with some interesting Christian theology tossed in for good measure.

I don't understand why people read it.The theme of good vs. evil played a part that would have been important, if it had been developed. Sadly, it wasn't.The ending is so far from reality that it's not something that anyone can identify with or will experience. We can't use it to mentor friends or even to grow as people ourselves. It's simply so ridiculous that it wasn't worth writing about.When it came to writing conversation (especially when the characters were looking back to their childhood), Dekker presented it in an awkward fashion. Maybe he hasn't spent time with ten- or eleven-year-olds lately, but they simply don't talk or think like that.The book dragged on and on, focusing on details that were not only unnecessary but also dragged out the tale needlessly. The only, only, ONLY reason that I finished the book was that I kept waiting for something to happen. I was disappointed. Now, I'm angry that I wasted my evening reading such drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed reader","review":"This is the first book that I have read by this author.

There are a lot of sections where the author goes into lecture mode rather than focus on story telling. The actual plot is very linear as are the characters. The villain is more like a giant pimple waiting to burst rather than a well played nemesis. Much of the intrigue is lost on events which are really not plausible. The author might have done better to write a stylized story with more blatantly fictional elements rather than try to use every day life as the backdrop. The law enforcement screen play is like watching an old FBI flick from the 70's."},{"rating":"1","title":"worthless dribble","review":"How in this universe did this book win awards?? The characters are flat, boring and uninteresting. The main character is held up like some kind of a saint. The storyline of the book, that Kevin is Kevin, Samantha,and Slater is down right silly and nonsensical. I get the whole multiple person thing, but there is a far cry from someone running around blowing up buses and kidnapping people at the same time that he's under police and FBI surveillance!!!! What does he walk through walls and fly too?? DOWNRIGHT SILLY and a complete waste of time. Fightclub was at least believable on some levels, and possible given time and space constants, this is not!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I picked up Thr3e mainly because it was listed as a Christian suspense and the blurb on the book sounded interesting. It was interesting at first, but the ending was totally unbelievable. One week after the finale with Slater, he is basically all right and will just need a \\"little\\" therapy? Also, Jennifer, the FBI agent, who is falling in love with him is going to serve as his psychotherapist? That's professional :)This was the first book I've read by Ted Dekker; I don't know that I'll be reading any more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it","review":"Others have given away the preposterous plot gimmick the author employs.A good mystery gives the reader enough information (however subtly) to solve the mystery before the last pages. This stinker pulls a ridiculous rabbit out of the hat instead. Don't waste your time.Oh, yeah, a guy with multiple personality disorder blows up his own car, a city bus, and a university library.

A must for any Dekker fans out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Story","review":"I recently read Thr3e with my husband. We both enjoyed the story and the many twists it takes. There is a good moral lesson to the story, which could have been explored more in depth. However, reading this story opened many conversations for my husband and I. I found the book easy to read and hard to put down at times. The characters were well developed and the plot interesting. I wish it would have explored the Christion undertones more, being a Christian Fiction Novel. All in all, a book worth having."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not my favorite Dekker book","review":"While I very much enjoyed this book and found it a solid, good read that quickly kept me turning pages to find out what happened next, it's not my favorite of Dekker's books. I would have to say the Black/Red/White trilogy is by far my favorite, followed by the Martyr's Series books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Three","review":"If you haven't read any Ted Dekker books...now is the time to start! Once you have read them all, all you can do is wait for the next one to come out. Ted Dekker is the best of the best. He can write like no one else. What a fabulous writer! Three is a fine place to start with the struggle of good and evil. But don't think this is going to be a quiet or simple ride... nothing Ted Dekker writes is simple. You gotta read his books to believe it. Go for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, Terrible, Terrible!","review":"Stupid ending, totally uninteresting characters, even the suspense was hokey. I don't know why I finished the book; guess I cannot image NOT finishing a book I've started. Just kept thinking \\"let me get this stupid book finished so I can find something decent to read\\".I cannot fathom how 198 people, to date, have given this book 5 stars. They surely must not read a great deal. I heard that Dekker was great. Did I just happen to pick his worst piece of work for my first read? Don't know if I have the courage to try again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrill without chill !!!!!!!","review":"Ted dekker has written some great books but this is not one of his best works. Kevin gets a call from a guy called slater who tells him that if he doesn't answer the question, his car will blow off in 3 minutes. This is how the book began. The initial chapters of the book were well written and I was hooked to it, waiting for some action. With each page, the suspense use to grow and the plot goes on becoming complicated.What works against such a promosing book was the details and length of the arguments in the book. It is a well written book, but after finishing half the book, the interest starts drifting away. Even the end is a let down.The book definitely has some great moments but the chill is lost."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Hokey, boring, nonsense\\". Just a few words that come to mind","review":"Not a spoiler Review! Just my opinionThis is my first Ted Dekker book, and I did not enjoy it. Heard from some readers that it was a great book so decided to pick it up at the local library. I was very disappointed! Boring characters; unbelievable (and at times non-sensical) plot; and just plain hokey throughout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother.","review":"I don't want to write a spoiler review. And without giving away the plot totally, I can't say very coherently exactly what I didn't like about this book. But I do feel the author cheated. Instead of concentrating, as I expected from the blurb and the other reviews, on the issue of being forced to face one's greatest sin, in public, the book sank into cheap psychological nonsense that had nothing particularly Christian about it, in spite of the tacked on sermons of the hero's friend who was a pastor, close to the end. The author writes in a way that keeps you turning pages, if you like thrillers; it is just that the premise of the book is fundamentally flawed. And worse, disappointingly boring. I won't read another Ted Dekker book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, predictable and annoying","review":"This book was just ok with some annoyingly predictable parts.**Spoiler**If you have seen movies like Fight Club or read other books with split personality characters you can start to tell who they are when no one talks to these people in the book/movie in person and only over the phone.Then to have one person with 3 personalities was just annoying especially when he had to shoot himself to get rid of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Teddekker","review":"WOW! What an awesome book. I definatly recommend this book to anyone who likes weird and suspencful books. The characters in this book are very dimentional. It is the classic good versus evil, but with a huge twist! In Romans, Paul talks about the sin that he does, and how he knows it's evil and he doesn't want to do it, but he does it anyway. Those verses are the theme for Dekker's book. Quick reading, and you just can't put it down! Everyone should read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeping pace with the big guns","review":"To say that this is the best Christian novel I have ever read may, I'm afraid, somehow lessen its greatness. Somehow we have come to expect less from Christian fiction than we do from secular, big publisher, mass market fiction, and to say that a book is a great \\"Christian novel\\" tends to put it in a \\"best of second class\\" light.THR3E is not second class. There is absolutely nothing about this book that precludes it from being ranked with the best and best-selling thrillers on any bookstore/drugstore/checkout shelf around. It is on par with the big boys. In fact, if you want to use this book as an outreach tool, give it to anyone who reads Greg Iles, Harlan Coben, Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child, or who likes the movies of M. Night Shyamalan. If they are honest with themselves, their view of \\"Christian\\" fiction will change, and they might just be moved a step or two closer to a personal relationship with God."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thr3e","review":"This was my first Ted Dekker book. The story sounded interesting but I wasn't sure what to expect from a \\"Christian\\" suspense novel. It turned out out be pretty good. It has religious elements but they don't distract from the story (except perhaps from one somewhat cheesy scene towards the end), which is is interesting from start to througout. The back story, about Kevin's childhood and his family is revealed in small doses, avoiding lengthy flashback sequences. Although marketed as \\"Christian\\", \\"Three\\" is a psychological thriller that should appeal to the general market as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of his best","review":"This is the book that got me hooked on all of Ted Dekkers books...a must read. And the movie wasnt bad either"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read","review":"Couldn't put it down. The writing is a little rough in places and the theology-philosophy obtrusive, but it's got a well-paced, gripping, unpredictable and unusual plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Dekker Thriller","review":"This book blew me away. A storyline that is unique and a climax that throughly surprised me.If you want to read an absorbing psychological thriller, without profanity and sex, this is definitely worth the read.Dekker is a genius."},{"rating":"1","title":"Juvenile at best","review":"I purchased this based on the 5 star ratings. What a let-down. Dekker 's writing style and plot presentation reminded me of Franklin Dixon, the author of the Hardy Boys series. When I later read that this was a \\"Christian\\" mystery, I was almost convinced that the high ratings given to it were cruel jokes. If you like this book, you will likely appreciate Dixon's early work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down...","review":"This book had me from the first sentence! I wanted to read it 24/7 - it was thrilling and suspenseful. You always wondered what was going to happen next and the characters were developed very well. The ending was shocking. You need to read this book, it's one of the best I have ever read, I couldn't put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mind Blowing-Christian Fiction","review":"Dekker is a brilliant writer. From page 1 to the end I was hooked. Not in my wildest dreams could I have seen the ending. He continually feeds the reader enough information to keep them hooked and on the edge of their seats. I'e always thought Frank Peretti was great and this guy is even Better (to me). I'll be reading many more Ted Dekker books. Suspense? Mystery? Mess With the Mind? Fantastic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexpected and Chilling Surprises","review":"A wild ride, with unexpected twists and turns and a stunning ending. Recommend it to anyone who enjoys psychological thrillers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre at best.","review":"\\"Three\\" aims to be suspenseful and insightful. It is neither. The plot is ill-contrived and bland. The characters are thin - you never come close to caring about any of them. It is in parts ridiculous. The ending has been done time and again. If you're a hardcore Ted Dekker fan, or if you're a suspense junkie not concerned with quality, dive right in. However, surely there must be better pieces of work out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing","review":"I finished reading the book, at first barely able to put it down since starting it last evening. The main reason I chose to read it was that it was listed as a Christian novel, which is what I prefer to read. I was disappointed when I discovered there was little that made it a Christian book, other than a few religious comments by the main character- who is a seminary student- and having a priest in it.I thought it was suspenseful and interesting in the beginning, but when certain things were revealed and hinted at, I had doubts about finishing the book. At times I felt like it was messing with my mind.I stuck with it to the end, but wish I would have passed on reading it altogether.I understand everyone has different tastes, so even though my opinion is less than favorable, you'll have to decide for yourself, because there are a lot of rave reviews for this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"OH, PL3ASE!!","review":"Juvenile Writing.Shallow Characters.Predictable Plot.Surprise Ending.Three negatives.No wonder \\"Christian\\" writers have so little credibility.I'm going back to Dostoyevsky."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst","review":"This has to be one of the worst books I've read in 40 years.It is incorrectly classified, and that should never be allowed.It is listed as a \\"novel,\\" but it is not; the end flaps seemto suggest it is a \\"mystery,\\" but that is so untrue, it's annoying.The story moves along at a medium pace, which is alright in itself, but as the end is approached, the whole tone switchesto some metaphysical or sci-fi context, and the ending isjust gibberish.It's a genuine waste of time to try this one. Details of thefirst 90% of this book are meaningless, because the endingis so off-base, and such a switch in tone, anyone interestedin that first part of the book will be disappointed in theending. A TV re-run is time better spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has anyone here seen the movie \\"Adaptation\\" ?","review":"This book's story AND title is a ripoff of the TERRIBLE and RIDICULOUS script the character of Donald Kaufman writes in that movie. It is unbelievable that this guy seriously wrote the same story and that so many people are taking him and it so seriously. It's like Metallica releasing their black album. Hadn't they seen \\"This is Spinal Tap\\" ?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Childhood Favorite","review":"This was one of my favorite childhood books! Julie's friend Sarah overcomes her fear of the wild country when she accompanies Julie on a trip to Granny's where the fabled Swamp Halibut and company make her hair stand on end.

You get nine episodes on this DVD, which are uncut, unlike when they had it on Cartoon Network. I really enjoyed the show on CN, so I bought this and they did cut alot out. I recommend this to fans of Cowboy Bebop and other space animes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool anime, lousy DVD","review":"Outlaw Star is one of those animes that is cool from the first episode and doesn't stop. If you have the money, pick up this DVD. While it may seem pricey, you get your money's worth since there are fewer episodes on the VHS tapes. But what seems to be a pattern in anime DVDs is no special features. These two discs lack a lot in that area. Still the series is so cool it doesn't really matter. You can watch Outlaw Star on TV if you want see the inferior edited version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bandai Entertainment Rules!","review":"Outlaw Star is got to be one of the animes that kept you in your seat and made you ask for more! In this DVD it contains up to 9 episodes in a 2-disc set. Only negetaive part of this DVD is the casing. The box is so wide and thick. Unlike volumes 2 & 3, volume 1's casing is sort of strange. It's also hard for me to pull the DVD's out of the case. Now to Outlaw Star. I can't believe the little things they edited out on Toonami. You got to purchase this DVD cause watching these episodes uncut is like watching extra deleted fotage. Buy This, it's a great series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hey Traveller Fans!","review":"As others before have said: good plot, interesting characters, well animated, excellent charcater designs and music.

So i of course went to get the dvd because i wanted to get the full package and see the series as intended. When it arrived i saw that the cover art was nice and slick. there were two discs and i popped them in to start viewing episodes. the menus quickly got on my nerves as did the music. At the beginning of each episode there is a little monologue/sermon followed by the opening sequence. this opening quickly becomes old after a few episodes. The animation is great but the song becomes annoying and detracts from the experience. The episodes on these two discs are mainly to introduce characters and plot elements. Overall the dvd is great but only get it if you are going to get the others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reason to buy this rather than to record on Cartoon Network!","review":"You should buy this DVD without worrying about \\"Why don't I just record the show on Cartoon Network?\\" First of all, this one, and the other 2 versions, are un-cut. There's some cussing, extra scenes, and Character Image Galleries. You can make it talk in English or Japenese audio. You can also choose what part of the episode to go to, and last but not least, on Collection 3, there's an episode that was never shown on TV. If you got a DVD player, BUY THIS DVD AND THE 2 OTHER COLLECTIONS!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hm....","review":"Well, you can watch this DVD or you can save yourself some time and just jam a railroad spike into your forehead. Your choice. I vote for the spike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Start for the Anime Space Genre","review":"Outlaw Star has a very, very promising start. It's fast paced, full of action, a likable hero, and his wisecracking sidekicks. The plot isn't too bad. It's about two pals, Gene Starwind and Jim Hawkings, who run an oddjob like business, where they will do anything for cash. Gene is a lady's man kind of guy, also a well known bounty hunter. Jim is an eleven-year old genius who's a whiz at the computer board. Their everyday lifestyle changes when they receive a message from a woman named Rachel. She wants Gene to be her bodyguard for some reason. Little does Gene know is that Rachel turns out to be Hot Ice Hilda, a bounty hunter known throughout the galaxy. They end up stealing a ship called the Outlaw Star, also taking an android girl named Melfina. On their journey, they run into space pirates, more bounty hunters, assasins, Ctarl Ctarls, and an assortment of characters from their past."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your time.","review":"That about sums up this book. I borrowed it from a friend Saturday morning and after about 100 pages I had to skim the rest. The writing is forced and dry and the dialogue is just not realistic. Nothing grabs you and you don't care about the characters at all. When I skimmed to the end I found the denouement to be unsatisfying and my friend, who had read the whole thing agreed. Even though it is self printed (ALWAYS A RED FLAG FOLKS!!) I was interested because I try to read all books I come across by people from my home state but I am glad I didn't spend any money on this one.I give it two stars only because there are some moments of interest about the local area.

It was with great interest that I noticed One Way had just released four of America's albums from 1979-1984. I had missed this one when it came out and was eager to hear it.

Women aren't \\"forced\\" by men to perform any act, including sexual ones, and as a woman I find the whole concept insulting. I, too, am single. Where I guess I differ from the author is that I'm not \\"an average of 10 lbs. overweight,\\" and I don't feel men will only be with me if I have sex with them.

Words several heroic women who have made a positive mark on the world have lived by, eg. Florence Nightengale and Mother Teresa.If having frequent, multiple sex is what makes a woman a woman, than Karla Homolka is more of a woman than Mother Teresa.The book makes the point that sex is a special experience and women have the RIGHT to control when to have it or to even have it.And besides most serial killers and rapists BELIEVE that sex is EVERYTHING.The women in Sex in the City live shallow, unfilling lives.You be the judge on what this book teaches."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice try but misses the Misses","review":"Although the concept for the cause is a good idea, it sort of misses the mark.

I am a die-hard Sailor Moon fan, but I need something different and now I've got a little bit of both:) This show is really good if you like Star Wars type shows, and even if you don't like Star Wars you will defenitly like this video! Gundam Wing had 49 episodes and a 3 part movie known as 'Endless Waltz'. This story not only focuses on the Gundams, but each character has their own story going on too. Heero (the pilot of Wing Gundam,Epyon,and Zero) seems to be the most grim and cold of the pilots. Relena ends up softening Heero up a little. Duo (GUndam Deathschyte's pilot)is the funniest,Quatre (Gundam Sandrock's pilot)is the nicest,Wufei (Shenlong's pilot)is the least emotional,and Trowa (Heavyarm's pilot)is a mystery.

It starts off with Vice Foreign-Minister Darlian getting knocked-off by Oz. From there we learn more about Relena's past. Heero shows that he does have a heart by saving Relena's life. And finaly, Treize Khushrenada sets up a nice little trap for the Gundams. If you haven't seen the first four episodes, you might get a little confused by the plot. This video is edited.

Yeah, Ranma 1/2's dub is actually good (except for the very beginning, that stunk)! Plus, I find the dub to be a bit funnier. However, this is still great, and is worth getting.Basically, Ryoga gets a mark on his stomach that makes him the \\"Strongest Man on Earth\\". However, the mark...is one of the most laughable things I have ever seen. As a result, Ryoga wants Ranma to beat him in order to get the mark off. It gets insane, like most Ranma episodes do.Overall, this tape is worth getting as it will provide plenty of laughs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT give your money to Baby Haven!","review":"Point: if you order from this company, do NOT expect a) to receive your order or b) to receive quality customer service.

This is a veritable musical stew of influences; jazz, soul, blues, rock, pop, and even some third-world rhythms. As War fans would expect, the end result is musical heaven.

The rape and murder of 12 year old Adena Watson. This case will haunt the troubled Detective throughout the series of the show.This episode also introduces the other characters of the show and explores the troubles of each and everyone of them.

Each episode was well done but never quite impressed me enough to make sure I was in front of the television set, same time next week. However, watching these three episodes has turned me completely around, and I think I know why. This was not a show which lent itself to commercial interruptions. The pacing and camera work are terrific when allowed to go at their own pace for 50 minutes. Each character is a fully realized individual, as opposed to a stereotype. I strongly recommend viewing these episodes, you'll be turned around, I guarantee it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gundam Wing- Cold Battlefield","review":"Gundam Wing Vol. 3,Cold Battlefield, is a great purchase for any Gundam Wing fan.

After the devilishly evil way that the producers ended episode 10, the fate of the Gundam boys hangs in the balance. By the end of episode 15, more characters are added to the mix and the plot becomes even more complex. Character changes that were hinted at during the first ten episodes begin to take shape. What will happen to Heero? Is Wing Gundam gone forever? How will Zechs deal with his grief over the disgraceful actions taken by Lady Une? It's all too much to bear. Gundam Wing is lauded for its character development and plotline, and these five episodes are vital to those two components.

The mixes on these songs are terrible, with the exception of two tracks. On the other hand, Ultra Dance 2, which is mixed by DJ Encore, is much better in comparison.

My favorite tracks include the Humate Remix of \\"The Boys of Summer\\" (Disc 1 track 3), \\"Yet Another Day\\" (Disc 2 track 1), \\"The Sound of Violence\\" (Disc 1 track 8) and Johnny Vicious's own \\"I'm Waiting\\" (Disc 2 track 10) (Which I discovered is EDITED for this CD: \\"...stop gnikcuf with my mind...\\").

On both CDs combined there are like 2 songs that are OK. I bought the CD, walked out to my car, popped it in, and listened. An hour later I got out of my car and took the CD back(or tried to really).

The book is not without entertainment value, but I feel sad and even a little guilty at having purchased it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gimmie a Gas Mask: I Smell Garbage","review":"What a disappointment. The Iggy Pop story is one of the most interesting in the history of rock and roll, and a serious look at this life and work would surely be a fascinating read. Unfortunately, instead of an intelligent look at a unique artist, Ambrose has instead served up a petty, highly critical, yet often contradictory shambles of a book. The focus here is on the tawdry anecdotes that those familiar with the Pop saga already know all too well, rather than the rise, fall, and rise of one of rock's most enduring provocateurs. Additionally, Ambrose seems to have real problems with Iggy's licensing his music for use in commercials, and for his decision to stay clean enough to get from city to city and play music for his fans. Evidently he subscribes to the rather juvenile notion that striving for success and enjoying it's rewards means selling out. I suggest helping Joe Ambrose keep his own art pure by not buying this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not \\"The Story of Iggy\\" but a critical take...","review":"...and a rather sad one at that. The other reviewers with low rankings have it pretty much correct. Nothing wrong with a critical view on a subject at book length, but to mix a lot of interesting history with comments like Patti Smith and Iggy Pop throwing away songs that were better than Kurt Cobain's best is almost enough to make one stop reading (but that's 25 pages from the end, so let's perserve on, shall we?).

Unfortunately, this isn't it. Ambrose has effectively reprinted huge sections from \\"Please Kill Me,\\" \\"I Need More,\\" and \\"Neighbourhood Threat.\\" Virtually no interviews or research was done from anywhere but these three books. Virtually nothing is said about Iggy's son Eric, and the last ten years of Pop's career are glossed over. Ambrose admits to not being a Pop fan, but feels compelled to repeatedly criticize his work (particularly the use of Pop's songs in commercials).

BUT, she loves to chew on them and they are made in China. I have read several places that the paint comes off. As they have no indication of \\"non-toxic\\" on them, they are not regulated for chewing on. That means they are most likely unsafe, as are most toys from China that don't say \\"non-toxic\\".On a side not, I wonder how something gains the label \\"non-toxic\\"? How are the rules determined and enforced? I don't really trust anything that doesn't specifically say it is ok to chew on.If your child is older and can be trusted to keep them out of their mouth, and not drink out of them in the tub, they should be a good toy for the bath. Very cute."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute, simple bath toys","review":"We bought these for our grandson and he loves them.

Of course, at home his cow is his favorite and well as the Penquin as they are black and white. He identied with them early and the black and white contrast for infants is really important.

They've been great for her to learn the animal names and noises (well, noises for some of the animals, anyway!), and after watching the animals running around the tub (courtesy of Daddy), she has now learned to make the animals run by herself, along with commentary-- i.e., \\"waddle, waddle\\" for the penguin. She also recently learned how to fill the animals with water and squirt out the water all by herself. These toys are also very portable and easy to clean, so whether we're going to Grandma's or for a doctor's appointment, I hide a few in the diaper bag so they can surprise her when a little entertainment is needed. I don't clean them in diluted bleach very often, and they still look and smell fine. I highly recommend these cute toys!"},{"rating":"1","title":"unsanitary mold incubators.","review":"These are very cute and my daughter loves playing with them. She has always loved chewing on the octopus. I had no problem with these until I kept finding this long stringy goo in the tub with her.

I squirt all the water out after each bath, but it stays just moist enough to grow mold--or something slimy, brown, and gross!!! I shudder to think about all the times my baby put these in her mouth!"},{"rating":"1","title":"paint comes off","review":"These are so cute and my 11mo daughter loves to play with them. We have never put them in the tub because I read about mildew build-up inside them. But they are cute and she loves to play with them anyway.The problem is she is still a mouthing baby and puts these little critters in her mouth. We have only owned them for about a month. The paint is coming off the sheep's face, which she likes to suck on. The raccoon is loosing his paint, and he hasn't even been played and that started happening right out of the bag. The cow looks like the paint has rubbed off in some spots too.I tried looking online to see what kind of paint it is, as sometimes they are waterbased and non-toxic, however I can't imagine that a company would use waterbased paint on a bath toy.They sure are cute though. Maybe the company can address the issue with the paint coming off. Until then, it would probably be advisable to save your money and find a safer product for your little one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous!! Really scary.","review":"I received this set as a gift and it's labeled for 6 mos+ so we started playingwith them when he was 6 mos. These are really dangerous - my son puts theanimal head in his mouth and because it's rubber-like material, it SEALS aroundhis mouth and he CANNOT BREATHE. This happened with the penguin and the hippo.I put them away for a month and let him try again at 7 months, but same story.This is REALLY SCARY as he could not remove the animal himself because it suctioned on him(and he's too young to know how to remove it).PLEASE do not buy this toy.

I'm happy with the graphics during gameplay, but the video clips are pretty low res. Only got to some of the mini games. Not very challenging yet and slightly boring start.

Customer service is really hard to deal with. They always say that their design is fine , it's the person operating it that is causing the damage. I've taken it to several \\"authorized\\" dealers and private shops and they say the same, \\"it has a defective design\\" but MTD refuses to acknowledge.

So, if you need to buy this machine (something I would not recommend because of poor quality and a tough to deal with MTD service organization), go get this years' model elsewhere.

NOT THE CASE!! Although there was maybe a page and a half that was dedicated to his growing up, and dreams of being a professional baseball player. The rest of the book merely chronicals his professional career through the eyes of the story-lines...not the behind the scenes look I was hoping for.

I may read this novel again sometime soon. Hard for me to give the book a grade thirty years after reading. C plus or so, I'd say. Note: I'm not a big fiction guy.

We temporarily taped it on to try different locations on the mirror. We liked it the best on the driver mirror, in the bottom left corner, with the rounded edge in the bottom left corner. There's no instructions on where to place it. It has really paid off with freeways on ramps where it's difficult to see & merge with traffic at increasing speeds. We feel so much safer changing lanes & not having to physically move our head around & take our eyes off the car in front of us. We've recommended them to family too."},{"rating":"1","title":"fell off.","review":"It stuck just fine for about 3 months but as soon as I went through a car wash it fell off. Too bad because it helped a lot. But I expect to go through the car wash every once in a while so I won't be using this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAVE YOUR MONEY","review":"I was extremely disappointed with this item. In 45 minutes I had acquired just a couple of pine cones and very sore arms. Don't know what I'll do now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Sounds great, doesn't it? Such a simple concept to save a lot of bending over. The reality is quite different. I found that I had to expend a lot of energy really slamming the Coneivore onto a pine cone to make the plastic fingers bend enough to pick it up. Even then, several jabs were often required to pick up a single cone. I gave up before filling it a single time. It might work if the fingers were more flexible, but as presently configured, it is worse than useless because it takes up space. I recommend that you spend the money on a good pair of gardening gloves and resign yourself to bending over."},{"rating":"1","title":"crap","review":"hated it, not better that the Remo Palam patches, dont buy this bc they will fall off over time, and its not as durable."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product","review":"Once again this is an evans product. and its does what its supposed to do. Its very durable and its been able to withstand my 260 bpms so far :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality, but not ideal for full figures","review":"The quality of this item based on materials is pretty good. I have a D-cup bust size, but pretty average-sized everything else, so I usually wear size medium tops. Since this one is \\"body-skimming\\" as the description aptly notes, and since it is not at all stretchy, which the description did not note, larger busts might get a little smashed, and for me, the arm holes gapped a lot due to the less than ideal fit. Also, the cropped length means you might be showing some stomach if you don't wear fairly high-waisted shorts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything you need to pass","review":"Read the review and take all the exams. Excellent! I was totally prepared"},{"rating":"1","title":"Problematic","review":"The book contains numerous typos and editing mistakes. The explanations provided are often too brief to completely illuminate grammatical issues. The book uses incorrect sentences to demonstrate \\"how not to proceed\\" - a practice that has been outdated for decades. In general, this book struck me as churned out quickly and without much care and attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Polly Toy I've Bought","review":"My four year old loves Polly Pocket. I bought her this set, and it's just awful! Within minutes of opening the package, and putting it all together for her, the whole thing fell apart, again and again. The main gist of it ended up in the trash. I kept the little chair and dresser, and the doll: none of which are impressive.The only GOOD part: She does love the little car! She plays with it almost every day, but without the accessories (the hubcaps have little magnets on them, so I took 'em away...).Not worth more than you're willing to pay for the car."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will grow with your child","review":"This puzzle is well made and fairly attractive. But the best thing about it is that it will grow with your child. My 8 month old likes to grab the pieces and bang them on things, but as she gets older she'll enjoy taking the pieces out and putting them back. I'm glad I bought it. One less piece of plastic in my house!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great toy","review":"One of the best learning tools a child could have got this for my 9month old an she loves it. made of nice and sturdy wood and i would recommend that you buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"good puzzle","review":"I am a speech therapist for little kids and I use the puzzle alot. We label the animals and imitate the sounds. The large knob handles make it easy for the child to do on his/her own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toy not painted!!!!","review":"Thought this toy would be painted like other M&D products. If your toddler chews on items, then this toy will be destroyed in about 2 minutes. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paper Coated Puzzle","review":"This puzzle was ruined in a day. My toddler had a mouth full of paper after only a few minutes of playing with it. So I threw this puzzle into the garbage. Worthless as far as I am concerned. I rate it about as high as any other Melissa & Doug product. Very cheaply made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous toy for children","review":"I was excited to buy this puzzle for my young son and he enjoyed playing with it for the short time we had it. However, since the puzzle is made from cheap laminated/layered wood, the puzzle piece backings began to splinter and rip almost immediately. As such, this toy represents a pretty serious hazard to young children. It's not even well-designed: the pieces are very thick and tightly fitted into their slots, making it difficult to pull them out in any direction except directly upwards. Very disappointing overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great start goes down hill fast!","review":"As a sufferer of this dreadful disease myself, I was eager to read a book about Carcinoid Syndrome. And I guess that's the problem. The beginning chapters-maybe four or five- are about the illness, then this book disintegrates into a story that has nothing to do with an illness of any kind. It's about a bloody ski trip money fiasco! Christ! Who cares? I'm sorry. Write another book called \\" Who took the Ski Money\\" or something. Where were the editors?! Don't sell a book to people dying to find out more about a miserable debilitating cancer and then switch to a personal legal battle that has nothing to do with it what so ever. I just don't get it. And wish I hadn't gotten it-this book, that is. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Calorie Fat & Carbohydrate Counter","review":"The guide has several entries. I ordered over the internet after seeing the cover, thinking it had protein counts as well.Not useful to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very useful tool","review":"If this book doesn't list it, you probably wouldn't eat it anyway. A \\"must have\\" if you're checking carbs or counting calories on your own. If you are on an exchanges or points plan, you probably wouldn't need this book though. 5 stars because it delivers everything it claims, and then some."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent handbook!","review":"This guide not only provides valuable food count information, it also provides nutrition information. Although not presented as a weight loss plan this book clearly contains the best method for both losing weight and developing healthy lifetime eating habits."},{"rating":"2","title":"I use this all the time","review":"This is a great reference book for counting calories. I have owned it for several years and I continue to find it usefull."},{"rating":"2","title":"Functional","review":"Item as described, shipped promptly, works fine, no problems. Would recommend to others. It was hard to unplug initially but with use has become easier."},{"rating":"1","title":"In what century was this book written?","review":"I knew that this book was in trouble when the author recommended sending demos on cassette tapes rather than CDs because most people don't have CD players available. In one chapter he says it's important to use professional printers and graphic artists, and in the next say to use your PC to design and print your packages.Virtually everything in this book is out of date. I'm not surprised, as the author teaches at Berklee College of Music. When I was a student at Berklee, I realized most of the teachers had little or no professional experience. Most had been students at the school and were hired to teach immediately upon graduation. I don't know if that's the case with this author, but it is obvious he is completely out of touch with the state of the music business today."},{"rating":"2","title":"highly recommended","review":"This book gives a lot of very practical hints and shows how to plan your musician's career no matter in what country you live. It is a must for students that don't have self-promoting as a faculty and want to be completely prepared for their independent carrer. It lets you understand music market today. It is really very helpfull!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The self promoting musician","review":"I did this class when I was at Berklee. At the time, it seemed to be the most useless class of all. I wanted to play, write, and make music! It didn't take me to long to realize how important in my career was to learn how to promote myself. Whether as a performer, as a writer or as a teachers all the information taught at that class has become part of my daily routine as a musician. I realize how important it is for a musician to comprehend that writing and playing great music it's not enough. You need to make your music get to the public. It is a wonderful idea to get this class together as book. Now anyone can access this information. It doesn't matter what area in the music industry you want to work with, you should read this book as soon as possible. It has opened my mind to small things I can do to make my life as musician the success I have always dreamed of."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Out There","review":"These glasses - along with the larger sizes - are the best out there. I'm not sure how many glasses I've gone through over the years - my family is constantly breaking them. But since I've ordered these in different sizes we've not had one break at all - we've had them over a year now. They've dropped...and dropped....but they haven't broken or chipped. They wash well in the dishwasher - and they are easy to hold on to due to the ridges. I recommend these to everyone - they are the best glasses we've ever had - ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality juice glasses","review":"They were exactly what I had been looking for in a juice glass. (Thicker glass than expected) Very pleased with this product. Great juice glass for kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent juice glasses","review":"Glasses are well made heavy little tumblers. Also like that they match the other Gilbrater glasses made by Libbey"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ordered 4 dozen, got just 4","review":"I wanted a nice supply of drinking glasses that my grandchildren's small hands would fit around easily so they wouldn't slip out of their hands. These juice glasses were exactly the right size. I ordered 4 dozen of them to allow for breakage over time. I got exactly 4 glasses, not even enough to set a full breakfast table. The seller ignored my pleas for the remaining glasses, and Amazon finally had to reimburse me. I would rather have had the glasses, but I got tired of waiting for a response."},{"rating":"2","title":"12 ounce glasses","review":"The design on the 7 ounce glass is excellent and we were able to purchase only 12 instead of large amounts. We wish you offered the same design in the 12 ounce beverage glass in quantities of twelve 12. Instead, we had to settle for a different design in order to purchase only 12. Not only your web site but virtually all sites we visited only offered large amounts, I assume for restaurants. No reason to post this. This is not a complaint, only an observation.Al"},{"rating":"2","title":"juice glasses","review":"This is just what I was looking for, just the right size and nice heavy glass. My husband and I drink juice every morning and these are perfect!"},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect for kids","review":"I have a 4- and a 5-year old. This is perfect for their little hands. They can pick it up one-handed without worrying about dropping it. Libbey glasses are extremely sturdy, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"juice glasses","review":"Nice heavy duty glass A little larger than I would prefer for juice but better too big than too small"},{"rating":"2","title":"51 after dark movie","review":"This short movie was as good as most of the After Dark Series. I found it captivating. I only wished it was longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not culturally correct","review":"While I purchased this book with intent for a very young audience to enlighten them on Japanese culture in what I thought would be a simple and cute reference, once I got it in hand I felt the content did not reflect a good understanding by the author of Japanese cultural references. The illustrations did not seem appealing for this purpose either."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love Teddy","review":"I liked the TT song \\"I Don't Want to Say Goodbye\\" on the Brokeback Mountain soundtrack. It was quite simple. Voice, fiddle, drums, guitar in 4/4 time. Teddy's voice gives it the right tenderness without making it sound sappy.I went out and bought \\"Up Front...\\" and have been listening to it every day. I really enjoy the first two tracks. \\"Change of Heart\\" and \\"Touching Home.\\" I guess my interest in country music has started when my friend encouraged me to go line dancing with him last month."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I like his newer stuff much better. This was too country for me. His newer music is more pop country."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry Teddy , LEAVE THE COUNTRY ALONE","review":"Ok, I like the voice, call it \\" country Chris Issak/Marshall Crenshaw\\" on this cd,BUT every one of these songs is better done by other artists!! I AM SORRY TEDDY, but its TRUE.Stick to your own songs, spare arrangements and have your Dad PLAY ON EVERY CUT.Now THAT would be a 4 star album.\\"A PIECE OF WHAT YOU NEED \\" is a much better cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the Point?","review":"I first heard Teddy Thompson's Separate Ways while visiting my sister and didn't stop playing if for about 3 months straight. FORTUNATELY I listened to Separate Ways first. Had it been Up Front I probably would have stopped there.Remakes of b-side country songs...What's the point. It doesn't show off his songwriting and incredible voice at all.Pass on this one and get Teddy Thompson and Separate Ways instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bicycle chain lube.","review":"This lube fit my needs very well. I bicycle (MTB-Hybrid)) in Arizona, with a dry and dusty climate. The dry nature of this lube works well in that environment. Initially I used it as directed as it can double as a cleaning treatment as well. As I have regular cleaning routine other than that, I use a micro (needle) oiler to apply to keep from being wasteful. I still flood each link roller after cleaning and briefly wipe off (minimal) excess.Because I have a nickel plated chain (silver) and the lube is red, I can see the amount of dry lube that is retained. This stuff does stick to you chain once dry. There were other wet lubes that I used to use that worked well from a lubrication stand point, but attracted so much grit/grim that wear on my cogs and rings was unacceptable. So far this is the best dry lube I have found for my conditions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too pricy!","review":"14.99$ for a Carry case? I can get a PANASONIC 2 way radio at 30$ after 30$ rebate. This price for two cases might be more acceptable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for other brands of FRS or cell phones too","review":"I don't own a Panasonic FRS, but use this case for another brand of FRS. This case will also hold a small cell phone. It is made of wet suit material and comes with a velcro arm strap. It can stretch a little bit, but don't try to fit the older generation cell phone inside. I don't have it in front of me, so I can't give the measurements, maybe next time. At Amazon.com's clearance price of about a couple of dollars, it is well worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"You had to be there. If you weren't, forget it.","review":"A well-meaning effort to rekindle some battlefield camaraderie through song that falls flat for those of us who did not experience the war. The songs are not terribly engaging, either. I had hoped for some parodies of \\"The Ballad of the Green Berets\\" or some such sneering and cynical view of soldiering. You do not sense that this was one of the most vociferously and viciously protested wars in American history. Kris Kristofferson tries to convince us he is one of the gang without much success. All in all, this is a for-veterans-only music video that at best only has artifact value for those who may be interested in this topic for non-sentimental reasons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scrabble","review":"Awesome! At last a Scrabble game for Macs that works with OS 10 and doesn't require that the disc be inserted to play a game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine But iPad App Is So Much Better","review":"Before the iPad, I would have said, fine, go ahead and get this product. I too was playing scrabble on my macbook, getting better so that I could beat my sister over on Facebook. Then I got my iPad and installed Hasbro's Scrabble App. The only word to use is PERFECTION for that app. The iPad is so much lighter and easier to carry around. I can whip it out of my purse anywhere and commence playing, whether sitting in a MacDonald's booth eating my hamburger or sitting on a picnic table by our condo pond enjoying the open air. Plus the App ties into Facebook if you and a Friend from there want to play one another. I also have the version for my iphone but it is far less satisfactory. So if you are a Scrabble addict, and I am, that alone may justify your getting an iPad. if you don't get an iPad though, this game on your macbook is the next best thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"New features on latest Scrabble.","review":"I especially enjoyed the fact that the newest Scrabble does not immediately penalize you for putting down a word that isn't in the dictionary. It just lets you continue play. And the newest version also doesn't play that music incessantly. The option to do a timed play is also interesting. All in all, I enjoy it a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"scrabble for macintosh","review":"i hated the product because i was unable to use this product on my mac computer. i was unable to open the scrabble game and was very disappointed that i spent $11.99 on software that was completely useless.i have played scrabble on pc as well as kindle fire with no problems. all i want is to just play scrabble but to no avail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Has some kinks","review":"I'm glad this works on my Mac. Although I have only played the computer, my complaint is that I use words and the game does not allow them but when the computer uses the words, it's ok."},{"rating":"2","title":"This game rocks","review":"I admit... I love Scrabble. This has great features like a dictionary, hints for the best word and actual recommendations when you get stuck. You can play the computer at various levels of expertise. It's really fun and somewhat addicting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scrabble practice","review":"I ordered this game after being humiliated playing Scrabble with friends. It has provided good practice and allows you to play at various levels of skill. I find it a little too tempting to use the Hint function. Usually the words that the Hint function comes up with are words that nobody except Merrium Webster has ever heard of."},{"rating":"1","title":"It cheats!","review":"This game is well done, fun, and addictive, BUT it cheats. There are a small number of words in its dictionary that do not appear in the Official Scrabble Players Dictionary (4th edition). It beat me tonight (barely) by using GADJO. If you look this up in the OSPD4, it isn't there. If you look it up in its own online version, it's there, but with \\"Definition not available\\". If you look it up in Google, it's a Barcelona-based gypsy-ska group, which gets its name from the Roma word for non-Romanji people. (That's the sort of obscure word that Scrabble lives by, but to use such a word when it is NOT in the OSPD is just cheating!) This is the second or third time in a year or so that I have encountered one of these. Grrrr...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to date","review":"The version is a 2007 and does not allow you to exit. I bought the same version years ago and cannot exit this one either.
